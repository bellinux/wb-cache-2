In 1986, a route to Keflavík allowed {{the company to}} break SAS's {{monopoly}} on flights between Greenland and Denmark via a Keflavík-Copenhagen leg operated by Icelandair. By 1989, the airline employed more than 400 Greenlanders and carried more than 100,000 passengers annually.|$|E
5|$|Kenya Airways {{had nine}} Boeing 787 Dreamliners on order as of April 2011, {{although}} the company considered cancelling the order after systematic delays with the delivery dates.

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> {{through this}} portion of Utah was the Old Spanish Trail, a trade route between Santa Fe, New Mexico and Los Angeles, California. The trail was in common use before the Mexican-American War in 1848. Although the trail serves a {{different}} route than I-70, they were both intended to connect southern California with points further east. I-70 generally parallels {{the route of the}} Old Spanish Trail west of Crescent Junction. I-15 south of the junction with I-70 also generally parallels the trail.|$|E
5|$|Two other roads {{have been}} {{numbered}} Utah SR-58 in the past. The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> designated SR-58 {{was formed in}} 1945 between SR-36 and Clover, but was ed in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between I-15 in New Harmony back to I-15 via Kanarraville, but that road was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between the state line and the junction with Frontage Road, which was formerly US40. Wendover Boulevard between US93Alt. and the state line was designated SR224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County.|$|E
5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war they were in a piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness and discomfort, and their encumbrance to motor cars in the city centre. Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their <b>first</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

5|$|Missoula {{began as}} a trading post in the 1860s {{situated}} along the Mullan Military Road {{to take advantage of}} the <b>first</b> <b>route</b> across the Bitterroot Mountains to the plains of Eastern Washington. Its designation as county seat in 1866 and location of the hastily built Fort Missoula in 1877 ensured Missoula's status as a regional commercial center; a status further consolidated in 1883 with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway. The railroad expanded Missoula's trade area to cover a 150-mile radius, and Missoula's location as the railway's division point and repair shops provided hundreds of jobs. When the railway began expanding again in 1898, increased freight shipments came through the city, and with the arrival of the Milwaukee Road and regional office for the U.S. Forest Service as well as the opening of the Flathead Indian Reservation to settlement all within a couple years of each other beginning in 1908, the economy began to rapidly expand.|$|E
5|$|Mondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; {{four are}} transbay routes {{connecting}} San Francisco to Oakland and various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs {{exclusively in the}} East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run on nights and weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's <b>first</b> <b>route</b> opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 and Montgomery Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube. BART's three routes then were Concord–Daly City, Fremont-Daly City and Richmond–Fremont.|$|E
5|$|Route 12 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was {{constructed}} through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California.|$|E
50|$|Qeshm Air {{was founded}} in 1993 and {{established}} its services by leasing airplanes from other airlines. The company's <b>first</b> <b>routes</b> were from Tehran to Qeshm, and from Tehran to Dubai. By they year 2000, Qeshm Air had seven aircraft in its fleet.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} roads used by Europeans {{to cross}} the Sierra Nevada into California were branches of the California Trail. The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> near the present US 50 was the Carson Route, laid out in 1848 by an eastward Mormon party that wanted to avoid the Truckee Route and its deep crossings of the Truckee River. The group left Pleasant Valley, southeast of Placerville, on July 3, following Iron Mountain Ridge up to {{the crest of the}} Sierra at Carson Pass and then descending through Carson Canyon into the Carson Valley. Along the Humboldt River in Nevada, the Mormons met Joseph B. Chiles, who was leading a westward wagon train to California, and told him of their new trail. Although this new Carson Route crossed two summits— Carson Pass over the crest of the Sierra and West Pass over the Carson Spur just to the west, these crossings were easier than Donner Pass on the Truckee Route, and only three fords of the Carson River were required. The route became the primary westward route into California {{at the start of the}} Gold Rush. Through California, the general alignment of the Carson Route, in terms of today's highways, was State Route 88 over Carson Pass and Mormon Emigrant Trail and Sly Park Road to Pleasant Valley.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> {{over the}} Cuyamaca Mountains was {{dedicated}} in 1912, and a plank road {{served as the}} first road across the Imperial Valley to Yuma; east of there, the Gila Trail continued east to Gila Bend. These were later replaced by U.S. Route 80 (US80) across California and part of Arizona, and Arizona State Route 84 (SR84) between Gila Bend and Casa Grande. The US80 freeway through San Diego was largely complete {{by the time it}} was renumbered as I-8 in the 1964 state highway renumbering; east of San Diego, the US80 roadway was slowly replaced by I-8 as construction progressed in the Imperial Valley. The Arizona portion of the road was built starting in the 1960s. Several controversies erupted during the construction process; questionable labor practices in Imperial County led to the federal conviction of mobster Jimmy Fratianno, and a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee found that the Arizona government had mismanaged financial resources.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> {{ran from}} Oslo to Cairo via Copenhagen and Paris on 30 January 1947. Afterwards, {{the company was}} {{chartered}} for several trips from Paris and Marseille, France, to Lydda, Palestine, and Tunis, Tunisia. From Lydda, the aircraft were used to evacuate French and British personnel prior {{to the creation of}} Israel. The company's route to Hong Kong was the longest air route in the world. At the time, the only scheduled service to the Far East was operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation using Sandringham flying boats. This route took a fortnight, while KLM had a land-plane route from Amsterdam to Batavia (Djarkarta). The first Braathens SAFE flight was made on 24 February from Oslo, landing at Amsterdam, Marseille, Cairo, Basra, Karachi, Culcutta and Bangkok before Hong Kong, where Norske Skyfarer landed on 8 March. Total flight time was 46 hours. Along the route, Braathens SAFE established contracts with agents, or stationed their own employees.|$|E

5|$|The first {{vehicle to}} be bought by Tillingbourne was a {{single-deck}} Chevrolet with 14 seats, which entered service on {{the launch of the}} company's <b>first</b> <b>route</b> in 1924. It was joined by a similar Overland Automobile bus later in the year. Two further vehicles had been purchased by 1928, when a depot fire destroyed three of the four buses. They were replaced by second-hand buses including an 18-seat Dennis and several Thornycroft A2 vehicles. From November 1934 until the outbreak of World War II, these were progressively replaced by new buses, also built by Thornycroft. The first double-deck vehicle {{to be bought}} was a Bristol K Type, which joined the fleet in 1959. Eight Guy Vixens were bought from London Transport between 1963 and 1964 to replace the entire previous fleet. These were succeeded by a wide variety of types, with Bedford coaches and buses the most numerous. In the 1970s, a number of second-hand Bristol SUL4A's, with ECW B36F bodies, were operated.|$|E
5|$|The rollout of Amfleets {{throughout}} {{the system was}} restricted by the availability of locomotives with HEP or special generator cars. The <b>first</b> <b>route</b> outside the Northeast Corridor to receive Amfleets was the Washington–Martinsburg Blue Ridge, on December 1. By November 1976, 350 Amfleets had been delivered and 78% of Amtrak's short-haul trains used either Amfleets or equally-modern Turboliner trainsets. Routes using Amfleets outside the Northeast Corridor included the Blue Ridge, Colonial, Twilight Limited, Wolverine, Illinois Zephyr, Abraham Lincoln, State House, Illini, Shawnee, Black Hawk, San Joaquin, Mount Rainier, Pacific International, Puget Sound, and San Diegan. The Amfleet's modern HEP system proved invaluable during the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak's aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the short-distance Amfleet I coaches into long-distance service. Budd completed delivery of the Amfleet I order on June 9, 1977.|$|E
