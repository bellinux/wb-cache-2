500|$|His {{relationship}} with Lana Lang {{was one of}} Smallvilles central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark {{realized that he had}} found someone who understood him, who <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would [...] "... kick him out of her life ..." [...] if she learned his secret— that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents— was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them. Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.|$|E
2500|$|White {{used his}} {{appearance}} {{to increase his}} effectiveness in conducting investigations of lynchings and race riots in the American South. He could [...] "pass" [...] and talk to whites {{as one of them}}, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> blacks as one of them and identified with them. Such work was dangerous: [...] "Through 1927 White would investigate 41 lynchings, 8 race riots, and two cases of widespread peonage, risking his life repeatedly in the backwaters of Florida, the piney woods of Georgia, and in the cotton fields of Arkansas." [...] (Peonage was a new form of unpaid labor.) ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{six months}} of failed {{research}} on the composition of trans-Neptunian objects, Raj feared being deported back to India (at which point, he describes spending his time at work as [...] "mostly checking e-mail, updating his Facebook status, and messing up Wikipedia entries"). To stay in the country, he sought out a research position in stellar evolution with Professor Laughlin; the job proposition failed as the research team included an attractive woman, and Raj, who became drunk so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her, made an inappropriate comment. Raj ended up working alongside Sheldon (or [...] "for" [...] him, as Sheldon insists), [...] "exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations". Ironically, he noted that he once {{wanted to be the}} [...] "Indira Gandhi of particle astrophysics (but with a penis, of course)". During season 6, Raj has developed a talent to be a party planner that was demonstrated at the time of Howard and Bernadette's wedding, ...|$|E
50|$|Marty {{must have}} shared in Katie and Laurie's unique imagination, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> also <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Ship.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> not do {{much more}} than walk down to the post office and back on the pleasantest days. A few people called, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, and they did not call again.|$|R
60|$|When Walter Lodloe {{walked to}} Lethbury because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Cristie, {{it could not}} have been {{reasonably}} supposed that his walk would have had more practical influence on his feelings towards that lady than a conversation with her would have had; but such was the case.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, racer Tim Bender was injured, and Bender's crew chief/car owner Robbie Reiser hired {{his former}} {{competitor}} and rival Kenseth to race for him despite having only one Busch start. Reiser said [...] "Matt and I {{used to have}} some fierce races against each other. I needed someone who understood race cars the way I understood them. I knew he could drive and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me in a manner I could understand." [...] Kenseth qualified third for the new team's first race. He was racing in third place in the final laps when he spun and finished eleventh. Kenseth qualified in 20th place for the next race at Talladega in his second time at a track big {{enough to have a}} significant draft. He passed thirteen cars to finish seventh. Kenseth had two Top 5 finishes during the partial season. The following year he raced full-time all season. He won his first Busch Series race on February 22, 1998, when he nudged leader Tony Stewart's car entering the final turn of the final lap, culmulating in a second- and third-place finishes in the Busch points. Kenseth drove the No. 17 Chevy.|$|E
60|$|Kit was {{grateful}} for her frank sympathy, and felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her about his father.|$|E
60|$|This {{so frightened}} the poor glass-blower {{that he went}} away hurriedly. But he stopped at a drug store and put his last dime in the {{telephone}} box so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Miss Mydas without being bitten by the dog.|$|E
60|$|The young clergyman {{was again}} ruby red {{up to his}} forehead. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> dare <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Adela, but hardly about himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir. I {{never heard}} of either one of 'em," [...] said Harry, hanging down his head. [...] "I fear my book-learning was {{neglected}} at home, sir. My brother had read every book that ever was wrote, I think. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> you about 'em for hours together." ...|$|R
60|$|Guy {{was very}} much shocked, and so deep in thought that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the child in their {{progress}} down the hill; but she was just so tired as to be inclined to silence, and quite happy clinging to his hand, till he delivered her over to her mother {{at the foot of}} the hill, and went to join his tutor, at the place appointed.|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as the}} {{machines}} were parked Chester Waltham, almost ignoring his sister, had devoted his attention to Grace, doing this while Sam was busy talking over some matters with his brothers. Waltham had {{walked over to the}} seats with Grace beside him, and now he saw to it that she was placed where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her with ease. This, of course, did not particularly suit Sam, but he was helpless in the matter and so made the best of it.|$|E
60|$|Near a month went {{by without}} much doing. The same night of our {{marriage}} Galoshes called round, and made himself mighty civil, and got into a habit of dropping in about dark and smoking his pipe with the family. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Uma, of course, and started to teach me native and French at the same time. He was a kind old buffer, though the dirtiest you would wish to see, and he muddled me up with foreign languages worse than the tower of Babel.|$|E
6000|$|The prince, putting spurs {{into his}} horse, rode after her, {{for he was}} {{determined}} not to let her out of his sight. But suddenly a thick mist arose and hid her from him. When he reached his home <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> his mother of nothing else but the beautiful stranger with whom he had danced so often, and with whom he was so much in love. And the bear beneath the table smiled to itself, and muttered: 'I am the beautiful stranger; oh, how I have taken you in!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew," [...] she said, [...] "I knew if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> but <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>he</b> would {{understand}} that you were sincere--and you have proved it. I am glad--I am glad that you saw him." [...] The quality of the sunlight changed, the very hills leaped, and the river sparkled. Could she care? Why did she wish her father {{to know that he}} was sincere.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'll {{excuse me}} for saying something, Major, I don't think I'd take the matter to Captain Dale--at least not just yet," [...] put in Jack. This {{conversation}} {{took place during the}} cadets' off time, and the young captain felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> freely <b>to</b> his superior officer. [...] "If we find that Stowell really tried to injure us, I guess we can take care of him," [...] and he smiled suggestively.|$|R
60|$|In such mood had he {{been that}} morning. He was {{additionally}} disturbed because the Doctor had gone early to Port Lannoch; and as {{he was the only}} person with whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>he</b> clung <b>to</b> him with something of the helpless feeling of a frightened child to its nurse.|$|R
60|$|He {{wished it}} were possible--which, of course, it was not--to {{go back to}} the St. Brasten Cocoa House, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the honest flat-footed galumping waitress, and cross his feet under his chair. For here he was daintily, yes, daintily, studied by the tea-room habitues--two {{bouncing}} and talkative daughters of an American tourist, a slender pale-haired English girl student of Assyriology with large top-barred eye-glasses over her protesting eyes, and a sprinkling of people living along Tavistock Place, who looked as though they wanted to know if your opinions on the National Gallery and abstinence were sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{were the}} people to whom he owed allegiance, and an {{overwhelming}} loneliness seemed to fall from the leaden sky of that winter without sunshine. All the faces were sad. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> no one, and had no hope of ever understanding anybody. It was as if these had been the faces {{of people from the}} other world--dead people--he used to tell me years afterwards. Upon my word, I wonder he did not go mad. He didn't know where he was. Somewhere very far from his mountains--somewhere over the water. Was this America, he wondered? ...|$|E
6000|$|Tito hurried along again: the Church of the Badia {{was not far}} off. They {{could enter}} it by the cloister that opened at the back, and in the church <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Tessa--perhaps leave her. No! it was an hour at which the church was not open; but they paused under {{the shelter of the}} cloister, and he said, [...] "Have you no cousin or friend in Florence, my little Tessa, whose house you could find; or are you afraid of walking by {{yourself}} since you have been frightened by the conjuror? I am {{in a hurry to get}} to Oltrarno, but if I could take you anywhere near--" ...|$|E
60|$|Now and again, as {{he walked}} along the little river bank that ran with so many {{turnings}} from Hurst Staple down to West Putford, he would think of his past hopes, and lament that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> of them <b>to</b> no one. His father was very good to him; {{but he was too}} cold for sympathy. His mother was all affection, and kindly suggested that, perhaps, what had happened was for the best: she kindly suggested this more than once, but her imagination carried her no further. Had she not four daughters, hitherto without husbands, and also, alas! without portions? Was it not enough for her to sympathize with them? As for his sisters--his sisters were well enough--excellent girls; but they were so gay, so light-hearted, so full of fun and laughter, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them of his sorrows. They were never pensive, nor given to that sober sadness which is prone to sympathy. If, indeed, Adela Gauntlet had been his sister--! And so he walked along the river to West Putford.|$|R
50|$|Whenever {{the player}} saw the rabbit, <b>he</b> or she <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> it. The rabbit would {{ask them if}} they wanted to go to a {{practice}} course, and they could either accept or decline. If they declined, the rabbit would fly away and the player {{would not be able to}} visit that bonus course anytime again in the game.|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} Hamas's {{release of}} Shalit, {{he was interviewed}} on the Egyptian state-owned television channel Nile TV by anchorwoman Shahira Amin. Generating a storm of criticism in Israel, the interview was considered insensitive and exploitative. An Israeli official stated, [...] "We are all shocked that a so-called interview was forced on (Shalit) before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> his family or set foot on Israeli soil." [...] Egyptian officials, however, claimed that the interview went according to agreements between Israel, Egypt and Hamas, and that Israel knew about it in advance.|$|R
6000|$|The day came, {{the party}} were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley seemed early to devote {{himself to the}} {{business}} of being agreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said, ...|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes he {{was tempted}} to screw the head off the stalk. He {{imagined}} himself doing it--with one hand, a twisting movement. Not seriously, of course. Just a simple indulgence for his exasperated feelings. He wasn't capable of murder. He was certain of that. And, remembering suddenly the plain speeches of Mr. Jones, he would think: [...] "I suppose I am too tame for that"--quite unaware that he had murdered the poor woman morally years ago. He was too unintelligent to have the notion of such a crime. Her bodily presence was bitterly offensive, because of its contrast with a very different feminine image. And {{it was no use}} getting rid of her. She was a habit of years, and there would be nothing to put in her place. At any rate, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> that idiot half the night if he chose.|$|E
60|$|Captain Asher did {{not write}} his note at all. He {{did not know what}} to say; he did not want to make too much of the incident, for it was really a trifling matter, only worthy of being {{mentioned}} in case he had something more important to write about. But he had nothing more important; there was no reason why he should write to Olive during her short stay with Mrs. Easterfield. Besides, she would soon be back, and then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her; that would be much better. Now, two strong desires began to possess him; one was for Olive to come home; and the other for Dick Lancaster to go away. There had been moments when he had had a shadowy notion of bringing the two together, but this idea had vanished. His mind was now occupied very much with thoughts of his beautiful niece and very little with the young man in the colored shirt and turned-up trousers who was staying with him.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, by the professor's {{method of}} teaching--assisted by a natural aptitude, and three hours' daily conversation, for five months--Bob had made {{surprising}} progress, especially {{as he had}} supplemented his lesson by continually talking Spanish with Manola, with the Spanish woman and children living below them, and with everyone <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Eleanor {{explained}} how Mr. Slope had at first endeavoured to tyrannize over her father, but {{how he had}} latterly come round and done all <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> the bishop over in Mr. Harding's favour. [...] "But my father," [...] she said, [...] "is hardly inclined to trust him; they all say he is so arrogant to the old clergymen of the city." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{a strange}} account, and very {{affecting}} to us both, but particularly the young clergyman; he was indeed wonderfully surprised with it; but under the greatest affliction imaginable that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her; that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not speak English to make her understand him; and as she spoke but very broken English <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not understand her. However, he turned himself to me, and told me, that he believed there must be {{more to do with}} this woman than to marry her. I did not understand him at first, but at length he explained himself, viz. that she ought to be baptized.|$|R
60|$|I have no {{idea why}} the mate was known by that {{eccentric}} name. He was called Wheeler, but though he had that English surname there was not a drop of white blood in him. He was a tall man, and well-made though inclined to stoutness, but much darker than is usual in Hawaii. He was no longer young, and his crisply curling, thick hair was grey. His upper front teeth were cased in gold. He was very proud of them. He had a marked squint and this gave him a saturnine expression. The captain, who was fond of a joke, found in it a constant source of humour and hesitated the less to rally him on the defect because he realised that the mate was sensitive about it. Bananas, unlike most of the natives, was a taciturn fellow and Captain Butler would have disliked him if it had been possible for a man of his good nature to dislike anyone. He liked to be at sea with someone <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> he was a chatty, sociable creature, and it was enough to drive a missionary to drink to live there day after day with a chap who never opened his mouth. He did his best to wake the mate up, that is to say, he chaffed him without mercy, but it was poor fun to laugh by oneself, and he came to the conclusion that, drunk or sober, Bananas was no fit companion for a white man. But he was a good seaman and the captain was shrewd enough to know the value of a mate he could trust. It was not rare for him to come aboard, when they were sailing, fit for nothing but to fall into his bunk, and it was worth something to know that he could stay there till he had slept his liquor off, since Bananas could be relied on. But he was an unsociable devil, {{and it would be a}} treat to have someone <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> That girl would be fine. Besides, he wouldn't be so likely to get drunk when he went ashore if he knew there was a little girl waiting for him when he came on board again.|$|E
6000|$|He {{found that}} the task would be difficult, and as he went he {{considered}} within his mind how best it might be accomplished. He had put a prayer-book in his pocket, without giving it much thought; but before he knocked at the door he had assured himself that the prayer-book would not be of avail. He would {{not know how to}} begin to use it, and felt that it would be ridiculed. He must leave that to Dolly or to the clergyman. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the girls; but they would not care about the affairs of the firm; and, in truth, {{he did not know what}} they would care about. With Dolly he could hold sweet converse as long as she would remain with him. But he had been present at the bringing up of Dolly, and did think that gifts had been given to Dolly which had not fallen to the lot of the Carroll girls. [...] "They all want to be married," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and that at any rate is a legitimate desire." ...|$|E
6000|$|He found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her of {{his work}} and aims upon the Fuel Commission and of the {{conflict}} and failure of motives he found in himself, as freely {{as he had done}} to Dr. Martineau and with a surer confidence of understanding. Perhaps his talks with the doctor had got his ideas into order and made them more readily expressible than they would have been otherwise. He argued against the belief that any class could be good as a class or bad as a class, and he instanced the conflict of motives he found in all the members of his Committee and most so in himself. He repeated the persuasion he had already confessed to Dr. Martineau that {{there was not a single}} member of the Fuel Commission but had a considerable drive towards doing the right thing about fuel, and not one who had a single-minded, unencumbered drive towards the right thing. [...] "That," [...] said Sir Richmond, [...] "is what makes life so interesting and, in spite of a thousand tragic disappointments, so hopeful. Every man is a bad man, every man is a feeble man and every man is a good man. My motives come and go. Yours do the same. We vary in response to the circumstances about us. Given a proper atmosphere, most men will be public-spirited, right-living, generous. Given perplexities and darkness, most of us can be cowardly and vile. People say you cannot change human nature and perhaps that is true, but you can change its responses endlessly. The other day I was in Bohemia, discussing Silesian coal with Benes, and I went to see the Festival of the Bohemian Sokols. Opposite to where I sat, far away across the arena, was a great bank of men of the Sokol organizations, an unbroken brown mass wrapped in their brown uniform cloaks. Suddenly the sun came out and at a word the whole body flung back their cloaks, showed their Garibaldi shirts and became one solid blaze of red. It was an amazing transformation until one understood what had happened. Yet nothing material had changed but the sunshine. And given a change in laws and prevailing ideas, and the very same people who are greedy traders, grasping owners and revolting workers to-day will all throw their cloaks aside and you will find them working together cheerfully, even generously, for a common end. They aren't traders and owners and workers and so forth by any inner necessity. Those are just the ugly parts they play in the present drama. Which is nearly at the end of its run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely! I {{meant as}} a lover. One {{does n't want a}} lover one pities, and one does n't want--of all things in the world--a picturesque husband! I should like Mr. Hudson as {{something}} else. I wish he were my brother, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me of marriage. Then I could adore him. I would nurse him, I would wait on him and save him all disagreeable rubs and shocks. I am much stronger than he, and I would stand between him and the world. Indeed, with Mr. Hudson for my brother, I should be willing to live and die an old maid!" ...|$|R
60|$|She did {{not find}} it easy, nor, though he made the effort, did Hawtrey. There was a {{restraint}} upon him, for {{when he first saw}} her he had been struck by the change in the girl. She was graver than he remembered her, and, it seemed, very much more reserved. He had tried and failed, as he thought of it, to strike any response in her. He became uneasily conscious that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to Sally Creighton. There was something wanting in him or her, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not at the moment tell what it was. Still, he assured himself, things would be different next day, for the girl was evidently very tired.|$|R
50|$|McGehee was set {{to return}} for another {{tour of duty in}} Thailand. At {{headquarters}} he attended several briefings, yet he was growing increasingly dissatisfied with the CIA as an institution. While back in Washington, he looked for another job; yet his lack of any work history (due to his inability to list his CIA employment) sank his efforts. In addition, his transforming state of mind made it difficult for him to effectively communicate, with anyone. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> his children about his changing attitudes toward the CIA and the cold war. On campus at Georgetown he noticed young dissenters. He wanted the war to stop, too, but felt paralyzed by internal conflicts.|$|R
