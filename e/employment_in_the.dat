Many of the new residents were immigrants who sought <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factories and mills and introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city. Ethnic neighborhoods emerged on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, the {{technology}} of cotton-spinning machinery improved, and the need for larger buildings to house bigger, better and more efficient equipment became apparent. The profitability of cotton spinning meant that open land that had been used for farming since antiquity, was utilised for purpose-built weavers' cottages. Larger buildings were still desired, and construction of two water powered cotton factories (two or three times the size of a cottage) can be traced to 1782. The construction of more mills followed—ten by 1789—facilitating a process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation in the region; the population moved away from farming, adopting <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factory system. The introduction of the factory system led to an increase of the township's population; from 872 in 1714 to 3,500 in 1801, mostly as a result of an influx of people from Yorkshire and Lancashire looking for <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cotton mills.|$|E

5|$|Like most of South Korea's smaller cities, Gyeongju {{has seen}} a steady drop in {{population}} in recent years. From 2002 to 2008, the city lost 16,557 people.

In 2007, about 1,975 more people {{moved away from the}} city each year than moved in.

30|$|Aiming to {{identify}} the role of agricultural and non-agricultural <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> improving <b>the</b> well-being of the Palestinian rural population through their impact on wages, this paper investigates the determinants of wages for rural and non-rural areas. The development literature postulates that the development process {{is likely to be}} associated with rural urban migration as a result of improvement in worker productivity <b>in</b> agriculture. At <b>the</b> same time, agglomeration effects will tend to make urban-rural wage gap diminish due to the increased labor supply from rural areas. Our study hypothesizes that proximity to the Israeli labor market tends to raise rural wages due to the higher share of <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> Israel for <b>the</b> rural areas. However, <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> Israel and <b>the</b> settlements may be a cause for concern with respect to rural-urban wage differential and the impact on unemployment resulting from closures. Given the lower average years of schooling for rural workers and <b>the</b> lower wage <b>in</b> agriculture rural wages may decline if <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> Israel continues to diminish in importance for rural workers. <b>The</b> political stalemate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peace process (and Israeli policy) will deter many Palestinians from seeking <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> Israel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long run.|$|R

However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long-run, the sign of the relationship changes. Therefore, I conclude that Cambodian factories should improve labor law compliance as it will lead to <b>employment</b> growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long-run...|$|R
5|$|The recent strong {{economic}} growth and lower unemployment in the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: unemployment in the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%.

5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' <b>employment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> T-formation.|$|E
