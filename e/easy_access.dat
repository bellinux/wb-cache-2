5|$|A {{road was}} built {{the same year}} on the plateau to provide <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, Bryce Canyon Lodge was built from local timber and stone.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s onwards {{projects}} aiming to improve Somerton for film industry purposes have been undertaken. The market square was heavily revamped, creating a central parking area with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> {{to the local}} amenities. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.|$|E

5|$|The Peak District National Park {{became the}} first {{national}} park in the United Kingdom in 1951. With its proximity to the cities of Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and Sheffield, and <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> by road and rail, it attracts millions of visitors every year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Edward was {{a regular}} habitué of Parisian brothels, most notably Le Chabanais, which was {{regarded}} as the top establishment in Paris where brothels were legal. One room contained a custom made bath which was sometimes filled with champagne; and a specially designed and crafted siège d'amour (love seat) that allowed <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> for oral {{and other forms of}} sex for two or three people. It is now a museum piece.|$|E
5|$|It bred on rocky, {{isolated}} islands with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to {{the ocean}} and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. When not breeding, they spent their time foraging {{in the waters of}} the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and Diesel Multiple Unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{with the}} full Spider set were staged in Rotterdam's Ahoy Stadium {{starting}} on 18 May before moving to De Kuip stadium for the dress rehearsals (27 and 28 May). Due to relatively <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to the venues during rehearsals, fans knew what the set list for the show would be before the tour even opened.|$|E
5|$|Storlien, {{just on the}} Swedish side of the {{national}} border, grew up as a resort, with the first hotel established just after the railway arrived. Trade {{between the two countries}} increased, as Jämtland had <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to the Trøndelag market. However, the freight rates were so high that it was cheaper to send some products to Trøndelag from the Swedish east coast by ship around Scania.|$|E

The motorway system provides for <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to Novi Sad and Budapest, in the north; Niš to the south; and Zagreb, to the west. Expressway is also toward Pancevo and new Expressway construction toward Obrenovac (Montenegro) is set scheduled for March 2017. Belgrade bypass is connecting the E70 and E75 motorways {{and it is}} currently under construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} phreatomagmatic eruptions {{caused by}} the <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> of water to the erupting vents threw rocks up to a kilometre (0.6mi) away from the island, and sent ash clouds as high as 10km (6mi) up into the atmosphere. The loose pile of unconsolidated tephra would quickly have been washed away had the supply of fresh magma dwindled, and large clouds of dust were often seen blowing away from the island during {{this stage of the}} eruption.|$|E
5|$|The main {{commercial}} and leisure {{areas of the}} town are located around the north coast, where there is <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to the pleasure beach. The industrial areas are in the west, beside the wetlands and the River Medway. The Bluetown industrial area and the Port of Sheerness are in the north-western part of the town. The residential districts of Mile Town and Marine Town are in the central and the eastern areas respectively.|$|E

Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.|$|E
5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to the goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E

At , the summit station also provides relatively <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> for climbers to the northeastern peaks of the range, including short introductory rock scrambles and a simple ice-face route on the NW face of the Petite Aiguille Verte.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long {{been one of the}} chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E

On buses, proof-of-payment saves drivers the time needed to collect fares, and makes it possible for all doors to be used for boarding. Validated tickets can double as transfers between lines.|$|R
