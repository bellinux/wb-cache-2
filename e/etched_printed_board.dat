40|$|A {{capacitive}} humidity-sensing {{device was}} created by thermal evaporation of 99. 999 % aluminum. The substrate used for the coating was <b>etched</b> double-sided <b>printed</b> circuit <b>board.</b> The <b>etched</b> <b>printed</b> circuit <b>board</b> serves as the dielectric of the capacitor while the aluminum thin films deposited on either side serve as the plates of the capacitor. The capacitance was measured before and after exposure to humidity. The device was then calibrated by comparing the readings of capacitance {{with that of the}} relative humidity sensor of the Vernier LabQuest 2. It was found that there is a linear relationship between the capacitance and relative humidity given by the equation C= 1. 418 RH+ 29. 139 where C is the capacitance and RH is the relative humidity. The surface of the aluminum films is porous and it is through these pores that water is adsorbed and capillary condensation occurs, thereby causing the capacitance to change upon exposure to humidity...|$|R
50|$|Direct bonded copper (DBC) {{substrates}} {{are commonly}} used in power modules, because of their very good thermal conductivity. They are composed of a ceramic tile (commonly alumina) with a sheet of copper bonded to one or both sides by a high-temperature oxidation process (the copper and substrate are heated to a carefully controlled temperature {{in an atmosphere of}} nitrogen containing about 30 ppm of oxygen; under these conditions, a copper-oxygen eutectic forms which bonds successfully both to copper and the oxides used as substrates). The top copper layer can be preformed prior to firing or chemically <b>etched</b> using <b>printed</b> circuit <b>board</b> technology to form an electrical circuit, while the bottom copper layer is usually kept plain. The substrate is attached to a heat spreader by soldering the bottom copper layer to it.|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo: projetar, construir e testar os imas principais do acelerador race-track {{microtron}} booster do ifusp, que tem como funcao defletir e focalizar o feixe de eletrons, permitindo a sua recirculacao. Esses imas desempenham papel fundamental quanto a qualidade do feixe obtido que, por sua vez, constitui um fator primordial para experiencias em fisica nuclear. O trabalho desenvolve a teoria do funcionamento do acelerador e os calculos analiticos que fundamentam a geometria dos imas. A ausencia da uniformidade do campo magnetico e a presenca de campos de borda inadequados comprometem o sincronismo. Utilizou-se bobinas corretoras confeccionadas na forma de circuitos impressos, que limitaram a falta de uniformidade a valores relativos de campo magnetico da ordem de 1 ́ 0 POT. - 5. ́ Os imas possuem pecas polares auxiliares (clamps) que criam campos de borda reversos ao campo principal. Os clamps foram projetados por meio de simulacoes realizadas com os programas poisson e ptrace, de forma a se obter uma distribuicao para o campo magnetico que propicie aceleracao para uma distancia conveniente entre os imasThe present {{work had}} {{the purpose of}} designing, building and testing the bending magnets of the IFUSP race-track microtron booster that deflect and focus the electron beam and allow its recirculation.

This work develops the theory conceming the functioning of the accelerator and the analytical calculations that establish the geometry ofthe magnets. The lack of magnetic field uniformity and the presence of inadequate fringing fields damage the synchronism.
