40|$|Objective: There is an {{established}} literature on cannabis expectancies {{and how these}} relate to patterns of cannabis use and clinical outcomes. However increasingly we are becoming <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how cannabis <b>expectancies</b> shape the subjective experiences people have during drug use, and vice versa. Here we present data reporting how cannabis expectancies relate to subjective experiences after cannabis. Additionally we will determine whether an index of psychosis proneness (schizotypy) is related to cannabis expectancies. Method: A sample of recreational cannabis users (n= 137) completed the brief Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire, the Cannabis Experiences Questionnaire and the Marijuana Effects Expectancy Questionnaire. Results: Cannabis expectancies correlated with the subjective experiences reported in the immediate high from cannabis. However, only Cognitive and Behavioural Impairment expectancies were correlated with after effects from cannabis. There were no significant correlations between schizotypy and cannabis expectancies. Conclusion: Cannabis expectancies {{are related to the}} immediate experiences subjectively felt after smoking cannabis. Further research is necessary to determine which clinically significant personality traits shape cannabis expectancies...|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of utility in tasks {{has been shown}} to facilitate performance and interest. This study (N = 160) is an extension of work by Hulleman and colleagues and is a 2 (success expectancy: high, low) x 2 (utility level: No Utility, Utility) x 2 (goal level: no goal, difficult goal), between-subjects design. Previous findings have shown that individuals with low success expectancies benefit from a utility manipulation, but high success expectancy individuals do not. The current study aimed to facilitate performance and <b>interest,</b> particularly <b>in</b> high <b>expectancy</b> participants. Participants learned a new math technique. After the practice session, participants were prompted to think about the task's utility or not, and were assigned a goal for the final problem sets or not. The researchers hypothesized {{that there would be a}} 3 -way interaction on performance and interest. Neither hypothesis was supported. However, participants with high versus low success-expectancy performed better, and those in the utility condition found the task more interesting.

The symposium combined two topics of recent <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> studies of alcohol expectancies: cognitive mechanisms <b>in</b> <b>expectancy</b> challenge studies, and context-related changes of expectancies. With increasing recognition of the substantial role played by alcohol <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> drinking, investigators have begun to develop and evaluate expectancy challenge procedures as a potentially promising new prevention strategy. The two major issues addressed in the symposium were whether <b>expectancy</b> challenges result <b>in</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> that mediate intervention (outcome relations), {{and the influence of}} simulated bar environments ("bar labs," in which challenges are usually done) on expectancies. The presentations were (1) An introduction, by Jack Darkes; (2) Investigating the utility of alcohol expectancy challenge with heavy drinking college students, by Mark D.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} postulate of Kelly 2 ̆ 7 s Psychology of Personal Constructs (1955) {{emphasizes the}} anticipatory {{nature of human}} behavior. Kelly 2 ̆ 7 s constructivist position presaged current <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> future <b>expectancy</b> and intentionality among cognitive psychologists. Contemporary theorists such as Nuttin (1985) recognize that anticipated and hoped-for future events are psychologically present on the representational level and may influence present behavior. However, little is known of specific relationships between future hopes and present adjustment. In this study, four hypotheses relating characteristics of future hopes to adjustment of the unemployed were examined. ^ Personal hopes were elicited by means of six TAT-like cards, each designed to tap a particular category of future hopes identified {{in a review of}} utopian literature. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 core hope constructs were then transferred to a Rep test for structural analysis. Four measures of aspects of future hopes were correlated with adjustment as measured by the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale and the Ellsworth Profile of Adaptation to Life. ^ As hypothesized, good adjustment was found to correlate positively with hopes characterized by high sociality. The measurement of sociality was accomplished by a content scale developed for this study. Inclusion of a sociality measure was based on the recognition that hope is not simply an individual quality, but is developed and sustained in the context of relationships. ^ Permeability is a Kellian concept referring to the capacity of a construct to remain open to change while retaining identity. The permeability of hopes was assessed by a content scale developed for this study. Confirmation of the permeability hypothesis suggests that the person who actively admits revised elements to his future hopes will function better in the present than the person whose hopes are closed to change. ^ Greater meaningfulness of vocational hopes correlated negatively with adjustment to unemployment, the correlation reaching significance only after refining the scoring procedure. No support was found for a fourth hypothesis. ^ Implications for psychotherapy with the unemployed were discussed. Recommendations were made for future studies of the psychology of hope. ...|$|R

40|$|The present article analyzed, how {{need for}} {{cognition}} (NFC) influences {{the formation of}} performance expectancies. When processing information, individuals with lower NFC often rely on salient information and shortcuts compared to individuals higher in NFC. We assume that these preferences of processing will also make individuals low in NFC more responsive to salient achievement-related cues because the processing of salient cues is cognitively less demanding than the processing of non-salient cues. Therefore, individuals lower in NFC should tend to draw wider ranging inferences from salient achievement-related information. In a sample of N = 197 secondary school students, achievement-related feedback (grade on an English examination) affected changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> non-corresponding academic subjects (e. g., expectation of final grade in mathematics or history) when NFC was lower, whereas for students with higher NFC, changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> non-corresponding academic subjects were not affected...|$|R

The contribution of cancers to the gender gap reduced over time, mostly influenced by the narrowing effect of liver cancer on gender gap.

In both countries a decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed most to the increase <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> males as well as females.

40|$|Objectives: This paper {{describes}} {{and discusses}} trends <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> wellbeing between 1989 and 1998. Methods: Data on wellbeing by the Bradburn Affect Balance Scale is {{obtained from the}} Netherlands Continuous Health Interview Surveys for the calendar years from 1989 to 1998. Using Sullivan's method, life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> wellbeing is calculated. Results: For males {{at the age of}} 16, life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> wellbeing increases significantly from 52. 7 years in 1989 (90. 1 % of the total life expectancy) to 54. 4 years in 1998 (90. 8 %). This increase is almost completely caused by the increase <b>in</b> total life <b>expectancy.</b> For females at the age of 16, life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> wellbeing raises significant from 54. 4 years in 1989 (84. 1 %) to 56. 2 years in 1998 (86. 3 %).
