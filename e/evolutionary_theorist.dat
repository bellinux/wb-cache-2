This essay investigates the conceptual framework {{that is used by}} <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theorists</b> when they develop explanations. This framework is advanced as an extension of ideas of William James on intrapsychic conflicts. It is argued that this framework is best characterized as crypto-Cartesian. The problems associated with this conceptual framework are analysed and it is suggested that the alternative, Aristotelian framework extended with Darwin's theory is a better starting point for studying possible conflicts in the mind. The advantages of the Aristotelian framework are discussed with regard to both human and animal behaviour...|$|R

40|$|An {{ecological}} evolutionary viewpoint offers {{new perspectives}} on contemporary demographic problems {{in general and}} on population-environment issues in particular. In turn, rich and detailed human demographic data can help solve problems of interest in evolutionary theory. Such data have been analyzed in greatest detail in studies of traditional and historical societies. Evolutionary approaches using historical data go beyond small-sample anthropological studies to {{the application of the}} evolutionary approach to large datasets, and illuminate important similarities between small-scale traditional societies and large modern populations living in evolutionarily novel environments. This article provides a concise update of the breadth of questions and hypotheses of likely interest to demographers and others that <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theorists</b> address using a variety of traditional and historical datasets. It suggests opportunities for additional collaborative work between <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theorists</b> and historical demographers and highlights topics relevant to modern demography.

40|$|Younger women, {{relative}} to older women, incur elevated risk of uxoricide. Some <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theorists</b> attribute this pattern to men's evolved sexual proprietariness. Other <b>evolutionary</b> <b>theorists</b> propose an evolved homicide module for wife killing. An alternative to both explanations is that young women experience elevated uxoricide risk as {{a byproduct of}} marriage to younger men, who commit most acts of violence. We used 13, 670 uxoricides to test these explanations. Findings show that (1) reproductive age women incur elevated risk of uxoricide; (2) younger men are over-represented among uxoricide perpetrators; and (3) younger women, even when married to older men, still incur excess risk of uxoricide. Discussion examines competing explanations for uxoricide {{in light of these}} findings. WIFE-KILLING AND WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE STATUS According to the reports of battered wives, battering husbands, and friends and family of both parties, physical violence is a punishment inflicted by husbands on wives they suspect of sexual infidelity (Daly & Wilson, 1988; Dobash & Dobash, 1979). Male sexual jealousy or "male sexual proprietariness" is {{the most common cause of}} wife battery, cross-culturally (Daly & Wilson, 1988).
