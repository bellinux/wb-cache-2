5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (<b>depreciation)</b> is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line <b>depreciation,</b> distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The <b>depreciation</b> period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity <b>depreciation</b> method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E
5|$|From 1978, {{the rate}} of {{exchange}} <b>depreciation</b> was fixed with a tablita, an active crawling peg {{that was based on}} a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of <b>depreciation.</b> The announcements were repeated on a rolling basis to create an environment in which economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation.

Second, instant pass-through into import prices {{is greater than}} into export prices when <b>depreciations</b> are caused by domestic monetary expansions. Thirdly, average pass-through is asymmetric in times of persistent <b>depreciations</b> and <b>depreciations.</b> It is higher under <b>depreciations</b> when the destination market is more competitive.

5|$|In {{the initial}} years of operation, THSRC {{accumulated}} debt {{due to high}} <b>depreciation</b> charges and interest, {{largely due to the}} financial structure set up for the private company. In 2009, THSRC negotiated with the government to change the method of <b>depreciation</b> from depending on concessions on rights to ridership. At the same time, the government also started to help refinance THSRC's loans to assist the company so it could remain operational and profitable. In 2015, the government injected NT$30 billion as a financial bailed out, boosting the government's stake to about 64% from about 37%. The government also extended the rail concession from 35 years to 70 years and terminated the company’s build-operate-transfer business model.|$|E

We also provide evidence that the Asian crisis is different from the previous European and Latin American ones: in Asia firms become more fragile after the crisis and their profitability declines and leverage increases further, whereas in Europe and Latin America there are clear signs of recovery after a crisis has occurred, especially for firms that are ex-ante expected to benefit from <b>depreciations.</b> currency crises; currency depreciation; corporate leverage; capital structure; profitability; financial fragility; exchange rates...|$|R

Market volatility tends to be ceteris paribus, more sensitive to bad news about equity than good news and more responsive to currency <b>depreciations</b> than appreciations.

5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or <b>depreciation</b> of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from <b>depreciation</b> of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E

These findings may help to understand the empirical results where pass-through effects have failed to appear significant when accounting for low exchange rate and high interest rate variability.

40|$|This article empirically {{analyses}} real {{per capita}} GDP growth for six Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Mexico, Venezuela) {{in terms of}} real exchange rate <b>depreciations,</b> inflation and US interest rates, focussing {{on the role of}} the real exchange rate. We find evidence of nonlinearity in this relationship, which we capture through a smooth transition regression model. With the exception of Mexico, nonlinearity in economic growth is associated with changes in the real exchange rate, with <b>depreciations</b> leading to different relationships compared with appreciations. Regimes for Mexico are associated with the past growth rates, with effectively symmetric effects of real exchange rate changes. Although our results are in accord with other recent literature in that <b>depreciations</b> may have negative effects for growth, the asymmetries we uncover indicate that these effects depend on the conditioning state. ...|$|R
30|$|Studying {{the sources}} of the RER’s growth asymmetries remains an {{interesting}} area of research. One line could follow the growth diagnostics literature (Hausmann et al. 2005 b) and test the hypothesis that while <b>depreciations</b> turn the RER into a potential constraint on growth, appreciations in contrast turn it into an actual one. A second line could follow the literature on non-linear exchange-rate pass-through: appreciations may have stronger effects than those of <b>depreciations</b> to the extent that profit margins adjust more easily downwards than upwards. Both lines of research seem promising in the Mexican case.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong <b>depreciation.</b> The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E

For economies exhibiting expansionary or strongly contractionary <b>depreciations,</b> such frictions lead to two optimal deviations from full information outcomes: i) under asymmetric information with signal extraction, the realisation of a relatively less frequent shock leads the central bank to behave as if a more likely disturbance had instead taken place; and ii) under asymmetric information without signal extraction, the monetary authority does not react on impact to shocks. Finally, in the case of mildly contractionary <b>depreciations,</b> both asymmetric information models predict a lack of response of the central bank to aggregate demand shocks, as opposed to an offsetting movement in interest rates under full information.

The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening.
