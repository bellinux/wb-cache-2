Luneburg [4] and I [2] have proved results which state that a design admitting many <b>dations</b> and having additional properties {{must be the}} design of points and hyperplanes of a finite desarguesian projective space. In this note, additional results of this type will be proved and applied to yield a generalization of a previous result on Jordan groups [3]. The proofs were suggested by a result of Hering on <b>dations</b> of finite projective planes [1, pp. 122, 190]. Much of our notation {{can be found in}} [1]. Designs will always satisfy v è k + 2, and the blocks will be distinguishable as sets of points. Isomorphic designs will be identified. The complement of the block X is fâX. If Y is an automorphism group of a design, and xfl, then Y(X) and T(x) are the largest subgroups of T fixing X pointwise and x blockwise, respectively. If TL(X) ^ T(X), then H(x, X) = T(x) H TL(X).

40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{bulk electrical conductivity}} and microbial population distribution in sediments at a site contaminated with light nonaqueous-phase liquid (LNAPL). The bulk conductivity was measured using in-situ vertical resistivity probes; the most probable num ber method was used to characterize the spatial distri bution of aerobic heterotrophic and oil-degrading mi crobial populations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if high conductivity observed at aged LNAPL-impacted sites may be related to microbial degradation of LNAPL. The results show higher bulk conductiv ity coincident with LNAPL-impacted zones, in contrast to geoelectrical models that predict lower conductivity in such zones. The highest bulk conductivity was ob served to be associated with zones impacted by resid ual and free LNAPL. Data from bacteria enumeration from sediments close to the resistivity probes show that oil-degrading microbes make up a larger percentage (5 – 55 %) of the heterotrophic microbial community at depths coincident with the higher conductivity compared to � 5 % at the uncontaminated location. The coincidence of a higher percentage of oil-degrading microbial popu lations in zones of higher bulk conductivity suggests that the higher conductivity in these zones may result from increased fluid conductivity related to microbial degra <b>dation</b> of LNAPL, consistent with geochemical studies that suggest that intrinsic biodegradation is occurring at the site.

40|$|Background: The ﬁx-cache {{approach}} to regression test selection was proposed {{to identify the}} most fault-prone ﬁles and corresponding test cases through analysis of ﬁxed defect reports. Aim: The study aims at evaluating the efﬁciency of this approach, compared to the previous regression test selection strategy in a major corporation, developing embedded systems. Method: We launched a post-hoc case study applying the ﬁx-cache selection method during six iterations of development of a multi- million LOC product. The test case execution was monitored through the test management and defect reporting systems of the company. Results: From the observations, we conclude that the ﬁx-cache method is more efﬁcient in four iterations. The difference is statistically signiﬁcant at α = 0. 05.

In the present study the gender typical impact of maternal prepregnancy overweight and obesity as well as ges- tational weight gain on newborn somatometrics was tested on basis of births records of 7565 births, {{which took place in}} Vienna Austria.

With increasing maternal prepregnancy weight status and increasing gestational weight gain birth weight, birth length and head circumference increased too. Among male new- borns however the increase was lower than among female ones. With increasing maternal weight status the prevalence of macrosome newborns increased significantly. Among girls however this increase was significantly higher. Male foetuses seem to react more sensitive to a higher maternal weight status in comparison to girls.
