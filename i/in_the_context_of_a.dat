This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limited voir dire.|$|E

Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction.

5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film.

An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics.

5|$|The Thousand-Year Door {{is set in}} {{the town}} of Rogueport, in the Mushroom Kingdom. The {{majority}} of locations are not featured in previous Mario games. Most locations consist of a set theme; Glitzville, for example, is a floating city centered around a fighting arena known as the Glitz Pit. The enemies and town inhabitants in the game range from recurring Mario characters, like Boo, to characters exclusive to the game, such as the X-Nauts.

In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E

The story is presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel, with each adventure involving the rescue of a Star Spirit denoted as a single chapter. Peach is playable between chapters, where she allies with a star kid named Twink in the castle to relay vital information to Mario regarding his quest.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit.

Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber {{was more interested in}} explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E

The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related}} to the shape of the curve (see below).

But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, the economy is already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E
