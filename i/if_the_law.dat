5|$|At {{present in}} the United States there are three {{different}} levels of scrutiny. Firstly, if a law categorizes {{on the basis of}} race or national origin (which are regarded as suspect classifications), or infringes a fundamental right, strict scrutiny is applied. Accordingly, the law is unconstitutional unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. In addition, there should not be a less restrictive alternative available to achieve that compelling interest. Secondly, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> categorizes on the basis of gender, legitimacy or similar quasi-suspect classifications, intermediate scrutiny is applied – the law is unconstitutional unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Finally, the traditional rational basis review is applied <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> categorizes on some other, non-suspect, basis. In this case, the law is constitutional so long as it is reasonably related to a legitimate government interest.|$|E

5|$|Vice-President Millard Fillmore {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on {{the constitutionality of the}} fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in the Compromise of 1850. Specifically, he asked <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.|$|E

25|$|In 471 BC Titus Quinctius {{was elected}} consul with Appius Claudius Sabinus as his colleague.

Appius was expected to lead the fight against the bill proposed by the tribune of the plebs, Volero Publilius, who wanted to introduce the election of the tribunes of the plebs by the Tribal Assembly, tribe by tribe, thus excluding the vote of the patricians and their clients. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was ratified, the tribunes would gain greater political independence from the patricians and thus prevent them from influencing their selection and their actions.|$|E
25|$|Challenges {{based on}} equal {{protection}} arguments are similarly difficult to sustain. Here courts {{are looking at}} {{whether there is a}} rational purpose for treating pit bull breeds differently from other dog breeds. Dog owners have attacked the rational purpose requirement by arguing either that BSL is over-inclusive, because it bans all dogs of a breed when only certain individuals within the breed have proven to be vicious, or under-inclusive, because many types of dogs have injured people and the BSL fails to include those other breeds. However, again under minimum scrutiny review, BSL will survive as long as the government can establish that the BSL is rationally related to its purpose, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is found to be over-inclusive or under-inclusive.|$|E

25|$|After the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century, royal justice {{came to be}} {{administered}} in three central courts: the Court of King's Bench, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Exchequer. The common law developed in these royal courts. To commence litigation in these royal courts, {{it was necessary to}} fit one's claim within a form of action. The plaintiff would purchase a writ in the Chancery, the head of which was the Lord Chancellor. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> provided no remedy (or no efficacious remedy), litigants could sometimes appeal directly to the King. Eventually, the King would delegate resolution of these petitions to the King's Council. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor himself. Christianity did play a role in creating Common Law, however it does not have any control or power in the court of law.|$|E
25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
25|$|The law has met heavy {{resistance}} from students, trade unions, and left-wing activists, sparking protests in February and March 2006 (and continuing into April) {{with hundreds of}} thousands of participants in over 180 cities and towns across France. On 18 March, up to as many as 1.5 million demonstrated across France, over half of the country's 84 public universities were closed because of student blockades, and Bernard Thibault, the leader of the CGT, one of France's five major labour unions, suggested that a general strike across the country would occur <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> was not repealed. A big march was prepared for 4 April, while students' organizations had already called for a general strike. In the biggest student movement since 1968, mass meetings were held in many universities (In Toulouse over 4,000 students occupied the rugby stadium to hold their meeting). Motorways were blockaded and employers organisations offices were occupied. The actions were (unusually) supported by all of the main trade union federations and all the Left political parties (more or less enthusiastically). The protests spread to high schools, and involved large numbers of young people both from prestigious universities, and from technical high schools and other places of education drawing a mainly working class student body.|$|E

Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E
