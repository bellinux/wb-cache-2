5|$|Jim wanders back to Suzhou Creek. Along the way {{he hears}} news of Japan's {{surrender}} {{and the end of}} the war. He encounters the Japanese teenager he befriended earlier, who has since become a pilot but is now disillusioned. The youth remembers Jim and offers him a mango, and will cut <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> with his katana. Basie reappears with a group of armed Americans who have arrived to loot the Red Cross containers being airdropped over the area. One of the Americans, thinking Jim is in danger, shoots and kills the Japanese youth. Basie offers to help Jim find his parents, but Jim—infuriated over his friend's death—chooses to stay behind.|$|E
5|$|Michael Giacchino {{composed}} the film's score; {{this was his}} fifth collaboration with Pixar and his second collaboration with Docter after Up. The producers first met with Giacchino to explain the film's concept and screen <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> In response, he composed an eight-minute suite of music, unconnected to the film, based on his emotions viewing it. Rivera noted that while both Giacchino and Docter were musicians, they discussed the film in terms of story and character.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} what was then known as Scary Movie went on sale on a Friday in June1995, but {{received}} no bids. By the following Monday, the script had become {{the subject of a}} significant bidding war among a host of established studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Morgan Creek Productions. Producer Cathy Konrad read the script and felt it was exactly what the Weinstein brothers of the fledgling Dimension Films — then a part of Miramax — were looking for. Dimension had previously released several horror films and intended to focus on that genre. Konrad brought the script to Bob Weinstein's assistant, Richard Potter. Believing it had potential, he brought it to Weinstein's attention. Studios began {{to drop out of the}} bidding as the price of the script increased, and the final two bidders were Oliver Stone, who was at the time working under Cinergi Pictures, and the Weinsteins of Dimension Films. Williamson agreed to a bid of $400,000 from Miramax, plus a contract for two sequels and a possible fourth unrelated film. Williamson said he chose Dimension because he believed they would produce Scary Movie immediately and without significantly censoring the violence in the script. Craven read the script before he became involved in the production, and considered convincing a studio to buy <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to direct. However, by the time Craven read the script, it had already been sold.|$|E

5|$|The series begins while set in 1978, as Frank {{gets into}} trouble with the law. Mr. Jarvis (John Stone), {{a man from the}} {{department}} of child services, explains that Frank's father Les (Mario Kery), is a criminal and his mother, Helena (Lee Sanderson) is an alcoholic. As he grows up he aspires to emulate Les' criminal dealings. Pippa and Tom take Frank in as their first foster child. Upon moving to Summer Bay, Frank tries to get a job in Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) shop where he meets Roo. Frank is attracted to Roo and tells Alf that he had been helping Roo with her school work. Alf gives him the job alongside helping Roo with her studies. Frank is not good with school work so he pays his foster brother, Steven to do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> They begin dating, but Alf becomes angry with Frank for convincing Roo to skip school. The pair nearly sleep together, but Roo asks him to wait.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

25|$|Following the Challenger disaster, {{examination}} of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed {{that three of the}} crew members Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Onizuka, mission specialist Judith Resnik, and pilot Michael Smith.

However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.|$|E

25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both {{had a sense of}} physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of Ibsen's Ghost at Toole's Theatre in London {{was seen by}} William Archer, the translator of Ibsen's works into English. Apparently comfortable with the parody, he enjoyed the humour of the play and recommended it to others. Barrie's third play Walker, London (1892) resulted in him being introduced to a young actress named Mary Ansell. He proposed to her and they were married on 9 July 1894. Barrie bought her a Saint Bernard puppy, who {{played a part in}} the novel The Little White Bird. He used Ansell's given name for many characters in his novels. Barrie also authored Jane Annie, a comic opera for Richard D'Oyly Carte (1893), which unfortunately failed. He begged his friend Arthur Conan Doyle to revise and finish <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{salmon is}} an {{important}} creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon of Knowledge plays {{key role in the}} tale The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn. In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of knowledge to whoever eats it, and is sought by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> However, Fionn burns his thumb on the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon {{is also one of the}} incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill and Fintan mac Bóchra.|$|E
