50|$|Ashanti {{region has}} a {{significant}} aquaculture industry and fishing industry. Products for local consumption and export include Western Cuttlefish, tilapia, rock lobsters, prawns, crabs, smoked catfish (smoked fish) and tuna. Processing is conducted along the Crater Lake of Lake Bosumtwi and Ashanti region's eastern Lake Volta coast. The main fish species cultivated in Ashanti region are Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Tilapia species represent over 90 percent of farmed fish production. Pond aquaculture is the main production system in terms of number of farms, and is mainly small scale and semi-intensive. However, {{in the last five}} to seven years the dominant culture system for tilapia production has changed, {{and the vast majority of}} tilapia is now farmed intensively in cages in Lake Volta. Aquaculture production increased from 950 metric tons in 2004 to over 27,000 metric tons in 2012. This growth is due mainly to increased production from a small number of large-scale cage farms (battery cages). Overall, cage farms currently account for less than 2 percent of farms by number but much more by production. In 2012, for example, aquaculture production from cages was over 24,000 metric tons compared to less than 2,000 metric tons from ponds and tanks. The growth in aquaculture production is also attributed to increased availability of quality fingerlings and <b>feed</b> <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> production. The number of private hatcheries, which currently produce the majority of fingerlings in Ashanti region, has increased in recent years as a result of the rapid growth of cage farming (battery cage). The establishment of a feed mills in Ashanti region in 2011, has greatly improved the reliability and availability of feed supply to fish farmers in Ashanti region.|$|E

However, small quantities of specialized feeds are often needed for experimental purposes, feeding difficult-to maintain aquarium fishes, larval or small juvenile fishes, brood fish conditioning, or administering medication to sick fish. Small ornamental fish farms with an assortment of fish require small amounts of various diets with particular ingredients. It is not cost effective for commercial manufacturers to produce very small quantities of specialized feeds. Most feed mills will only produce custom formulations in quantities of more than one ton, and medicated feeds are usually sold in 50 -pound bags.
