5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work <b>desks,</b> and treehouses, driving toy vehicles such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on <b>desks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{trading area}} is {{surrounded}} by <b>desks</b> allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the <b>desks</b> served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops.|$|E

50|$|The modern trestle <b>desk</b> {{is not so}} much a <b>desk</b> form as a <b>desk</b> improvisation. In {{shape and}} {{manufacture}} it sometimes resembles certain variations of the antique field <b>desk</b> which was used by officers not too far from the battlefield. Basically, the modern trestle <b>desk</b> improv is a plank of wood set on two trestles.|$|R
5|$|The second floor, {{reserved}} as {{the chamber}} for the Senate, was more ornate and adorned with heavy red drapes. By 1796, the room featured 32 secretary <b>desks</b> {{very similar to}} the <b>desks</b> that are still used in the current Senate chamber in the United States Capitol; 28 of the <b>desks</b> at Congress Hall are original. Portraits of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, presented as gifts from the French monarch following the American Revolution, hang in adjoining committee rooms. A fresco of an American bald eagle is painted on the ceiling, holding the traditional olive branch to symbolize peace. Also on the ceiling, a plaster medallion {{in the form of a}} sunburst features 13 stars to represent the original colonies. The design mirrors a similar pattern on the floor, where a carpet made by William Sprague, a local weaver, features the shields of each of the 13 original states. The carpet seen today is a reproduction of the original.|$|E

50|$|The {{only other}} major antique {{combination}} of a large portable <b>desk</b> and a frame is the more delicate <b>desk</b> on a frame of the 18th century, which was popular in Colonial America. When {{the top and bottom}} chests are permanently attached or built as one piece there is a <b>desk</b> form called a Fall front <b>desk.</b> It is supposed that the fall front <b>desk</b> form gradually evolved from the <b>desk</b> on a chest {{towards the end of the}} Renaissance.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some places}} the slant top <b>desk</b> {{is known as}} a [...] "bureau" [...] <b>desk,</b> and in others it goes under the name of slope-front <b>desk.</b> In the United States, the slant top <b>desk</b> is {{sometimes}} called a Governor Winthrop <b>desk,</b> in memory of John Winthrop, the 17th century governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As Winthrop died in 1647, he had no actual connection to this style of <b>desk,</b> which originated in the 18th century and is especially associated with Chippendale. The name [...] "Winthrop" [...] was attached to this kind of <b>desk</b> by the Winthrop Furniture Co. of Boston, Massachusetts, who offered their [...] "Gov.

5|$|The House chamber on {{the first}} floor is rather simple and {{featured}} mahogany <b>desks</b> and leather chairs. The room eventually accommodated 106 representatives from 16 states: the 13 original states as well as the representatives from the new states of Vermont in 1791, Kentucky in 1792, and Tennessee in 1796. The room has been restored to its original appearance in 1796.|$|E

However, the preparation of contents is a hard job for contents-creators (usually, who is an expert of the work.). To support making help <b>desk</b> contents, we developed "Procedure based help <b>desk</b> system".

40|$|Summer of 2011, the Reserves <b>Desk</b> and Fines <b>Desk</b> were {{consolidated}} {{with the}} Circulation <b>Desk.</b> Facilities and Systems took over {{management of the}} Checkout <b>Desk.</b> Circulation thus became responsible for staffing and managing one service <b>desk</b> which offered circulation, reserves and fines collection services. In the Fall of 2011, the Circulation and ILL departments were merged together to form the Access Services Department. Circulation staff was trained to conduct ILL services at the Circulation <b>Desk.</b> As a result, the Circulation <b>Desk</b> offered circulation, reserves, fines and ILL services. In the Summer of 2012, another important merger took place. The Reference <b>Desk</b> was merged with the Circulation <b>Desk</b> to create a single service point. A new name was created for the <b>desk,</b> the Library Services <b>Desk.</b> Managers from both Access Services and Reference worked together to implement transitioning to a single service point. Training plans were created and hours of operation were discussed. Circulation staff would answer basic reference questions. Reference staff (Graduate Library Assistants) would answer basic circulation questions. An on-call librarian service was created to respond to in-depth reference questions. Walkie-talkies were used to contact the on-call librarian. Willis office 123, adjacent to the Library Services <b>Desk,</b> was established as a meeting room on-call librarians could use when needed. In December 2012, managers of the Access Services and Reference Departments met to discuss how well the merged <b>desk</b> was functioning by answering a series of service <b>desk</b> assessment questions. ...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, {{the commune}} had eight primary schools with 19 {{teachers}} for 595 children. There were 20 mahadras, or traditional schools, in 11 locations. Only four had a library or document repository. There were 11 writing rooms of varying quality, and one small vocational training centre. By 2007, the commune had 11 primary schools with 689 students (45percent {{of whom were}} girls) and 28 teachers, but no secondary school. Only three schools had <b>desks.</b> All had latrines, but not all had drinking water or facilities for preparing meals for the children. The quality of education was mixed.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the capitol}} wings closed for a {{restoration}} project to upgrade {{items such as}} furniture, plumbing, and electrical systems. The $34 million project became {{an issue in the}} 2008 Senate campaign between Gordon Smith and Jeff Merkley when Smith used the price of the project in ads attacking Merkley who was the Speaker of the Oregon House when the remodel was approved. Part of the attack involved the cost of new <b>desks</b> for legislators and staff that were manufactured by Oregon prison inmates. Renovations were completed in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the church}} stands a cloister {{surrounded}} by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was {{the heart of the}} abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts. The monks' <b>desks</b> were placed in the north walk of the cloister, and a cupboard for books in current use was carved into the external wall of the south transept.|$|E
50|$|By this {{capacity}} of hiding or revealing the main working area the spinet <b>desk</b> {{could be said}} to be a smaller, less obtrusive cousin of the rolltop <b>desk</b> and the cylinder <b>desk.</b> Like them, and unlike the secretary <b>desk</b> or the fall front <b>desk,</b> it can be closed up without disturbing too much the paperwork and various documents and implements left on the main desktop surface.|$|R

5|$|In 1984 the {{non-stop}} Gatwick Express {{service was}} started, {{aiming for a}} 30-minute journey time. This was coupled with the provision of an airport lounge and check-in facilities at first-floor level, with dedicated escalators down to the Gatwick Express platforms. British Airways and other major airlines had their own check-in <b>desks</b> there. British Rail operated an International Travel Centre within the main station, separate from the domestic travel centre. At the time, Victoria was still a major departure point for international travel, with boat trains to Dover and Folkestone for France and Belgium and beyond. This ceased {{with the introduction of}} Eurostar in 1994, which did not serve Victoria, and the International Travel Centre closed.|$|E
5|$|Making {{necessary}} arrangements {{each year}} for {{the growing number of}} pilgrims poses a logistic challenge for the government of Saudi Arabia, which has, since the 1950s, spent more than $100 billion to increase pilgrimage facilities. Major issues like housing, transportation, sanitation, and health care have been addressed and improved greatly by the government by introducing various development programs, with the result that pilgrims now enjoy modern facilities and perform various rites at ease. The Saudi government often sets quota for various countries to keep the pilgrims' number at a manageable level, and arranges huge security forces and CCTV cameras to maintain overall safety during Hajj. Various institutions and government programs, such as the Haj subsidy offered in India or the Tabung Haji based in Malaysia assist pilgrims in covering the costs of the journey. For 2014 Hajj, special Hajj information <b>desks</b> were set up at Pakistani airports to assist the pilgrims.|$|E

After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines.

5|$|Once the {{revolution}} concluded following the Dutchâ€“Indonesian Round Table Conference of 1949, Soeman was recalled to Pekanbaru {{and made the}} head of the regional branch of the Department of Education and Culture. His main task was reestablishing and reinvigorating the education system in Riau following three years of the Japanese occupation and four years of revolution. <b>Desks</b> had been used for firewood, school buildings had been razed to prevent enemy forces from using them, and much of the population had been unable to attend regular classes. Furthermore, the department did not have sufficient funding to support reconstruction. Over the next three years Soeman led communal work projects dedicated to restoring Riau's education facilities, relying on voluntary contributions from the populace.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would help make the music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other <b>desks</b> and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|E

All of the items inside of the bank were bought from a bank-supply catalogue by set decorator Tim Stepeck. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, a four-block area was sealed off to allow cameras to film. A total of eleven cameras, some at different speeds, were used. Some of the cameras made it onto the film, but they were erased during post-production.|$|E
