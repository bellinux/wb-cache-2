5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash {{performed}} his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking out before the three count. This led to Nash hitting Joe in the groin and placing <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes for leverage in his winning pin attempt.|$|E

But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard {{to the right and}} to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the {{crowding}} ghosts of many miserable years.|$|E
5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the main}} event match, Piper {{revealed}} that the fan humiliated by Lawler in the King's Court segment would be in Piper's corner during the match. Piper started the match by throwing his kilt in Lawler's face and attacking him. The match consisted mainly of brawling, and Lawler was frequently distracted by the fan who was standing in Piper's corner. Lawler gained the advantage by performing a sleeper hold and a piledriver on Piper. He attacked Piper with a foreign object, which knocked Piper to the mat. Then, while trying to pin Piper, Jerry Lawler placed <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes for leverage. The fan at ringside pushed Lawler's feet off, however, which allowed Piper to perform a back suplex and get the victory.|$|E
5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee {{what had happened and}} the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.|$|E

25|$|After Frenchy Martin's departure, Bravo joined Jimmy Hart's {{stable and}} entered a feud with another power wrestler, The Ultimate Warrior, unsuccessfully {{challenging}} Warrior for his WWF Intercontinental Championship. Prior to a WrestleMania VI loss to Duggan, Bravo {{teamed up with}} Earthquake, and Bravo would often display his strength by doing push ups while the 460lb. Earthquake sat on his back (although Tenta kept <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, so not all of his weight was on his partner). The team of Earthquake and Bravo would have a lengthy feud with Hulk Hogan and Tugboat.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Hulk Hogan and Randy Orton. Orton took the {{advantage}} in the match, as he focused on Hogan's injured knee. The match saw Orton perform an RKO on Hogan. As Orton went for the pin, Hogan had <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes. The referee did not see his feet and originally gave Orton the victory. Later, the referee saw that Hogan's feet {{were still on the}} ropes and restarted the match. Hogan won the match when he performed a leg drop on Orton for a pinfall victory. To date, this is Hogan's last match in the WWE.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} was between Lex Luger and Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Luger gained the early advantage, and {{targeted}} {{the left arm}} of Flair. Luger applied the hammerlock, and used the guard rail and ringpost. Flair fought back after he avoided an elbow drop, and sent Luger's head into the guard rail. Luger applied the sleeper hold, but Flair fought out with a belly to back suplex. Luger fought back with a superplex, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger continued to have the advantage until Flair pulled Luger down, and hit his left knee with a steel chair. Flair then targeted Luger's left leg, and applied the figure four leglock. Luger fought back with a gorilla press slam. After performing mounted punches and a scoop powerslam, Luger applied the Torture Rack. However, his knees buckled, and Flair fell on top of him. Flair then pinned Luger with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rope to win the match, and retain the title.|$|E
25|$|Hellwig {{joined the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987. First {{competing}} on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated {{a series of}} jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, Barry Horowitz and Mike Sharpe. He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of Wrestling Challenge, where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs. The Ultimate Warrior became known for his high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena at full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ropes up and down. He was also known for his distinctive pattern of face paint. After several months of defeating jobbers, he was pinned {{for the first time}} in the WWF by fellow WWF rookie/future rival Rick Rude on December 28, 1987. In early 1988, Warrior entered into his first real WWF feud with fellow strongman Hercules Hernandez. The two faced off on the February 7, 1988 airing of Wrestling Challenge, where Hercules was disqualified for using his steel chain. Warrior then grabbed a hold of the chain and in the midst of a tug of war over it, the chain snapped. This led to a match at WrestleMania IV, where Warrior was victorious in his pay-per-view debut. Warrior lost twice by pinfall shortly thereafter: cleanly to André the Giant in April in Italy, and to Dino Bravo, who put <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes for leverage, in Montreal in June.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between Matt and Jeff Hardy with Lita as the Special Guest Referee. In the beginning, {{the two had}} several {{reversals}} until Matt got in control. Jeff sidestepped when Matt attempted a diving leg drop. Jeff hit a falling headbutt and a clothesline. Jeff went on to deliver a diving leg drop of his own. Jeff went to the top rope but Matt trapped him in a Tree of Woe. Matt then applied the sunset flip, which Jeff countered and both men were lying outside the ring. In the ring, Jeff injured his left knee, which Matt would work on. He hit a chop block {{and a series of}} moves. He tried a powerbomb, but Jeff countered it into a Compactor Clutch. Matt assaulted Jeff again with a Half Boston Crab. Jeff got to the ropes, breaking the hold, and kicked Matt to the outside. Jeff went to the top, but, because of his hurt knee, he fell down. Matt grabbed Jeff's leg but Jeff hit a mule kick. Matt tried a Twist of Fate, but Jeff countered it into a leg drop. Jeff hit a suplex, and went to the top rope again but, because of his knee, Matt took advantage and clutched him. Matt tried to hit a Twist of Fate but Jeff reversed it into his own. Matt attempted a pinfall on Jeff and used ropes for leverage but Lita ordered him to break it. Jeff went to the top rope again, but Matt caught him, and tried to hit him a Twist of Fate from the top. Jeff forced Matt off and hit a Swanton Bomb. Matt tried to get <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes, but Jeff pulled them off, and won the match.|$|E

He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating {{that when he was}} a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings.

500|$|Having {{just been}} {{released}} from Burnley, Pugh signed for League Two club Bury on a short-term contract on 23 March 2006, following a three-week trial. Bury were entangled in a relegation battle, and Pugh made his debut two days later after coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Lewis Gobern in a 2–1 home win over Rochdale. He marked his first start for Bury with a goal from 10yards in a 1–1 away draw with Lincoln City on 15 April 2006, after which manager Chris Casper commented [...] "Mark's a good player and he's got a bright future if he keeps <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground". He finished the 2005–06 season by playing six matches and scoring one goal for the club. As {{a result of his}} good performances, and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation in 19th place, Bury manager Chris Casper offered him a new one-year contract at Gigg Lane; his first professional contract.|$|E

Feeling guilty for how they treated him, the Griffins give Brian their blessings.|$|E
500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E
