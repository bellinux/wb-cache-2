50|$|As the powered {{escape wheel}} rotates clockwise, the {{entrance}} tooth slides across the sloping impulse {{plane of the}} entrance pallet. This turns the pallets about their axis, which places the <b>exit</b> <b>pallet</b> {{into the path of}} the rotating escape wheel. Once the entrance tooth leaves the impulse plane of the entrance pallet, the wheel is able to turn a small amount (called the drop) until the exit tooth of the escape wheel lands on the locking face of the <b>exit</b> <b>pallet.</b> The wheel is said to be locked on the <b>exit</b> <b>pallet.</b> From the release from the entrance pallet to this point, the escape wheel will have turned through exactly one half of the 24 degree angle between two teeth.|$|E
50|$|The impulse {{received}} by the entrance pallet as the tooth moves over the impulse face is transferred by the lever to the balance wheel via the ruby impulse pin on the roller of the balance wheel. The lever moves until it rests against the right banking pin; it is held in this position {{by the force of}} the exit tooth against the <b>exit</b> <b>pallet</b> jewel (called the draw). This means that in order to unlock the wheel it must be turned backwards by a small amount, which is done by the return momentum of the balance wheel via the impulse pin.|$|E
50|$|After {{the exit}} tooth locks, the balance wheel rotates anti-clockwise, free of {{interference}} from the escapement until the balance spring pulls it back clockwise, and the impulse pin re-enters the fork. This will unlock the escapement, releasing the escape wheel {{so that the}} exit tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the <b>exit</b> <b>pallet,</b> which transfers a clockwise impulse to the balance wheel's impulse pin via the lever fork, while pushing the lever up against the left banking pin. The escape wheel drops again until the entrance tooth locks on the entrance pallet now being {{held in place by}} the left banking pin via the lever. The balance wheel continues clockwise, again free from interference until it is pulled back by the balance spring to the center position. The cycle then starts again.|$|E
50|$|McNair's pallet {{was shipped}} {{out of the}} prison around 9:45am, {{and he was able}} to <b>exit</b> the <b>pallet</b> around 11:00am. McNair was aware that it would not be until 4:00pm that the prison would find him missing. McNair's plan was to go to the nearby town of Alexandria, Louisiana, where he would then steal {{supplies}} and transportation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{escape wheel}} is {{geared to the}} watch's wheel train, which applies torque to it from the mainspring. The {{rotation}} of the escape wheel {{is controlled by the}} pallets. The escape wheel has specially shaped teeth of either ratchet or club form, which interact with the two jewels called the entrance and <b>exit</b> <b>pallets.</b> The escape wheel, except in unusual cases, has 15 teeth and is made of steel. These pallets are attached solidly to the lever, which has at its end a fork to receive the ruby impulse pin of the balance roller which is fixed to the balance wheel shaft. The balance wheel is returned towards its static center position by an attached balance spring (not shown in the diagram). In modern design it is common for the pallet mountings and the fork to be made as a single component. The lever is mounted on a shaft and is free to rotate between two fixed banking pins.|$|R
5000|$|In early {{watches the}} pallet fork and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss lever type escapement, the lever is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor escapement. The lever is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the escapement's escape wheel. The central shaft of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the balance wheel's impulse pin, which is set off center in a disk on the balance wheel's shaft. To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the entry pallet, while the other one is called the <b>exit</b> <b>pallet.</b>|$|E
