5|$|A {{gun in the}} Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis has {{the ability}} to {{bioaccumulate}} the heavy metal vanadium, a phenomenon first reported in Amanita muscaria in 1931. A field study of Scandinavian specimens found vanadium contents ranging from 38 to 169mg of vanadium per kg of dry mushroom (average of 119mg/kg). For comparison, the vanadium concentration <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> mushrooms is typically less than 2mg/kg.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 {{times that of the}} surface, which <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.|$|E
5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> side chains give them lower priority.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, The Secret Service {{aired in}} the ATV, Granada and Southern {{broadcasting}} regions on its original run, appearing on Sunday evenings at the regular time of 5.30pm. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> ITV regions, The Flaxton Boys was broadcast {{in this time}} slot. Outside of Britain, ATN Channel 7 purchased and broadcast the series in Australia on Saturday mornings in 1972. Although repeats ran until 1972 on ATV and Southern, and until 1975 on Granada, the series has not been transmitted since and remains unsold to new broadcasters.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} species, 'Carnival' thrives {{best in a}} semi shade position, on a fertile, well-drained soil. Prefers {{alkaline}} soils, but will grow on <b>most</b> any type. <b>In</b> cooler climates, can take more sun without burning. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> afternoon shade is preferred, and it will grow amazingly well in full-shade.|$|R
50|$|Notice {{that the}} POWER7 chip {{significantly}} outperformed (2x-5x) the i7 in some benchmarks (bwaves, cactusADM, lbm) while also being significantly slower (2x-3x) <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>others.</b> This {{is indicative of}} major architectural {{differences between the two}} chips / mainboards / memory systems etc.: they were designed with different workloads in mind.|$|R
5000|$|... "Keep A-Knockin (but You Cant Come In)" [...] is {{a popular}} song that has been {{recorded}} {{by a variety of}} musicians over the years. The lyrics concern a lover at the door who wont be admitted—in some versions because someone else is already there, but <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> because the knocking lover has behaved badly.|$|R
5|$|Like <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> d-block groups, the {{abundance}} in Earth's crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number. Zinc is with 65 {{parts per million}} (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant. Copernicium, as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only {{be present in the}} laboratories where it was produced.|$|E
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, as <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> fish, is {{the transfer of}} gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscular system}} has been {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most side-scrolling deathmatch games, {{the weapons}} in Liero have {{infinite}} ammo. Key factors include the reload rate of each weapon {{and how fast}} they shoot, whereas <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>others</b> include how much ammo a gun sports and how frequent more ammo for that gun can be found. Liero depends all on timing and swift maneuverability.|$|R

5|$|The {{position}} of governor has {{developed over the}} course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> states.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E
5|$|The total medical {{cost for}} a pregnancy, {{delivery}} and {{care of a}} newborn in the United States is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a Caesarean section as of 2012. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> countries the cost is less than half. For a child born in 2011, an average US family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them.|$|E

5|$|The uniform worn for {{practicing}} aikido (aikidōgi) {{is similar}} to the training uniform (keikogi) used <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the oval-shaped {{eye socket}} of Tanystropheus, the eye socket of Dinocephalosaurus {{appears to be}} peach-shaped, with a narrow {{anterior}} end. On {{the top of the}} skull, the parietal is broad and flattened, bearing no trace of the midline crest found in Tanystropheus. The jugal only has two processes, missing the third backward-projecting process present <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> reptiles. Also missing are the retroarticular process of the posterior (rear) lower jaw (another point of distinction from Tanystropheus), as well as additional teeth and a cavity between the pterygoid bones on the palate.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Frome has a {{temperate}} climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.|$|E

50|$|Parabasalids are anaerobic, {{and lack}} mitochondria, {{but this is}} now {{known to be a}} result of {{secondary}} loss, and they contain small hydrogenosomes which apparently developed from reduced mitochondria. Similar relics have been found in other amitochondriate flagellates, and the parabasalids are probably related to them, forming a group called the metamonads. They lack the feeding grooves found <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> but this is probably a secondary loss as well.|$|R
5000|$|Rarely, a Japanese Bobtail, {{especially}} {{a predominantly white}} specimen, may have heterochromia, or eyes of different colors. Regardless of breed, cats with this trait are known as odd-eyed cats. In this breed, one iris is blue ("silver" [...] in Japanese breeding terms) while the other is yellow ("gold"). This trait {{is more common in}} this breed than <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>others,</b> with the notable exception of the Turkish Van.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Portishead has a {{temperate}} climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> parts of the United Kingdom.
