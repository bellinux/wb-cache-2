5|$|In early 1799 Prudente was {{operating}} off South Africa, attacking British trade passing {{to or from}} the Cape Colony when the ship was discovered by British frigate HMS Daedalus under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball. Prudente turned away and Ball gave chase, following the French ship closely. After five hours Daedalus caught Prudente and fired a raking broadside into the stern, disabling the French ship. <b>For</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> the action continued at close range until Prudente was forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} {{companies}} {{landing in the}} first wave, only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended. E/116, aiming for Easy Green, ended up scattered across the two beaches of the 16th RCT area. G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead. I/16 drifted so far east it did not land <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> and a half.|$|E
5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} be much faster than the large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E

5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour,</b> but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. <b>For</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shots were}} fired at 12:30 by Persanne close to the island of Pelagosa (Palagruža), but the main action did not begin <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour,</b> when Alceste and Pomone {{exchanged}} shots from their stern and bow guns. By 13:40, Alceste was firing her broadside into Pomone and simultaneously pressing on all sail {{in an effort to}} reach Pauline, but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from Pomone brought down Alcestes main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing Pauline to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, Active had arrived in action and was also firing into Pomone, forcing Montfort to bring Pauline round to protect her outgunned colleague. By 14:20 the conflicts between Active and Pomone and Alceste and Pauline had separated into different duels, Pomone particularly suffering severely but Active also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder carronade shot severing Captain Gordon's leg {{at the height of the}} engagement.|$|E

Mark Waugh and Blewett {{contrived}} to hold out <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour,</b> before Lewis (4–24) and Tufnell took further wickets. Healy (51 not out) did his best to marshal the tail, batting for two and a quarter hours and with Fleming, batting until well into the final hour, but Lewis eventually trapped the latter leg-before, and Malcolm (4–39) finished the job off by picking up McIntyre as well to round off an England victory.|$|E
25|$|After lunch, {{the pair}} {{continued}} to score quickly <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour,</b> and extended their partnership to 177 before Flintoff was lbw to Tait for 102, his first Test century against Australia. The loss of Flintoff did not deter the English, as Jones continued to hit {{runs through the}} off side {{on the way to}} his highest score against the Australians, making 85 before he was caught and bowled by Kasprowicz. The next two wickets fell quickly, but a stubborn last-wicket partnership of 23 between Matthew Hoggard and Simon Jones – including an incident where the ball hit the stumps but the bails failed to fall off – saw England to 477 all out at tea.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E

25|$|On 12 September 1810, Alban was off Læsø island {{when she}} saw six Danish gunboats coming towards her from the {{direction}} of the Skaw. Wind conditions were calm so Alban had to resort to her sweeps to try to escape the Danes. She was unsuccessful and by early afternoon an engagement had commenced. After about three hours, a cannon shot took off the back of Thomas's skull. His second in command, Midshipman Alexander Hutchinson, continued the resistance <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour,</b> but then struck. Alban had lost two men killed (including Thomas), and had three wounded, out of a crew of some 25. She also had five feet of water in her hold, and her rigging and sails were entirely shot away. The subsequent court martial honourably acquitted Hutchinson and the surviving officers and men, and recommended Hutchinson for promotion. The Danish gunboat flotilla was under the command of Lieutenant Jørgen Conrad de Falsen.|$|E
25|$|On {{assessing}} Greenwichs strength, the frigate kept {{close to}} the squadron, which then came up and attacked, action commencing at 9 a.m. when Diadème opened fire. For the next twelve hours Greenwich was constantly engaged with one or other of the French ships. Roddam still hoped to carry his plan of capturing one of them into execution, and assembled his men {{in an attempt to}} board the 64-gun Éveillé, but several of her consorts bore up and opened fire, damaging Greenwichs rigging and leaving her unmanageable. Roddam gathered his officers together, and told them that though they had no hope of winning against such a superior force, if any man could point out the admiral's flagship, he hoped to engage her and fight on <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> or two. His officers, among whom was Lieutenant James Wallace, pledged to follow their captain, but pointed out that they had done all in their power to defend their ship. At 9.30 p.m., Roddam agreed to surrender his ship, as further resistance would only cause further casualties among his men.|$|E
25|$|Confusion between {{ship and}} shore {{led to the}} South Saskatchewans {{reducing}} their defensive perimeter too quickly, yielding the western heights to German infantry. The original order for evacuation was for 10:00 but was changed to 11:00. The change proved disastrous for the assault troops, as the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada had already started to withdraw to the beach at 09:30, closely followed by the Saskatchewans. They would {{have to contend with}} the increasing enemy action <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour,</b> despite the perimeter now being too close to the beach. At about 10:30, all available craft were sent to Green Beach at Dieppe, which was still under intense fire from mortars and machine-guns. At 10:45, six LCAs came inshore to Green Beach under heavy fire. It was a mistake; the evacuation should have begun on Red Beach. As Alasdair Ferguson grounded his LCA, he could see no movement on the beach. Moments later, so many troops were rushing Ferguson's craft that it was swamped and, as he made out to sea, the craft was hit by a shell and capsized. He helped the survivors board another craft, and the traumatized sailors and soldiers returned to Newhaven. The other five LCAs participated in a chaotic evacuation, taking men aboard and clearing the beach successfully, but casualties mounted. A second flight of LCAs appeared soon after, but the state of the tide was changing markedly and the risk of becoming stranded kept the LCAs well off shore. The loss of the western heights and the receding tide made further attempts to evacuate most costly. Heavy losses occurred on the sand and in the water. By 11:30, the few men left on the beach were overwhelmed by an enemy attack and captured while attempting to disengage.|$|E

500|$|Venerable {{took the}} worst of the early action and at 05:30 the mizzen topmast was shot away. Hood responded by {{ordering}} Captain Aiskew Hollis in Thames to approach Troude's stern, the frigate repeatedly raking the French ship under fire from the ineffective stern guns. <b>For</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> the ships traded broadsides, until at 06:45 the mainmast of Venerable collapsed over the side, significantly retarding the ship's movement. Formidable was able to pull ahead slowly in the light and unreliable winds, continuing to fire the stern guns at the now immobile British ship. Venerable was now drifting out of control, the foremast collapsing at 07:50 as the ship grounded on the shoals at Sancti Petri, [...] south of Cadiz. With his main opponent disabled, Troude continued slowly towards Cadiz, out of range of the approaching Caesar.|$|E
500|$|Patton's brigade {{was then}} moved to support U.S. I Corps in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive on September 26.

Around 09:00, Patton was wounded while leading six men and a tank in an attack on German machine guns {{near the town of}} Cheppy. His orderly, Private First Class Joe Angelo, saved Patton, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E. Brett, commander of the U.S. 326th Tank Battalion, took command of the brigade in Patton's absence.

500|$|A lookout aboard Weehawken spotted Atlanta at 04:10 on {{the morning}} of 17 June. When the latter ship closed to within about [...] of the two Union ships, she fired one round from her bow gun that passed over Weehawken and landed near Nahant. Shortly afterward, Atlanta ran aground on a sandbar; she was briefly able to free herself, but the {{pressure}} of the tide pushed her back onto the sandbar. This time Webb was unable to get off and the monitors closed the range. When Weehawken, the leading ship, closed to within [...] she opened fire with both of her guns. The [...] shell missed, but the [...] shell struck the ironclad above the port middle gun port, penetrated her armor and broke the wooden backing behind it, spraying splinters and fragments that disabled the entire gun crew and half the crew of the bow gun, even though it failed to cleanly penetrate through the backing. The next shot from the 11-inch Dahlgren gun struck the upper hull and started a small leak even though it failed to penetrate the two-inch armor there. The next shell from the 15-inch Dahlgren glanced off the middle starboard gun shutter as it was being opened, wounding half the gun's crew with fragments. The final shell was also from the 15-inch Dahlgren and it struck the top of the pilothouse, breaking the armor there and wounding both pilots in it. By this time, Atlanta had been able to fire only seven shots, none of which hit either Union ship, and was hard aground with high tide not due <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>hour</b> and a half. Weehawken and Nahant were able to freely maneuver into positions from which the Atlantas narrow gun ports would not allow her to reply and the damage already inflicted by the former ship made further resistance futile. Webb surrendered his ship within 15 minutes of opening fire, before Nahant even had a chance to fire. Of the ironclad's 21 officers and 124 enlisted men, one man was killed and another sixteen were wounded badly enough to require hospitalization.|$|E
