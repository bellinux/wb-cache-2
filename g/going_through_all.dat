2500|$|Accused {{of being}} Guilty of conspiracy. Convicted {{for getting the}} {{information}} about the landing at Shekhadi and that the main exit point could be in Mhasla Shrivardhan area.

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship.

Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person.
