5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. <b>Dogtooth</b> mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E

25|$|All Hallows is {{constructed}} in ironstone and limestone with a slate roof. Some former openings have been blocked by brick. Its plan {{consists of the}} chancel, with a west porch which was added in the 1889. At the east end is a single bellcote. The porch has a flat roof, and it incorporates a 13th-century doorway. This has a pointed arch and its decoration includes some <b>dogtooth</b> carving. It is built against the blocked chancel arch, parts of which are still visible, including {{the ends of the}} nave arcades. The chancel stands on a plinth, and its north wall is blank. At the east end is a late 14th-century three-light window that was restored in the 19thcentury. The south wall of the chancel contains a priest's door, now blocked with brick, above which is a two-light window dating probably from the early 14thcentury. To the east of this is another similar window.|$|E
2500|$|The film's larger {{meanings}} eluded easy expression. Scott {{called the}} film [...] "a conversation piece. Though the conversation may... be more {{along the lines}} of: 'What was that?' 'I don’t know. Weird.' 'Yeah.' [...] 'Weird.'" [...] Olsen saw <b>Dogtooths</b> substance as [...] "part enigma, part allegory and even part sci-fi in its creation of a completely alternate reality." [...] While Ebert found a [...] "message...: God help children whose parents insanely demand unquestioning obedience to their deranged standards.... ome have even described the film as a comedy. I wasn't laughing." [...] For Bradshaw, the film investigates [...] "the essential strangeness of something society insists is the benchmark of normality: the family, a walled city state with its own autocratic rule and untellable secrets." [...] Harkness notes the [...] "absolute mockery the situation makes of the perfect family ideal" [...] where [...] "Lanthimos isn't interested in making specific political or social points and he refuses to offer any clarifying backstory"; he found <b>Dogtooths</b> oddness [...] "as organic and playful as its impact is incisor sharp." ...|$|R
500|$|The Canadian Rockies {{may have}} towered up to [...] {{approximately}} 70m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion from water and greatly augmented later from glacier ice {{beginning with the}} Quaternary glaciation 2.5 m.y.a. carved the mountains into their present shapes. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, arêtes, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, <b>dogtooth,</b> and sawback mountains. Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40–60 degrees. This leads to dip slope landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its home}} country, Greek critic Dimitris Danikas gave the film {{a rating of}} eight out of ten ("with enthusiasm") and characterizes it as [...] "black, surreal, nightmarish." [...] He {{believes}} that <b>Dogtooth</b> is as important for Greek cinema as Theodoros Angelopoulos' 1970 film Reconstitution. He {{goes on to say}} [...] "Lanthimos composes and goes from one level to another like a wildcat-creator, constantly and continuously maintaining the same rigorous style. Hence the aphasia; hence the uniformity; hence the submission and the scheduled mass culture; hence also the serial killer; hence, however, the disobedience, the anarchy. As I said at the beginning: <b>Dogtooth</b> has the surrealism of Buñuel, the scalpel of Haneke, the underground horror of a thriller without the splatter. Perfect." [...] Danikas characterized Dogtooth's Academy Award nomination as [...] "the greatest Greek triumph of recent years." [...] Columnist Dimitris Bouras, writing for Kathimerini, refers to [...] "the beneficial effects that the prestigious award could have" [...] and believes that the nomination reveals three interesting facts: [...] "1) in Greece we need to be extroverts (and not only in cinema), 2) exportable product is whatever has an identity, 3) Dogtooths nomination is like an investment – manna from the heaven of Hollywood for the developing Greek cinema." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Dogtooth</b> was {{the feature}} film début for Boo Productions, an Athens-based {{advertising}} company. The Greek Film Center supported the project with about €200,000 {{and much of}} the production was done with help from volunteers. Another €50,000 was offered by the production studio, bringing the overall budget to €250,000. Anna Kalaitzidou and Christos Passalis were stage actors who were cast after having worked with Lanthimos earlier. Mary Tsoni was not a professional actress, but a singer in a punk band. Lanthimos [...] had an open approach to both acting and visual style, as he thought it would look fake if he involved too much in the details. It wasn't until the rehearsals started that he began to develop the idea of how the film should be shot, a style where he tried to combine a realistic environment with [...] "really strict framing and a cool, surreal look to go with the narrative".|$|E
6000|$|... § XV. All {{the forms}} given in Plate IX. are of not unfrequent occurrence: varying much {{in size and}} depth, {{according}} to {{the expression of the}} work in which they occur; generally increasing in size in late work (the earliest dentils are seldom more than an inch or {{an inch and a half}} long: the fully developed dentil of the later Gothic is often as much as four or five in length, by one and a half in breadth); but they are all somewhat rare, compared to the true or armor dentil, above described. On the other hand, there are one or two unique conditions, which will be noted in the buildings where they occur.[77] The Ducal Palace furnishes three anomalies in the arch, <b>dogtooth,</b> and dentil: it has a hyperbolic arch, as noted above, Chap. X., § XV.; it has a double-fanged <b>dogtooth</b> in the rings of the spiral shafts on its angles; and, finally, it has a dentil with concave sides, of which the section and two of the blocks, real size, are given in Plate XIV. The labor of obtaining this difficult profile has, however, been thrown away; for the effect of the dentil at ten feet distance is exactly the same as that of the usual form: and the reader may consider the <b>dogtooth</b> and dentil in that plate as fairly representing the common use of them in the Venetian Gothic.|$|E
6000|$|... § VI. The <b>dogtooth,</b> {{employed}} in this simple form, is, however, rather a foil for other ornament, than itself a satisfactory or generally available decoration. It is, however, easy to enrich {{it as we}} choose: taking up its simple form at 3, and describing the arcs marked by the dotted lines upon its sides, and cutting a small triangular cavity between them, we shall leave its ridges somewhat rudely representative of four leaves, as at 8, which is the section and front view {{of one of the}} Venetian stone cornices described above, Chap. XIV., § IV., the figure 8 being here put in the hollow of the gutter. The <b>dogtooth</b> is put on the outer lower truncation, and is actually in position as fig. 5; but being always looked up to, is to the spectator as 3, and always rich and effective. The dogteeth are perhaps most frequently expanded to the width of fig. 9.|$|E
6000|$|... § XII. In Fig. LVII. I {{have given}} {{two of these}} Byzantine stilted arches: {{the one on the}} right, a, as they now too often appear, in its bare brickwork; that on the left, with its {{alabaster}} covering, literally marble defensive armor, riveted together in pieces, which follow the contours of the building. Now, on the wall, these pieces are mere flat slabs cut to the arch outline; but under the soffit of the arch the marble mail is curved, often cut singularly thin, like bent tiles, and fitted together so that the pieces would sustain each other even without rivets. It is of course desirable that this thin sub-arch of marble should project enough to sustain the facing of the wall; and the reader will see, in Fig. LVII., that its edge forms a kind of narrow band round the arch (b), a band which the least enrichment would render a valuable decorative feature. Now this band is, of course, if the soffit-pieces project a little beyond the face of the wall-pieces, a mere fillet, like the wooden gunwale in Plate IX.; and the question is, how to enrich it most wisely. It might easily have been dogtoothed, but the Byzantine architects had not invented the <b>dogtooth,</b> and would not have used it here, if they had; for the <b>dogtooth</b> cannot be employed alone, especially on so principal an angle as this of the main arches, without giving to the whole building a peculiar look, which I can not otherwise describe than as being to the eye, exactly what untempered acid is to the tongue. The mere <b>dogtooth</b> is an acid moulding, and can only be used in certain mingling with others, to give them piquancy; never alone. What, then, will be the next easiest method of giving interest to the fillet? ...|$|E
6000|$|... § X. One {{other form}} of the <b>dogtooth</b> is of great {{importance}} in northern architecture, that produced by oblique cuts slightly curved, as in the margin, Fig. LVI. It is susceptible of the most fantastic and endless decoration; each of the resulting leaves being, in the early porches of Rouen and Lisieux, hollowed out and worked into branching tracery: and at Bourges, for distant effect, worked into plain leaves, or bold bony processes with knobs at the points, and near the spectator, into crouching demons and broad winged owls, and other fancies and intricacies, innumerable and inexpressible.|$|E
6000|$|... § IV. When, however, {{light is}} more {{valuable}} than shadow, or when {{the architecture of the}} wall is too fair to be concealed, it becomes necessary to draw the cornice into narrower limits; a change of considerable importance, in that it permits the gutter, instead of being of lead and hung {{to the edge of the}} cornice, to be of stone, and supported by brackets in the wall, these brackets becoming proper recipients of after decoration (and sometimes associated with the stone channels of discharge, called gargoyles, which belong, however, more properly to the other family of cornices). The most perfect and beautiful example of this kind of cornice is the Venetian, in which the rain from the tiles is received in a stone gutter supported by small brackets, delicately moulded, and having its outer lower edge decorated with the English <b>dogtooth</b> moulding, whose sharp zigzag mingles richly with the curved edges of the tiling. I know no cornice more beautiful in its extreme simplicity and serviceableness.|$|E
6000|$|... § VIII. This {{being the}} {{simplest}} {{treatment of the}} pyramid, fig. 10, from the refectory of Wenlock Abbey, {{is an example of}} the simplest decoration of the recesses or inward angles between the pyramids; that is to say, of a simple hacked edge like one of those in fig. 2, the cuts being taken up and decorated instead of the points. Each is worked into a small trefoiled arch, with an incision round it to mark its outline, and another slight incision above, expressing the angle of the first cutting. I said that the teeth in fig. 7 had in distance the effect of a zigzag: in fig. 10 this zigzag effect is seized upon and developed, but with the easiest and roughest work; the angular incision being a mere limiting line, like that described in § IX. of the last chapter. But hence the farther steps to every condition of Norman ornament are self evident. I do not say that all of them arose from development of the <b>dogtooth</b> in this manner, many being quite independent inventions and uses of zigzag lines; still, they may all be referred to this simple type as their root and representative, that is to say, the mere hack of the Venetian gunwale, with a limiting line following the resultant zigzag.|$|E
60|$|And {{just then}} there {{happened}} {{a coincidence that}} was also something like a catastrophe. I was idly watching, as it moved down the narrow street {{to one of the}} dark doorways, the head-dress, like a tower of white drapery, belonging to the Christian woman from the place where Christ was born. After she had disappeared into the darkness of the porch I continued to look vaguely at the porch, and thought how easily {{it might have been a}} small Gothic gate in some old corner of Rouen, or even Canterbury. In twenty such places in the town one may see the details that appeal to the same associations, so different and so distant. One may see that angular <b>dogtooth</b> ornament that makes the round Norman gateways look like the gaping mouths of sharks. One may see the pointed niches in the walls, shaped like windows and serving somewhat the purpose of brackets, on which were to stand sacred images possibly removed by the Moslems. One may come upon a small court planted with ornamental trees with some monument in the centre, which makes the precise impression of something in a small French town. There are no Gothic spires, but there are numberless Gothic doors and windows; and he who first strikes the place at this angle, as it were, may well feel the Northern element as native and the Eastern element as intrusive. While I was thinking all these things, something happened which in that place was almost a portent.|$|E

60|$|The extreme {{diameter}} of the circle is 3 ,, 10-1/2; its field is slightly raised above the red marbles, {{as shown in the}} section at A, on the left.

The pattern which occupies the other spandril is similar, except that the field b c, instead of the intersecting arcs, has only triangles of grey marble, arranged like rays, with their bases towards the centre. There being twenty round the circle, the reader can of course draw them for himself; they being isosceles, touching the dentil with their points, and being in contact at their bases: it has lost its central boss. The marbles are, in both, covered with a rusty coating, through which it is excessively difficult to distinguish the colors (another proof of the age of the ornament). But the white marbles are certainly, in places (except only the sugary dentil), veined with purple, and the grey seem warmed with green.|$|E
6000|$|... § IV. Taking a {{piece of}} stone instead of timber, and {{enlarging}} the notches, until they meet each other, we have the condition 2, which is a moulding from {{the tomb of the}} Doge Andrea Dandolo, in St. Mark's. Now, considering this moulding as composed of two decorated edges, each edge will be reduced, by the meeting of the notches, to a series of four-sided pyramids (as marked off by the dotted lines), which, the notches here being shallow, will be shallow pyramids; but by deepening the notches, we get them as at 3, with a profile a, more or less steep. This moulding I shall always call [...] "the plain dogtooth;" [...] it is used in profusion in the Venetian and Veronese Gothic, generally set with its front to the spectator, as here at 3; but its effect may be much varied by placing it obliquely (4, and profile as at b); or with one side horizontal (5, and profile c). Of these three conditions, 3 and 5 are exactly the same in reality, only differently placed; but in 4 the pyramid is obtuse, and the inclination of its base variable, the upper side of it being always kept vertical. It is comparatively rare. Of the three, the last, 5, is far the most brilliant in effect, giving in the distance a zigzag form to the high light on it, and a full sharp shadow below. The use of this shadow is sufficiently seen by fig. 7 in this plate (the arch on the left, the number beneath it), in which these levelled dogteeth, with a small interval between each, are employed to set off by their vigor the delicacy of floral ornament above. This arch is the side of a niche from the tomb of Can Signorio della Scala, at Verona; and the value, as well as the distant expression of its <b>dogtooth,</b> may be seen by referring to Prout's beautiful drawing of this tomb in his [...] "Sketches in France and Italy." [...] I have before observed that this artist never fails of seizing the true and leading expression of whatever he touches: he has made this ornament the leading feature of the niche, expressing it, as in distance it is only expressible, by a zigzag.|$|E
60|$|For {{this simple}} reason, that, while in {{architecture}} you are continually {{called upon to}} do what may be unnecessary {{for the sake of}} beauty, you are never called upon to do what is inconvenient for the sake of beauty. You want the level window sill to lean upon, or to allow the window to open on a balcony: the eye and the common sense of the beholder require this necessity to be met before any laws of beauty are thought of. And besides this, there is in the sill no necessity for the pointed arch as a bearing form; on the contrary, it would give an idea of weak support for the sides of the window, and therefore is at once rejected. Only I beg of you particularly to observe that the level sill, although useful, and therefore admitted, does not therefore become beautiful; the eye does not like it so well as the top of the window, nor does the sculptor like to attract the eye to it; his richest moldings, traceries, and sculptures are all reserved for the top of the window; they are sparingly granted to its horizontal base. And farther, observe, that when neither the convenience of the sill, nor the support of the structure, are any more of moment, as in small windows and traceries, you instantly have the point given {{to the bottom of the}} window. Do you recollect the west window of your own Dunblane Abbey? If you look in any common guide-book, you will find it pointed out as peculiarly beautiful,--it is acknowledged to be beautiful by the most careless observer. And why beautiful? Look at it (fig. 7). Simply because in its great contours it has the form of a forest leaf, and because in its decoration it has used nothing but forest leaves. The sharp and expressive molding which surrounds it is a very interesting example of one used to an enormous extent by the builders of the early English Gothic, usually in the form seen in fig. 2, Plate II., composed of clusters of four sharp leaves each, originally produced by sculpturing the sides of a four-sided pyramid, and afterwards brought more or less into a true image of leaves, but deriving all its beauty from the botanical form. In the present instance only two leaves are set in each cluster; and the architect has been determined that the naturalism should be perfect. For he was no common man who designed that cathedral of Dunblane. I know not anything so perfect in its simplicity, and so beautiful, as far as it reaches, in all the Gothic with which I am acquainted. And just in proportion to his power of mind, that man was content to work under Nature's teaching; and instead of putting a merely formal <b>dogtooth,</b> as everybody else did at the time, he went down to the woody bank of the sweet river beneath the rocks on which he was building, and he took up a few of the fallen leaves that lay by it, and he set them in his arch, side by side, forever. And, look--that he might show you he had done this,--he has made them all of different sizes, just as they lay; and that you might not by any chance miss noticing the variety, he has put a great broad one at the top, and then a little one turned the wrong way, next to it, so that you must be blind indeed if you do not understand his meaning. And the healthy change and playfulness of this just does in the stone-work what it does on the tree boughs, and is a perpetual refreshment and invigoration; so that, however long you gaze at this simple ornament--and none can be simpler, a village mason could carve it all round the window in a few hours--you are never weary of it, it seems always new.|$|E
