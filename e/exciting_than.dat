5|$|In the TV sketch {{comedy series}} Rutland Weekend Television, {{there is a}} musical sketch that tells the tale of three US Navy sailors who plan to spend an exciting—"More <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> a book of Norman Mailer's"—and glamour-filled 24 hours in Royal Tunbridge Wells.|$|E
5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish {{near the bottom}} of the final standings, exceeded expectations, with the latter eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> any traditional sporting match he had ever seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which deserved the same level of respect of traditional sports.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Waterford faced Cork in the Munster {{championship}} for {{the fourth}} season in-a-row. Once again McCarthy's team conceded an early goal, however, the result was much tighter at the end. Cork won the day on a score line of 2–17 to 2–15 and confined Waterford to the qualifiers. McCarthy's side came through the qualifiers system successfully, however, the random draw for the All-Ireland quarter-finals meant that Waterford had to play Cork for a second time. The game was less <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> previous meetings with Cork winning by five points.|$|E

60|$|So {{he changed}} his skin then and there, and the Leopard was more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> ever; {{he had never seen}} a man change his skin before.|$|R
500|$|The {{discoveries of}} new poems by Sappho in 2004 and 2014 excited both {{scholarly}} and media attention. [...] The {{announcement of the}} Tithonus poem {{was the subject of}} international news coverage, and was described by Marylin Skinner as [...] "the trouvaille of a lifetime". [...] The publication in 2014 of the Brothers poem was described as [...] "more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> a new album by David Bowie" [...] by the Daily Telegraph.|$|E
500|$|Limp Bizkit {{will offer}} several concerts in UK during winter 2016 {{alongside}} Korn, {{two of the}} most prominent nu metal acts from 1990s. Regarding this nostalgic tour Fred says: [...] "You may have experienced a lot of cool concerts in your life, but I can guarantee you that an evening with Korn and Limp Bizkit will always and forever be your favourite. No one brings the party harder, heavier, and more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> us. No one. And… make sure you get plenty of rest the night before. It’s time to bring it back!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to their support of animal rights, the band has voiced their support for Democratic causes. During the 2004 United States presidential election, the band was part of Punkvoter, a political activist group, and appeared on the Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 compilation. The Rock Against Bush project raised over $1 million for then presidential candidate John Kerry. [...] During the 2008 presidential election, the band members endorsed Barack Obama. In a news bulletin in early 2009, the band stated: [...] "Few things are more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> watching Bush finally release America as his eight year hostage." ...|$|E

60|$|Then Bill and Joe, hardly less <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> {{their younger}} companions, resumed the {{interrupted}} labor, and the amateur prospectors went {{to tell the}} wonderful news to Mrs. Byram.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{best man}} was more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> Joe was," [...] said Susan. [...] "He wished Miranda many happy returns of the day. She {{did not look}} very happy, but perhaps you could not expect that under the circumstances." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Papa's Cabin", {{the final}} {{episode of the}} Dean O'Dell story arc, marks the final {{appearances}} of Fabian, Newman, and Jordan in their respective roles. Series creator Rob Thomas enjoyed Fabian and Jordan's performances in the episode, while filming of scenes on the ocean contained some production troubles. Upon its initial airing, the episode received 2.66 million viewers and mixed reviews from television critics; many considered this episode to be a solid conclusion to the story arc but one that was less <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> previous mystery-ending episodes. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club believed that the episode was intellectually satisfying, while Jon Lachonis of BuddyTV opined {{that the decision to}} make Tim the murderer was not appropriate.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics who {{agreed that it}} was more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> ButterFly. The production also received praise from critics. Commercially, the album peaked at number 12 on the United States, number 42 in Canada, and number 84 in Australia. It was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of 500,000 copies. [...] "My Father's Song" [...] and [...] "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" [...] were released as the album's two singles in August and November 1975, respectively. The former entered the Adult Contemporary charts in the United States and Canada while the latter was a success on two of Billboards dance charts in late 1975.|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} {{of the discovery of}} the Brothers Poem, along with fragments of eight other poems – the largest discovery of new material by Sappho in almost a century – was the subject of significant media attention. [...] James Romm, writing in The Daily Beast, called it [...] "a spectacular literary discovery", and Tom Payne in The Daily Telegraph said that it was [...] "more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> a new album by David Bowie". [...] Other commentators expressed concern about the provenance of the papyrus, with Douglas Boin in The New York Times criticising the failure to properly discuss the papyrus' provenance as [...] "disturbingly tone deaf to the legal and ethical issues".|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll follow him," [...] Guy exclaimed, {{growing more}} <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> ever, now this quarry was almost well within sight; [...] "I'll follow him till I find him, the confounded rascal. I'll follow {{him to his}} grave. He shan't get away from me." ...|$|R
60|$|High on {{the cliff}} wall {{appeared}} a small, round protuberance. It {{was of the}} unmistakably red color of the other tombs; and Wallace, more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> {{he had been in}} the cougar chase, said it was a sepulcher, and he believed it had never been opened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah cert'nly thought Ah {{heard the}} voice of an ol' friend from way down Souf! Ah cert'nly did!" [...] he muttered, and without another word he started off into the Green Forest, more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> he had been since his family came up from [...] "Ol' Virginny." ...|$|R
500|$|Movielines Stephanie Zacharek complimented the film's {{action and}} wrote that it [...] "defies all the current trends in {{mainstream}} action filmmaking. The driving sequences are shot and edited with a surgeon's clarity and precision. Refn doesn't chop up the action to fool us into thinking it's more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> it is." [...] She also admired Refn's skill in handling the film's violence, and the understated romance between Gosling and Mulligan. Her {{score for the}} film is 9.5/10. Drive was Roger Ebert's seventh best film of 2011. In praising the film, he wrote, [...] "Here is a movie with respect for writing, acting, and craft. It has respect for knowledgeable moviegoers." [...] Like Zacharek, Ebert admired the film's action sequences, which were practically made and did not rely on CGI effects.|$|E
500|$|The strip {{followed}} {{the structure of}} the football season, thus there were several months each year when the Rovers were not playing football, but the strip needed to depict something more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the players going on holiday and then reporting for pre-season training. As a result, the players tended to spend their summers involved in activities such as competing in charity cricket tournaments, but by far the most common summer storyline saw the Rovers go on tour to a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, normally South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. [...] "Melchester played more pre-season games at gunpoint deep in the jungle than they ever did in more mundane settings." [...] The summer would often also see Roy fending off lucrative offers to leave Melchester, as in 1978, when the Sheik of Basran, an oil-rich Middle-Eastern state, offered him £1million to coach the national team.|$|E
500|$|Two filmed {{scenes were}} {{cut from the}} final version of the episode. Both {{featured}} Tim Ransom as Scully's boyfriend Ethan Minette. In the first, Minette and Scully meet, with Scully cancelling plans for a holiday the two had arranged, due to her assignment to the Oregon case. The second scene briefly shows Scully answering a telephone call from Mulder whilst asleep in bed with Minette, though the latter has no dialogue. The addition of Scully's boyfriend was an attempt by the Fox executives to create the romantic interest that they felt was not there between Mulder and Scully. Chris Carter ultimately found that it was [...] "very easy" [...] to remove the character from the episode, both because his appearances seemed to slow down the scenes in which Mulder and Scully are together and due to the fact that Carter found Scully's relationship with her FBI partner to actually be more interesting and <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> her relationship with her boyfriend.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} excellent," [...] Guy said, [...] "and I am greatly obliged to you. Doubtless, too, they will soon make {{acquaintance}} {{with some of}} the other workmen, and by mixing with these there will be less suspicion <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> if they always went about together." ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Jim {{was more}} <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> ever when Owen Ford {{told him of}} his plan. At last his {{cherished}} dream was to be realized and his [...] "life-book" [...] given to the world. He was also pleased {{that the story of}} lost Margaret should be woven into it.|$|R
5000|$|Nick Hogan of TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing [...] "All in all, I very much enjoyed this episode and I'm more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> ever {{for the last}} few episodes. They're not pulling any punches and I can't wait to see where it leads." ...|$|R
500|$|Initial {{sales of}} the game were so low, Enix {{was going to lose}} money, but several Shonen Jump {{articles}} by Horii helped increase its sales substantially. People liked Toriyama's artwork and Sugiyama's music, which the book [...] said [...] "was richer and more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> any game music had ever sounded". The game was extremely popular in Japan and became {{the first in a series}} that in 2016 includes eleven games with several spin-off series and stand-alone titles. More than 2million copies were sold of the Japanese version. The Dragon QuestI&II remake for the SNES yielded 1.2million copies sold in Japan. The 1989 [...] "All Soft Catalog" [...] issue of Famicom Tsūshin (now Famitsu) included Dragon Quest in its list of the best games of all time, receiving the Best RPG and Best Character Design awards, but losing to Dragon Quest III for the overall Grand Prize for best game of all time.|$|E
500|$|Jando Dominique, {{reporting}} for Spectacle: An Online Journal of Circus Arts, summarized audience and critical reception for Circus Juventas's shows by describing them as [...] "always sold out and enthusiastically {{reviewed by the}} press." [...] Renee Valois cited {{the age of the}} performers and the proximity between them and the audience when she asked in a St. Paul Pioneer Press review of Oz comparing the circus school with Cirque du Soleil, [...] "Dare I say Circus Juventas is more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the troupe that inspired it?" [...] Writing for Minnesota Monthly, Amanda Bankston commended the technical skill and professionalism of the performers in 2012's Showdown: [...] "There is nothing child-like about the talent in this show. The budding stars fearlessly swing, flip, and soar through the air like pros." [...] In Spectacle, Dominique noted that Juventas's productions consistently have [...] "a polish and style not often seen in youth circuses, or most professional ones, for that matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin James of the Professional Wrestling Torch Newsletter {{praised the}} event, stating [...] "I would gladly have paid PPV money for this" [...] and [...] "if Raw had {{this kind of}} quality, I would gladly sign up for a three-hour show." [...] He also pointed out that there were no {{commercial}} breaks or dead time, making the event [...] "mighty close in total content to a three-hour Raw". James wrote that the [...] "announcing team was perfect tonight, no bickering, no fake feuds, no 'storytelling' for things outside the ring", especially [...] "in the opening match, where it was clear that they were completely invested in the match". He also wrote that Cesaro-Zayn was [...] "match of the year by a country mile", describing it as [...] "better, more emotionally intense, and more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> anything WWE has put on since their previous encounter". [...] "Some of the sequences in here had 5+ counters strung together" [...] and there was [...] "hard hitting action".|$|E
60|$|Till four in {{the morning}} the Applebys sat unmoving, awake and happy. When the train passed the row on row of apartment-houses that mean New York no youngster first seeing the {{infinitely}} possible city, and the future glory it must hold for him, was ever more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> the invading Innocents.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a dead}} silence. It was {{impossible}} that suspense could be strained to a higher pitch. The air and countenance of Sydney and Buckhurst were rather <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> mournful or alarmed. They needed no inquiries, for before they had penetrated the circle they had become aware of its cause.|$|R
60|$|If {{they had}} been {{inspired}} by the grape, {{nothing could be more}} animated and even <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> all their countenances suddenly became. The cheer might have been heard in the coffee-room, as they expressed, in the phrases of many languages, the never-failing and never-flagging enthusiasm invoked by the toast of their mistress.|$|R
500|$|Some {{analyses}} {{have examined}} the relationship between Marco and his father. Alison Lurie asserts that Marco's factual reply to his father {{at the end of the}} story says that [...] "it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults", a message that appears again in The Cat in the Hat. [...] To Matthew Pierlot, [...] "The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth", a Socrates-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> it is. [...] To Patrick Shannon, [...] "Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world". [...] In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of Maurice Sendak and William Steig; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.|$|E
500|$|After the film's initial release, {{critical}} reception {{continues to}} be positive. Film scholar Andy Klein wrote that the film is [...] "almost a distillation of [...] post-1986 work. Even if the plot is full of holes, and the emotional tug isn't quite as strong as in The Killer, the action sequences (nearly the whole movie) are among the greatest ever filmed". Mark Salisbury of Empire Magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "Infinitely more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> a dozen Die Hards, action cinema doesn't come any better than this." [...] Salisbury compared Hard Boiled to Woo's American films, stating that his Hong Kong films are [...] "not as slick as his later films, [...] more inventive and stylised and [...] great early performances from Fat and Leung". Empire placed the film at number 70 in their list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" [...] in 2010. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film the highest rating of four stars, proclaiming it {{to be one of}} Woo's best films. The British film magazine Empire ranked the character of Tequila as 33rd in their [...] "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" [...] poll.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{declared}} that [...] "Cheek to Cheek {{is a record}} where the music and even the songs take a backseat to the personalities". Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave the album a rating of two out of five stars. Camp criticized Bennett and Gaga's vocals in the album, adding that [...] "If not for the session musicians' top-notch work... much of Cheek to Cheek, which drags at an economical 45 minutes, would sound like glorified karaoke." [...] San Francisco Chronicle writer Aidin Vaziri was disappointed with Bennett and Gaga not [...] "highlight each other's wildly distinguishing features", adding that [...] "the background music is far more <b>exciting</b> <b>than</b> the people singing over it". Mikael Wood from Los Angeles Times complimented Gaga's vocals in the album but panned her [...] "cheap exploitation: {{of a bunch of}} important songs she brings nothing to; of an 88-year-old legend with whom she has zero chemistry; and, most disappointingly, of our eagerness to follow her down an unlikely creative path." [...] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015, Cheek to Cheek won a Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.|$|E
60|$|Polly {{would get}} even more <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> I did, and I {{remember}} that {{on one or two}} occasions of particularly hard races, she came home with her handkerchief and gloves literally torn into shreds, quite unconsciously to herself, in the excitement she felt in watching the varying chances of the boat Harry pulled in.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother {{spoke to}} me in the atrium just now, gracious mistress," [...] replied Blanca, who seemed scarce less <b>excited</b> <b>than</b> her mistress, [...] "he and Dion heard a thud in the night, which roused them from a brief sleep which they had snatched, for they were very tired ... their long hunt in the Amphitheatre...." ...|$|R
