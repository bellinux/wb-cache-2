50|$|The fan-forced <b>evaporator</b> <b>unit</b> in {{the display}} case was not {{properly}} secured, and thus was able to vibrate constantly while in operation; these vibrations were carried along the copper refrigant pipes, causing the pipes to rub against the electrical conduit in the wall soffit and make it vibrate too. Through a combination of galvanic corrosion (where the copper refrigerant pipes were in physical contact with the aluminum electrical conduit, causing the conduit to erode over time), and vibration - as well as jagged edges and stretched wires resulting from poor workmanship during the installation - the electrical wires inside the conduit ended up missing chunks of their plastic insulation, and the conduit was rendered un-grounded (there was no separate ground wire; the metal conduit itself was designed to function as the ground, so {{the disintegration of the}} conduit rendered the system un-grounded).|$|E
50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the <b>evaporator</b> <b>unit.</b> A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|E

40|$|During the {{concentration}} of sugarcane juice, there is continuous deposition of nonsugar impurities {{on the surface of}} <b>evaporator</b> <b>units.</b> Because the scale deposit has a low thermal conductivity, its accumulation impairs heat transfer and eventually renders the process uneconomical owing to reduced throughput. Calcium oxalate is the main intractable scale formed in factories that process sugarcane. It is not removed by conventional chemical cleaning methods. This paper describes studies on the apparent solubility product of calcium oxalate in the presence of sugar and calcium and magnesium ions at different temperatures and pH's. A solubility product model was obtained that states that the apparent solubility product of calcium oxalate decreases with increasing temperature and sugar concentration, but increases with increasing pH. The model was able to predict calcium oxalate solubility changes in raw sugarcane factory processes, indicating that the apparent solubility product of calcium oxalate declines rapidly through the evaporator set. The results also indicated that calcium oxalate solubility is increased in the presence of calcium and, in particular, magnesium ions...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the harmful}} {{environmental}} effects of HCFC’s (hydrochlorofluorocarbons) and CFC’s (chlorofluorocarbons) discovered in the late 20 th century, interest has increased for more environmentally-friendly refrigerant alternatives in cooling systems. One of the alternatives is carbon dioxide due to its unique properties, low cost, and low environmental impact compared to conventional refrigerants. The aim of this report is to study the use of CO 2 in a one-stage and two-stage heat pump cycle for transportation purposes using an existing HCFC-based heat pump modified to work with CO 2. Tests were conducted on this existing experimental CO 2 heat pump setup at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden in Borås, Sweden. A model was developed with MatLab software primarily for the two-stage compression configuration, {{and the results of}} the model were validated against measurements conducted with the experimental setup. Overall, the measurement and model results showed that the gas cooler unit is over-dimensioned and modifications in future systems could be considered. It was found that the air side within each heat exchanger limits the heat transfer in the existing setup due to the ratio of outside to inside surface area and the low air heat transfer coefficient. Measurements results also indicate that there is significant uneven distribution {{at the entrance to the}} <b>evaporator</b> <b>unit.</b> This creates uncertainty when modelling as it is too complicated with the existing measurements and equipment to model anything other than perfect distribution at the inlet to the <b>evaporator</b> <b>unit.</b> Results also indicate that the 2 nd stage compressor operates at a much lower efficiency than expected by manufacturer and theoretical data. Tests on compressor operating speed changes showed significant system performance improvements when decreasing the 2 nd stage compressor speed from the manufacturer suggested value.

40|$|The {{morphology}} and valence-band {{electronic structure}} of single-crystalline 3 s-, 3 d-, 4 d- and 5 d-metal layers on the (110) faces of tungsten and molybdenum were {{studied in the}} thickness range below 50 monolayers. The thin-film samples, prepared by means of molecular beam epitaxy using specially developed <b>evaporator</b> <b>units</b> and sample holders in ultra-high vacuum conditions, were studied systematically and comparatively. This investigation was carried out both structurally, by electron diffraction (LEED), and electronically, by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). Despite the chemical and crystallographic similarities of the noble metals copper, silver and gold, thin-film growth reveals substantial differences between them. All of these metals form hexagonal surface lattices on the rectangular substrate surface structure, but whereas Cu(111) and Mg(0001) form single-domain single-crystalline films, silver grows pseudomorphically in the first layers and then relaxes into the two-domain Kurdjumov-Sachs geometry. In the case of gold, optimized preparation conditions {{can be used to}} switch between the two structures while, at the same time, the well-known herringbone reconstruction can be generated or prevented as chosen. The electronic surface band structure of these systems is analyzed in detail using synchrotron radiation and radiation from a laboratory He-plasma source. The valence band structure is characterized by a large number of two-dimensional electronic states and is subject to pronounced layer-thickness dependent quantization of the sp- and d-bands along the crystal momentum perpendicular to the surface, which leads to a series of quantum-well states. Their parabolic dispersion can be observed not only within, but also outside the projected band gap of the substrate, where they undergo strong interactions with the substrate's electronic bands. The thickness dependence was described in the framework of a modified phase-accumulation model that explicitly implements hybridization with substrate bands. In ultra-thin films of less than five monolayers, as the film thickness decreases, the substrate's influence on the electronic band structure of the film increasingly dominates. In this investigation, a dual comparison is undertaken: first, between the intrinsic results for the metals Mg, Cu, Ag and Au, and second, between the results obtained using the two substrates of choice, which possess different LS-coupling strengths. On this basis, a detailed study is presented of parity effects, the formation of hybridization band gaps, and surface-induced Rashba splitting in the quantum-well and surface states.

40|$|To sustain an {{efficient}} {{operation of the}} black liquor evaporation plant, extensive cleaning is often needed to remove water soluble scales that are rapidly formed on the heat transfer surfaces {{in the part of}} the plant with the highest concentrations. The soluble scales consist of sodium carbonate – sodium sulfate crystals and are normally formed at concentrations above ca 50 % dry solids content (DS). To have {{an efficient}} cleaning, the cleaning time should be sufficient to dissolve all scales, and, at the same time, be as short as possible to minimize disturbances and down time. Today, however, very little fundamental knowledge exists about how to efficiently remove scales and the cleaning process is based on trial and error. In this paper, cleaning of industrial falling film evaporators was evaluated using a modelling approach. The cleaning performance using black liquor as wash liquid was evaluated for the whole range of DS, from 0 % (i. e. condensate) to 45 %. It was found that the feed rate of wash liquid and evaporation rate were the two most important parameters for the cleaning time, while sump volume and recirculation flow rate were less important.

In this model, both surface finish and optical view factors are taken into consideration in the computation of solar radiation that effectively reaches the surface of saline water in the distillation system. The model was applied to a conventional solar still and an advanced solar still with. separate condenser. The conventional solar still was tested at New Delhi (28 o 35 ¢ N, 77 o 12 ¢ E) in previous work while the advanced distillation system was developed in this investigation and it comprised three basins with saline water.

The problem of rational distribution of heat transfer agent for of the corps multiple-evaporator is relevant from point of view of energy saving and energysaving heat of the sugar factory. The solution to this problem is advantageously carried out on the basis of quantitative mathematical description of the distribution of vapor on the corps of the evaporation plant. The heat consumers distribution should be based on technical and economic calculation. To solve this problem it is advisable to use a single equation that determines the dependence of the steam flow in the first <b>unit</b> <b>evaporator</b> on the amount of evaporated water and the method of heat consumers distribution for housing.

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, there was a wide scale gross in using {{seawater}} desalination in Egypt to solve water shortage problem in the remote areas. Most of these units {{are located in the}} touristic sits and in some military and industrial locations. The cost of water produced by seawater desalination is the main factor affecting the usage of desalination technology, not only in Egypt but also in many other countries with limited resources of water. Research and development programs to improve desalination technology were carried out to enhance the performance of the desalination plants and reducing its cost in order to attain minimum water cost produced. As the demand for desalted water is usually associated with a similar demand for electricity in arid regions, dual purpose plants are built to provide electricity for direct consumption and process steam which is used as an energy source to the desalination plants that convert seawater into fresh water.

40|$|The {{performance}} of membrane heat exchangers for HVAC total energy recovery systems was evaluated through experimentation and detailed system modelling. The operating {{principle of the}} membrane heat exchanger (enthalpy heat exchanger) is based on passing ambient hot and humid supply air over {{one side of a}} porous membrane heat exchanger surface and cold and less humid room exhaust air {{on the other side of}} the transfer surface. Due to the gradient in temperature and vapour pressure, both heat and moisture are transferred across the membrane surface causing a decrease in temperature and humidity of the supply air before it enters the <b>evaporator</b> <b>unit</b> of the conventional air conditioner. Hence both sensible and latent energy are recovered. In this study, both experimental and numerical investigations were undertaken and mathematical models were developed to predict the {{performance of}} the latent heat recovery heat exchangers for use with conventional air conditioning systems. The membrane moisture transfer resistance was determined by a laboratory-scale permeability measurements. It was found that the membrane heat exchanger performance is significantly influenced by the heat exchanger flow profile and shape, heat and moisture transfer material characteristics, air velocity and air moisture content. Improvement of membrane heat exchanger performance requires an in depth study on flow, temperature and moisture distribution in the heat exchanger flow paths. Thus, a commercial CFD package FLUENT is used to model the membrane heat exchanger. However, software of this type cannot model moisture diffusion through the porous transfer boundary. Therefore, two user defined function codes have been introduced to model the moisture transfer in latent energy heat exchangers. The annual energy consumption of an air conditioner coupled with a membrane heat exchanger is also studied and compared with a conventional air conditioning cycle using the HPRate software. Energy analysis shows that in hot and humid climates where the latent load is high, an air conditioning system coupled with a membrane heat exchanger consumes less energy than a conventional air conditioning system. The membrane heat exchanger dehumidifies the air before it enters the air conditioning system, resulting in a decrease in energy consumption in comparison with conventional air conditioning system...|$|E

The Tetra Pak A 6 is a complete sterilisation, filling and packaging machine for the Tetra Evero Aseptic carton bottle. The package is specially designed for ambient white milk. It is developed to be more user friendly than old fashion prism shaped packages due to the easier handling and reclosing feature and more environmental friendly than plastic bottles due to the separable carton body and plastic top. A spray nozzle in the evaporator injects a high-speed liquid mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide that is evaporated, swirled down into the carton bottle and used as aseptic treatment of the inside of the package before the vapor mixture is vented out and the package is filled with beverage. The behaviour of the multicomponent spray was numerically modeled using unsteady RANS and Lagrangian tracking of representative computational parcels of spray droplets. The simulations were performed using STAR-CCM+, a software package for computational fluid dynamic simulations. To break down the complex fluid dynamic problem in the high-speed spray nozzle and be able to isolate and study important physical phenomenon, two different case studies with simplified geometries were performed. The first case study was a parameter and sensitivity analysis of the behaviour of a general evaporating spray in a small cubical domain. The injector is a solid cone injector originating from a single point. Responses such as penetration length, spray width, evaporated mass for the species, diameter- and velocity distributions were studied for varying spray parameters and solver settings. The second case study originates from an experimental and numerical study of wall impingement of diesel spray in an open channel with cross flow [3]. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effect of droplet-droplet collisions, wall interaction and fluid film. The conclusions from the case studies were applied to spray simulations of the nozzle and evaporator in the Tetra Pak A 6. Comparison with experimental droplet velocities and diameters from laser measurements showed acceptable conformity. The ambition is that the results from the aforementioned studies could be used for sprays in other industrial applications such as diesel or urea spray in the automotive industry since these applications use the same models for simulating spray behaviour...|$|E

The evaporators of two types were used for testing, designed to have the same volumetric size with a baseline unit. Results of the cooling capacity tests are similar under on/off and continuous running conditions. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Generated {{leachate}} in landfills {{is often}} {{as a result of}} the infiltration of rain, surface or running water into waste bodies. Numerous studies have revealed the potential impacts of leachate escape from landfill disposal facilities on human and environmental health. Although much is been done in most landfills in South Africa to ensure minimal leachate escape into immediate soil, surface and groundwater reserves, much more is still required. As such, the option of leachate treatment is gradually been explored. The potential efficiency and energy usage of a landfill waste water treatment plant (WWTP) for a simple leachate treatment process is explored. The WWTP process involves the basic treatment of the leachate with subsequent sequencing batch reactors (SBR), reverse osmosis unit (RO) and evaporation for additional concentration of RO yield. The process efficiency is appraised by conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (BOD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total nitrogen (TN) measurements. Energy usage is estimated by electrical input power, motor efficiency of power-consuming units and functional hours. 2. 2 % of the of the WWTP total operational real power consumption is gotten for the primary treatment process with 16. 7 % corresponding SBR operation and 13. 2 % RO <b>unit.</b> 2 <b>unit</b> <b>evaporators</b> consumes 61. 5 % and 0. 78 % for leachate recirculation to landfill from the total energy usage. Therefore, RO is taken as the most efficient leachate treatment process as it can dispense substantial amounts of water from the landfill leachate pond whereas, the evaporators are energy demanding...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for obtaining triterpene extracts and betulin from pelletized birch bark (fraction 0. 4 - 2. 0 mm), extracting with petroleum ether (PE 140) (boiling temperature range 100 - 140 ºC) at a boiling temperature was developed. In the extraction unit, {{the process was}} carried out in a flowing through type reactor in the flow of distilled solvent in the intensive mass exchange regime. The change in the solubility of betulin and other triterpenes of outer birch bark (OBB) in PE 140 at varying temperature was used to realise the process. During the process, betulin in the purified crystal form precipitates in the intermediate crystalliser making up 40 ‒ 50 % of the total amount of extractives, with the total betulin, lupeol concentration of 90 ‒ 93 wt. % o. d. crystals. Decreasing the temperature of the solution remaining in the <b>unit’s</b> <b>evaporator,</b> betulin – lupeol crystals with slightly decreased content of betulin, but increased content of lupeol settle. The intensive mass exchange extraction unit can be used also for OBB extraction with polar solvents (alcohols, acetone). The extraction time of pelletized (0. 4 ‒ 2. 0 mm) OBB in polar solvents did not exceed 3 ‒ 5 h. However, the action of the intermediate crystalliser was less efficient, therefore required cooling jacket temperature should be lower than 10 ºC. The mother liquor, remaining after isolation of triterpenes from the extract, was collected in the evaporator. It contained about 38 ‒ 40 % of lupeol (wt. % o. d. mother liquor extractives) and can be used for obtaining of pure lupeol...|$|R
