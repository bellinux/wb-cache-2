50|$|Sonnenberg {{had such}} an air of persuasion and success about him that <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> would pay a fee just {{to talk with him}} on the phone. He loved showing off his extravagance with <b>his</b> <b>clients</b> through {{entertaining}} and gift giving. Sonnenberg gained mass success and affluence because he was dedicated to following through on his promises to <b>his</b> <b>clients,</b> and because of this his reputation grew by word of mouth.|$|R

5|$|Lee Woods {{was tried}} twice, {{after his first}} trial ended in a mistrial due to a juror in her 20s falling ill. Wood's attorney, Samuel J.

5|$|Lincoln rarely raised {{objections}} in the courtroom; {{but in an}} 1859 case, {{where he}} defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, {{who was accused of}} stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to <b>his</b> <b>client.</b> Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.|$|E

5|$|On 20 January 1999, Jeyaretnam {{wrote to}} President Ong Teng Cheong {{requesting}} the reference of another constitutional {{question to the}} Tribunal. This was made on behalf of <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> opposition politician Chee Soon Juan, who had been charged for giving a public talk on 20 December 1999 without a licence under the Public Entertainments Act. The question involved {{the constitutionality of the}} Act. Jeyaretnam argued that the Act violated Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, which enshrines freedom of speech and assembly.|$|E
5|$|The {{resultant}} Cleveland Street scandal implicated other high-ranking {{figures in}} British society, and rumours swept upper-class London of {{the involvement of}} a member of the royal family, namely Prince Albert Victor. The prostitutes had not named Albert Victor, and it is suggested that Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, fabricated and spread the rumours to take the heat off <b>his</b> <b>client.</b> Letters exchanged between the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Augustus Stephenson, and his assistant, Hamilton Cuffe, make coded reference to Newton's threats to implicate Albert Victor.|$|E
5|$|When casting for {{the role}} of Dorothy, Warner Bros. {{declined}} to audition any actresses younger than the age of 30; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced the studio to audition <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> who was only 22 at the time.

On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually <b>his</b> <b>client.</b> In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to <b>his</b> <b>client.</b> The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's yearly {{income from}} the {{endorsements}} {{is estimated to be}} over forty million dollars. In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.

An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of <b>his</b> <b>client</b> firms of more than $1billion.|$|E

5|$|Some of the temple's {{supplies}} {{came from}} direct donations by the king. In the New Kingdom, when Egypt was an imperial power, these donations often {{came out of}} the spoils of the king's military campaigns or the tribute given by <b>his</b> <b>client</b> states. The king might also levy various taxes that went directly to support a temple. Other revenue came from private individuals, who offered land, slaves, or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services to sustain their spirits in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Sven-Göran Eriksson {{took over}} from Pearce for the 2007–08 season and, {{following}} a spending spree, Samaras was reportedly deemed surplus to requirements {{by the new}} manager. Samaras' agent Paul Koutsoliakos said that, despite interest from across Europe, <b>his</b> <b>client</b> {{wanted to stay in}} the Premier League and prove his ability. Samaras was linked with a £2.5million move to Middlesbrough {{towards the end of the}} transfer window but ended up staying at City. Eriksson stated that although he was unimpressed with Samaras when he first joined, he felt the player had improved and adapted his style of play a lot during pre-season and that he now felt comfortable keeping him at the club.|$|E
5|$|The land, sited at two {{sharp bends}} in the McCloud River, was named by {{financial}} adviser Edward Clark {{for the local}} Native American tribe of the Wintun people. Beginning as a humble fishing resort, the land was improved {{by a series of}} people, notably San Francisco attorney Charles Stetson Wheeler, <b>his</b> <b>client</b> Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and her son William Randolph Hearst who disputed with his cousin over ownership. Prominent structures, noted for their architecture, have been built on the land, some lost to fire, while other multimillion-dollar buildings were planned, but not built. Famous visitors to Wyntoon include Clark Gable, Charles Lindbergh, Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and his son John F. Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his agent}} Milan Ćalasan's insistence that <b>his</b> <b>client</b> {{would not be}} playing in the lower divisions, Žigić {{underwent}} groin surgery in the close season and resumed his Birmingham career in September. He told the Mail {{that he would be}} happy to stay and that any move would depend on the club, which was in increasing financial difficulty, wanting to sell. His first Championship goal gave Birmingham a 1–0 win against Leeds United. Early in the Europa League group match at Braga, Birmingham were awarded a penalty. In the absence of regular penalty-taker Marlon King, Žigić took on the responsibility. His attempt was saved, Braga won the match 1–0, and Birmingham finished the group one point behind them and Club Brugge so failed to qualify for the knockout rounds. Away to Leeds, Žigić scored all four in a 4–1 win, and he finished the season with eleven in the league and one in the play-off semi-final as Birmingham lost on aggregate to Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{controversy}} and celebrity surrounding the case, the judicial duel between Carrouges and Le Gris {{was the last}} ever permitted by the French government and as such a well attended and infamous event, it soon attracted near-legendary status. In France {{the memory of the}} duel far outlasted its participants, primarily a result of it being recorded soon after by the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart. Over the following century, vivid and imaginative accounts were carried in the chronicles of Jean Juvénal des Ursins and the Grandes Chroniques de France as well as by Jehan de Waurin and others, many embellishing the story with imaginative twists. The factual details of the case are unusually well recorded for a medieval trial as the records of the Parlement de Paris have survived intact and Jacques Le Gris' lawyer Jean Le Coq kept meticulous notes on the case which still exist. In addition to a clear view of proceedings these notes also contain Le Coq's own concerns about <b>his</b> <b>client,</b> whose innocence Le Coq deemed highly suspect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that <b>his</b> <b>client</b> had gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
