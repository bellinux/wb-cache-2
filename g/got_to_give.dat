5|$|Monroe {{completed}} 29 {{films in}} her career. In 1962 she was filming her thirtieth film, Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give,</b> {{when she was}} fired by the studio; she died before it was completed {{with others in the}} role.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in Some Like It Hot (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> in June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Fox soon regretted its decision, and re-opened {{negotiations}} with Monroe later in June; a settlement {{about a new}} contract, including re-commencing Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> and a starring role in the black comedy What a Way to Go! (1964), was reached later that summer. To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for Life and Cosmopolitan and her first photo shoot for Vogue. For Vogue, she and photographer Bert Stern collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were both later published posthumously with the title The Last Sitting. In the last weeks of her life, she was also planning on starring in a biopic of Jean Harlow.|$|E

5|$|Monroe next filmed a {{scene for}} Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> {{in which she}} swam naked in a {{swimming}} pool. To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in Life; {{this was the first}} time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

[...] She also said, [...] "Plies makes a nice addition to the already sexified track, as the self-proclaimed goon drops a raunchy verse in his raspy Southern drawl."

[...] Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said that the}} song was [...] "is not only the album's first official single," [...] but [...] "also a declaration." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "In the song, Usher's basically sending a message to his female fans that the Usher they knew and loved is back in their lives and that they don't need to stray any more: [...] "You know your daddy's home, and it's time to play, so you ain't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> my lovin' away."

500|$|Bure was {{selected}} 113th {{overall in the}} sixth round Draft by the Vancouver Canucks, following his rookie season with CSKA Moscow. The pick was controversial, as the Canucks had chosen him seemingly a year ahead of his eligible draft season. At the age of 18, he was available to be chosen {{in the first three}} rounds of the draft, but to be selected any later, he would have needed to play at least two seasons—with a minimum of 11 games per season—for his elite-level Soviet club, the Central Red Army. While most teams believed he was ineligible, the Canucks' head scout at the time, Mike Penny, discovered Bure had played in additional exhibition and international games to make him an eligible late-round draft choice a year early. Jack Button, the Washington Capitals' director of player personnel, admitted [...] "everybody would have taken him earlier. We assumed he was not eligible... you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Canucks credit for doing their homework." ...|$|E
500|$|Monroe {{returned}} to the public eye in spring 1962: she received a [...] "World Film Favorite" [...] Golden Globe award and began to shoot a new film for 20th Century-Fox, Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give,</b> a re-make of My Favorite Wife (1940). It was to be co-produced by MMP, directed by George Cukor and to co-star Dean Martin and Cyd Charisse. Days before filming began, Monroe caught sinusitis; despite medical advice to postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April. Monroe was too ill {{to work for the}} majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to put pressure on her by alleging publicly that she was faking it. On May 19, she took a break to sing [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] on stage at President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration (ten days before his actual birthday) at Madison Square Garden in New York. She drew attention with her costume: a beige, skintight dress covered in rhinestones, which made her appear nude. Monroe's trip to New York caused even more irritation for Fox executives, who had wanted her to cancel it.|$|E

500|$|Songwriter Stephen Schwartz had {{originally}} been slated to write both the music and lyrics for Mulan until he ultimately left the project to write songs for rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998) instead after Disney executives forced him {{to choose between the}} two. Schwartz had completed only two songs for Mulan before his resignation, one of which was entitled [...] "China Doll" [...] which, according to Schwartz, [...] "more or less corresponds to the scene in the film in which Mulan goes to the Matchmaker". Schwartz was eventually replaced with composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who wrote [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] with which to replace Schwartz's [...] "China Doll". Disney cast American singer and actress Marni Nixon, one of Hollywood's most prolific playback singers, as the singing voice of Grandmother Fa, Mulan's paternal grandmother. Nixon received the sheet music for [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] to review prior to auditioning for the role. The filmmakers then showed Nixon a drawing of the character, by whose comedic appearance the singer was immediately [...] "enchanted", telling herself [...] "you've just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her a voice... or, in this case, an unvoice." [...] Improvising her performance, Nixon decided to make the character sound as though she was merely attempting to sing as opposed to actually singing, keeping in mind that the elderly character is toothless. Nixon also made no effort to sound like the actress who had been cast as Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time, determining that the two performers sound nothing alike upon listening to the actress' recording. Nixon had almost reconsidered auditioning for the role upon realizing how different she sounded from Grandmother Fa's speaking voice actress.|$|E
500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was so happy to work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - did you see it? And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely {{did a very good job}} in the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005. Aside from the video's script, Carey channeled Marilyn Monroe, one of her icons growing up. During a pool scene, Carey re-enacts a part from Monroe's film Something's <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Give</b> (1962). In an interview with MTV News, Carey spoke of the re-enactment: ...|$|E

Are you going to tell a male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E
