40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a diploid species {{including}} both dioecious and monoecious cultivars with hetero- and homomorphic sex chromosomes, respectively. It displays a high plasticity of sex expression, i. e., {{the ratio of}} female and male flowers. In this study, we investigated the role of sex chromosomes in the genetic determinism of sex expression in dioecious and monoecious hemp. The experimental materials were three F 1 segregating populations, two dioecious (C 1 and C 2 : ‘Carmagnola’ ♀ × ‘Carmagnola’ ♂), and one monoecious (UF: ‘Uso 31 ’ × ‘Fedora 17 ’). A ‘sex’ phenotypic marker was mapped in C 1 and C 2. In total, 23, 42, and 26 AFLP markers (71 markers in total) were mapped to three, nine, and three co-segregation groups putatively located on sex chromosomes in C 1, C 2, and UF, respectively. Recombination rates with sex ranged from 0 to 0. 5. Five sex-linked markers were detected in UF, revealing homologies between the X chromosomes of monoecious hemp and the X and Y chromosomes of <b>dioecious</b> <b>hemp.</b> Five QTLs associated with quantitative variations in sex expression were identified in each map. Four markers associated with variations in sex expression in UF segregated with sex or accounted for a putative QTL in C 1 or C 2. Two QTLs and three of these markers were mapped in UF in a region homologous to the sex-locus region of the dioecious maps. Given these results, conducting further research on the genetic determinism of sex expression in hemp using a quantitative approach appears relevant...|$|E
40|$|The sex {{expression}} {{is a major}} concern for the genetic improvement of hemp. Although naturally dioecious and bearing heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the species displays a highly variable sexual phenotype. The monoecious cultivars allow the mechanical harvest of both stem and seed; however, their seed production requires a strict control of the sex expression. This thesis investigated the genetic determinism of sex expression in monoecious hemp and established its relationship with flowering phenology and stem and seed yields. The existence of genotypic variability for the sex expression in monoecious hemp was evidenced despite the high environmental sensitivity of the trait. Sex expression and earliness varied mostly consistently among cultivars. Higher seed yields were associated with (mid-) early feminised cultivars. Monoecious hemp was demonstrated to bear XX chromosomes, which showed homologies with both the X and Y ones of <b>dioecious</b> <b>hemp.</b> Three F 1 segregating populations were created, and genetic maps were constructed. The distribution of male and female flowers in monoecious plants was modelled. A relatively high number of genomic regions (QTLs) showed variation associated with the model parameters. Some of them were likely located on the sex chromosomes. Closely linked QTLs for sex expression, earliness and yields were found. Their putative implications for breeding were discussed. In conclusion, the present quantitative approach successfully provided fundamental insights to improve our understanding of the genetic determinism of sex expression in monoecious hemp and to support its cultivation for a dual production.

40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) has {{a highly}} {{variable}} sexual phenotype. In <b>dioecious</b> <b>hemp,</b> the sex {{is controlled by}} heteromorphic sex chromosomes according to an X-to-autosomes equilibrium. However, in monoecious hemp, the sex determinism remains widely unknown {{and has never been}} related to a quantitative approach of sex expression. The present paper aims to contribute to the comprehension of the sex determinism in monoecious hemp by assessing the genotypic variability of its sex expression and establishing its sex chromosomes. Five monoecious and one dioecious cultivars were grown in controlled conditions under several photoperiods. The monoecy degree of 194 monoecious plants was recorded at each node by a figure ranging from 0 (male flowers only) to 6 (female flowers only). The genome size of 55 plants was determined by flow cytometry. The DNA of 115 monoecious plants was screened with the male-associated marker MADC 2. The monoecy degree varied significantly among monoecious cultivars from 3. 36  ±  2. 28 in 'Uso 31 ' to 5. 70  ±  0. 81 in the most feminised 'Epsilon 68 '. The variation of monoecy degree among cultivars remained consistent across trials despite a significant "cultivar × trial" interaction and partly agreed with their earliness. The genome size of monoecious plants (1. 791  ±  0. 017  pg) was not different from that of females (1. 789  ±  0. 019  pg) but significantly lower than that of males (1. 835  ±  0. 019  pg). MADC 2 was absent from all monoecious plants. These results strongly support that cultivars of monoecious hemp have the XX constitution and that their sex expression has a genetic basis. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The study aims to {{determine}} the nutritional value of hemp seed expressed by the oil content and by the concentration of metals (Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cd), for five varieties of monoecious and <b>dioecious</b> <b>hemp</b> seeds approved in Romania, comparative with the concentration of these metals in the soil. Results The content of oil in hempseed registers a slight decrease in the production records of 2011, losses due to drought {{and low levels of}} precipitation during the growth period. The greatest loss is found in Diana monoecious variety (26. 54 - 20. 82 %) followed by Zenit varieties (27. 37 - 22. 97 %), Armanca (29. 27 - 25. 32 %), Silvana (28. 89 - 25. 04 %) and Denise (26. 96 - 25. 30 %). Siccative hemp oil has a yellowish green color and an iodine index of 140 – 156 g I 2 / 100 g oil. Hemp seed are rich in mineral based Ca (144 – 955 mg/ 100 g seed), Mg (237 – 694 mg/ 100 g seed), K (463 – 2821 mg/ 100 g seed), Fe (1133 - 2400 mg. kg - 1), Mn (63 – 110 mg. kg - 1) and Zn (42 - 94 mg. kg - 1). For the soil the following macroelements concentrations were determined: Ca (2100 – 2520 mg. kg - 1), Mg (320 – 376 mg. kg - 1) and K (232 – 257 mg. kg - 1). Mn (156 – 197 mg. kg - 1) and Zn (54 – 67 mg. kg - 1) remain within normal limits for Romania. The soils in the experience area contain large amounts of Fe (19000 – 20430 mg. kg - 1). The presence of K in large quantities determines the accumulation of large quantities of Fe in the soil. Conclusion Hempseed belonging to the five Romanian varieties are rich source of nutrients (Ca, Mg, K) and unsaturated oil easily digestible by the body, but the presence of Cd concentrations above the upper limit puts a question mark over the use of seeds in various food products. Hemp extracts easily certain metals from the soil. Significant amounts of Fe (1133 – 2400 mg. kg - 1), Mn (63 – 110 mg. kg - 1), Zn (42 – 94 mg. kg - 1) and Cd (1. 3 - 4. 0 mg. kg - 1) are found in hemp seeds. Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is included among plants suitable for phytoremediation of soil contaminated with cadmium, zinc and iron. </p...|$|E
