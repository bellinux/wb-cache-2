5|$|The {{end result}} of the air {{campaign}} against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to <b>ever</b> <b>increasing</b> military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe.

However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had even begun.
