40|$|From the histochemical {{study on}} the {{vascular}} distribution of limb muscles of cats and rats, the following results were obtained. 1. The red, white and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers</b> of the soleus and gastrocnemius individually present dissimilar patterns of the vascular distribution. In the transverse section of the muscle, most of the capillaries are found preferentially assembled around the small red fiber. Usually the red fibers are supplied with 4 - 6 capillaries, while the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers</b> 3 - 4 capillaries and the white 1 - 2 capillaries. 2. In the longitudinal section, the capillaries run parallel with the muscle fiber. Occasionally, these capillaries branching out for anastomoses cross the fiber almost at right angle. These anastomoses are more frequently observed on the red fibers. 3. The soleus muscle is better supplied with capillaries than is the gastrocnemius, because this muscle is composed only of two types of capillary rich fibers, namely, the red and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers.</b> 4.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} hydrodynamically induced textile {{deformation}} during resin injection in Liquid Composites Molding processes have been experimentally investigated for various fiber volume fractions in a rectangular flow channel with linear injection gate. For layups from bi-directional 45 engineered glass fiber fabric, three deformation effects have been identified: Wrinkling of the topmost fabric layer for low fiber volume fractions, instantaneous in-plane compression of the layup during fiber wetting for <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> volume fractions, delayed in-plane compression of the wetted {{part of the}} fabric for high fiber volume fractions. The deformation behavior is determined by the fabric stiffness and the fixation in the flow channel due to clamping. The fabric has been experimentally characterized with respect to compressibility and coefficient of static friction {{in order to understand the}} clamping effect. The injection pressure, which is critical for deformation, has been determined as function of the fiber volume fraction, i. e. as function of the clamping pressure. The characteristics of the function have been correlated with the three observed deformation effects. A simple mechanical model for description of layup displacement and compression, implying visco-elastic behavior of the fabric and clamping with friction on the flow channel walls for various impregnation states, is presented.

40|$|Distinct ultrastructural {{differences}} exist at the neuromuscular junctions of red, white, and intermediate fibers of a mammalian twitch skeletal muscle (albino rat diaphragm). The primary criteria for recognizing the three fiber types {{are differences in}} fiber diameter, mitochondria) content, and width of the Z line. In the red fiber the neuromuscular relationship presents the least sarcoplasmic and axoplasmic surface at each contact. Points of contact are relatively discrete and separate, and axonal terminals are small and elliptical. The junctional folds are relatively shallow, sparse, and irregular in arrangement. Axoplasmic vesicles are moderate in number, and sarcoplasmic vesicles are sparse. In the white fiber long, flat axonal terminals present considerable axoplasmic surface. Vast sarcoplasmic surface area is created by long, branching, closely spaced junctional folds that may merge with folds at adjacent contacts to occupy a more continuous and widespread area. Axoplasmic and sarcoplasmic vesicles are numerous. Both axoplasmic and sarcoplasmic mitochondria of the white fiber usually contain intramitochondrial granules. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> has large axonal terminals {{that are associated with}} the most widely spaced and deepest junctional folds.

Rodent vibrissa follicles have regular, predictable, and relatively short growth cycles. In this investigation, we took advantage of these properties; we classified mouse vibrissa follicles according to different phases in the hair cycle and then compared fiber growth and morphologic changes in culture. Follicles isolated in the early phase of the growth cycle produced fine growing fibers with an average growth that exceeded 3 mm over 15 d. Even when hair growth had slowed or halted subsequently, histology showed that these follicles retained an anagen-like morphology. By contrast, follicles isolated {{toward the end of}} the growing cycle produced thicker fibers for much shorter periods, after which growth ceased and the fibers lifted up from the base of the follicle. Internally, these specimens resembled their telogen counterparts in situ. Follicles isolated in mid-growth demonstrated <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> growth characteristics. In organ culture, mouse vibrissa follicles therefore closely reflect theft in vivo origin in growth characteristics and cycle timing.

Skeletal muscle comprises different ﬁber types {{that can be}} broadly classified as red, intermediate, and white. Recently, a set of miRNAs was found expressed in a fiber type-specific manner in red and white fiber types. However, an in-depth analysis of the miRNA transcriptome differences between all three fiber types has not been undertaken. Herein, we collected 15 porcine skeletal muscles from different anatomical locations, which were then clearly divided into red, white, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> type based on the ratios of myosin heavy chain isoforms. We further illustrated that three muscles, which typically represented each muscle fiber type (i. e., red: peroneal longus (PL), intermediate: psoas major muscle (PMM), white: longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM)), have distinct metabolic patterns of mitochondrial and glycolytic enzyme levels. Furthermore, we constructed small RNA libraries for PL, PMM, and LDM using a deep sequencing approach.

40|$|An immunocytochemical {{approach}} {{was used to}} localize myosin with respect to individual fibers in rat skeletal muscle. Transverse cryostat sections of rat diaphragm, a fast-twitch muscle, were exposed to fluorescein-labeled immunoglobulin against purified chicken pectoralis myosin. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a differential response among fiber types, identified {{on the basis of}} mitochondrial content. All white and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> but only about half of the red fiber reacted with his antimyosin. In addition, an alkali-stable ATPase had the same pattern of distribution among fibers, which is consistent with the existence of two categories of red fibers. The positive response of certain red fibers indicates either that their myosin has antigenic determinants in common with "white" myosin, or that the immunogen contained a "red" myosin. Myosin, extracted from a small region of the pectorlis which consists entirely of white fibers, was used to prepare an immunoadsorbent column to isolate antibodies specific for white myosin. This purified anti-white myosin reacted with the same fibers of the rat diaphragm that had reacted with the white, intermediate, and some red fibers are sufficiently homologous to share antigenic determinants. In a slow-twitch muscle, the soleus, only a minority of the fiber reacted with antipectoralis myosin. The majority failed to respond; hence, they are not equivalent to intermediate fibers of the diaphragm; despite their intermediate mitochondrial content. Immunocytochemical analysis of two different musles of the rat has demonstrated that more than one isoenzyme of myosin can exist in a single muscle, and that individual fiber types can be recognized by immunological differences in their myosin. We conclude that, in the rat diaphragm, {{there are at least two}} immunochemically distinct types of myosin and four types of muscle fibers: white, intermediate, and two red. We suggest that these fibers correspond to the four types of motor units described by Burke et al. (Burke, R. E., D. N. Levine, P. Tsairis, and F. E. Zajac, III 1973. J. Physiol.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryBradley J. JohnsonZilpaterol {{hydrochloride}} (ZH) is {{a growth}} promotant that is approved {{for use in}} finishing cattle to improve growth performance and increase lean tissue accumulation. Little {{is known about the}} combined effects of ZH with anabolic steroid hormone implants. There is also little published data on the effect these growth promotants have on genes that play a role in skeletal muscle synthesis and degradation. Therefore, two separate studies were conducted to address these issues. The first study evaluated the effects of ZH and the steroid implant Revalor-S (RS) on animal performance and skeletal muscle gene expression in feedlot steers. Four treatments were used to analyze the effects of RS implanted 58 days before ZH, which was fed for 30 days with a 3 day withdrawal. It was determined that ZH and RS additively contribute to improved live and carcass performance; however these compounds had different effects on the abundance of the receptors for ZH as well as the abundance of myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA in skeletal muscle of feedlot steers. It was also determined that ZH can cause a transition in the abundance of MHC mRNA isoforms in skeletal muscle that are available for the translation of larger, faster, more glycolytic fiber types of MHC. The second study evaluated the effects of two types of anabolic steroid hormones on myosin heavy chain gene expression. Four treatments were used to measure the effects of trenbolone acetate (TBA) and estradiol (E[subscript] 2) on performance and the amount of MHC mRNA in skeletal muscle of finishing steers. It was determined that anabolic steroid implants improve live animal performance, however there was no alteration in the abundance of MHC mRNA in skeletal muscle of feedlot steer for 28 days after implantation; however there was an increase in <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> type IIA of MHC mRNA in skeletal muscle with increasing days on feed.

40|$|In many soft {{biological}} tissues {{mechanical strength}} and anisotropy are determined {{primarily by the}} presence of fibers, in particular collagen. When an isotropic material is subject to a uniaxial tension, the principal strain transverse to the direction of applied load is always negative. However, in fiber reinforced materials the transverse principal strain can change its sign as the load increases, passing through the zero-points, known as perversions. We investigate how the number of perversions in a material reinforced by two symmetrically aligned families of distributed fibers depends both on the degree of fiber dispersion and the model used for fiber dispersion. Angular integration and three variants of the generalized structure tensor approach are considered and discussed. The study of perversions clearly demonstrates the qualitative difference between these approaches in the case of high dispersion of fibers. The results suggest that this difference is primarily due to the way compressive fibers are modeled. Fiber alignment in biological tissues is created and maintained by the cells, which respond to mechanical stimuli arising from properties of the surrounding material. This coupling between mechanical anisotropy and tissue remodeling can be modeled in nonlinear elasticity by a fiber-reinforced hyperelastic material where remodeling is represented as the change in fiber orientation. We study analytically a simple model of fiber reorientation in a rectangular elastic tissue reinforced by two symmetrically arranged families of fibers subject to constant external loads. In this model, the fiber direction tends to align with the maximum principal stretch or strain. We characterize the global behaviour of the system for all material parameters and applied loads, and show that provided the fibers are tensile initially, the system converges to a stable equilibrium, which corresponds to either complete or <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> alignment. Finally, we consider a model for the coupled growth and fiber reorientation in an elastic incompressible disk. The dynamics of our model is extremely sensitive to the initial condition and characterized by an infinite number of equilibrium states of fiber arrangement. We observed that the stress-induced fiber reorientation and growth laws used in our model produce specific fiber orientation pattern, which suggest a possible mechanism for self-organisation. </p...|$|E

The objective of this study was to determine whether the differences in growth performance between poor (PP) and high (HP) performing piglets could be the result of different skeletal muscle properties. Therefore, from a total of 368 piglets (offspring from Hypor sows bred to TOPIGS sires) 2 groups with a divergent growth performance were selected at 6 wk of age: HP (n = 20, predicted BW at 10 wk of age 26. 8 – 30. 9 kg) and PP (n = 20, predicted BW at 10 wk of age 16. 0 – 22. 9 kg). Piglets were euthanized at 10 wk of age, and samples of the semitendinosus muscle (STN) were collected for histochemistry and gene expression analysis using quantitative PCR (qPCR). At 10 wk of age, realized BW did not differ from predicted BW in either group (P > 0. 880). The HP piglets exhibited greater ADG and ADFI from 6 to 10 wk and greater BW at birth and 6 and 10 wk of age (P = 0. 002) compared with the PP piglets, whereas G:F ratio was similar (P = 0. 417). Superior growth performance of HP piglets was associated with a 1. 27 -fold higher IGF 1 plasma concentration at 10 wk compared with the PP piglets (P = 0. 044). The greater weight and muscle cross-sectional area of STN in HP piglets was due to a 1. 20 -fold increase in total muscle fiber number (TFN; P = 0. 009) and 1. 34 -fold increase in fiber cross-sectional area (FCSA; P = 0. 004) compared with the PP piglets. The number of myonuclei per red and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fiber</b> was greater in HP piglets (P = 0. 097), but the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio was unaffected by the performance group (P = 0. 861). The mRNA expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), paired box 7 (PAX 7), myogenic factor 5 (MYF 5), and myogenic differentiation factor (MYOD) did not differ between groups (P = 0. 327). However, IGF 2 -specific mRNA expression was numerically higher in the HP piglets (P = 0. 101). The greater myofiber number, the higher degree of myofiber hypertrophy, and the increased muscular mRNA expression of IGF 2 indicate that HP piglets exhibit a greater capacity for lean accretion and may grow faster until market weight. In summary, pigs that were selected for predicted high BW at 10 wk of age using a complex selection model had a superior muscularity in terms of greater TFN and FCSA, which may be of advantage for lean mass accretion in later life and for meat quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} tenotomy on the fibers of rat leg muscles (soleus and tibialis anterior) was studied bistochemically with succinic {{dehydrogenase}} (SDH) and phosphorylase (PhR) staining. The following results were obtained. 1) Three days to 4 weeks after tenotomy, with the SDH reactions, red and <b>intermediate</b> muscle <b>fibers</b> in the soleus muscle showed a moth-eaten loss of staining {{reaction in the}} internal parts of the fibers. Central core/targetoid fibers and target fibers were also observed in the fibers. 2) Three days to 4 weeks after tenotomy, PhR activities of white, red and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers</b> in the tibialis anterior muscle merely showed a slight decrease. 3) Morphological changes following tenotomy, especially, muscle atrophy was more markedly observed in the soleus than the tibialis anterior muscle. Three days after tenotomy of both muscles, atrophied and hypertrophied fibers appeared in all types of related fibers. On {{the basis of these}} results, the histochemical and morphological changes following tenotomy were compared with those after denervation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanism}} by which a contracture occurs following injections of various drugs in M. rectus femoris or M. deltoicleus of human beings, the effect of lincomycin on the activity of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and phosphorylase (PhR) in rat rectus femoris muscle was studied histochemically. The following results were obtained. 1) It was demonstrated that rat rectus femoris muscle is composed of three types of fibers; red, white and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers.</b> White fibers predominate in the superficial portion of this muscle and red and <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers</b> {{are located in the}} deeper portion. The diameter of three types of fibers was larger in the order of white＞intermediate＞red fibers. Moreover, in the cross-section of individual fibers, reticular structure (network) was observed by SDH and PhR staining. 2) One hour after injection of 65 ? 650 mM lincomycin, SDH activity in individual fibers tended to increase. The degree of the increase was greater in the order of red≧white＞intermediate fibers. On the other hand, PhR activity was markedly inhibited by 65 ? 650 mM lincomycin. The degree of the inhibition was greater in the order of white＞red＞intermediate fibers. Furthermore, the short diameter of individual fibers was increased by the drug and as a result the cross-section of the fibers took on an almost round appearance. This change was marked in the order of white＞red＞intermediate fibers. The intercellular space was markedly enlarged and thus each fiber tended to be separated. The destruction of the internal structure of fibers and the irregularity of the network were outstandingly prominent in white fibers, while the internal structure of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>fibers</b> remained relatively normal. 3) The structural changes mentioned above were found to be more marked 4 and 6 hours after injection of lincomycin. Three days after injection, atrophy, degeneration and necrosis were markedly observed in the individual fibers. From these results, it was histochemically induced that lincomycin affects the oxidative and glycolytic metabolism of the individual fibers, although there is a difference of the lincomycin effect between the three types of fibers, and that the drug also affects the form and the internal structure of the muscle fibers and the connective tissue surrounding the fibers...|$|R
