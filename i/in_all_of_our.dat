500|$|In June 2009, Jackson's brother Michael {{died at age}} fifty. She spoke {{publicly}} {{concerning his}} death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating [...] "I'd just like to say, to you, Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, {{thank you for all}} of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much." [...] In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming Why Did I Get Married Too?. Amidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, [...] "it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second." [...] During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri. Several months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet [...] "Scream". MTV stated [...] "there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] The performance was lauded by critics, with Entertainment Weekly affirming the rendition [...] "as energetic as it was heartfelt".|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. De Ferran stated that: [...] "I think first of all, I'd {{like to say that}} we're still running under {{a little bit of a}} cloud with all of the things that happened in the U.S. last week and what happened to (Alex) Zanardi is still <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds." [...] He said that he was [...] "glad" [...] to have taken part in the race and that the victory was special for him because his wife is from England. De Ferran earned US$100,000 (£68,600) for the victory. Bräck said that he had no complaint over the last-lap loss and that it was a [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "exciting" [...] race. He said the remaining four races of the season were [...] "crucial" [...] and that the [...] "very close" [...] battle for the championship was not over. He stated that he was looking forward to those events and hoped they would play into his favour. Castroneves congratulated de Ferran on securing the victory,saying that it was [...] "a quick and busy day" [...] for the people who were involved in the event. He was glad that the race was able to be held, and hoped to achieve a good result at the next race of the season.|$|E
500|$|Gareth McLean, who {{reviewed}} {{a preview}} screening for The Guardians TV and radio weblog, appreciated the episode's use of [...] "the disaster movie template" [...] {{and came to}} a favourable overall conclusion: [...] "For the most part, The Voyage of the Damned is absolutely smashing." [...] Its main flaw, in his view, was the [...] "blank and insipid" [...] acting of Kylie Minogue. James Walton of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a positive review, summarising it as [...] "a winning mixture of wild imagination and careful writerly calculation". Alex Clark of The Observer commented that the death toll was rather high, but she still thought the episode was [...] "an oasis of cheeky nonsense and careless invention". Harry Venning of The Stage concluded his positive review of the episode by stating it [...] "was well up to Doctor Whos impeccably high standards". Doctor Who Magazine placed two of the deaths in the episode in its list of the top 100 deaths {{in the history of the}} show. Bannakaffalatta's death, a self-sacrifice to save the Doctor's party, was placed in the [...] "top 20 tearjerkers" [...] category. Astrid's death was given the title of [...] "Doctor Whos all-time greatest death scene", commenting it [...] "ticks boxes <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> main categories [...] ", and [...] "her death would truly make a glass eye cry." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times gave the episode a negative review, stating that [...] "It was boring, despite the endless dashing about and CGI flimflam." [...] The Daily Mirror commented the episode had [...] "some brilliant psychedelic Pink Floyd-esque imagery", [...] "great baddies", and [...] "neat jokes", but lamented that [...] "the plot was a mess, consisting mostly of one hi-tech chase scene after another, and it descended into noise and bluster." ...|$|E

October 2016 network tests by Cellular Insights showed that models A1660 and A1661 with Qualcomm modems had [...] "a significant performance edge" [...] over models A1778 and A1784 with Intel modems. Inspection of the modems {{also found that the}} Qualcomm version's ability to use Ultra HD Voice had been turned off, likely to [...] "level the playing field between the Qualcomm, and Intel variants". The report concluded with the statement that [...] "We are not sure what was the main reason behind Apple's decision to source two different modem suppliers for the newest iPhone." [...] Bloomberg {{reported in}} November 2016 that tests by researchers from Twin Prime and Cellular Insights had shown the two modems to perform similarly on some U.S. cellular networks despite one of the modems being technically capable of faster connectivity. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller told the publication that [...] "Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing ... <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models". Bloomberg quoted analysts and technology advisers who stated that [...] " [...] don’t want one version to get the reputation that it is better" [...] and that [...] "This may not impact the fanboys, but it may make other consumers think twice about buying an Apple phone, especially if they think they might be purchasing a sub-standard product".|$|E
2500|$|Also citing McFly as {{influences}} are British pop {{rock band}} The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 [...] Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated [...] "McFly is a band {{we love to}} be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation... We find ourselves going to the same minor guitar chords like McFly would." ...|$|E
