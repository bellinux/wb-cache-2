Because of its reputation, Rosendale cement has also been used as both a trade name and as a generic term referring to natural hydraulic cements produced elsewhere.

They perfected a traditional Spanish and Italian technique for light, center-less vaulting using layers of tiles in <b>fast-setting</b> cement set flat against the surface of the curve, rather than perpendicular to it. The father, Rafael Guastavino, innovated with the use of Portland cement as the mortar, rather than the traditional lime and gypsum mortars, which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces. His use of the recent development of graphic statics enabled him to design and build inexpensive funicular domes with minimal thickness and no scaffolding. The vaults were typically 3 inches thick and workers, standing on the completed portions, used simple templates, wires, and strings to align their work.|$|E

5000|$|Within Fringe, {{the prime}} and {{parallel}} worlds are inexorably linked, hypothesized by the characters {{as the result}} of a divergent event in the past that formed the two universes. Quantum entanglement of objects between the two universes is significant, having been shown as part of the function of the doomsday device and an electric typewriter used by shapeshifters to communicate with the parallel universe. The parallel universe appears more technologically advanced than the prime one; in the keystone second season episode [...] "Peter", which takes place primarily in 1985, the parallel universe is shown to have cell phones, and zeppelins appear as a common form of transportation. In the show's present (2009 and onward), John F. Kennedy is alive as an ambassador to the United Nations, and other figures like John Lennon and Martin Luther King, Jr. are also alive. The United States in the parallel universe only consists of 48 states; while there exists a North and South Texas, other single states appear to take the place of two separate states in the prime universe, such as both North and South Carolina being the single [...] "Carolina" [...] in the parallel universe. Furthermore, much of western California has been lost, suggesting that a large earthquake along the San Andreas Fault has caused much of the coastal region to sink below sea level. Other effects on the global scale have caused sheep to become extinct, and made coffee and avocados valuable rarities. The singularities that plague the parallel universe can lead to destructive voids; to prevent these, the Fringe division there uses a <b>fast-setting</b> amber-like substance to prevent weakened areas from becoming destructive, but with no regard for innocents that may be trapped within it. A mass blight has affected vast areas of plant life, such as the area around Boston. While the September 11 attacks still occurred in the parallel universe, only the White House and The Pentagon were attacked, and the World Trade Center remains standing. Other changes exist in the parallel universe's popular culture; Eric Stoltz stars in Back to the Future, the musical Dogs has replaced Cats as the longest running Broadway musical, the Sherlock Holmes books were never written, and many comic book characters are different or do not exist such as Green Arrow being Red Arrow and Batman being the Mantis.

40|$|Investigations {{aimed at}} finding some <b>fast-setting</b> glues for {{exterior}} plywood and particleboard based on diisocyanates {{in combination with}} compounds from renewable resources like tannins, proteins, and starches revelaed the following: The mechanical properties of particleboard bonded with unmodified tannin extracts from spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus sylvestris) were inferior. The fortification of the tannin extracts with diisocyanate increased the bonding strength and reduced the thickness swelling. With one exception, particleboards bonded with nonemulsifiable diisocyanate modfied with glutin or maize starch (extender content up to 20 %) had exteriorgrade quality (German standard V 100 for flat-pressed boards). Veneer plywood, which is conditionally weatherproof (German standard AW), can be produced by applying diisocyanate together with tannins or starches. The veneer wood species, the glue mixtures, the pressing conditions, and the fillers have to be adjusted to the diisocyanat e type and the extender.

The problem of mounting an aligned fibre sample, so that it retains alignment whilst remaining fixed in place as it is vibrated in a large magnetic field, was addressed for the first time.

40|$|Test {{sections}} of jointed plain concrete pavement were constructed with <b>fast-setting</b> hydraulic cement concrete (FSHCC) {{as part of}} the California Department of Transportation accelerated pavement-testing program. Many of the longer slabs cracked under environmental influences before any traffic load was applied to them. Data from field instrumentation were recorded and analyzed along with laboratory test data to determine the cause of the cracking. Cores drilled through the cracks indicated that cracking began {{at the top of the}} slabs and propagated downward. This was confirmed with the ILLI-SLAB (ILSL 2) finite-element package in which high tensile stresses were predicted at the top of the slab as a result of the differential drying shrinkage between the top and base of the slab and the nonlinear nature of the negative temperature gradients through the slab. Laboratory free-shrinkage tests with the test section concrete indicated significantly higher levels of shrinkage compared with that achieved with ordinary Type II portland cement.

This {{has been the case}} for the California De-partment of Transportation (Caltrans), which recently undertook a major concrete pavement rehabilitation project on I- 15 near the city of Ontario, California. The I- 15 Ontario Corridor carries about 200, 000 ADT with 4 - 6 lanes each direction, about 6 percent of which is heavy trucks during peak hours. The size of the project is approximately $ 86 million in the engineer’s estimate cost. It is scheduled to start construction on February 2009 and to be completed by April 2010.

40|$|AbstractCordierite based {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in high temperature applications due to their good thermo-mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance. They are generally employed in the kiln furniture (shelves, brackets, bearing plates) for firing ceramic pieces. Because of its low expansion coefficient and dielectric properties, cordierite is also used in advanced ceramics, catalyst supports automotive, industrial waste gas purification and parts subjected to sudden temperature changes. The low intrinsic strength of the cordierite may be compensated {{by the presence of}} mullite, forming a composite material of cordierite-mullite, extending its use to somewhat higher temperatures, at the expense of a slight increase in the thermal expansion coefficient. In this work a cordierite-mullite precursor was prepared from a mixture of magnesium oxide, calcined alumina, silica fume and monoaluminum phosphate solution that produces fast setting at room temperature (∼ 20 minutes) and then, by calcination, cordierite-mullite is generated. The evolution of the mineralogical phases was studied from room temperature to 1350 °C by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry. A possible sequence of chemicals reactions throughout the heat treatment is also proposed.

40|$|Natural cement was {{patented}} in 1796 but it didn’t {{arrive in}} Spain until 1835. No {{one knows exactly}} where the production started in Spain, because it emerged independently {{at the same time}} in many places. Most of these outbreaks are concentrated in the north and northwest of Spain: Basque Country (Zumaya and Rezola) and Catalonia (San Celoní and San Juan de las Abadesas). Natural cement was extensively used to decorate historical buildings during the nineteenth and beginning of twentieth century in Madrid. It was the building material which realised the architects and builders dreams of mass-produced cast elements in a wide variety of styles. Its arrival replaced traditional materials that were used previously (lime, gypsum and hydraulic limes). However, its use was not extended in time, and soon it was replaced by the use of artificial Portland cements. During 20 th century this building material disappeared from use. What remains is it’s memory, in thousands and thousands of “stone witnesses” in our cities. Final properties of the cement largely depend on raw materials used and its combustion temperature.

The complete {{solution to the problem}} of arthroplasty will be found only when we can provide our patients with new hips either made of, or able to unite with, living bone.

A more promising field lies in the covering of raw bony surfaces by grafts of articular cartilage which, nourished by synovial fluid, do in fact survive readily along with a thin plate of subjacent bone (Gallie l 956 b). Unfortunately in the hip survival of the cartilage is nullified by changes due to avascularity or disease in the underlying femoral head, and it is perhaps because this abnormal bone is not removed that “ cartilage-cup arthroplasty “ has not been more successful.

In recent studies, CPC-chitosan composites are developed with {{high mechanical strength}} and washout resistance. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to optimize the setting time and mechanical properties of a CPC-chitosan composite by tailoring the chitosan content, and to evaluate the bioresorbability by using an dissolution model. Six chitosan mass fractions are tested: 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 %. Specimens are immersed in solutions with pH ranging from 3. 5 to 5 to simulate the acidic environments produced by osteoclasts in. Dissolution is measured as the fraction of mass loss versus immersion time from 7 d to 28 d. The CPC-chitosan composite with 20 % by mass chitosan has a setting time (mean±SD; n= 4) of 13 1 min, significantly less than 87 7 min for CPC control without chitosan (p 0. 1). The dissolution rates (fraction of mass loss per day,%/d) were 1. 05 for CPC control and 1. 08 for CPC-chitosan. In summary, a CPC-chitosan composite is developed with <b>fast-setting</b> and a flexural strength three-fold of that of CPC control without chitosan. Both materials are soluble in acidic environments, indicating that adding chitosan did not compromise the bioresorbability of CPC.
