The relative spectral flux density is also useful if we wish to compare a source's flux density at one wavelength with the same source's flux density at another wavelength; for example, if we wish to demonstrate how the Sun's spectrum peaks in the visible part of the EM spectrum, a graph of the Sun's relative spectral flux density will suffice.|$|E

The researchers were specifically <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> inoculation and post hoc refutation. Post hoc refutation is another form of building resistance to arguments, however, instead of building resistance prior to future arguments, like inoculation, it attempts to restore original beliefs and attitudes after the counterarguments have been made. Results of the research reinforced prior conclusions that refutational same and different treatments both increase resistance to attacks. More important, results also indicated inoculation was superior to post hoc refutation when attempting to protect original beliefs and attitudes. (Pfau et al., 1990) ...|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of two inks, one propionic acid based and another water based were investigated. Many research groups report results from water based solution infiltration [15], whilst our previous work showed how propionic acid based inks {{can be used}} to form doped ceria [20]. Propionic acid based solutions spread well on metal and oxide surfaces [21] and so, unlike aqueous solutions, do not require additional surfactants to achieve a high degree of wetting. Hence, there was <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> the performance enhancement for alternative precursor solutions, particularly where the rheological properties for each ink may be different. In addition to fuel cell infiltration, symmetric anode cells were produced and infiltrated to demonstrate the suitability of propionic acid ink precursor.|$|R

Although the Ising model has been well studied, no analytical result for the spin-spin correlation function exists for arbitrary magnetic fields and temperatures. We show the validity of our form by comparison with simulations using the Wolff algorithm, and obtain remarkable precision by including analytic corrections to scaling. Given recent <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>comparing</b> biomembrane heterogeneity to Ising criticality, our spin-spin correlation function may be used as a predictive quantitative measure for FRET or NMR membrane experiments.
