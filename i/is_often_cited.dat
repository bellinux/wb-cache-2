5|$|Because {{there are}} 26 letters (2×13) {{in the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} is applied, so the same action {{can be used for}} encoding and decoding.

5|$|Indian cuisine {{encompasses}} {{a wide variety}} of regional and traditional cuisines, often depending on a particular state (such as Maharashtrian cuisine). Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), toor (pigeon peas), urad (black gram), and mong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli urad—or split. Split lentils, or dal, are used extensively.

5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>cited</b> as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|Prog {{is based}} on fusions of styles, {{approaches}} and genres, involving a continuous move between formalism and eclecticism. Due to its historical reception, prog's scope is sometimes limited to a stereotype of long solos, overlong albums, fantasy lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>cited</b> for its merging of high culture and low culture, few artists incorporated literal classical themes in their work to any great degree, and {{only a handful of}} groups purposely emulated or referenced classical music.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944, when Asif read a play {{set in the}} reign of Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty. Before its principal photography {{began in the early}} 1950s, the project had lost a financier and undergone a complete change of cast. Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period. The soundtrack, inspired by Indian classical and folk music, comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singers including Lata Mangeshkar and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>cited</b> among the finest in Bollywood cinematic history.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with large}} teeth {{and a strong}} bite, the kitefin shark is a powerful, solitary {{predator}} that takes {{many different types of}} prey, ranging from bony fishes, sharks and rays, to cephalopods, crustaceans, polychaete worms, siphonophores, and possibly carrion. It also takes bites out of animals larger than itself, similar to its smaller relative, the cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). This shark is aplacental viviparous and gives birth to 1014 young. The kitefin shark is fished commercially for its meat, skin, and liver oil, primarily by Portugal and Japan. A fishery targeting this species existed off the Azores from the 1970s to the 1990s, but collapsed due to overfishing and falling liver oil prices; the rapid depletion of the Azores stock <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>cited</b> {{as an example of the}} susceptibility of deep-sea sharks to human exploitation. The low reproductive rate of this species renders it susceptible to overfishing and, coupled with known population declines, has led it to be assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX was {{developed}} alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but {{took a different}} approach by returning to the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>cited</b> by critics and fans {{as one of the}} best entries in the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling over five million copies worldwide by March 2003 and five and a half million copies by February 2016. In 2016 ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.|$|E
