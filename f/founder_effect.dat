5|$|The second mode of {{speciation}} is peripatric speciation, {{which occurs}} when small populations of organisms become isolated {{in a new}} environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically {{much smaller than the}} parental population. Here, the <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger {{the two groups}} to diverge significantly {{over the course of}} many generations. As the difference, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and phenetically, although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following after Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> were critically important for new species to develop. However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research and the results have been equivocal at best.|$|E
50|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{forces that}} contribute to patterns of human genetic variation include new mutations, natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift, population bottlenecks, <b>founder</b> <b>effects,</b> isolation by distance, genetic admixture and barriers to gene flow.

30|$|The {{remarkable}} non-diversity of Japonic and Koreanic can {{be explained}} by two factors. The first is a <b>founder’s</b> <b>effect,</b> the phenomenon by which genetic diversity is reduced when a small population settles a new area. The claim that a serial <b>founder’s</b> <b>effect</b> is discernible in linguistic variation has been made by Atkinson (2011), among others. In the case of Japonic, we might expect <b>founder’s</b> <b>effects</b> to have occurred {{as a result of the}} movement of relatively small populations from the Korean peninsula to Kyūshū, and again from Kyūshū to the rest of the archipelago. Crudely put, the effect can be conceptualized as a local reduction in linguistic diversity compared to the home population. The same effect would be anticipated in the establishment of Koreanic in the south central peninsula, and again as it expanded throughout the peninsula.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there is}} still much debate about the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can notably {{suffer from}} mitral valve disease, {{which leads to}} heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers {{at some point in}} their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, {{including}} early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a <b>founder</b> <b>effect,</b> in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this {{has been shown to be}} the result of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which random {{processes}} such as founder events contribute to evolutionary divergence is a longstanding controversy in evolutionary biology. To determine the respective contribution of <b>founder</b> <b>effects</b> and natural selection, we conducted an experiment in which brown anole (Anolis sagrei) lizard populations were established on seven small islands from male-female pairs randomly drawn from the same large-island source. These founding events generated significant among-island genetic and morphological differences that persisted {{throughout the course of}} the experiment despite all populations adapting in the predicted direction—shorter hindlimbs—in response to the narrower vegetation on the small islands. Thus using a replicated experiment in nature we showed that both <b>founder</b> <b>effects</b> and natura...|$|R
5|$|The <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> is {{a special}} case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} all genetic {{variation}} is functionally neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or {{significant difference in}} fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this variation accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce genetic variation through population bottlenecks. which among other things can cause the <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> in initially small new populations. When genetic variation does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such variation. As a result, the genetic variation at those sites is higher than at sites where variation does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic variation at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces genetic variation by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E
5|$|The {{late onset}} of Huntington's disease means {{it does not}} usually affect reproduction. The {{worldwide}} prevalence of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically {{as a result of}} ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower {{in the rest of the}} world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local <b>founder</b> <b>effect,</b> a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific Rim {{distribution}} of head-marking may reflect population movements beginning {{tens of thousands}} of years ago and <b>founder</b> <b>effects.</b> Kusunda has traces in the Himalayas and there are Caucasian enclaves, both perhaps remnants of typology preceding spreads of interior Eurasian language families. The dependent-marking type is found everywhere but rare in the Americas, possibly another result of <b>founder</b> <b>effects.</b> In the Americas, all four types are found along the Pacific Coast but in the East, only head-marking is common. Whether the diversity of types along the Pacific Coast reflects a great age or an overlay of more recent Eurasian colonizations on an earlier American stratum remains to be seen.|$|R

25|$|The {{examination}} of the core conserved region of the haplotype Cw5-B18 indicates that it likely originated in Africa. The DR3-DQ2 component is found at high frequencies in the Irish, but in strong linkage disequilibrium in the AH8.1 haplotype. Recent studies indicate that DR3-DQ2 in two branches of AH8.1 have a common origin in Africa at about 75,000 years ago; the frequency maximum of the haplotype is in the Côte d'Ivoire region and northwest portion of Central Africa. Taken together, A30-Cw5-B18-DR3-DQ2's origin among peoples with deep Eurasian ancestry is highly unlikely, and indicates that this haplotypes abundance in Sardinia is a likely consequence of a <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> or positive selection and other genetic factors. There is a claimed shared ancestry between Sardinians and the Basque, however Sardinia is proximal to North Africa, and does not bear the Cw variant found in the Basque or Morocco, whereas the Basque most likely can attribute their variant A30::DQ2 to gene flow from northwest Morocco.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that because snowball Earth would {{undoubtedly}} have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see <b>founder</b> <b>effect),</b> and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the germ line of the colony, that reproduces {{as a result of the}} differentiation), i.e. R > C/B (see Hamilton's rule). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} unanswered {{question is}} whether such rare variants exist because of chance mutations, population founder events and maintenance by processes such as drift, or whether there is any selective advantage involved in their maintenance and spread. An {{example of such a}} rare variant effect was recently discovered among Samoan islanders. Among the islanders the variant is extremely common, but in other populations it is extremely rare or absent. The variant predisposes to obesity but strangely is protective against type 2 diabetes. Based on cell studies it was suggested the variant may protect individuals against periods of 'famine' and there is also evidence that it has been under positive selection. The most likely scenario then is that this rare variant was established in the islanders by a <b>founder</b> <b>effect</b> among a small initial colonising population, and was able to spread because of a selective advantage it conferred within that small group. Hence, in small populations under particular environmental conditions it may be feasible that the 'thrifty gene' idea is correct. It {{remains to be seen if}} rare variants that fill the gap in the missing heritability estimates are also 'thrifty genes' or if they are rare chance events sustained by drift, as implicated for the common variants currently linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

5000|$|Serial <b>founder</b> <b>effects</b> have {{occurred}} when populations migrate over long distances. Such long-distance migrations typically involve relatively rapid movements followed by periods of settlement. The populations in each migration carry only {{a subset of}} the genetic diversity carried from previous migrations. As a result, genetic differentiation tends to increase with geographic distance as described by the [...] "isolation by distance" [...] model. The migration of humans out of Africa is characterized by serial <b>founder</b> <b>effects.</b> Africa has the highest degree of genetic diversity of any continent, which is consistent with an African origin of modern humans. After the initial migration from Africa, the Indian subcontinent was the first major settling point for modern humans. Consequently, India has the second-highest genetic diversity in the world. In general, the genetic diversity of the Indian subcontinent is a subset of Africa, and the genetic diversity outside Africa is a subset of India.|$|R
