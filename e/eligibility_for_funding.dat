5000|$|The first {{special report}} {{published}} by Abraham under s10(4) Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 concerned NHS funding for long-term care. Two reports {{had previously been}} issued on the subject by Sir William Reid, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman between 1990 and 1996. It was found by Reid that the National Health Service had failed to make long-term care available to patients with {{mental and physical health}} needs. There were also failings in how health authorities had set the eligibility criteria for funding. The report published by Abraham in February 2003 was strongly critical of the Department of Health. It was found that numerous health authorities were using criteria that was too restrictive in determining <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> for NHS care that was not in line with that laid down by the Department after the judgment in ex parte Coughlan. [...] Abraham found that the cost of caring for patients with very severe disabilities was left to relatives instead of the National Health Service. [...] She recommended the Department take a strong lead in providing a [...] "very clear, well defined national framework" [...] for determining eligibility. This the Government undertook to do, as well as a retrospective review of cases that it had determined. The backlog of retrospective review cases grew {{to such an extent that}} Abraham took the decision in June 2004 to accept cases directly without complainants having to exhaust the NHS complaints procedure. In a follow-up report in December 2004, Abraham criticised the shortcomings which she had discovered in the retrospective review process. Record keeping was often poor, decisions were sometimes taken without clinical advice and review processes were sometimes secretive. Once again, Abraham insisted on a national framework for criteria and recommended the development of good practice guidance to support the criteria. [...] Thereafter, the Office engaged deeply with the Department and the health authorities to ensure that cases were properly assessed according to criteria. The Department published its national framework for determining funding eligibility in June 2007 and the number of NHS continuing care cases being handled by the Office shrunk from 1,500 in November 2007 to just 100 in March 2008. [...] Through its rigorous reporting and active engagement with the Department, the Office under Ann Abraham had helped bring about service improvement in the NHS and provide justice to those wrongly denied funding.|$|E

It {{is clear from the}} overarching goals of the GCCA+ programme, that to rank the countries according to <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> the following issues need to be considered: vulnerability to climate change, adaptive capacity, climate change mitigation action, disaster risk, and a (political) commitment to respond to climate change and poverty reduction. The GCCA+ index identifies those countries most vulnerable to climate change and ranks them according to their <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> {{within the context of the}} EU GCCA+ programme classifying 34 “fit for purpose indicators” along one of four components (natural hazards, exposure, vulnerability and capacity). The list 34 ‘fit-for-purpose’ indicators has been compiled on the basis of their relevance with the GCCA+ programme, and the compliance with the following criteria: reliable, open source, consistent, scientifically robust, with global coverage, and based on data which are in the public domain. The indicators cover the social, economic and environmental aspects of each of the components under which they have been classified. Each indicator is described in terms of relevance, measuring unit, indicator creation method, data source, periodicity, missing data and geographical distribution in the sample of countries for the latest available year. The methodology applied to calculate the GCCA+index adopts a climate resilient development approach integrating the development policy perspective with a climate change risk management approach.

However, many variables especially indirect cost in cost estimation is subject to uncertainty. This level of uncertainty will arise because of increased imperfect knowledge about indirect cost variables.

This paper proposed artificial intelligence computation based on the Back Propagation method in Neural Networks. This method is used to model all of variables consist of direct cost and indirect cost based on previous typical projects to reduce uncertainty. This method is applied specifically to estimate the costs of instrumentation and control discipline. In the future, this method could be developed and applied for other discipline such as process, piping, mechanical, civil, electrical and others, so that the total uncertainty of project cost estimation could reduce significantly...|$|E
40|$|The three British Sports Councils are {{instrumental}} {{in developing the}} policy landscape for {{sport and physical education}} (PE). They aspire to equality between the sexes in ‘sport and physical recreation’ (SPR), in keeping with their Royal Charters (SE, 2009; SS, 1996; SW, 1997) and the Equality Act (HM Government, 2010). As public bodies they are committed to eliminating direct and indirect discrimination in provision, and advancing equality. One of their main functions is the distribution of public money, and all collect participation data detailing the different SPR choices of the sexes. These are primary planning tools in the three home countries. This paper investigates whether equality in relation to sex is considered a ‘first order’ question of distributive justice for the Councils. Consequently, the funding awarded to the top SPR preferences by sex for each Country is presented. Defining SPR determines <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> and the boundaries of the SPR infrastructure which influences and interfaces with sport, school sport and PE. Consequently, critical feminist political and economic theory is used to evaluate the Councils’ framing of SPR and equality in relation to sex. Male preferences are disproportionately grant-aided leaving those of females significantly under-funded. Although the remit of the Councils is ‘sport and physical recreation’ this is usually reframed by them as ‘sport’. Equality is generally considered a second order question of justice, and outsourced to national governing bodies of sport. Further dance, {{one of the most popular}} female SPR activities for girls, has not, until 2016, been designated as SPR in England and has been ineligible for funding. These policies suggest indirect discrimination against women and girls who disproportionately prefer physical recreation and dance to competitive sport. Therefore, the Sports Councils and/or over-arching government departments may not be fulfilling their legal requirements under the Equality Act...|$|E

40|$|MM thesis - P&DMThe {{purpose of}} {{transforming}} public service delivery operations was appropriately structured, specifically in reconstructing and bringing equity and {{equal access to}} public resources. Similarly, by transforming NGOs in general and Elderly Residential Homes in particular, the Department of Social Development was earnestly aiming at effectively redressing inequalities and addressing the skewed distribution of welfare services specifically within those disadvantaged communities that remain {{on the margins of}} society. However, transformation prescriptions mostly put emphasis on balancing racial ratios of beneficiaries, staff and governing board structures within these Homes, thereby reducing the purpose of transformation to simply <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding.</b> Even the legislative framework designed to support transformation emphasises the financial suspension aspect of non-compliance with transformation requirements. Clearly, such assumptions tend to overlook the need to make a thorough scrutiny of the real contextual challenges experienced by the Non-Governmental Elderly Homes in their attempts to comply with transformation requirements, especially those Homes that existed during the apartheid period and serviced one racial group, because they were suddenly expected to undergo drastic reforms to redefine their service objectives in ways that display inclusiveness. This report explores the challenges of transformation as experienced by Non-Governmental Organizations, particularly the Residential Homes for the Elderly. Through the qualitative ii method of observation, interviewing and document analysis, it investigates the process of transformation as carried out within the Non-Governmental Elderly Homes to achieve the required level of transformation in their service delivery systems. Emanating from the research results is the fact that, from the perspective of Social Development, transformation was reduced to nothing more than a ‘qualification’ to access Departmental financial support, which then resulted in its real purpose being ill-conceived and consequently unsuccessful. The Elderly Homes in Springs cited the demand by the Department to transform as putting a strain on their operational activities. Homes also feel that they generally try to extend their services to other racial groups but the Department seems unconcerned about the problems they encounter in the transformation process. Drawn from such findings, this report concluded that in its efforts to transform community service delivery by Non-Governmental Organizations in general and Elderly Homes in particular, the same process of transformation should be understood and viewed broadly so that the importance of the matter is properly communicated to those organizations charged with taking it further. Adequate transformation support systems should also be set up to enable Elderly Homes to function at the required level of transformed service provision...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years {{there has been}} a {{paradigmatic}} shift in the field of disabilities towards assessing individual support needs in relation to social and environmental context rather than individual deficits. The capacity of existing assessment instruments to assess support needs is limited because most were designed to assess individual deficits and thereby determine <b>eligibility</b> <b>for</b> <b>funding</b> and/or services. Some instruments have been designed to assess support needs but there are several problems associated with these instruments including, suitability for use in only one disability type, susceptibility to rater bias, and failure to account for variations in support needs over time. This thesis attempted to contribute to addressing these deficiencies by examining the characteristics that are most predictive of support needs for people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities and the methods by which changes in such support needs could be predicted. Two studies were used to address these aims. The first considered samples of people with primary psychiatric disabilities (N= 561) and intellectual disabilities (N = 168), who lived in Supported Residential Facilities. These participants were assessed in regards not only to standard demographic and disability characteristics, and also personal characteristics, including functional abilities, and support needs. The data were analysed using ordinal logistic regression to determine which better predicted support needs and, accordingly, which characteristics were most important to include in the assessment of support needs. Analysis showed that personal characteristics, such as functional abilities such as showering/bathing and budgeting explained much more variance in support needs than either demographics or disability characteristics. This suggests that, for support needs assessments to be accurately assessed, they should include evaluations of these personal characteristics even though they may require more time and resources to obtain than demographic and disability data. The second study in this thesis aimed to investigate whether caregivers could predict changes in support needs over six-month periods accurately. Residents in supported accommodation with a primary psychiatric disability (N = 60; although some attrition among those with psychiatric disabilities), or primary intellectual disability (N = 57) and their caregivers were involved in this study. Caregivers were interviewed on three occasions at six-monthly intervals and asked to estimate any changes that they expected to occur in the next six months or that they believed had occurred in the preceding six months. Caregivers were also asked to complete two functional assessments for each resident at the three points in time. The functional assessments were used as the benchmark against which the accuracy of caregivers’ estimates was examined. Analysis found that caregivers were unable to predict accurately prospective changes in overall or specific support needs, nor were they able to report accurately such changes retrospectively. The results of this thesis contribute to the body of knowledge in the relatively new area of support needs assessment in terms of possible predictors of support needs and the assessment of changes in support needs. Recommendations for further research include; investigating some of the personal characteristics found to be predictors of support needs in greater detail and among other disability types, replication of these findings in other samples, and investigating ways to improve caregivers’ capacity to predict changes in support needs accurately.
