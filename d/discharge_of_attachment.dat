To explain the etiology and the consequences of the diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorder the authors analyzed literature which allowed combining the theory <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> and the theory of deficits. In {{the first part of the}} script the authors described Bowlby’s theory <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> which arranges attachment behaviors in behavioral attachment system. To expand comprehension of the subject theymentioned psychoanalytic and system concepts. The second part of the paper is devoted to the definition of deficit phenomenon and determining its different areas on the basis of observations made by the researchers dealing with this matter. Conclusion. In authors’ opinion the deficits occurring in children suffering from disruptive behavior disorder are connected with improper family relations. The disruptive behavior disorders may be a way of defense against narcissistic injury as well as motor <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> the emotional difficulties...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to evaluate the representations <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> 40 adopted adolescents (age 13 - 24 years, mean 16. 5 years) and their parents, in order to: (a) assess the quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> representations in a population of adolescents at risk, (b) verify the intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> in adoptive families, with the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI, George, Kaplan, Main, 1985). In line with research data on adolescents, the results highlight the prevalence <b>of</b> Dismissing <b>attachment</b> (55. 5 %) and the low presence <b>of</b> Secure-Free <b>attachment</b> (22. 5 %); when we consider the four attachments' categories, the data emphasizes the high presence <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> Unresolved with respect to Trauma and/or Loss (22. 5 %).

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the study of recent {{scientific}} literature about the development <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> the author answers the following questions: which are the postulates the theory <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> has about the stability of the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> which level <b>of</b> stability in the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> from infancy to adulthood these studies illuminate and which factors significantly influence the (in) stability of the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> in time. The theory <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> assumes that normal circumstances elicit stability. Changes, however, can be the result of important events influencing the sensitivity of the object <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> Agreement has not yet been reached regarding the percentage of stability in the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> There is more agreement regarding attachment in adulthood than that in childhood. The results depend on the size and characteristics of the subjects of the research, the measuring instruments, type of data analysis etc. The author concludes that attachment is a dynamic system influenced by significant changes in life (the cognitive development of the child, external care, parents&# 39; divorce, different stressful situations). As the influence of stressful events on the individual person&# 39; s quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> is examined, it is necessary to consider also his&# 47;her temperamental characteristics, role of other people in their lives, etc...|$|R
40|$|Stability {{and change}} <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> was {{examined}} longitudinally {{in a group}} of 48 children at 14, 24, and 58 months <b>of</b> age. Whereas <b>attachment</b> classifications showed stability between 14 and 24 months, lack of stability was the case between either 14 or 24 months and 58 months. Mothers of children who did not exhibit stability <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> reported more negative and less positive life events. No correspondence was found between attachment classification at 14 or 24 months and mental representations at 58 months. However there was agreement between representational and behavioral measures <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> at 58 months, where mental representations <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> appeared to mirror and complement behavioral classification <b>of</b> the <b>attachment</b> relationship with the mother. Evidence for continuity <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> from infancy to childhood internal representations was found only in a subgroup of children who showed stability <b>of</b> secure <b>attachment</b> between infancy and 58 months of age.

40|$|This study {{examined}} attachment in institutionalized and community children 12 – 31 {{months of age}} in Bucharest, Romania. Attachment was assessed using ratings <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> behaviors and ratings of caregiver descriptions in a structured interview. As predicted, children raised in institutions exhibited serious disturbances <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> as assessed by all methods. Observed quality of caregiving was related to formation and organization <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> in children living in institutions.

Second, we also attempted a moderation analysis in order to examine whether the relationship between quality <b>of</b> <b>attachments</b> and bullying is moderated by the child’s gender. Finally, we explored whether there are significant differences in the quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> between children identified as bullies, victims, bully/victims, and uninvolved. The participants were 303 fifth and sixth grade children with a mean age of 11. 06 years that completed the Revised Bullying and Victimization Questionnaire and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment. The results showed that poor quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> with parents and peers predicts bullying and victimization. Moderation analysis revealed that the link between quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> and bullying and victimization is significantly stronger for girls. Also, as hypothesized, bullies and bully/victims manifest the worst quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> with parents and peers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{attachment}} and social-emotional functioning in Emotionally Disturbed youth at a residential treatment center (RTC) and therapeutic day program (TDP). Fifty-nine children and adolescents from a New York RTC/TDP participated in this study. As there is debate on whether researchers should use discrete or continuous measures <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> the current study employed both a categorical and continuous measure <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> in order to gather information on the child/adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s perception <b>of</b> their <b>attachment</b> style. Results indicate a significant correlation between self-esteem and the three subscales of the ASCQ. More specifically, there was a positive correlation between secure scores and self-esteem and a negative correlation between anxious/ambivalent scores and avoidant scores and self-esteem. In addition, there was a significant effect <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> as measured by the categorical measure, on self-esteem. In examining attachment and self-control, there was not a significant effect <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> on self-control using the categorical measure <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> nor was there a significant correlation between self-control on the secure and avoidant scales of the continuous measure <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> However, a positive correlation was found between the anxious/ambivalent scores and self-control.

Three questionnaires were used: styles <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> to God by Kirkpatrick and Rowatt, emotional empathy by Mehrabian and Epstein and forgiveness inventory by Enzeit. Pearson correlation and Regression analysis were used for data analysis. The style <b>of</b> secure <b>attachment</b> to God had a significantly positive relationship with forgiveness and empathy. Furthermore, the style <b>of</b> avoidant <b>attachment</b> to God and the style <b>of</b> bilateral <b>attachment</b> to God had a significantly negative relationship with forgiveness. In addition, the standard coefficients of all three predictive variables (Secure attachment, bilateral and avoidant to God) were all significant at p= 0. 05.
