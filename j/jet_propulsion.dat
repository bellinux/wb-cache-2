40|$|Aquatic Anisopteran {{dragonfly}} larva {{possesses a}} modified hindgut pump that enables jet propelled locomotion and respiration. In supporting these functions, the associated flows are modulated by a tri-leaflet anal valve. Previous studies on this valve {{have been limited}} to showing larva's ability to modulate the aperture size through concurrent movement of the three leaflets. However, we have newly observed that the dragonfly nymph's anal valve is capable of more sophisticated movements via independent control of the leaflets. The impact of this unique feature on the two functions of the pump was investigated through simultaneous visualization of the dragonfly's anal valve kinematics and the corresponding anal jets. Our results indicate that by controlling the individual anal valve leaflets, the larva <b>jets</b> its <b>propulsion</b> <b>jet</b> straight by the symmetric nozzle opening, while diagonally deflecting its respiratory jet by the asymmetric nozzle opening. The straight <b>jet</b> during the <b>propulsion</b> appears to reduce the thrust loss due to a side-thrust generation. The deflected respiratory jet appears to induce a secondary entrainment flow in a favorable direction for a clean and efficient breathing...|$|R

5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories.

During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the <b>Jet</b> <b>Propulsion</b> Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle.

5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of <b>jet</b> <b>propulsion.</b> It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, {{in the face}} of the {{emerging}} Cold War scenario, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed <b>jet</b> <b>propulsion</b> would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation's chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Europa Clipper — In July 2013 {{an updated}} concept for a flyby Europa mission called Europa Clipper was {{presented}} by the <b>Jet</b> <b>Propulsion</b> Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer.|$|E
