5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve,</b> {{besides the}} credits and Sandy Pearlman's lengthy {{notes on the}} Imaginos story, sports a large black and white photo by {{landscape}} British photographer Simon Marsden of Duntrune Castle in Argyllshire, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover art was {{directed}} by John Gillespie. John Holmstrom and guitarist Johnny Ramone both worked on illustration, with the entire back cover contemplating a military theme, while the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> artwork depicted many of the themes portrayed in songs. The subject matter of songs varied throughout the album, though nearly all the tracks on the album incorporated humor into the lyrics. The musical style showed more of a surf rock influence, and many songs had minimal structuring.|$|E
5|$|The UK edition {{contained}} Bob Cato's colour {{photo of}} Harrison {{sitting in front}} of an antique car, with art direction for the package being credited to Cream designs. The international CD release of the album uses the latter cover. The <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the original LP in Britain contained a picture by Michael Putland, showing Harrison on a wintry beach in Cannes, where he was attending the Midem music-industry trade fair in January 1976. A third front-cover option came with MFP's budget reissue during the 1980s, which reproduced Harrison's 1968 White Album portrait.|$|E

50|$|Double vinyl edition as {{a heavyweight}} black vinyl in wide spine <b>sleeve</b> with printed <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|R
50|$|May-1973: United Artists Records, UAD60037/8, UK vinyl - {{original}} issues came in 6 panel fold-out <b>sleeve</b> with <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Subsequent releases in gatefold sleeve.|$|R
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
5|$|Winter in America juxtaposes {{themes of}} nostalgic hope {{to the social}} {{problems}} of the early 1970s, particularly in the African-American community and inner cities. Also a prominent theme in Scott-Heron's lyrics is people's faith in their culture in a bleak, impoverished environment. The album features Scott-Heron's examination of maintaining one's cultural roots in a discouraging environment. Other themes include love, fatherhood, freedom, alcoholism, and political scandal. The themes of social disillusionment and the human condition featured on the album are also depicted on the Winter collage, representing the grim, sullen images of poverty, decay, and death in generally urban areas and ghettos. Created by artist Peggy Harris, the collage was featured on the original LP's <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> and in the liner booklet of Winter in Americas CD reissue.|$|E
25|$|Nov-1972: United Artists Records, UAG29364, UK vinyl – {{original}} issues came {{in black}} on silver foil single sleeve, with <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> and foldout Star Rats poster. Subsequent issues were a simple single sleeve.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} ground {{conditions}} on the soil plug formation have been sufficiently investigated [11, 12, 19]. While the effects of pile diameter on the inner frictional resistance have been studied adequately [15, 20], the effects of outer or <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> (i.e., attachments at the pile base) on the mechanism of soil plugging have hardly been studied. Therefore, the mechanism of soil plugging on the sleeved-piles are still unknown. In this research, the behaviour of open-ended piles attached with <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> was studied.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{promoted}} on <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> throughout the Harvest Records catalogue, along with albums by Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Kevin Ayers, Barrett and Roy Harper.|$|R
25|$|The large cover (and <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves)</b> {{are valued}} by {{collectors}} and artists {{for the space}} given for visual expression, {{especially when it comes}} to the long play vinyl LP.|$|R
25|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{was put on}} {{the index}} {{separately}} because it contained the lyrics. Some tour posters were considered misogynistic and were also put on the list. They contained a drawing of a tied up and gagged woman called Gwendoline that was inspired by bondage artist John Willie and is the mascot of the band. Since then, Die Ärzte have used a skeleton version of Gwendoline in the artwork of most of their albums.|$|E
25|$|The photographer, Hugo McGuiness, and {{the sleeve}} designer, Steve Averill (a friend of bassist Adam Clayton), {{went on to}} work on several more U2 album covers. The image was changed to a {{distorted}} picture of the band for the American and Canadian release, due to the record company's fears that the band would be accused of encouraging paedophilia. Sandy Porter is credited as the photographer for the American cover. However, the photo of Rowen appeared on the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the album in the US and Canada. In 2008, the artwork of the remastered editions was standardised worldwide {{to that of the}} 1980 UK release.|$|E
25|$|The two {{children}} who modelled {{for the cover}} were siblings Stefan and Samantha Gates. The photo shoot was a frustrating affair {{over the course of}} ten days. Shooting was done {{first thing in the morning}} and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. The photos of the {{two children}} were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results of the shoot were less than satisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created an unexpectedly striking album cover. The <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway.|$|E

5000|$|Use {{polyethylene}} <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Never use PVC sleeves {{as their}} chemical makeup {{is too close}} to vinyl and may cause imprints or fuse to the LP. Replace paper sleeves as paper deteriorates, leaving oil and paper residue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{statuette}} {{also appears}} on the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> of the original vinyl, {{as well as on}} the record's labels. [...] It can also be seen on the album cover of Back to the Egg in the background, on the mantelpiece.|$|R
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{announced}} that band would be releasing a second box set after Soundtrack to the Apocalypse (2003), and would include every one of Slayer's studio albums from 1986's Reign In Blood to 2009's World Painted Blood. It originally had a price tag of $199.99, but is now sold at retail price of $149.98. It was released through American Recordings and Sony. Blabbermouth.net noted that they are [...] "treating the albums the way they would treat a great jazz, classical, Bob Dylan or Miles Davis record, something that isn't normally done for metal records." [...] To increase quality, Lacquers were cut several times, and the original albums were remastered. It was released as a high-quality 180gram audiophile vinyl, pressed at RTI, an American pressing plant. The vinyl discs are packaged in a standard, clear <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> to preserve the vinyl, and are also in high-quality litho-wrapped jackets, and boxed in a slipcase. Reproductions of the original albums <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> artwork were converted to 12inch square inserts to fit the standard vinyl disc covers.|$|E
500|$|On the album's track listing, each song is {{identified}} with a symbol from the cover: a teardrop, an eye, or a toy arrow. The teardrop iidentifies [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", [...] "Figuración", [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] and [...] "Que el viento borró tus manos"; the eye, [...] "Color humano" [...] and [...] "A estos hombres tristes", and the toy arrow [...] "Ana no duerme", [...] "Fermín" [...] and [...] "Laura va". The <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> describes each icon: ...|$|E
500|$|The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock {{called the}} album a [...] "surly milkshake of broken rock shards... from the artistic {{misspellings}} of song titles to the lyric collage on the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the abrasive, abstract guitar noises on the songs, Pretty on the Inside reveals the band's {{fascination with the}} New York no wave art and music scene of the '80s." [...] According to Billboard, the album had sold 27,000 copies by 1994, when the band released their wildly popular follow-up album, Live Through This.|$|E

Photometric and wavelength calibration sources insure shutter positions according to operational phases...|$|R
50|$|When Manticore Records went defunct in 1977, Atlantic Records reissued {{the album}} {{with the initial}} design {{as well as with}} an {{ordinary}} vinyl packaging, which consisted of simple non fold-out outer and <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves.</b> The 'face' painting was used as the back cover of the outer sleeve.|$|R
50|$|The sleeve was {{designed}} by Barney Bubbles and came in 3x2 panel foldout, the outer 6 panels being colour, the inner 6 panels being monochrome, the discs in psychedelic patterned orange & yellow <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> were folded into this. It made Q Magazine's 100 greatest album covers list.|$|R
500|$|By 1971, Van der Graaf Generator's line-up had stabilised as {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Peter Hammill, saxophonist David Jackson, organist and bassist Hugh Banton and drummer Guy Evans. The group had been gigging extensively and became close friends after a particularly gruelling tour of Germany. Hammill wrote [...] "A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers" [...] during the tour, {{and the group}} began performing [...] "Man-Erg" [...] towards its end. To alleviate the tedium of touring, the group invented games including [...] "Crowborough Tennis" [...] which involved bouncing a ball off a table, a photograph of which was eventually used as the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> for the album.|$|E
500|$|While he {{identifies}} {{a level of}} religiosity in other songs on Dark Horse, Allison pairs the album with Material World as works that [...] "literally wear their Hinduism on their record sleeves". The front cover of Dark Horse includes a Himalayan landscape, above which floats the Nath Tradition yogi Shiv-Goraksha Babaji, while the phrase [...] "All glories to Sri Krsna" [...] appears on the back cover. Among his handwritten notes on the LP's <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve,</b> Harrison included Sripad Maharaj's name in a list headed [...] "Thanks to". The song was published by Oops Publishing (or Ganga in the United States), the new company that Harrison founded in March 1974.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the sound of tolling bells before the {{beginning}} of [...] "Poppy Day". The words were based on John McCrae's poem [...] "In Flanders Fields", which was written in 1915 after the loss of a friend during a First World War battle. [...] "Poppy Day", a short track with a long introduction building over what one journalist called [...] "shards of John McKay's guitar" [...] and a [...] "strident militaristic backbeat", had been shaped after Steven Severin had observed the televised two minutes of silence in memory of the war dead on Sunday, 12 November 1978. [...] "We wanted to write a song that would fittingly fill that gap", he stated. On the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> of the album, the mention [...] "2 minutes of silence" [...] was added next to the lyrics of the song.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic {{cylinders}} {{are designed}} {{with a series of}} steel or aluminum tubes of progressively smaller diameters nested within each other. The largest diameter sleeve is called the main or barrel. The smaller <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> are called the stages. The smallest stage is often called the plunger or piston rod.|$|R
50|$|The cover art {{features}} {{a photograph of}} the band members against a deep green background, with the band name in large rounded lower case type. The song titles are listed, also in lower case, along the left hand side of the front cover. The <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> contain the song lyrics.|$|R
5000|$|Released as {{a limited}} edition of 1200 copies pressed on black vinyl and {{packaged}} in a full-color gatefold <b>sleeve</b> with printed <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves,</b> the catalog {{number on the}} jacket reads [...] "mt093a," [...] but this an error: mt093a was the special limited edition. This standard limited edition was designated as [...] "mt093b." ...|$|R
500|$|Erica Wexler from Spin {{described}} Madonna on {{the cover}} as [...] "like a cobra basking in the hot sun, Madonna {{on the cover}} of her new album stretches her profile lasciviously." [...] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli commented in , that the album cover indicated how True Blue was a vehicle of growth for Madonna. He felt that the [...] "washed out color photograph" [...] of her with head tilted back and eyes closed was [...] "understated", especially when compared to the sexier poses she had been associated in the past. The album's <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> did not feature any photographs, and instead was dedicated to album credits and the song lyrics, since Madonna wanted to be represented by her songs on True Blue, not her image. Billboard listed the cover at rank 34 on their article about the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers", describing it as a striking image of the singer.|$|E
500|$|L.A. Woman was {{released}} on April 19, 1971. It reached number nine on the Billboard 200, remaining on the charts for 36 weeks, and reached number 28 in the UK, spending four weeks on the UK Albums Charts. The first cover pressing had a burgundy-colored, curved-corner cardboard cutout sleeve, framing a clear embossed cellophane insert, glued in from behind. Photography was credited to Wendell Hamick. According to Jac Holzman, {{chief executive officer of}} Elektra Records: [...] "I wasn't sure there would be another album ever, so I had Bill Harvey create a collector's cover. The Doors' faces were printed on clear film. The backing color of the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve</b> could be changed and would affect the mood of the package. This is the first album in which Jim is bearded [...] His photo is on the right, no bigger, no smaller than the others, just another guy in the band." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's art {{design was}} {{credited}} to Capitol's in-house designer, Roy Kohara. Harrison supplied sketches {{for each item}} of the artwork, which adopted a humorous, [...] "wacky" [...] theme throughout the packaging. The vivid-orange front cover featured a die-cut design around the words [...] "EXTRA TEXTURE", through which an inner-sleeve, blue-tinted picture of Harrison was visible. Some vinyl editions presented the words as simple blue text on an orange background, however, doing away with the expensive cut-out detail. In keeping with the album title, the thin cardboard used for the LP cover was similar in texture to the [...] "animal skin used on a football", according to Beatles author Bruce Spizer. The front cover included an Om symbol, positioned below the angled title text and also coloured blue. On {{the back of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>sleeve,</b> there was a second Henry Grossman tour photo of Harrison, clearly enjoying himself on stage.|$|E
50|$|A {{limited edition}} double LP was also made available. The LPs are {{coloured}} in blue and pink and packaged {{into a wide}} spine jacket with a gold foil imprint.

50|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{widespread}} notoriety, his cult following continues on due to the commitment of Laughing Hyena Records to honor Hickman's last request, for them and only them to continue marketing his CDs for future generations to hear per the testimony of his friend and company founder, Arnie Hoffman, as found on the <b>inner</b> <b>sleeves</b> of Hickman's CDs.|$|R
