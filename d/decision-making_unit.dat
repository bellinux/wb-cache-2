Considering the {{requirements}} of index evaluation system for data of input and output indicators and following the principles of accessibility and representative of the data, this paper selected 10 oil plants as the <b>decision-making</b> <b>units.</b> Insufficient <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> would weaken {{the applicability of the}} result, while over-sufficient <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> can lead to “overcrowding” in the data processing. Therefore, it was appropriate to select 10 <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> for evaluation. The data are from China Energy Statistical Yearbook, Petroleum Statistical Yearbook, annual reports, and other relevant sources in 2015. After collecting and organizing the data, we obtained the panel data of 10 oil plants under discussion during 2012 – 2015. In this paper, 10 oil plants (C 1, C 2, [...]..

Farmers were asked to classify 18 farming decisions (systematically selected from a pool of 100) into a series of categories of <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> (Alone, Family, Shared, Delegated) and actors (person/people involved). Frequency tables and multivariate analyses were used to analyse the data. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed to find out simple and canonical correlations between farmers'/farms' characteristics and the decision-making approaches. Factor analysis (FA) combined with a Cluster analysis (CLA) was used in order to: (1) define groups of farmers with similar decision-making approaches; and (2) define groups of decisions made by similar <b>decision-making</b> <b>units.</b> Logistic Regression was used to study the influence of the intrinsic characteristics of the decisions and the <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> involved. A Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used to graphically represent the relationships between shared and delegated decisions and the actors involved. The CCA showed that the level of dedication to farming, the educational level {{and the size of the}} farm were the characteristics more strongly influencing the decision-making approaches. Monopolisation of decisions by one decision-maker was the most frequent decision-making approach in the population since half of the decisions were made by the farmer alone. However, other approaches in which other <b>decision-making</b> <b>units,</b> mostly the family, had an important role were also frequently found in the population. FA and CLA found very well defined groups of decisions in terms of <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> involved. The logistic regression suggested that the intrinsic characteristics of the farming decisions influenced the level of involvement of the different <b>decision-making</b> <b>units.</b> Operational decisions tended to be more delegated to farm staff and family members, while technical decisions were mostly shared mainly with technical advisors and family members.

40|$|Abstract: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) {{introduces}} {{a model for}} weights determination maximizing efficiency of the <b>decision-making</b> <b>units.</b> The primary focus of the DEA model is to compare <b>decision-making</b> <b>units</b> (alternatives) {{in terms of their}} efficiency in converting inputs into outputs. The multicriteria decision making (MCDM) method VIKOR uses a common set of weights expressing a decision maker's preferences. In contrast, the CCR model of DEA does not provide a common set of weights that could express the preferences of a decision maker. The weights in MCDM do not have a clear economic significance, but their use provides the opportunity to model the real aspects of decision making, such as the preference structure. A comparison of DEA and MCDM shows that DEA resembles MCDM, but the results differ. In spite of these differences, DEA {{could be used as a}} supplement for screening alternatives within MCDM.
