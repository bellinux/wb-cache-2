40|$|The {{dynamic control}} of {{daylight}} {{has been called}} the “Holy Grail” of the fenestration industry. <b>Electrochromic</b> (EC) <b>glass</b> {{is believed to be the}} leading contender in the race to manufacture a glazing technology that will achieve the accolade set down by Steve Selkowitz in 1998. With recent investment in the scaling-up of production capacity, EC glass is now set become a mainstream glazing product. As EC glass darkens (‘tints’) the peak in the spectral transmittance curve shifts to the blue. Whilst control of the luminous and thermal environment is highly desirable, occupants are believed to prefer daylight illumination that is perceived as neutral rather than tinted. Thus the question regarding the neutrality of the illumination spectrum is an important one that needs to be addressed. In this paper the authors show that it is possible to maintain an effectively neutral spectrum of daylight illumination in a space with EC glass in normal operation, provided that a relatively small proportion of the glass is left in the clear state. A theoretical formulation giving the overall spectral transmittance curves for any arbitrary combination of clear and tinted EC glazing in varying proportions is outlined. Applying the theoretical model it should be possible to configure and/or control an actual EC glass installation so that neutral daylight illumination results.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to assess the}} visual effect of {{selected}} aspects of the building envelope on human performance and perception, first broadly, and then focused on view clarity. The initial literature review examined human factors that could be explicitly considered in building envelope design, operation and current daylight metrics. We found that debate remains on the practical applicability of these metrics, and gaps exist between daylight and other building envelope-related aspects such as view. Following the literature review, we narrowed down our research question to experimentally investigate the visual performance of fabric shading systems and electrochromic windows under both diffuse and direct sunlight conditions, and develop a view clarity rating method. We introduce and show results from an experimental study done at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Windows Testbeds. We tested High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography techniques to capture the different view clarity through the selected building envelope layers (shades and <b>electrochromic</b> <b>glass)</b> under various sky conditions. The experimental study reveals that light fabric shades restrict the view compared to dark fabric shades, and that view clarity through a blind can be significantly reduced when there is direct sun in the field of view (at certain sun angles). The direct sun caused white-spotted visual noise at the partial area of the fabric shade. Hence, the view was more obscured by the effect of the direct sun even though in this case there was a greater vertical illuminance than the others.

40|$|For several years, our {{university}} research group {{is interested in}} innovative materials {{in the field of}} energy saving, with particular attention in transparent building components, regarding, specifically, the use of <b>electrochromic</b> <b>glass</b> (EC). The EC glazing elements are able to change, under user control, the colour intensity of the glass itself which, going from light to dark, can shield 97 % of visible light transmission and 99 % solar incoming radiation. This chromatic change occurs through a chemical process of reversible oxidation-reduction that modifies, considerably and dynamically, the solar factor g (SHGC Solar Heat Gain Coefficient) and allows, at the same time, to maintain the visibility and the relationship outwards. This technology, initially studied also from some European industries, is currently marketed only by an American company that has done all the tests required by U. S. regulations and it is now preparing to operate in Europe. The high sunshine that characterizes the climate of the Mediterranean regions makes this technology particularly interesting in relation to indoor comfort, energy savings and consequently the environmental respect, that the use of these glass could bring.
