40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was to generate pregnancy associated glycoprotein (PAG) -profiles throughout pregnancy in a heterogenous sample of sheep using a radioimmunoassay with a heterologous antibody (anti-caPAG 55, 59, # 708) and utilize them for the purpose of pregnancy detection. From 2 weeks after the introduction of males into the breeding herd until 4 weeks after parturition, weekly blood samples were collected from 66 pregnant and 25 non-pregnant ewes of various breeds. Between 3 and 5 weeks after conception, plasma PAG levels increased, remained almost stable until week 17, then continued to increase, culminating in a drastic surge during the last 2 weeks of pregnancy. By 4 weeks of gestation, the plasma PAG level exceeded the level typical for non-pregnant ewes by five standard <b>deviations,</b> <b>permitting</b> a reliable pregnancy diagnosis. Plasma PAG levels were higher in twin-bearing ewes than in ewes carrying a single lamb, differences getting more evident as pregnancy proceeded. Neither breed and parity of the mother nor sex and weight of lambs home exerted a significant effect. The heterologous assay system utilizing a caprine antibody proved to deliver results that are more consistent and less depending on various variables than those used in other studies. It may be concluded that, at the present state of development, the assay provides a reliable means of diagnosing pregnancy in sheep from the 4 th week after they have been bred onward.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between Book-Tax Differences and earnings quality i. e. earnings persistence in order to assess the usefulness of accounting earnings for decision making. Managers may have incentives to increase accounting or “book” earnings while simultaneously reducing taxable income, any difference in the two measures is termed the book-tax difference (BTD). As the measurement of accounting earnings and taxable income is based on two different sets of rules differences can arise because of permissible discretion in the measurement of accounting income representing genuine economic differences. However, differences could also represent earnings management or manipulation, e. g. an increase in accounting income without a corresponding increase in real assets. Consequently this has raised calls to conform accounting earnings and taxable income in an attempt to limit the misuse of the discretion and the <b>deviation</b> <b>permitted</b> between the two measures. Nevertheless, conformity is argued to cause a loss of accounting earnings informativeness which makes them less useful for decision making. Using an earnings persistence model this study aims to address: (1) Does the contribution of the BTD in the model differ from that of underlying earnings and if so, does the nature of the contribution depend on a short term or longer-term measure of the BTDs. (2) Further, when BTDs are disaggregated into their “temporary” and “permanent” sources does the nature of the contribution change. If BTDs behave differently from underlying earnings, this will support the retention of differing measures of accounting earnings and taxable income and more directly retaining discretion in measurement of accounting earnings...|$|R

The droop control concept is adapted to improve the cooperation between power converters in order to optimally regulate voltage and dispatch the load demand.

In this paper we show by example that satisfaction of the winding number condition is not a transitive relation and examine the implications of this for cautious adaptive control...|$|R

CNODES is a distributed network of investigators and linked databases in British Columbia, Alberta, Sas-katchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Principles of operation are as follows: (1) research ques-tions are prioritized by the coordinating office of DSEN; (2) the linked data stay within the provinces; (3) for each question, a study team formulates a detailed protocol enabling consistent analyses in each province; (4) analyses are “blind ” to results obtained elsewhere; (5) protocol <b>deviations</b> are <b>permitted</b> for technical reasons only; (6) ana lyses using multivariable methods are lodged centrally with a methods team, which is responsible for combining the results to provide a summary estimate of effect.

The upward approach was taken into account while selecting HACS and carrying out the program’s other stages, although {{in most parts of the}} region (for instance in Portugal and Greece) hidden possibilities were not fully put to account. The hitch in the upward approach might have been caused by the lack of downward support.
