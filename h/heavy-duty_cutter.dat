50|$|In the Middle East DEME is {{executing}} the dredging and reclamation {{package for the}} Ruwais Refinery Expansion project of Takreer in Abu Dhabi. The work was awarded to Dredging International in May 2009 and started on 7 June 2009. A total of 42 million m3 is being dredged, pumped and reclaimed by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>cutter</b> suction dredger Al Mahar and trailing suction hopper dredgers.|$|E
5000|$|Preceding {{the current}} programme, ten major {{dredgers}} {{were added to}} the DEME fleet under the investment programme 2002-2007. This included the world's largest <b>heavy-duty</b> seagoing <b>cutter</b> suction dredger, the 28,000 kW d'Artagnan. With the construction of the Pearl River in 1994, DEME became a trendsetter for what is now [...] "considered as the first 'jumbo' trailer suction dredger"On August 1, 2002, the enlargement of Pearl River was started in Singapore. In the process the hopper capacity of Pearl River was increased from 17,000 m3 to 24,146 m3. Moreover, a large deep dredging installation for the Pearl River was built in, which allows this jumbo trailer to dredge to depths of 120 m.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} find out the cutter {{disrepair}} principle and provide a valuable reference for the design, production and use of the <b>heavy-duty</b> hard alloy <b>cutter,</b> have experiment study on machining the heat-resistant steel-the 3 Cr- 1 Mo- 1 / 4 Vsteel. First, have impact disrepair experiments with several types of different grooves milling inserts, and find out the difference of the impact disrepair invalidation types among them, and build the impact disrepair life cumulating distribution function mathematic model. Second, based on the adhering disrepair experiments, find out the difference of the adhering disrepair invalidation types, build the quantitative mathematic relation between milling temperature and maximal adhering disrepair depth on rake face of the cutter, and analyze the rule that the milling temperature affects the adhering disrepair. And then, {{on the basis of the}} scene machining, have analysis on cutter disrepair phenomenon and mechanism under the joint action of force and heat, so to provide a theoretical basis on how to avoid premature failure of the tool for the actual production process...|$|R
5000|$|According to Mort J. Richardson in The Dynamics of Dredging Ackermans & van Haaren held {{a leading}} {{position}} in technological innovation, {{from the very}} beginning. In 1895 Ackermans & van Haaren was at the cradle of hydraulic dredging techniques and successfully designed a suction dredger, capable of unloading by its own. In the same year, a first vessel of that type was built and christended as Schelde II. Société Générale de Dragage/Algemene Baggermaatschappij (SGD) realized the very first application of a submersible pump in dredging, when such a device was developed and fixed on the drag head of TSHD Maas. At {{the time of her}} commissioning in September 1994 DEME's 17,000 m3 flagship Pearl River became, according to Richardson (p. 11), [...] "the very first suction hopper dredge of a completely new generation - featuring twice as much capacity as its biggest successor." [...] In 2005 DEME's French subsidiary Société de Dragage International (SDI) launched the world's largest <b>heavy-duty</b> and ocean-going <b>cutter</b> suction dredger d'Artagnan (28,200 kW installed power).|$|R
