5|$|Youthanasia is {{the sixth}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on November 1, 1994 through Capitol Records. The album {{is not a}} large stylistic departure from the band's earlier recordings; however it marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following {{the footsteps of the}} previous album Countdown to Extinction (1992). The album's title is a play on words, implying that society is euthanizing its youth. The cover art features an elderly woman hanging babies by their <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seemingly endless clothesline; the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track.|$|E
25|$|Antennae are {{generally}} sensitive to signals {{only when they}} have a length that is {{a significant portion of the}} wavelength, or larger. A common example is the half-wave dipole. For longwave use, this resulted in loop antennae tens of <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> side, often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal. This presented a significant problem in arranging for the antenna to be rotated. The US Navy overcame this problem, to a point, by mounting long antennae on ships and sailing in circles.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

When directing animation for early episodes, one of Stephen Hillenburg's goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs' walk cycle with the intention of making it cartoonish.

[...] Perceiving that the coast at Santa Barbara was vulnerable to attack, he located a spot near a harbor which was sheltered from severe storms. [...] In addition, there was an ample supply of both building materials and water nearby. [...] Construction began on April 21, 1782, and Padre Junípero Serra blessed the site. [...] By the next year, a temporary facility had been completed, and a wheat field planted by the local Chumash Indians of Chief Yanonalit. [...] The early Presidio consisted of mud and brush walls around a quadrangle 330 <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> side. The post had 61 officers and men in 1783.|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's like you have a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E

He's called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here." [...] Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself to be a Republican with no interest in running for president.|$|E

[...] Christ appears in the centre of both rows; in the top row as a law-giver or teacher between his chief followers, Peter and Paul (the Traditio Legis), and on the bottom entering Jerusalem. Both scenes borrow from pagan Roman iconography: in [...] the top one Jesus is sitting with his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> billowing cloak representing the sky, carried by Caelus, the classical personification of the heavens.

The enclosed room is for smaller objects that have been found during the years the site has been explored, most coming from the Pyramid of the Niches. One of the most interesting objects on display is an altar from Building 4. It is a large stone slab sculpted to depict four individuals standing in pairs with a figure of intertwined snakes between the two pairs. The snakes represent the ball game marker called the tlaxmalacatle in Aztec times. [...] The main exhibits of the roofed area are the fragments recovered from the Building of the Columns, with a number partially reassembled. One tells the story of 13 Rabbit, a ruler of El Tajin who [...] probably had the building constructed. The scene shows as dual procession with 13 Rabbit seated on a wooden throne and his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> severed head. In front is a sacrifice victim with his entrails slung over a frame. 13 Rabbit’s name glyph appears above as well as an attendant named 4 Axe.

2500|$|The 1912 {{session of}} Parliament opened on 14 February with a stated intent by the Liberal Party in the King's Speech to {{introduce}} a new Home Rule Bill. The bill was to be introduced on 11 April, and four days before that Law travelled to Ulster for {{a tour of the}} area. The pinnacle of this was a meeting on 9 April in the grounds of the Royal Agricultural Society near Balmoral (an area of Belfast), attended by seventy Unionist MPs, the Primate of All Ireland and topped by [...] "perhaps the largest Union Jack ever made" [...] – 48 feet by 25 <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flagpole 90 feet high. At the meeting both Law and Carson swore to the crowd that [...] "never under any circumstances will we submit to Home Rule". However, the Parliament Act and the government majority made such a victory against the Bill unlikely unless the government could be brought down or Parliament dissolved. A second problem was that not all Unionists opposed Home Rule to the same degree; some hardcore Unionists would oppose any attempt at Home Rule, others thought it inevitable that the Bill would pass and were simply trying to get the best deal possible for Ulster. The spectre of civil war was also raised– the Ulstermen began to form paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteers, and there was a strong possibility that if it came to fighting the British Army would have to be sent in to support the underfunded and understaffed Royal Irish Constabulary.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{important}} monuments {{are in the}} chancel and the chapel. [...] Behind the altar is the free-standing tomb chest of Sir Thomas St. Pol, who died in 1588, and his wife.

[...] On top of the chest are effigies {{of a man and a}} woman. [...] The man is dressed in plate armour and is holding a sword and a prayer book. His head rests on a helmet, his <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cushion. [...] The woman is wearing a long dress, a cloak and a hat,and is holding a Bible. [...] Above them is a canopy carried by six pillars. [...] The entablature is decorated with an egg and dart frieze. [...] On the top of the canopy, above each pillar, is the statue of a weeping figure. [...] In the centre is an altar, in front of which is a kneeling female figure, and on the top is a male figure, also kneeling. [...] The whole monument is painted and gilded. [...] On the north side of the chapel is the tomb of Sir George St. Pol, who died in 1613, and his wife. [...] On the side of the tomb are three niches. [...] The central niche contains a carving of Sir George's daughter, and the lateral niches have mourning putti. [...] On the tomb are two recumbent effigies, each lying on their right side, propped on an elbow. [...] The nearer effigy is a female in mourning dress with a ruff and a hat, holding a prayer book. [...] Behind in a higher position on a step is a male figure in plate armour, holding a sword. [...] The effigies are contained in a semicircular-headed recess, the archivolt of which is decorated with roses. [...] The back wall has an inscribed panel surrounded by scrolls and memento mori. [...] At the sides are pillars supporting a frieze and an entablature. [...] On top of the monument are flaming urns, an achievement of arms, shields and obelisks. [...] In the north wall of the chapel is an alabaster painted and gilded plaque to Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick who died in 1619. [...] It contains a circular medallion carved with the head and shoulders of the deceased, behind which is the profile of his wife. [...] On each side are pilasters, and above is an entablature [...] carrying a coat of arms and heraldic supporters. [...] Underneath is a panel inscribed with a poem. [...] This memorial is thought to have been made by Epiphanius Evesham. [...] Elsewhere, on the east wall of the chapel and the south wall of the chancel, are brass memorial plaques.|$|E
