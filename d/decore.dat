This enabled the party to displace the New Democrats to become the Official Opposition to the Progressive Conservative government of Ralph Klein.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the Liberal Party {{was led by}} Laurence <b>Decore,</b> {{a former}} mayor of Edmonton. Despite being the {{smallest}} of the three parties in the legislature, the Liberals made major gains by shifting to the political right and criticizing the Conservatives' fiscal responsibility, the province's rapidly rising debt, and the government's involvement in the private sector which resulted in some companies defaulting on government loans.|$|E
500|$|Mizoguchi {{based his}} film on two stories from Ueda's book, [...] "The House in the Thicket" [...] (Asaji ga Yado) and [...] "The Lust of the White Serpent" [...] (Jasei no In). [...] "The Lust of the White Serpent" [...] {{is about a}} demon who appears as a princess and {{attempts}} to seduce a man. It was {{the basis of the}} plot in which Lady Wakasa seduces Genjurō. [...] "The House in the Thicket" [...] gave the film its ending, in which the protagonist returns home after a long absence, only to meet the spirit of his lost wife. Other inspirations for the film's script include Guy de Maupassant's <b>Décoré!</b> (How He Got the Legion of Honour). This story provided a basis for Tōbei's subplot. In the short story, the protagonist receives the French Legion of Honour by ignoring his wife's adultery with a member of the Legion. Similarly, Tōbei becomes a samurai while his wife becomes a prostitute.|$|E

500|$|Getty {{called the}} 1989 {{election}} {{less than three}} years into his 1986 mandate {{to take advantage of the}} economic optimism prevalent in the province, partly as a result of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement. [...] While the P.C.s made spending promises including paving all of the province's secondary highways, the Liberals under new leader Laurence <b>Decore</b> stressed dealing with the deficit. [...] The overall end result was respectable for the government, as it won a sixth term in government with a net loss of only two seats. [...] However, Getty was defeated in his own riding by Liberal Percy Wickman. [...] Brian C. Downey resigned his seat in the rural central Alberta riding of Stettler to allow Getty to run in a by-election, which he won handily. [...] He built a home in the riding on Buffalo Lake, and was later accused of arranging for the lake to be risen so it would be better-suited for fishing (though Adair claimed that the arrangements had been in place since 1979, when he had been Minister of Recreation, Parks and Wildlife).|$|E
2500|$|The Liberals {{capitalized}} on the stagnant PC vote {{and the collapse}} of the New Democratic Party vote from 26% to 11%. [...] As opposition to the PC government coalesced around <b>Decore</b> and the Liberals, they managed to win almost 40% of the popular vote and 32 seats in the legislature, including every seat in Edmonton. They formed what still stands as the largest opposition caucus in Alberta history with the exception of 1917, when the government majority was smaller but there were far fewer seats in the legislature. To the surprise of many, <b>Decore</b> stepped down as Liberal leader not long after the election, supposedly being pressured to resign by party insiders who felt that he missed the chance to form the government.|$|E
2500|$|Ray Martin's New Democrats, {{previously}} {{the official}} opposition, were {{shut out of}} the legislature altogether {{for the first time since}} 1967. All of their seats in Edmonton—including Martin's--were lost to the Liberals, due to the popularity of <b>Decore</b> there. [...] Martin suggested that tactical voting was to blame as well, as the anti-PC vote consolidated around the Liberals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{basic information}} about new processes for cores for cylinder heads production with alkali silicate based inorganic binders. Inorganic binders {{are coming back}} to the foreground due to their ecologically friendly nature and new technologies for cores production and new binder systems were developed. Basically these binder systems are modified alkali silicates and therefore they carry some well-known unfavourable properties with their usage. To compensate these disadvantages, the binder systems are working with additives which are most often in powder form and are added in the moulding material. This paper deals with <b>decoring</b> behaviour of different moulding sands as well as the influence of chosen additives on knock-out properties in laboratory terms. For this purpose, specific methods of specimen production are described. Developed methods are then used to compare <b>decoring</b> behaviour of chosen sands and binder systems...|$|R
2500|$|The Alberta general {{election}} of 1993 was the twenty-third {{general election}} for the Province of Alberta, Canada. It {{was held on}} June 15, 1993 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. It is notable because it was seen {{by some as a}} contest between the former mayors of Calgary and Edmonton, Ralph Klein and Laurence <b>Decore,</b> respectively. [...] Before eventually being defeated in 2015, it remained the closest the Progressive Conservatives had come to losing since coming to power in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|As an alderman, Reimer {{supported}} changing aldermen's titles to [...] "councillor", {{stating that}} while the title didn't offend her, it should be changed {{out of respect for}} others' sensibilities. [...] Early in her third term, she and Hayter jointly called for reform of Edmonton's ward system – specifically, Reimer supported increasing the number of wards from six to twelve and halving the number of aldermen per ward to one. [...] The proposal was defeated, in part because mayor Laurence <b>Decore,</b> just re-elected in a landslide, suggested that reform wasn't needed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, mayor Laurence <b>Decore</b> {{resigned}} {{to lead the}} Alberta Liberal Party, and Terry Cavanagh was selected by council to complete his term. [...] Reimer challenged Cavanagh's bid to keep the job in the 1989 election. [...] The campaign was acrimonious: Cavanagh called Reimer's endorsement by the Canadian Union of Public Employees a [...] "blatant attempt to muscle votes for an opponent," [...] and suggested that Reimer harboured a [...] "socialist hidden agenda" [...] and that the city would become known as [...] "Redmonton" [...] if she was elected. [...] Reimer won a landslide victory.|$|E

40|$|Sand cores {{are used}} to produce {{internal}} cavities of metallic cast parts with complex shapes like automotive cylinder heads. Foundry cores are granular materials made of sand grains aggregated with binder bridges. In the cold box coring process, the binder is a polyurethane resin. It is noteworthy that during the casting of the liquid metal, the polymer binder is seriously damaged. This kind of materials has been poorly investigated so far. This study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour and fracture of cores subjected to various loads and thermal ageing. Particularly, the focus is on the <b>decoring</b> step, which consists in removing the sand by hammering and vibration of the metallic part after casting. This major project, generated from the collaboration of the aluminum casting company Montupet, and two laboratories Centre des Matériaux (CdM) and MATEIS, includes both experimental and numerical activities in order to model the <b>decoring</b> step of cylinder heads based on empiric data. Here, the experimental part of the work is presented...|$|R
2500|$|On July 31, 1987, {{a devastating}} tornado (ranked F4 on the Fujita scale; main article: Edmonton tornado) hit {{the city and}} killed 27 people. The storm hit the areas of Beaumont, Mill Woods, Bannerman, Fraser, and Evergreen. The day became known as [...] "Black Friday." [...] Then-mayor Laurence <b>Decore</b> cited the community's {{response}} to the tornado as evidence that Edmonton was a [...] "city of champions," [...] which popularized the city's unofficial slogan originally coined in 1984 to promote Edmonton. It was further popularized in a sporting context later in 1987 upon the Edmonton Eskimos winning the Grey Cup after the Edmonton Oilers won the Stanley Cup earlier in the year.|$|E
2500|$|Getty {{knew that}} the Tories faced a {{statutory}} general election in 1993. [...] With polls showing the Liberals far ahead, Getty decided to retire from politics. Under former Edmonton mayor Laurence <b>Decore,</b> the Liberals had made major gains by criticizing the Progressive Conservatives' fiscal responsibility, the province's rapidly rising debt, and the government's involvement {{in the private sector}} which resulted in some companies defaulting on government loans. Klein campaigned for the leadership in part by making arguments similar to Decore's. [...] He favoured a near-immediate balancing of the provincial budget and rapid debt repayment thereafter, and declared his government [...] "out of the business of business". Klein was elected leader of the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party on December 5, 1992, and became the Premier of Alberta on December 14, 1992. He led the party to victory in the 1993 election, winning 51 of the 83 seats in the legislature, and almost 45% of the popular vote. [...] The 32 opposition MLAs—all Liberals—would be the most opposition that Klein would face during his 12 years as premier.|$|E

By the time Klein dropped the writs, his party had regained the lead on polls.|$|R
