The problem is formulated {{in terms of the}} electrostatic potential and the <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> which have prescribed spatial mean values. The free energy of the system is decomposed as the difference of the internal energy and entropy functionals. The entropy functional is the sum of an ideal entropy and an excess entropy, the latter taking into account non-ideality due to electrostatic correlations at low <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> and steric exclusion effects at high <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations.</b> We derive sufficient conditions to achieve convexity of the entropy functional, yielding a convex-concave free energy functional. Our main result is the existence and uniqueness of the saddle point of the free energy functional and its characterization as a solution of the original model problem. The proof hinges on positive uniform lower bounds for the <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> and uniform upper bounds for the <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the electrostatic potential.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} electrostatic {{properties of}} an ionic solution with multiple ionic species of possibly different ionic sizes. Such properties are {{described by the}} minimization of an electrostatic free-energy functional of <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Bounds are obtained for <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> with low electrostatic free energies. Such bounds are used {{to show that there}} exists a unique set of equilibrium <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> that minimizes the free-energy functional. The equilibrium <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> are found to depend sorely on the equilibrium electrostatic potential, resembling the classical Boltzmann distributions that relate the equilibrium <b>ionic</b> <b>concentrations</b> to the equilibrium electrostatic potential. Unless all the ionic and and solvent molecular sizes are assumed to be the same, explicit formulas of such dependence are, however, not available in general. It is nevertheless proved that in equilibrium the ionic charge density is a decreasing function of the electrostatic potential. This determines a variational principle with a convex functional for the electrostatic potential. Mathematical Subject Classification: 35 J 20, 35 J 60, 49 S 05, 81 V 55, 92 E 99. ...|$|R
