500|$|Critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar {{work as an}} {{integral}} element of Pink Floyd's sound. Rolling Stone ranked Gilmour number 14 in their [...] "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" [...] list and di Perna described him {{as the most important}} guitarist of the 1970s, calling him [...] "the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen." [...] In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: [...] " [...] fingers make a distinctive sound... aren't very fast, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> instantly recognisable... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.|$|E
500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E

2500|$|Symington ran {{for reelection}} {{to a second}} term in 1994. In the Republican primary, Symington was {{challenged}} by Barbara Barrett, wife of business executive Craig Barrett. In regard to his primary campaign message, Symington stated [...] "I vowed to get state spending under control, reduce taxes and {{do my best to}} promote economic development and restore strength to the economy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in a strong position because I accomplished my goals." [...] Barrett had spent more than $1 million of her own money in the attempt to defeat Symington, who she stated she did not dislike personally, but simply felt that she could do a better job as Governor. On September 13, 1994, Symington defeated Barrett in the primary by a margin of 68% to 32%. Political analysts stated that Barrett had failed to distinguish herself from the incumbent Governor, and ran a flawed campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The young United States also faced {{criticism}} {{on political}} and ideological grounds. Ceaser argues that the Romantic strain of European thought and literature, hostile to the Enlightenment view of reason and obsessed with history and national character, disdained the rationalistic American project. The German poet Nikolaus Lenau commented: [...] "With the expression Bodenlosigkeit (absence of ground), <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> able to indicate the general character of all American institutions; what we call Fatherland is here only a property insurance scheme". Ceaser argues in his essay that such comments often repurposed the language of degeneracy, and the prejudice came to focus solely on the United States and not Canada and Mexico. Lenau had emigrated to the United States in 1833 {{and found that the}} country did not live up to his ideals, leading him to return to Germany the following year. His experiences in the USA were the subject of a novel entitled Tired of America (Der Amerika-Müde) (1855) by fellow German Ferdinand Kürnberger.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1890s, he {{had many}} songs in his repertory, {{and he was in}} demand from audiences. The Entr'Acte wrote, [...] "Champion is a comic singer who is endowed with genuine humour, which is {{revealed}} in his several songs, of which the audience never seems to get enough". His earliest known recording success was in 1896 with [...] "In the World Turned Upside Down", followed by [...] "Down Fell the Pony in a Fit" [...] in 1897. In 1898 Champion ceased his style of alternating songs and patter and instead adopted a quick fire delivery in order for him to perform as many songs as he could during his act. He retained this style of delivery for the remainder of his career, remarking, [...] "At one time I used to sing songs with plenty of patter but I changed the style for a new idea of my own, and started [...] "quick singing". <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the only comedian who sings songs all in a lump, as you may say".|$|E
