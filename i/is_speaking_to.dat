He holds her hand as he raps his verse, the milk package falls from her hand as she holds his, thus spilling milk on the floor. When Drake's verse is over, Rihanna pushes him and walks away with a smile.|$|E

500|$|Bowman {{made use}} of a Steadicam for those scenes {{featured}} Mulder inside the train, and kept the character away from {{the centre of the}} screen, to accentuate his [...] "paranoid" [...] mindset. This was deliberately contrasted with the concurrent scene featuring Scully, who <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> Mulder over a telephone. This was shot using a camera dolly and a [...] "graphically balanced" [...] mise-en-scène, intended to leave the character seeming as [...] "balanced, confident, strong" [...] as [...] "the Rock of Gibraltar". Bowman, who felt that the finished episode [...] "was really like a movie", has stated that his cut of the episode impressed series creator Chris Carter enough for Carter to offer Bowman the job of directing the series' film adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|Verb {{forms are}} {{extremely}} complex, agreeing with the subject, direct object, and indirect object; and include forms that agree with a [...] "dative of interest" [...] for intransitive verbs {{as well as}} allocutive forms where the verb form is altered if one <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> a close acquaintance. These allocutive forms also have different forms {{depending on whether the}} addressee is male or female. This is the only area in Basque grammar where gender plays any role at all. Subordination could also plausibly be considered an inflectional category of the Basque verb since subordination is signaled by prefixes and suffixes on the conjugated verb, further multiplying the number of potential forms.|$|E
2500|$|After their meeting, Fertility calls Tender {{thinking}} she {{has called the}} crisis hotline. [...] Tender soon realizes it's Fertility, so he begins {{to talk to her}} in a fake voice. Because it is revealed later that Fertility is psychic and knows [...] "everything", it is understood that she knows at this point that she <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> Tender. She talks about her brother's suicide and how she met Tender ("a pretty weird guy") at the mausoleum, mentioning how he reminded her of a Creedish cult member, and adding that he was extremely unattractive and she believed him to be Trevor's ex-homosexual lover. Eventually, she asks the man at the [...] "crisis hotline" [...] (i.e. Tender) to have phone sex with her, but he hangs up after turning her down. He then stops answering his phone in fear that Fertility will be on the other line, wanting to have phone sex or growing more attracted to him as a mysterious voice than as a person.|$|E
2500|$|Paul's {{announcement}} {{that he is}} not [...] "ashamed" [...] (epaiscúnomai) of his gospel because it holds power (dúnamis). These two verses form a backdrop {{for the rest of the}} book. First, we note that Paul is unashamed of his love for this gospel that he preaches about Jesus Christ. He also notes that he <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> the [...] "Jew first." [...] There is significance to this, but much of it is scholarly conjecture as the relationship of Paul the Apostle and Judaism is still debated. We are hard-pressed to find an answer to such a question without knowing more about the audience in question. Wayne Brindle argues, based on Paul's former writings against the Judaizers in Galatians and 2Corinthians, that rumors had probably spread about Paul totally negating the Jewish existence in a Christian world (see also Antinomianism in the New Testament and Supersessionism). Paul may have used the [...] "Jew first" [...] approach to counter such a view.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} each week, each housemate is {{required}} to sit down and be interviewed about the past week's events. Unlike the normal day-to-day taping, these interviews, which are referred to as [...] "confessionals," [...] involve the subject looking directly into the camera while providing opinions and reflective accounts of the week's activities, which are used in the final, edited episodes. The producers instruct the cast to talk about whatever they wish, and to speak in complete sentences, to reinforce the perception {{on the part of the}} home viewer that the cast <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> them. Winick described this practice as [...] "like therapy without the help." [...] The confessionals were originally conducted by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray, but were eventually delegated to production staff members like George Verschoor and Thomas Klein. Beginning with the second season (Los Angeles), a small soundproof room was incorporated into each house for this purpose, which itself has also become known as the Confessional. (The soundproofing practice appears to have been discontinued in later seasons.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Parsons {{maintains}} that the Haustafeln in Ephesians and Colossians are clearly written to those within the church, not those outside. Many believe that in the 2Corinthians passage, the apostle Paul <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> situations of, at a minimum, potential disorder in the churches—to include the breaking of all social order. Therefore, he believes {{the purpose of the}} New Testament Household Codes likely was a call to order in an unruly church. But Parsons says whatever the overall purpose of each particular Haustafel might have been, it is certain that the paired relationships are explained by their relationship to Christ. [...] "Correspondingly new behavior is expected from Christian believers in each of those social situations. Each member of the three pairs is equal to the other 'in Christ', but they are not to presume on that new position and make it an excuse for behaving in any unchristian manner." [...] There is no room in an [...] "in Christ" [...] relationship for feelings of antagonism, of superiority and inferiority, or of dehumanizing pride.|$|E

Don Giovanni, relieved {{that he is}} unrecognised, readily promises it, and asks who has disturbed her peace. Before she can answer, Donna Elvira returns and tells Donna Anna and Don Ottavio that Don Giovanni is a false-hearted seducer. Don Giovanni tries to convince Don Ottavio and Donna Anna that Donna Elvira is insane (Quartet: [...] "" [...] – [...] "Don't trust him, oh sad one"). As Don Giovanni leaves, Donna Anna suddenly recognizes him as her father's murderer and tells Don Ottavio {{the story of his}} intrusion, claiming that she was deceived at first because she was expecting a night visit from Don Ottavio himself, but managed to fight Don Giovanni off after discovering the imposture (long recitative exchange between Donna Anna and Don Ottavio). [...] She repeats her demand that he avenge her and points out that he will be avenging himself as well (aria: [...] "Or sai chi l'onore Rapire a me volse" [...] – [...] "Now you know who wanted to rob me of my honour"). [...] Don Ottavio, not yet convinced (Donna Anna having only recognised Don Giovanni's voice, not seen his face), resolves {{to keep an eye on}} his friend ("" [...] – [...] "On her peace my peace depends").|$|E

2500|$|Lockhart {{believed}} that Scott knew his Journal {{would eventually be}} published, but he nevertheless called it [...] "The most candid Diary that ever man penned". [...] The theme of the Journals candour has been taken up by many later critics. [...] C. S. Lewis considered that it was [...] "One of the sincerest books in the world, and (what is {{not exactly the same}} thing) full of self-knowledge." [...] The novelist John Buchan wrote that [...] "It {{is one of the most}} complete expressions of a human soul that we possess… There is no reticence and no posturing, because he <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> his own soul…The greatest figure he ever drew is in the Journal, and it is the man Walter Scott." [...] W. E. K. Anderson added the other side of the coin: [...] "It is candid about Scott himself. [...] It is neither informative nor candid about other people." [...] The novelist and critic A. N. Wilson judged it to be a truthful record of an unusual kind:There is nothing in it which can be contradicted by other biographical evidence…Yet there is something extremely conscious about it. [...] It is far more than a work of art. [...] Scott was not making himself out to be someone that he was not; rather, the Journal is his record of how he made himself conform to the heroic standards of his own fictions…Scott was intent on facing [...] with the bravado of Burley and the stubbornness of Jeanie Deans.|$|E
2500|$|The next week, Kim {{notices that}} Ray has {{a string of}} missed calls on his mobile phone, and {{suspects}} he is having an affair.

They went on to say that if Ray reveals what he is up to, he could be the first suspect to be eliminated. Soaplife said that Kat never has her mobile out of her hand, so when Kim catches Ray texting a mystery woman, it could mean that he is texting Kat. Inside Soap also wondered if this was evidence of Ray being Kat's secret lover. Carena Crawford from All About Soap said that when Ray is seen with flowers heading for the tube and on the phone saying he is meeting the person he <b>is</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to,</b> at the same time Kat is on her phone arranging to meet her lover, she thought it was [...] "the biggest clue yet" [...] that it could be Ray, especially when they later return to the pub at the same time.
