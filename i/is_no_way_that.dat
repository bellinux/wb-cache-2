25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation might benefit future generations {{at the expense of}} current generations, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations. If, for example, some countries were to benefit from future climate change but others lose out, {{there is no guarantee that}} the winners would compensate the losers; similarly, if some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others lose out, there would likewise be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers.|$|E
500|$|The falsification {{principle}} {{has been}} developed as an alternative theory by which {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement [...] "God loves us" [...] both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.|$|E
500|$|The writer Susan Leckey {{described}} Jacques as [...] "one of the best-loved British comedy stars", while Jacques's obituarist in The Times {{observed that}} [...] "she was invariably successful" [...] at making people [...] "laugh with, {{rather than at}} you". Peter Chapman of The Independent stated that Jacques was [...] "blessed with remarkable grace, delicacy and warmth, giving her an almost unique comic appeal". Sunday Life said that for decades she was [...] "Britain's favourite silly, sexually frustrated, fat woman". Nina Wadia of Goodness Gracious Me considers Jacques along with Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor to have [...] "paved the way for younger comediennes in Britain today", remarking that [...] "if {{it had not been}} for women like Hattie and Barbara, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> younger actresses would have any role model, or probably the ambition to do what they do".|$|E

I don't suppose it was anyone's fault. Maybe it got far too much {{attention}} for very little effort in the early stages, because of what I'd done in the past." [...] He also added that the [...] "band wasn't working out cos the singer, Chris, wanted to persue a solo career in tandem, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> going to work for me".|$|R

2500|$|Until his 1985 ouster, Rifaat al-Assad was {{considered}} the face of corruption by the Syrian people. Although highly paid as Commander of Defense Companies, he accumulated unexplained wealth.

She also stated that she had as much legal experience as Mason and criticized the defense attorneys for taking on the media before mentioning Caylee Anthony's name in their news conference and stated that [...] "here <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> this is a verdict that speaks the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sheldrake {{responded to}} Rose's article, stating {{that there was}} {{experimental}} evidence that showed that [...] "memories can survive {{the destruction of the}} putative memory traces". Rose subsequently responded, asking Sheldrake to [...] "get his facts straight", explaining the research and concluding that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> this straightforward and impressive body of evidence can be taken to imply that memories are not in the brain, still less that the brain is tuning into some indeterminate, undefined, resonating and extra-corporeal field".|$|E

Hollis explained, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> I could ever play again {{a lot of the stuff}} I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|E

50|$|When Captain Nairac {{showed the}} photographs, Mr. Holroyd started to object, {{not because he}} objected to {{an active member of}} IRA being assassinated in a highly illegal {{cross-border}} raid but because he realised that once the British state started to perpetrate such methods there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> eventually Britain would not alienate vast sections of the community and eventually lose the struggle for {{the hearts and minds of}} the Irish people.|$|R
5000|$|As {{was pointed}} out by George Bright, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> a sober {{analysis}} of Japan and China's economic and military potential would have led Wells to attribute to them such might - even assuming, as the book does, an incredibly fast industrialisation of China, a backward and predominantly agrarian country {{at the time of}} writing. Rather, this theme is clearly linked to fears of the [...] "Yellow Peril", prevalent in Edwardian Britain as in other Western countries.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that in late November 2012, Kat's lover would [...] "turn stalker", with Inside Soap saying that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the mystery man is letting her get away so easily [...] That's proved when he ups his game to get Kat {{to meet with him}} at their lovenest". An insider told the magazine that Kat's man is [...] "persistent, ruthless and utterly fixated on her. This could be a very dangerous game for Kat to play. Might the man who loves her completely destroy her life?" [...] It was also reported in November that Derek would be killed off from the series at Christmas, and it was speculated that he would be murdered. Alfie and Kat were both named as suspects, amongst many others, with Soaplife saying that if Derek is Kat's lover, he might turn violent if she continues to reject him and she might be forced to kill him, or Alfie might find out that Derek is Kat's lover and murder him in revenge, referring back to Richie's reminders that Alfie had been in jail and would want to harm Kat's lover. In fact, Alfie quickly became the favourite with bookmakers William Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Ronaldo was {{the last}} Brazilian player {{out of the tunnel}} as the teams entered the field. During the playing of the Brazil {{national}} anthem the camera focused on him throughout, with Ronaldo showing little emotion. Steinberg states that Ronaldo [...] "sleepwalked" [...] through the final in what was a below par performance for the striker, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated [...] "for the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off", but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0. Ronaldo later reflected: [...] "We lost the World Cup but I won another cup - my life." [...] An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission [...] "imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost. At that moment I'd have to go and live on the North Pole." [...] Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he {{would have been able to}} perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit." [...] Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier, Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final, and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer.|$|E
