40|$|Having {{negative}} impacts {{on environment and}} the scarcity of resources of conventional fossil fuels, fuel cell technology draws more attention as an alternative for providing the electrical energy in parallel with thermal energy. In this study, a single tubular solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with an electrolyte of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia 8 mol ceramic powder was experimentally investigated. The investigation illustrated the effects of three different fuel flow-rates (175 ml/min, 250 ml/min and 325 ml/min) and two operating temperatures (650 degrees C and 750 degrees C) on the output electrical and thermal powers. The highest electrical voltage (open circuit) and overall output power of the cell {{were found to be}} 1. 1 V and 5. 30 W respectively for the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> of 250 ml/min at the operating temperature of 750 degrees C. The electrical power and efficiency were increased about 18. 80 and 1. 27 respectively for the increase of operating temperature from 650 degrees C to 750 degrees C for a constant <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> of 250 ml/min, where; thermal power and efficiency were increased about 33. 33 and 10. 51 respectively for the same condition. The overall efficiencies of the fuel cell were obtained about 80. 42, 77. 49 and 60. 73 for the fuel flow-rates of 175 ml/min, 250 ml/min and 325 ml/min respectively for the operating temperatures of 650 degrees C. On the other hand, the overall efficiency of the cell was found to be 83. 38 at the operating temperature of 750 degrees C and <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> of 250 ml/min. The investigation recommends that for achieving higher efficiency, <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> should be lower and operating temperature should be higher. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) {{methodology}} {{has been}} used to model the combustion dynamics in a realistic swirl-stabilized dump combustor. A novel partially-premixed flamelet combustion model is employed to capture the interaction of the unsteady flame-front with local velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations. Two sets of simulations have been conducted which employ this combustion model. First, the model is used to simulate temporal variations in the mean inlet <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> mimicking pressure and fuel feed-line interaction, a major source of instabilities. The second application models the effects of unmixedness as a result of spatial various in the inlet equivalence ratio. A baseline, uniform equivalence ratio simulation is also reported and is used for comparison. It is shown that the present model is capable of capturing the combustion dynamics under both temporal and spatial fluctuations in the equivalence ratio. ...|$|E

This paper presents an overview of existing software packages, along {{with the development of}} a new multipurpose driving cycle simulator implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment. In order to evaluate the performance of the simulator, a MAN TGL 12. 240 multi-usage delivery vehicle was fitted with a CAN-bus data logger and used to create a series of 'real-life' drive cycles. These were inputted into the vehicle model and the simulated <b>fuel</b> mass <b>flow-rate</b> and engine rotational speed were compared to those experimentally obtained.

40|$|Laminar gas jet {{diffusion}} flames represent a fundamental combustion configuration. Their study {{has contributed to}} numerous advances in combustion, including the development of analytical and computational combustion tools. Laminar jet flames are pertinent also to turbulent flames by use of the laminar flamelet concept. Investigations into the shapes of noncoflowing microgravity laminar {{jet diffusion}} flames have primarily been pursued in the NASA Lewis 2. 2 -second drop tower, by Cochran and coworkers and by Bahadori and coworkers. These studies were generally conducted at atmospheric pressure; they involved soot-containing flames and reported luminosity lengths and widths instead of the flame-sheet dimensions which are of Greater value to theory evaluation and development. The seminal model of laminar diffusion flames is that of Burke and Schumann, who solved the conservation of momentum equation for a jet flame in a coflowing ambient by assuming the velocity of fuel, oxidizer and products to be constant throughout. Roper and coworkers improved upon this model by allowing for axial variations of velocity and found flame shape to be independent of coflow velocity. Roper's suggestion that flame height should be independent of gravity level is not supported by past or present observations. Other models have been presented by Klajn and Oppenheim, Markstein and De Ris, Villermaux and Durox, and Li et al. The common result of all these models (except in the buoyant regime) is that flame height is proportional to fuel mass flowrate, with flame width proving {{much more difficult to}} predict. Most existing flame models have been compared with shapes of flames containing soot, which is known to obscure the weak blue emission of flame sheets. The present work involves measurements of laminar gas jet diffusion flame shapes. Flame images have been obtained for buoyant and nonbuoyant methane flames burning in quiescent air at various <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rates,</b> burner diameters and ambient pressures. Soot concentrations were minimized by selecting conditions at low flowrates and low ambient pressures; this allows identification of actual flame sheets associated with blue emissions of CH and CO 2. The present modeling effort follows that of Roper and is useful in explaining many of the trends observed...|$|R
40|$|The T 4 {{shock tunnel}} at The University of Queensland is {{regularly}} used to perform supersonic combustion experiments. The {{fuel for the}} test model is supplied using a Ludwieg-tube delivery system. A combination of theoretical modelling and calibration tests is {{used to determine the}} mass <b>flow-rate</b> of <b>fuel</b> for given Ludwieg tube initials conditions and the measured pressure in the plenum chamber that supplies the fuel to the model. The theoretical model used in the calibration procedure is presented. The goal of this project is to check the suitability of the modelling assumptions by simulating the complete Ludwieg-tube system using the one-dimensional Lagrangian computer code, L 1 d. Simulation of the fuel delivery system is done separately for viscous and inviscid flow with conditions replicating those used in supersonic combustion tests in T 4. The steady plenum pressures from the simulations of inviscid and viscous flow are, on average, within ± 7 % and ± 4 %, respectively, of the values measured experimentally. Further, the <b>fuel</b> mass <b>flow-rates</b> obtained from viscous simulations are, on average, within ± 13 % of the experimental values...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of laminar inverse diffusion flames (IDFs) of methane and ethylene was studied using a cylindrical co-flowing burner. Several flames {{of the same}} <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> yet various air flow-rates were examined. Heights of visible flames were obtained using measurements of hydroxyl (OH) laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and visible images. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) LIF and soot laser-induced incandescence (LII) were also measured. In visible images, radiating soot masks the blue region typically associated with the flame height in normal diffusion flames (NDFs). Increased air flow-rates resulted in longer flames. PAH LIF and soot LII indicated that PAH and soot are present on the fuel side of the flame and that soot is located closer to the reaction zone than PAH. Ethylene flames produced significantly higher PAH LIF and soot LII signals than methane flames, {{which is consistent with}} the sooting propensity o...|$|E
40|$|Isolator/combustor {{interactions}} are measured in a direct-connect dual-mode ramjet-scramjet experiment. An operating point approach {{is used to}} create a mapping of the coupling effects between the isolator geometry, inlet flow conditions and fuel injector behavior. The resulting isolator/injector coupling map provides a description of the response of the isolator to particular injector performance, and the effective blockage it induces on the isolator flow. Existing models and correlations predicting the pressure rise across a pseudo-shock, and its resultant length, were evaluated through comparison with measurements made in a heated-flow isolator duct that is coupled to a hydrogen-air combustor. The observation of a normal-to-oblique shock-train transition mechanism has lead {{to the development of a}} revised shock-train operating regime description that takes into account the impact of Mach number and maximum pressure recovery on the shock configurations present in the isolator. The behavior of a ram-scram transition was examined along with pressure measurements and high-speed laser interferometry. The work quantifies the sudden change in the wall static pressure profile and flame position that occurs as the downstream boundary condition abruptly changes when the flow becomes unchoked. Transition was studied in three ways; as a quasi-steady phenomenon, or as caused by rapid variations in either <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> or test-section wall temperature. A regime diagram was measured that plots the ram-scram transition boundary. Under certain conditions some periodic low-frequency oscillations of the flame position occur and they are shown to be correlated with oscillations of the upstream pre-combustion pseudo-shock. A self-sustaining shear-layer instability, associated with the flameholding cavity, is identified as the mechanism perpetuating this behavior. The relevant time scales associated with the ram-scram transition and the flameshock {{interactions are}} discussed...|$|E
30|$|For the {{previous}} few years, existing literature related to estimating air transport fuel efficiency have been limited. Inside {{the range of}} air transport fuel efficiency literature, Lee et al. [51] analyzed the relationship between aircraft fuel efficiency and cost, and estimated the aviation emissions reduction potential based on analytical and statistical models. Babikian et al. [4] compared the fuel efficiency of different aircraft types, and emphasized that differences in fuel efficiency could be described largely by differences in aircraft operations. Peeters et al. [62] analyzed the fuel efficiency of commercial aircraft since their initiation in the 1930 s, and {{results showed that the}} last piston-powered aircrafts were at least twice as fuel-efficient as the first jet-powered aircraft. Williams (2007) highlighted the engineering options for the improvement in aircraft fuel efficiency, and these options had included the changes to airframes, engines, avionics, air traffic control systems, airspace design, and improved market based measures. Morrell [56] investigated the potential for greater fuel efficiency by utilizing larger aircraft and different operational practices. Lee [50]; Lee and Mo [52] have presented the key technologies and policy issues for the induction of energy efficient, environmentally friendly innovations in aircraft systems. Zou et al. [83] used ratio based, deterministic and stochastic frontier approaches to investigate fuel efficiency of transport aircrafts, and the results showed that potential cost savings of airlines. Singh and Sharma [74] explored the aircraft technology, operations, alternative fuels, socio-economic measures, and infrastructural factors for fuel efficiency improvement. Chandra et al. [13] compared fuel efficiencies of selected airlines around the globe, and results found that, the average fuel efficiency of the airlines reported was is 0.4  L/RTK (revenue tonne kilometer), respectively. Also, this study has investigated the variances in fuel efficiency among airlines from different regions. Li et al. [53] employed the virtual frontier dynamic range adjusted measure to estimate the energy efficiency of 22 airlines during the period of 2008 – 2012, and the results showed that the aggregate airline energy efficiency consistently increased from 2008 to 2012. Baklacioglu [5] employed a genetic algorithm-optimized neural network topology to predict the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate</b> of a transport aircraft using real flight data, and results showed that the saving in fuel energy, and reducing flight costs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn fire-tube boilers, {{the flue}} gas passes inside boiler tubes, and heat is {{transferred}} to water on the shell side. A dynamic model has been developed {{for the analysis of}} boiler performance, and Matlab has been applied for integrating it. The mathematical model developed is based on the first principles of mass, energy and momentum conservations. In the model, the two parts of the boiler (fire/gas and water/steam sides), the economizer, the superheater and the heat recovery are considered. The model developed can capture the dynamics of the boiler level and boiler pressure with confidence, and it is adequate to approach the boiler performance and, hence, to design and test a control strategy for such boilers. Furthermore, it gives insight of dynamics performance not only during nominal operating conditions, or transient behavior when a parameter is changed, but also for the start-up. The model proposed can be easily implemented and thus, it is useful to assist plant engineers and even for training future operators. A case study of an 800 HP fire-tube boiler burning fuel-oil has been simulated to test the boiler performance by varying operating conditions using a pulse and a step change in <b>fuel</b> and steam <b>flow-rate</b> as well as simulating a start-up form the beginning up to achieve the steady state.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the cause of an intermittent combustion-driven oscillation in a full-scale refinery flare is reported. When present, ambient sound pressure levels in excess of 100 dBA are generated. The oscillations began after the replacement of an old flare tip with one of a different design which required the use of non-standard components. The assessment included measurements of time resolved and integrated sound pressure in the ambient environment, and pressure in the fuel pipe and the air duct. Images obtained from video recorded from two directions are presented along with relevant process data. A review is also presented of {{the conditions under which}} the oscillations are inhibited or enhanced, and a comparison is made with another flare of similar design which does not exhibit an oscillation. The Strouhal numbers of the potential causes of flow oscillation and the wavelength of acoustic resonances in the supply pipes are calculated. The findings are then compared with related investigations found in the literature. The frequency of the oscillation was found to scale with the speed of sound in the fuel and also to match a resonant frequency within three consecutive segments of the fuel supply pipe. In contrast, the speed of sound in air was constant for all tests, while the frequency varied. This shows that the resonance occurs within the fuel system. The frequency also scales approximately with the <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> although more poorly than with the speed of sound, and matches a vortex shedding deduced to be present within the fuel side of the flare tip. In addition the frequency also matches the fundamental vortex shedding frequency of the air jet emerging from the tip. At the same time the visual appearance of the base of the flame was consistent with the air jet being driven at its fundamental mode. This suggests that the oscillations are caused by the coincidence of several coupling mechanisms. The acoustic resonance in the fuel pipe is deduced to control the frequency of oscillation and to amplify the pressure fluctuations. However the root cause of the oscillation is deduced to be a vortex shedding within the fuel supply. This causes fluctuations in the fuel flow rate which are amplified by the heat release. This creates positive feedback in further amplifying the pressure fluctuations in the fuel jet and the acoustic resonance. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Opposed to a {{conventional}} approach of using ethanol in a spark-ignition engine, this study demonstrates a potential of ethanol utilization in a diesel engine using dual-fuel combustion strategy where ethanol is {{injected into the}} intake manifold and diesel is directly injected into the combustion chamber. The main focus {{of this study is}} the effect of ethanol port fuel injector (PFI) sprays on dual-fuel combustion and emissions. Firstly, details of temporal and spatial development of ethanol PFI sprays were studied using Mie-scattering and high-speed shadowgraph imaging techniques. Momentum flux-based injection rate measurement was also performed. The influences of <b>fuel</b> <b>flow-rate,</b> injection duration, and ambient air cross-flow are of particular interest in an effort to understand ethanol PFI spray characteristics that are relevant to automobile engines. Ethanol sprays are also studied for various PFI positions to examine the potential effect of droplets-airflow interaction and wall wetting. With the clear understanding on ethanol PFI sprays, dual-fuel engine experiments were conducted for various ethanol energy ratios and PFI positions. It is found that the effect of PFI position on global phenomena such as in-cylinder pressure, apparent heat release rate and mean effective pressure is much less significant than the effect of ethanol energy fraction. However, the misfiring limit shows measurable difference such that the PFI position closer to the intake valves results in 10 % higher ethanol energy fraction than that of the further upstream position. Reduced wall-wetting due to surface boiling occurring on the hot valve seat is suggested as a possible cause, which is consistent with 30 % lower carbon monoxide and 64 % lower unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. Detailed investigation for various ethanol energy fractions was also conducted. From the in-cylinder pressure measurements, it is found that the increased ethanol energy fraction increases the engine efficiency up to 10 % until it is limited by misfiring. The results are compared to diesel-only operation with varying injection timings in order to explain whether the increased efficiency is due to the combustion phasing or improved combustion associated with fast burning of ethanol. Further analysis of the data reveals that the latter is the primary cause for the efficiency gain. By advancing the diesel injection timing, it is found that the maximum ethanol fraction can be extended to 70 % without the misfiring problem but 20 % increase in nitrogen oxide emissions is also observed, which raises a question on the advantages of utilizing ethanol in a diesel engine. However, negligible smoke emissions are measured at ethanol energy ratio of 20 % or higher suggesting that optimization of these emissions is much easier compared with conventional diesel combustion...|$|E
