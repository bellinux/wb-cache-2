He touted <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> President Woodrow Wilson and declared {{his support for the}} United States' admission into the League of Nations. <b>His</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Wilson hurt him with German American voters, and Wilson's handling of recent coal strikes hurt Black with the traditionally Democratic labor vote.|$|E

5|$|He {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> {{representative}} democracy and his populist style.

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{elections}} of 1970, Tydings faced criticism from both parties for his actions as senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the bill for writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E
5|$|Letcher {{supported}} Adams' administration, {{but became}} anti-administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest.

Bolstered by <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} {{she arrived in}} Paris to attend the École Normale de Neuilly. The school {{provided}} its female pupils with classes in chemistry and bookkeeping, in addition to traditionally feminine arts such as embroidery. Her roommate was Noémie, the daughter of Henri Rochefort, who had been imprisoned in New Caledonia for <b>his</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> the Paris Commune. The girls shared tales of their parents' political exploits, and remained good friends for years. Pankhurst was so fond of Noémie and the school that after graduating she returned with her sister Mary as a parlour boarder. Noémie had married a Swiss painter and quickly found a suitable French husband for her English friend. When Robert Goulden refused to provide a dowry for his daughter, the man withdrew his offer of marriage and Pankhurst returned, miserable, to Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. <b>His</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. <b>His</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} {{ignored in the}} historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus instead on the {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. <b>His</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
