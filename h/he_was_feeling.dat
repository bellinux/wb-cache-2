5|$|On November 10, 1948, Shadrick {{left for}} basic combat {{training}} at Fort Knox, Kentucky. As he was 17 years old, Shadrick {{had to convince}} his parents to sign papers allowing him to enlist. Shadrick completed this training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, for post–World War II occupation duties. Shadrick spent a year on Kyushu island with the division. According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 he was growing tired of the country, and indicated in letters <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be his last words. Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
25|$|The {{tour of the}} West Indies was {{the first}} {{overseas}} Test series for Australia in 25 months, and the first for Ponting's new look bowling attack. In five previous Test series in 1999 and 2003, he averaged 98.71, with four hundreds. He also averaged 42.80 in 25 ODIs from four tours—1995, 1999, 2003 and the 2007 World Cup. After eight months of consecutive cricket from the World Twenty20, Ponting was surprised about how good <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling,</b> despite believing {{that he would be}} weary from the amount of cricket he had played.|$|E

5000|$|The song is {{considered}} Astley's signature song {{and it is}} often played {{at the end of}} Astley's live concerts. During a live performance, usually on the last verse, Rick sometimes shouts out to the audience that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "bloody marvellous" [...] or in other countries that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "fantastic" [...] after the line [...] "And if you ask me how I'm feeling" [...] to have some banter with the audience.|$|R
25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a one-car accident that caused him to bump his head around seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 825, Niu Sengru {{was still}} serving as chancellor, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> {{powerless}} {{to stop what}} he saw as Emperor Jingzong's frivolousness and poor governance. He asked to be sent out of the capital. Emperor Jingzong made him the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (武昌, headquartered in modern Ezhou, Hubei). Also, that year after Emperor Jingzong declared a general pardon, Li Fengji submitted a proposed edict announcing the general pardon that would permit those exiled officials who had previously received a movement toward Chang'an be given another one, but not stating anything with regard to those exiled officials who had never received a previous movement toward Chang'an. Wei pointed out that this wording was intended by Li Fengji to prevent Li Shen's movement toward Chang'an. At Wei's suggestion, the edict was revised, allowing Li Shen to be moved to Jiang Prefecture (江州, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to serve as its secretary general.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E

500|$|On July 16, Lucretia Mott sent {{a note to}} Stanton apologizing {{in advance}} for James Mott {{not being able to}} attend the first day, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "quite unwell". Lucretia Mott wrote to say she would bring her sister, Martha Wright, and that the two women would {{participate}} in both days of the convention.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Kurt Cobain felt {{pressured}} to create music for Bleach that conformed to the grunge music style favored by his record label and the contemporary Seattle music scene. The album {{is regarded as}} quite negative and bleak; Cobain claimed {{that most of the}} lyrics were written the night before recording while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "pissed off", and that he did not regard them highly.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} of the songs previewed at Kinfauns, the Beatles did not revisit [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] during the White Album sessions. Harrison decided to give the song to former Undertakers singer Jackie Lomax – a fellow Liverpudlian {{and one of the}} first artists signed to the Beatles' record label, Apple Records, in early 1968. In a 2004 interview, Lomax said that he was {{fortunate}} to have Harrison's help, adding: [...] "even on a big project like The White Album he only had four songs. I think <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> held back [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|César Ritz's health had {{declined}} after his 1902 collapse at the Carlton, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> {{well enough to}} assume {{an active role in}} the plans for the hotel's opening dinner on 24 May 1906. [...] Unlike the opening of the Paris Ritz, which had catered to society, most of those invited to the Ritz, London opening were members of the national and international press. Major British newspapers such as the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and The Daily Telegraph were invited to the dinner along with newspapers which included the Berliner Tageblatt, The Sydney Morning Herald and The New York Times. Ritz's guest list also included the engineer and architects of the structure along with key staff members of the new hotel and their wives.|$|E
500|$|Earlier in the day, Parks {{had been}} {{complaining}} about neck pain, and paramedics were called. According to Gary Guenther, chief {{investigator for the}} Summit County Medical Examiner, [...] "When they got there, they checked him out," [...] he said. [...] "Mr. Parks apparently said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> better and refused {{to go to the}} hospital." [...] At the time of his death, he was en route to Ann Arbor, Michigan with the band for a football game on September 18 between UMass and the University of Michigan. He was honored on Homecoming Day on October 16, 2010 by current and former band members and staff. This included a performance by the alumni band, which included approximately 1,300 participants, the largest the university had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing process}} for Fantasy Black Channel was largely unplanned. The verses of [...] "Broken" [...] were {{conceived}} {{late at night}} and are inspired by insomnia. It took Eastgate a long time to describe how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "in a way that sounded original" [...] for such a common theme in pop music. The lyrics in the chorus are about the first time Late of the Pier drove to London and got lost. [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] tries to weigh up what is more important: a person or an inanimate object, or an absence of anything, while [...] "The Bears Are Coming" [...] concerns [...] "a silent threat". The idea for the lyric [...] "A heartbeat, a flicker, a line" [...] in [...] "Heartbeat" [...] came to Eastgate while recording the song and hearing its time signature always changing.|$|E
5000|$|Punpun is a {{young boy}} who is most often {{depicted}} as a bird, although <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also shown in the other forms. When <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> confused about life or depressed he consults [...] "God" [...] using a chant his uncle taught him.|$|R

5000|$|The song is a mid-tempo ballad {{in which}} the narrator tells of his [...] "night to remember" [...] a lost lover. He begins by stating {{that he has had}} a tough week, and has plans for tonight because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> downcast.|$|R
500|$|As the 1915 {{season was}} set to get underway, Coach Yost reported, [...] "Johnny told me <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> fine when I saw him recently, {{although}} he doesn’t weigh {{as much as he}} used to." [...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. [...] He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that [...] "a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight." [...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Balthier was {{designed}} by Akihiko Yoshida, who has stated that the character is his favorite from Final Fantasy XII since the character is based on [...] "someone I admire." [...] Balthier {{has been called a}} [...] "completely original character" [...] by Yoshida, having not used any previous Final Fantasy character as a reference. [...] In an interview, Yoshida stated that all the characters of Final Fantasy XII were designed with a focus on creating an aesthetic found nowhere in the real world. The armor of the Judges, which Balthier had been, were designed as a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas. During the making of the game, there were some issues with the character's faces; In one scene Balthier asked Vaan how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> which brought laughter to the staff because in that scene Vaan's face was poorly modelled. In retrospective, Square Enix members found Balthier as an appealing character and jokingly stated Vaan would need an entire decade to surpass him.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling,</b> so he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because {{he is such a}} supreme musician." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly after hiring Kosinski, Bailey {{approached}} screenwriting duo Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, {{who accepted}} for being self-described [...] "obsessed about Tron". Horowitz later claimed {{the challenge was}} to [...] "homage the first movie, continue the story, expand it {{and take it to}} another place and open up space for new fans", and Kitsis claimed that the film would start a whole new mythology [...] "of which we're only scratching the surface". Horowitz and Kitsis first created a story outline, and developed and fine-tuned the plot with Bailey and Kosinski across a period of two days in La Quinta. The writers also consulted Lisberger, to view Trons creator input on the story. Lisberger gave his blessing, particularly as he has a son the same age as Sam, which Kitsis stated that [...] "was like we had tapped into something <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> without even realizing it." [...] The Pixar team contributed with rewrites for additional shooting after being shown a rough cut in March 2010, which helped in particular to the development of Sam's story line.|$|E
500|$|At the US National Championships he equaled his 100m best of 9.84s {{while running}} into the wind. This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100m time with a {{headwind}} after Maurice Greene's 9.82s run. He followed this with a new 200m personal best in the finals, again facing an impeding wind. His time of 19.62s was the second fastest ever; only Johnson's 19.32s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster. Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong: [...] "I wasn't thinking about any time. I {{was trying to get}} away from Spearmon as fast as I could." [...] After noting that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> worn out, Gay had a brief recuperation period in preparation for the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. He returned to the track in Europe and, while weather conditions were poor, he won the 200m in Lausanne with 19.78s and had wins at 100m events in Sheffield and London. He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships: both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge.|$|E
500|$|The group {{concluded}} the North American [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] {{leg of the}} tour on 25 November 1992, leaving them with a six-month break before the tour resumed in Europe in May 1993 with the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg. Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two {{did not want to}} settle back into domestic life. Bono said, [...] "We thought we could live a normal life and then go back on the road [...] But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going...?" [...] The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>feeling</b> after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording.|$|E
