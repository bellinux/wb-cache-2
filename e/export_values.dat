50|$|Wheat {{from the}} Hauran—high-protein {{semolina}} used in pasta—was {{intended to be}} the mainstay of the railway's income, along with the Muslim pilgrimage trade during the Hajj. The entry of American, Indian, and Australian wheat into the European market amid the continuing Long Depression, however, undercut that trade while the railway was still under construction. Damascene traders had thought the Beirut railway {{would allow them to}} export their grain more cheaply; instead, as early as the 1894 harvest, the rail flooded the market, collapsing prices and margins. Completion of the line to the coast did not improve matters, since the world market was trading at still lower prices and the premium once commanded by Hauran wheat—which, being hand-harvested, might include pebbles or weeds—was now lost to machine-reaped grain from the United States. It was not until 1908 that <b>export</b> <b>values</b> again reached the levels of the 1880s. The railway itself was one of the best-managed in the Ottoman Empire: It had total receipts of $434,000 for 1900 and in 1906 received a guarantee from the government of $4320 per mile on the 200-mile Aleppo Railway All the same, the company was never very profitable: it was at perpetual risk of bankruptcy; shares traded at 550 Fr in 1891 and only 468 Fr in 1909; and dividends were minuscule: 4.40 Fr in 1902 and 6.31 Fr in 1909.|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{dominance}} {{analysis was}} used to assess export performance in two Melanesian countries of similar size and structure that are comparatively well endowed with natural resources: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Total <b>export</b> <b>values</b> increased over the study period in Solomon Islands, brought about by {{a significant increase in the}} value of non-agricultural resource exports. Agricultural exports showed small increases but the average annual rate of growth was only 1. 3 per cent for agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> compared with 10. 7 per cent in non-agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values.</b> The record of commodity export performance in Vanuatu over the study period was less impressive, with a small average annual decline in total <b>export</b> <b>values.</b> This decline was caused by agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> falling by 1. 5 per cent per annum although it showed signs of abating in the final decade of the study period. Results suggest that both countries are capable of achieving sustainable economic development, given their generous natural resource endowments, but many factors may militate against this achievement, as witnessed by the current political unrest and crisis in public finance in Solomon Islands. export performance, stochastic dominance, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{dominance}} {{analysis was}} used to assess export performance in Fiji from 1960 to 1999. A country with reasonably abundant resources, Fiji has made effective use of its quite substantial resources to increase total <b>export</b> <b>values</b> significantly over the study period, with an average rate of growth of 2. 6 per cent per annum. Non-agricultural exports were the source of this growth, increasing annually by 7. 3 per cent. Growth was particularly strong from the late 1980 s despite the loss of skills and capital flight {{in the wake of the}} May 1987 coup and military takeover. The economy clearly benefited from a policy switch from a trade protectionist policy with a high degree of government intervention to an export-oriented strategy based on private sector-led development. The values of total exports in the 1990 s were dominant overall. The values in the 1980 s dominated values in the 1960 s and 1970 s as a result of the expansion of non-agricultural exports. The 1970 s stochastically dominated the 1960 s clearly and the 1980 s dominated the 1970 s for non-agricultural exports. Non-agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> continued to expand in the final decade of the study period, rendering overall stochastic dominance of the 1990 s over the 1980 s and preceding decades. The dominant decade for agricultural exports was the 1970 s. However, the increase in agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> during the 1970 s was offset by a decline in agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> in the final two decades of the study period such that there was no trend in agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> over the whole study period. export performance, Fiji, stochastic dominance, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

The countries under study are Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Only Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands experienced a positive trend in total commodity <b>export</b> <b>values.</b> Agricultural <b>export</b> <b>values</b> grew significantly only in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands.

Evidence suggests that export performance was not improved by good policies unless those policies were properly implemented. To be satisfactorily implemented, they required soundly operating and effective institutions. Unfortunately, institutional performance deteriorated over the study period and was likely to have adversely affected export performance, particularly in the primary industries.

40|$|Policy {{simulations}} {{for national}} economies with econometric models {{in general are}} done using a stand alone national model with exogenous <b>export</b> <b>values</b> and import prices. In a globalised world such an exercise is critical, since the policy in question may change the export prices and the import volumes of the particular country and induce via international trade a change of the economic activities {{of the global economy}} and a feed back to the <b>export</b> <b>values</b> and import prices of the particular country. The paper at hand presents a sensitivity analysis for Germany comparing the impacts of a shock on investment in a stand alone simulation using the multisector model INFORGE with the results, which occur, if the same model is linked to the global multicountry/multisector model GINFORS endogenising Germany's <b>export</b> <b>values</b> and import prices. The results are striking: The effect on real GDP is 50 % higher in the global simulation than in the stand alone case.

This paper employs a gravity model on Swedish firm-product level export data to analyse the effect of distance on the export decisions as well as <b>export</b> <b>values,</b> respectively. The focus is on how the influence of distance varies across differentiated and non-differentiated products. For both export participation and intensity decisions, the results are not in line with the network/search view and suggest that homogeneous products are more sensitive to distance than differentiated products when controlling for annual shocks and industry heterogeneity.
