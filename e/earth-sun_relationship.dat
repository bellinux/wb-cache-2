This manual has been created to support school communities in their implementation of the Guidelines for School Programs to Prevent Skin Cancer and, specifically, to help schools create and maintain a physical environment that supports sun safety by ensuring that school grounds have adequate shade.

50|$|The Nabataeans worshipped Arab {{gods and}} goddesses during the pre-Islamic era {{as well as}} a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death. Dushara was the primary male god {{accompanied}} by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzá, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to <b>Earth-Sun</b> <b>relationships,</b> often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.|$|R
40|$|In {{the heart}} of the Department of Physics (Roma Tre University) there is a garden where, in spring time, daisies bloom, {{students}} sit on the grass studying and discussing, and professors pass by, lost in their deep thoughts. In this garden two new astronomical structures recently flourished: an oriented-Globe (oriented just like Planet Earth) and a small observatory. So this garden has become our “Astrogarden”. The oriented-Globe gives you the opportunity to make many simple experiences of orientation in space and on <b>Earth-Sun</b> <b>relationships.</b> The observatory - in addition to visual observations of the Moon and Planets - permits to gain skills in photometry and spectroscopy, with the aid of modern CCD’s. In a city like Rome, where light pollution never lets real night come, the Astrogarden {{is one of the few}} places where direct contact between man and sky is possible. The Astrogarden raises interest by students and all visitors, drawing people...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Orbiting Geophysical Observatories and the {{supporting}} ground checkout equipment, data acquisition and tracking stations and {{data processing equipment}} are designed to conduct large numbers of diverse experiments in space. Measurements will be made within the earth's atmosphere, ionosphere, exosphere, magnetosphere, and in cislunar space to obtain {{a better understanding of}} <b>earth-sun</b> <b>relationships</b> and of the earth as a planet. Configured to meet scientific requirements, the observatories include six booms to support detectors away from disturbances generated in the main body. Five degrees of freedom allow the orientation of experiments relative to three references- the earth, the sun, and the orbital plane. Power, thermal control, and data handling subsystems provide for the proper operation of the experiments and telemetry of the data. Ground stations receive these data, which are then processed into a form suitable for use by the experimenters. The systems have been designed to make available a standard spacecraft and support equipment which can be used repeatedly to carry large numbers of easily integrated experiments {{in a wide variety of}} orbits...|$|R
40|$|Rhythmic {{sedimentation}} patterns observed {{within the}} Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway, {{such as those}} in the Bridge Creek Limestone Member of the Greenhorn Limestone Formation exposed near Pueblo, Colorado, appear to be a response to episodic climate change. These climatic variations could, in turn, be forced by the periodic insolation change over the North American continent created by Milankovitch-scale <b>Earth-Sun</b> orbital <b>relationships</b> [...] eccentricity (100 kiloyears), obliquity (41 kiloyears) and precession of the equinox (23 kiloyears). ^ To test the sensitivity of Cretaceous climate to changes in Milankovitch-scale insolation forcing, a set of seasonal simulations using maximum difference insolation forcing conditions was conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research 2 ̆ 7 s Community Climate Model using 100 MA Cretaceous paleogeography and paleotopography. Analysis showed statistically significant differences in surface temperature, precipitation, surface wind, storm track location, and upwelling occurred over many regions of the Cretaceous Earth, particularly in the summer and winter monsoon system. During Northern Hemisphere winter, differences in the position of storm passage over Cretaceous western North America under maximum difference insolation forcing conditions varies the precipitation received over the southern Western Interior Seaway at the location where the Bridge Creek Limestone Member rhythmic sedimentation was produced. ^ Northern Hemisphere winter simulations removing all sea ice from the model showed little difference in the climatic effects observed over southwestern North America from the case with sea ice present. Additional simulations varying only the obliquity within the model suggest that the observed Bridge Creek Limestone Member rhythmic sedimentation patterns are controlled by climatic change produced by cyclic variation in the precession of the equinox and eccentricity insolation forcing, rather than by periodic change in obliquity insolation forcing. ^ Northern Hemisphere summer and winter global displays are provided for the numerical mean values of surface temperature, precipitation, zonal and meridional component wind and wind vector and storm track distribution produced by the various combinations of insolation forcing used in the computer simulations. ...|$|R
