5|$|Hinde {{purchased}} {{property from}} William Mc'Intosh near the Wabash River, {{an area that}} had been a Piankashaw Indian campground. It contained numerous <b>earthwork</b> mounds built by cultures that predated the Piankashaw.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch is a six-mile (9.7km) long linear <b>earthwork</b> between Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford in Greater Manchester, England. It was dug as a {{defensive}} fortification, or possibly a boundary marker, between the 5th and 11th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{was planned}} for 18 October 1968, but was delayed to the {{following}} year after the airport was flooded {{a week before the}} scheduled date. The construction work resulted in a legal dispute between the municipality and the consulting company Norsk Teknisk Byggekontroll. The initial filling of <b>earthwork</b> had proved insufficient, so additional <b>earthwork</b> had to be filled, costing an additional NOK840,000. The municipality demanded that the consulting company cover NOK250,000 of the extra cost.|$|E
5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and {{it may not have been}} in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the <b>earthwork</b> remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular <b>earthwork,</b> with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|Cleeve Abbey {{was passed}} {{back to the}} Crown in 1950–51 to pay Death Duties on the Luttrell estate and was managed by the Department for the Environment. Major {{restoration}} and archaeological work followed. In 1984, English Heritage took over responsibility for Cleeve Abbey, carrying out excavations and <b>earthwork</b> surveys and continues to care for it today.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, Loughor Castle is {{controlled}} by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction. The ruined tower and fragments of the curtain wall still survive on top of the ringwork's <b>earthwork</b> defences, which now resemble a motte, or mound, and are part of the Loughor Castle Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} of French {{intervention}} in the 1540s and 1550s, {{at the end of}} the Rough Wooing, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of <b>earthwork</b> forts and additions to existing castles. These included the erection of single bastions at Edinburgh, Stirling and Dunbar.|$|E
5|$|The Early Woodland {{period in}} Indiana came between 1000 BC and 200 AD and {{produced}} the Adena culture. It domesticated wild squash and made pottery, which were large cultural advances over the Clovis culture. The natives built burial mounds; {{one of this}} type has been dated as the oldest <b>earthwork</b> in Anderson's Mounds State Park.|$|E
5|$|The ditch {{is still}} visible in short sections, {{such as a}} 330-yard stretch in Denton Golf Course. In the parts which survive, the ditch is 4–5yards wide and up to 5feet deep. Part of the <b>earthwork</b> is {{protected}} as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|The western {{terminus}} of {{the early}} medieval linear <b>earthwork</b> Nico Ditch is in Hough Moss, just {{to the east of}} Stretford; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Until the 12thcentury, stone-built {{and earth}} and timber castles were contemporary, {{but by the}} late 12thcentury the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly {{attributed}} to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of timber and <b>earthwork</b> sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone. Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and <b>earthwork</b> castles {{were by no means}} useless. This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; Owain Glyndŵr's 11th-century timber castle at Sycharth was still in use by the start of the 15thcentury, its structure having been maintained for four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Burrow Mump, {{an ancient}} <b>earthwork</b> {{owned by the}} National Trust, is a natural hill of Triassic {{sandstone}} capped by Keuper marl, standing at a strategic point where the River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. It probably served as a natural outwork to the defended royal island of Athelney {{at the end of}} the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|Nico Ditch, an <b>earthwork</b> {{stretching}} from Stretford to Ashton-under-Lyne, {{is evidence of}} Anglo-Saxon activity in Tameside. It was probably dug between the 7th and 9th centuries {{and may have been}} used as a boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. Further evidence of Anglo-Saxon era activity in Tameside comes from the derivation of settlement names from Old English such as -tun, meaning farmstead, and leah meaning clearing.|$|E
5|$|Other folklore, first {{recorded}} in the Victorian era, associates the figure with fertility. In the past locals would erect a maypole on the <b>earthwork,</b> around which childless couples would dance to promote fertility. According to folk belief, a woman who sleeps on the figure will be blessed with fecundity, and infertility may be cured through sexual intercourse {{on top of the}} figure, especially the phallus.|$|E
5|$|Overlooking Old Grimsby harbour and the {{anchorage}} of St Helen's Pool, the blockhouse {{would have}} housed {{a battery of}} two or three artillery pieces, positioned on a square gun platform on top of a rocky outcrop. An <b>earthwork</b> bank and a stone wall were built to protect it from attack from the beach and the landward sides respectively. A small room to provide living quarters for the garrison was later constructed {{on the side of the}} gun platform.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was removed}} from active service in January 1945 and reopened to the public the {{following}} year. The Second World War gun battery was finally closed in 1956 {{after several years of}} use as a training site. Between 1945 and 1970, much of the Victorian <b>earthwork</b> and concrete defences were cleared from the Grand Sea Battery, and the 1941 battery was completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{costs for}} the project ended at NOK26,651,900, of which NOK22.0 million was for the railway. This total {{included}} NOK2.3 million for a power station and NOK1.2 million for a ferry quay at Flåm. The largest cost was for <b>earthwork,</b> which ended at NOK9.1 million; other major costs were NOK2.4 million for rolling stock, NOK1.6 million for stations, NOK1.2 for tracks, NOK1.5 million for snow protection and NOK675,000 for electrification.|$|E
5|$|Around 1627, Robert Morton, {{the mayor}} of Hull, had an {{additional}} rectangular <b>earthwork</b> battery of four guns constructed around the south blockhouse to defend the estuary against a potential Spanish and French invasion threat. The South End Fort {{was built on the}} other side of the river from the South Blockhouse at the same time, provided supporting crossfire. In 1634, a survey showed the North Blockhouse to be mounting 24 pieces of artillery, the castle 29, and the South Blockhouse 24 guns. Catholic recusants continued to be detained in the castle and blockhouses, where they were ill-treated by the keepers, typically men with strong Puritan sympathies.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament in 1642, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament and the town invested money in Kingswear's castle doors. The following year, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town. An <b>earthwork</b> fort, called Mount Ridley or Kingsworth, may subsequently have been built to protect the vulnerable position behind Kingswear Castle; an alternative supposition is that the fort was first built in 1627 and was simply brought back into use during the conflict. In January 1646, Sir Thomas Fairfax led a Parliamentary army to retake Dartmouth, capturing Kingswear from Sir Henry Cary, the High Sheriff of Devon, who had been left in charge of defending it.|$|E
5|$|Castle Acre Castle {{and town}} walls are {{a set of}} ruined medieval defences built {{in the village of}} Castle Acre, Norfolk. The castle was built soon after the Norman Conquest by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, at the {{intersection}} of the River Nar and the Peddars Way. William constructed a motte-and-bailey castle during the 1070s, protected by large <b>earthwork</b> ramparts, with a large country house in the centre of the motte. Soon after, a small community of Cluniac monks were given the castle's chapel in the outer bailey; under William, the second earl, the order was given land and estates to establish Castle Acre Priory alongside the castle. A deer park was created nearby for hunting.|$|E
5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{was built}} in either the 1220s or the 1230s by Llywelyn the Great, {{at the base of}} the Llanberis Pass, {{overlooking}} the lake of Llyn Padarn in North Wales. Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles, instead using undefended palaces called , or courts. From the late 11th century onwards, the Normans had advanced into Wales, taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century some timber and <b>earthwork</b> castles began to be built, but in small numbers.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern <b>earthwork</b> bastions and an outlying fort, called a sconce. Worcester changed hands {{several times during}} the conflict, and after the war ended the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval stone walls and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century plans have been drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that after the}} collapse of the Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD. The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD. Their settlements, like those of the Hopewell, were known for their ceremonial <b>earthwork</b> mounds. Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River. The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell. The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region. The people also developed the bow and arrow and copper working during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Fort Bayard was an <b>earthwork</b> fort {{constructed}} in 1861 northwest of Tenleytown in the District of Columbia {{as part of}} the defenses of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. It never faced major opposition during the conflict and was decommissioned following the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Named after Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who was killed at the Battle of Fredericksburg, the site of the fort is in Boundary Park, located at the intersection of River Road and Western Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. No trace of the fort remains, though a marker commemorating its existence has been constructed by the Park Service.|$|E
5|$|Fort Runyon was a {{timber and}} <b>earthwork</b> fort {{constructed}} by the Union Army following the occupation of northern Virginia in the American Civil War in order to defend the southern approaches to the Long Bridge {{as part of the}} defenses of Washington, D.C. during that war. The Columbia Turnpike and Alexandria and Loudon Railroad ran through the pentagonal structure, which controlled access to Washington via the Long Bridge. With a perimeter of almost , and due to its unusual shape it was approximately the same size, shape, and in almost the same location as the Pentagon, built 80 years later.|$|E
5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major <b>earthwork</b> stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E
5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large <b>earthwork</b> platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E
5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a battery of guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from granite stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive <b>earthwork</b> was constructed around it during the 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a lasting}} peace with France {{was made in}} 1558 and the initial {{invasion}} threat passed. The Spanish threat to the south-west of England became more serious, however, and war broke out in 1569. As a result, a defensive <b>earthwork</b> was constructed north-west of the castle to protect it against an attack from the land, and an additional gun battery facing upriver was installed alongside the blockhouse. The levels of the garrison varied considerably during the period. Pendennis had a garrison of 100 men in 1578, and could have mustered around 500 men in 1596, while in 1599 it was reportedly guarded by 200 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Orford Castle {{was given}} to the Ministry of Works in 1962, and is now {{maintained}} by English Heritage. The keep of the castle is {{the only part of the}} structure remaining intact, although the <b>earthwork</b> remains of the bailey wall are still visible; some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks, however, are not medieval, but instead the result of the earlier quarrying of the bailey walls. The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally. Archaeological work to understand the surrounding environment has continued, most recently during 2002 to 2003. The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Iron Age {{tribes of}} later Somerset were the Dobunni in north Somerset, Durotriges in south Somerset and Dumnonii in west Somerset. The {{first and second}} {{produced}} coins, the finds of which allows their tribal areas to be suggested, but the latter did not. All three had a Celtic culture and language. However, Ptolemy stated that Bath was in {{the territory of the}} Belgae, but this may be a mistake. The Celtic gods were worshipped at the temple of Sulis at Bath and possibly the temple on Brean Down. Iron Age sites on the Quantock Hills, include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as smaller <b>earthwork</b> enclosures, such as Trendle Ring, Elworthy Barrows and Plainsfield Camp.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{position}} at Borodino {{consisted of a}} series of disconnected earthworks running in an arc from the Moskva River on the right, along its tributary, the Kolocha (whose steep banks added to the defense), and towards the village of Utitsa on the left. Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center (on the French side of the Kolocha) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult, aiding the defenders. The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt, a massive open-backed <b>earthwork</b> mounting nineteen 12-pounder cannons which had a clear field of fire {{all the way to the}} banks of the Kolocha stream.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly Isles {{supported}} Charles I {{during the}} English Civil War, {{and after a}} short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The Royalists on Tresco appeared to have believed that King Charles's Castle was a critical defensive point {{on the island and}} probably built new <b>earthwork</b> defences around the castle to defend it against an attack from the land. It is possible, however, that these defences instead date from around 1627, and were built by the King's engineer, Bernard Johnson. During this period the castle was given its current name.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} in the ownership of Hamelin Plantagenet's family, passing to his son William de Warenne in 1202. William was probably responsible {{for the construction of}} new stone curtain walls around the inner bailey, destroying the former <b>earthwork</b> defences in the process. The inner bailey was levelled and William built a hall and service buildings inside the castle, again in stone. Conisbrough was inherited by William's young son John de Warenne in 1239, but he was still a minor and the castle was initially managed by his mother, Maud.|$|E
