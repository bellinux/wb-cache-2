The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not more so, than <b>direct</b> <b>actions.</b> Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were technically proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E

5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with <b>direct</b> <b>actions</b> at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> {{has long}} been {{associated}} with European anarchism, from the industrial sabotage espoused by nineteenth and twentieth century anarcho-syndicalists to the anti-Poll tax activists and the "DiY culture" of more recent British movements. A particular ethic is identified within anarchist <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> which has two features: the first requires that means be in accordance with ends (prefiguration); the second {{the identities of the}} subjects involved in the act. prefiguration distinguished <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> from both Leninist consequentialism and the deontological approaches of liberal and anrcho-capitalist traditions. The identities of the agents involved and created through <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> illustrate important differences between anarchist <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> and that of more conservative groupings. The paper not only clarifies <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> but also considers whether a prefigurative ethic necessitates non-violence. Additionally, the paper answers the question of why <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> is embraced by the anti-hierarchical anarchist tradition, explaining the attractions of such methods to contemporary movements and illustrating parallels between contemporary anarchism and politically-engaged post-structuralisms. Examples are drawn from actions from the 1990 s to early 2000 s' the publicity and discussion materials of contemporary groupings and their critics as well as texts more centrally located within the academy...|$|R
40|$|Mirror neurons {{are single}} cells found in macaque premotor and parietal cortices that are active during action {{execution}} and observation. In non-human primates, mirror neurons {{have only been}} found in relation to object-directed movements or communicative gestures, as non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> of the upper limb are not well characterized in non-human primates. Mirror neurons provide important evidence for motor simulation theories of cognition, {{sometimes referred to as}} the direct matching hypothesis, which propose that observed actions are mapped onto associated motor schemata in a direct and automatic manner. This study, for the first time, directly compares mirror responses, defined as the overlap between action execution and observation, during object directed and meaningless non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> We present functional MRI data that demonstrate a clear dissociation between object directed and non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> within the human mirror system. A premotor and parietal network was preferentially active during object <b>directed</b> <b>actions,</b> whether observed or executed. Moreover, we report spatially correlated activity across multiple voxels for observation and execution of an object <b>directed</b> <b>action.</b> In contrast to predictions made by motor simulation theory, no similar activity was observed for non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> These data demonstrate that object directed and meaningless non-object <b>directed</b> <b>actions</b> are subserved by different neuronal networks and that the human mirror response is significantly greater for object <b>directed</b> <b>actions.</b> These data have important implications for understanding the human mirror system and fo...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>action</b> [...] {{occurs when}} a group takes an action which is {{intended}} to reveal an existing problem, highlight an alternative, or demonstrate a possible solution to a social issue. This can include nonviolent and less often violent activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed offensive to the <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> participants. Examples of nonviolent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> (also known as nonviolence, nonviolent resistance, or civil resistance) can include sit-ins, strikes, workplace occupations, blockades, or hacktivism, while violent <b>direct</b> <b>action</b> may include political violence or assaults. Tactics such as sabotage and property destruction may be considered violent if people are hurt in the action. By contrast, electoral politics, diplomacy, negotiation, and arbitration are not usually described as <b>direct</b> <b>action,</b> as they are politically mediated. Non-violent actions are sometimes a form of civil disobedience, and may involve a degree of intentional law-breaking where persons place themselves in arrestable situations {{in order to make}} a political statement but other actions (such as strikes) may not violate criminal law.|$|R

By early 1954, however, a major covert operation against Guatemala was being organized, this time with greater Honduran cooperation. One reason for the cooperation was the Honduran government's concern over increased labor tensions in the banana-producing areas, tensions that the fruit companies blamed, in part, on Guatemalan influence.|$|E

Most white residents of Birmingham expressed shock at the demonstrations. White religious leaders denounced King and the other organizers, saying that [...] "a cause should be pressed in the courts and the negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets". Some white Birmingham residents were supportive as the boycott continued. When one black woman entered Loveman's department store to buy her children Easter shoes, a white saleswoman said to her, [...] "Negro, ain't you ashamed of yourself, your people out there on the street getting put in jail and you in here spending money and I'm not going to sell you any, you'll have to go some other place."

A Spanish-German Spanish-Moroccan Transport Company (HISMA) and an entirely German company, the [...] "Raw Materials and Good Purchasing Company" [...] (ROWAK) were established. German {{transports}} moved nearly 2,500 troops from Spanish Morocco to Spain. Early intervention helped to ensure the Nationalists successes in the war's initial stages. The training they provided to the Nationalists proved as valuable, if not more so, than <b>direct</b> <b>actions.</b> From 29 July to 11 October the Germans transported 13,523 Moroccan troops and 270,100 kilograms of war material from Morocco to Andalusia; and it was Franco's African forces, thus transported and supplied, which were a decisive factor in the war. Germany signed the Non-Intervention Agreement on 24 August 1936, but consistently broke it. After a Republican air attack on the German warship Deutschland, Germany and Italy said they would withdraw from the Non-Intervention Committee and from maritime patrols. Early June 1937 saw the return of Germany and Italy to the committee and patrols, but they withdrew from patrols following a further attack. The German military in Spain, who were later reorganised and renamed the Condor Legion, claimed to have destroyed a total of 372 Republican planes and 60 Spanish Republican Navy ships. They lost 72 aircraft due to hostile action and another 160 to accidents. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices.|$|E
