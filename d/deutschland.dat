5|$|<b>Deutschland</b> {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the High Seas Fleet until 1913, when she {{was transferred to the}} II Battle Squadron. With the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she and her sister ships were tasked with defending the mouth of the Elbe and the German Bight from possible British incursions. <b>Deutschland</b> and the other ships of the II Battle Squadron participated in most of the large-scale fleet operations {{in the first two years}} of the war, culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. Late on the first day of the battle, <b>Deutschland</b> and the other pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged several British battlecruisers before retreating.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deutschland</b> {{was ordered}} by the Imperial Navy from the Samuda Brothers {{shipyard}} in London, UK; her keel was laid in 1872. <b>Deutschland</b> and her sister Kaiser were ordered shortly {{after the end of}} the Franco-Prussian War, under the assumption that the French would quickly attempt a war of revenge. The ship was launched on 12 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 20 July 1875. <b>Deutschland</b> cost the German government 8,240,000gold marks. She was the last German capital ship built by a foreign shipbuilder.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1912, {{due to the}} Agadir Crisis, {{the summer}} cruise was {{confined}} to the Baltic, to avoid exposing the fleet {{during the period of}} heightened tension with Britain and France. In September, following the autumn maneuvers, <b>Deutschland</b> suffered a grounding while in the Baltic. The resulting damage necessitated dry-docking, and repairs were completed by November, allowing the ship {{to take part in the}} winter cruise in the Baltic. In October, during the repair period, KzS Hugo Meurer took command of the ship. On 30 January 1913, Holtzendorff was relieved as the fleet commander, owing in large part due to Wilhelm II's displeasure with his strategic vision. Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Ingenohl took Holtzendorff's place that day; but only one day later, on the 31st, he lowered his flag aboard <b>Deutschland</b> to transfer to the new dreadnought , which replaced <b>Deutschland</b> as flagship. The golden bow ornament that denoted the flagship was removed, and <b>Deutschland</b> returned to the ranks of the II Battle Squadron. The year's training proceeded in much the same pattern as in previous years. <b>Deutschland</b> briefly resumed flagship duties in late 1913, as Friedrich der Grosse was in dry-dock for periodic maintenance.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 {{he became}} a member of the SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei <b>Deutschlands)</b> and later joined the (USPD (Unhabhänige Sozialdemokratische Partei <b>Deutschlands).</b> In spring 1919 he was one of the founders of the KPD (Kommunistische Partei <b>Deutschlands)</b> in Magdeburg and in 1946 he joined the SED (Sozialistische Einheitspartei <b>Deutschlands).</b>|$|R

5|$|The next year—1909—followed {{much the}} same pattern. KzS Ehler Behring {{replaced}} von Krosigk in April. In June, <b>Deutschland</b> won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent shooting in the II Squadron. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which <b>Deutschland</b> stopped in Bilbao, Spain. While {{on the way back}} to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. After another round of exercises, <b>Deutschland</b> went in for a periodic overhaul. During the refit, she was given additional pedestal-mounted searchlights and became the first ship in the German navy to be equipped with an X-ray machine. In late 1909, Prince Heinrich was replaced by Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, who kept <b>Deutschland</b> as his flagship. Holtzendorff's tenure as fleet commander was marked by strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E
5|$|After Jutland, <b>Deutschland</b> and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned to picket duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts had no place in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, <b>Deutschland</b> lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, <b>Deutschland</b> had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.|$|E

5|$|After the battle, {{in which}} pre-dreadnoughts proved too {{vulnerable}} against more modern battleships, <b>Deutschland</b> {{and her three}} surviving sisters were assigned to coastal defense duties. By 1917, they had been withdrawn from combat service completely, disarmed, and tasked with auxiliary roles. <b>Deutschland</b> {{was used as a}} barracks ship in Wilhelmshaven {{until the end of the}} war. She was struck from the naval register on 25 January 1920, sold to ship breakers that year, and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deutschland</b> {{remained}} on the East Asia station until early 1900, when she travelled via the Mediterranean and Portsmouth to Kiel. After returning to Germany, <b>Deutschland</b> {{was used as a}} harbor ship, starting on 3 May 1904. She was renamed Jupiter on 22 November of that year. On 21 May 1906, the ship was stricken from the naval register and used briefly as a target ship in 1907. The Kaiserliche Marine sold the ship in 1908 for 120,000marks; she was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg-Moorburg.|$|E

5|$|On 14 July 1914, {{the annual}} summer cruise to Norway began. The {{threat of war}} during the July Crisis caused Kaiser Wilhelm II to end the cruise early, after only two weeks; {{and by the end}} of July the fleet was back in port. <b>Deutschland</b> reached Kiel on the 29th, and moved to Wilhelmshaven on 1 August. With the {{outbreak}} of war, <b>Deutschland</b> and the rest of the II Squadron was tasked with coastal defense at the mouth of the Elbe. This duty was interrupted from 2 to 23 October, when the ship returned to Wilhelmshaven, and from 27 October to 4 November, for an overhaul in Kiel. On 10 November, she took part in a sweep into the Baltic toward Bornholm, which concluded uneventfully two days later. By 17 November, the ship was again stationed off the coast near the Elbe. While her sisters covered the raid on the English coast on 15–16 December, <b>Deutschland</b> remained on picket duty at the mouth of the Elbe.|$|E
5|$|The British {{battleship}} —armed {{with ten}} 12-inch (30.5cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906. Dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including <b>Deutschland.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Kaiser-class {{design was}} {{prepared}} in 1869 by Sir Edward Reed; their construction {{was awarded to}} the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London. The ships were the last German capital ships to be built abroad. All subsequent German capital ships were built by German shipbuilders. Kaiser and <b>Deutschland</b> were laid down in 1871 and 1872, respectively. Kaiser was launched on 19 March 1874 and commissioned into the fleet on 13 February 1875. <b>Deutschland</b> was launched on 12 September 1874 and joined her sister in the fleet on 20 July 1875.|$|E

50|$|The {{merger of}} the Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei <b>Deutschlands,</b> KPD) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (Sozialdemokratische Partei <b>Deutschlands,</b> SPD) into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei <b>Deutschlands,</b> SED) {{occurred}} on 21 April 1946 {{in the territory}} of the Soviet occupation zone: it is also called the forced merger of the KPD and SPD. In the course of the merger, about 5,000 Social Democrats who opposed it were detained and sent to camps and jails.|$|R
5|$|The ship {{did not see}} {{active duty}} again until the summer of 1889, when <b>Deutschland</b> joined the fleet that steamed to Great Britain to {{celebrate}} the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II; the ship joined her sister Kaiser and the turret ships Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse in the II Division. The fleet then held training maneuvers in the North Sea under command of Rear Admiral Friedrich Hollmann. <b>Deutschland</b> {{and the rest of}} the II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889–1890, the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany. <b>Deutschland</b> participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890. She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September, where the entire eight-ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel. The II Division, including <b>Deutschland,</b> served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890–1891. The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean, under the command of Rear Admiral Wilhelm Schröder.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee {{had some}} {{improvements}} in armor thickness. The barbettes, 100mm thick in <b>Deutschland,</b> became 125mm {{for the two}} sisters. Admiral Scheer had the belt somewhat improved, and Admiral Graf Spee had a much more improved 100mm belt, instead of 50–80mm. The armored deck was improved as well, and some places had up to 70mm thickness.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, <b>Deutschland</b> and Admiral Graf Spee were deployed to the Atlantic {{to put them in}} position to attack Allied merchant traffic once war was declared. Admiral Scheer remained in port for periodic maintenance. <b>Deutschland</b> was not particularly successful on her raiding sortie, during which she sank or captured three ships. She then returned to Germany where she was renamed Lützow. Admiral Graf Spee sank nine vessels in the South Atlantic before she was confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate. Although she damaged the British ships severely, she was herself damaged and her engines were in poor condition. Coupled with false reports of British reinforcements, the state of the ship convinced Hans Langsdorff, her commander, to scuttle the ship outside Montevideo.|$|E

5|$|<b>Deutschland</b> {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean, often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits. <b>Deutschland</b> was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, though she was too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent three years in the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1900. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until 1908 when she was sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
