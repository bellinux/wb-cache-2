25|$|I {{find a man}} prowling {{about my}} house with {{obviously}} felonious purposes. I hasten to get locks and bars, and to barricade my windows.

25|$|Soon I {{found myself}} on the main bandstand before this {{enormous}} crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming <b>down</b> <b>my</b> cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} <b>down</b> <b>my</b> first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that I {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned is that it has made Rome hard to follow.|$|E

Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions <b>down</b> <b>my</b> throat – no one.|$|E

500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better.

500|$|As a teenager, Stengel {{played on}} a number of semipro {{baseball}} teams. He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning a dollar a day. He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, [...] "So I put <b>down</b> <b>my</b> paper and signed. You could never change that boy's mind anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Unable {{to contain}} her fires, Kaga {{survivors}} were taken {{off by the}} destroyers [...] and [...] between 14:00 and 17:00. Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from Hagikaze and sank stern-first at position [...] Ensign Takeshi Maeda, an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze, described the scene: [...] "My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby.

Philip Saville had heard Dylan singing [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] to two Spanish au pairs, early one morning whilst the singer was staying in his house. [...] "Hang Me, O Hang Me" [...] and [...] "Cuckoo Bird" [...] were traditional folk songs but Dylan altered the words.

500|$|Following an {{argument}} with Janice and Les, Toyah ran away to London to find her real father, Ronnie. However, she was [...] "led on" [...] by Neil Flynn (Tim Dantay), a stranger pretending to be Ronnie, and was later abducted by him. Taylor said the storyline {{was one of the}} hardest she had to film: [...] "In the story, I come down to London to track <b>down</b> <b>my</b> real father and things go badly wrong. Toyah hitchhikes all the way and just leaves herself so wide open. She is so naive and trusting and open to being used and abused." [...] The storyline was filmed on location in the city of London in early August. An hour long episode focusing on Janice and Les' search for Toyah was broadcast a month later.|$|E
500|$|Led Zeppelin II {{is a hard}} rock, blues rock, {{and heavy}} metal album. The {{finished}} tracks reflect the raw, evolving sound of the band and their ability as live performers. The album has been noted for featuring a further development of the lyrical themes established by Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin's debut album, as Robert Plant had not until that point written any lyrics for the band. This all served to create a work which would then become more widely acclaimed and arguably more influential. [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] and [...] "The Lemon Song" [...] both feature sexual themes, as the latter contains a metaphor, which, according to one music writer, implores [...] "unnamed ladies to squeeze his lemon 'til the juice runs <b>down</b> <b>my</b> leg.'" [...] As was later observed by Plant himself: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, {{actress and}} singer Kristin Chenoweth was {{originally}} {{cast as the}} voice of Rapunzel while the film was still titled Rapunzel Unbraided under Keane's direction. Chenoweth, who had already begun recording dialogue for the role, said of her character at the time, [...] "I am Rapunzel, but Rapunzel is a squirrel ... and I'm going to let <b>down</b> <b>my</b> tail." [...] At one point, Disney had cast actress Reese Witherspoon as Rapunzel. Additionally, Witherspoon was also intended to serve as an executive producer on the film, but eventually exited the project for unknown reasons but has been suggested as creative differences. Following Witherspoon's resignation, Rapunzel remained uncast for quite some time, further jeopardizing the film's already troubled production, a period during which the character's voice was temporarily provided by [...] "friends around the studio" [...] in lieu of legitimate actresses.|$|E

500|$|In 1913, Chabas {{stated that}} he was [...] "pained and humiliated" [...] by the {{controversy}} over September Morn, though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as [...] "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements {{that it was his}} masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it [...] "was [...] wife's favorite picture". At {{the time of his death}} in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted [...] "If I had never seen it from the day I put <b>down</b> <b>my</b> brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." [...] However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, [...] "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Virginia Tech, Garland {{was named to the}} 2011 All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Academic Team along with Kyle Singler, Mason Plumlee, Ryan Kelly, and Tyler Zeller.
