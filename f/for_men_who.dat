5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look <b>for</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, and it had been caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it was decided}} to {{amalgamate}} old local and regional regiments that had existed into six new multi-battalion state-based regiments. While the pentropic system eventually fell by the wayside, these regiments have endured, maintaining the battle honours of the previously existing Militia units that had perpetuated the units of the AIF and serving as a valuable link to the traditions and service of earlier units. Nevertheless, many CMF soldiers felt that the introduction of these regiments reduced the Army's links to the community due to the move away from the traditional regionally based system and as a result many of these soldiers chose to leave the organisation. In 1965, as the pentropic system was abandoned, a further re-organisation of the CMF was undertaken as existing battalions were reduced and additional battalions were raised in the more populous areas, namely in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. Concerns about the regional identity of these units were addressed by reintroducing the old numerical designations. In 1966, the Army authorised the raising of six remote area battalions, one in each state. These units offered special conditions of service <b>for</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> could not meet their training requirements through normal attendance due to their occupation or place of residence. Ultimately though the Tasmanian battalion was never formed.|$|E

The highest rates of infection were in the most urbanised parishes and in tourist areas. The HIV epidemic has been closely tied to poverty and developmental and socio-cultural issues, including slow economic growth, high levels of unemployment, early sexual debut, the culture of multiple partnerships, and the informal drug and commercial sex sectors.|$|E

The custom to appoint to vote by proxy was however used also by males, and it was in fact common <b>for</b> <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> were absent or ill during elections, to appoint their wives to vote for them.|$|E

25|$|Patients {{who might}} {{particularly}} benefit from focal therapy with HIFU are men with recurrent cancer after the gland has been removed.

Additionally, <b>for</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have already failed salvage radiation treatment and have limited therapeutic options remaining, interventional therapies might offer more chances to potentially cure their disease.

25|$|Cheek kissing in Turkey is also widely {{accepted}} in greetings.

Cheek kissing between women is also very common, but it is also very rare for women who are introduced for the first time. A man and a woman could cheek kiss each other for greeting without sexual connotations only if they are good friends or depending on the circle, the setting, and the location like in big cities.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, mine {{officials}} disliked by {{union members}} were {{driven out of}} the area under death threats. In January 1894, the manager of the Isabella mine at Cripple Creek, Mr. Locke, was captured by a large body of armed men, and made to swear that he would leave and never return without permission of the miners, and that he would not identify those who forced him to leave. Once he gave assurances, he was allowed to get on a horse and leave the district.p.22 In July 1894, a group of about 20 to 40 armed men came to the Gem mine in the Coeur D’Alene district in Idaho, searching <b>for</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had been ordered by union miners to leave the country. They found one, John Kneebone, and shot and killed him. They then forced the mine superintendent and some other mine officials to walk to the Montana state line, and made them promise never to return.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and {{men who have sex}} with men are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or will be in the future, and form a bridge between the high-risk {{men who have sex with}} men group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions <b>for</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men, leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men who have sex with men living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men who have sex with men in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E
