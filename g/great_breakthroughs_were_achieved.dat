40|$|The GaN-based light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) have extensive applications in LED display, high brightness illumination, traffic signals, streetlights, automotive for LEDs, and high density optical storage, full-color display, laser printing, and laser lighting for LDs. The progress of the GaN-based LEDs and LDs is introduced. There are many universities and companies focusing on their research on the GaN LEDs and LDs, and the <b>great</b> <b>breakthroughs</b> have <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> in the GaN material, process techniques, growth on non-polar and semi-polar substrates, and high extraction efficiency for LEDs.

And the possible solutions are proposed in order to eliminate or decrease the difficulties...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{colloidal}} {{properties of}} soils, especially of its clay and decayed organic matter components are pillars of edifice of soil science. The colloids control almost all soil reactions, but their behavior {{is controlled by}} dilution, change in pH, ion exchange, accretion of bases and many other processes, {{some of which are}} natural, while many others are anthropogenic. The anthropogenic manipulation of soils is the foundation of agrarian civilization, but spread into managed-forest, and urban ecosystems with time. In the twentieth century, <b>great</b> <b>breakthroughs</b> have <b>been</b> <b>achieved</b> in order to make soils more productive and responsive to environmental challenges. Historically, soil science as a discipline showed enormous capacity to absorb scientific advancement made in kindred disciplines into its body of knowledge. The X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic studies on clay particles in the last century exhibited nanoscale nature of the particles in all three dimensions. Therefore, it was but natural that clay and organic matter components of soils would be of primary concern to nanotechnology regardless of the field of activity &#x 2013; from physics to medicine. The added advantages of clay were their role in genesis of life on earth, and in evolutionary diversification of Neoproterozoic life forms. It was no wonder that many authors believe that nanoscience and nanotechnology sprouted from clay mineralogy and crystallography. Richard Feynman in his lecture, &#x 201 c;There&#x 27;s plenty of room at the bottom: An invitation to enter a new field of physics&#x 201 d; in 1959 envisioned that solid state materials, of which clay is a part, would be of great interest to nanotechnology. |$|R
