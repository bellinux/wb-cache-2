50|$|ADP/ATP {{translocase}} is very specifically inhibited by two <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>compounds.</b> The first family, {{which includes}} atractyloside (ATR) and carboxyatractyloside (CATR), binds to the ADP/ATP translocase from the cytoplasmic side, locking it in a cytoplasmic side open conformation.

Together with this, a database is collected for these QSAR studies, and could be considered a useful tool in future QSAR modeling of tyrosinase activity and for scientists that work in the field of this enzyme and its inhibitors.
