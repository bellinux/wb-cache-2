40|$|Silver {{was used}} for its {{antimicrobial}} effect by the ancient Greeks, long before the existence of microorganisms were first suspected. Nowadays {{a wide range of}} antimicrobial dressings containing silver, either incorporated within or applied on the dressings, are available for clinical use. This type of dressings is designed to provide the antimicrobial activity of silver in a more convenient application. The aim with this master thesis was to evaluate if silver release and antimicrobial effect of nine silver containing dressings are dependent on the test medium and if there is any relation between silver release and antimicrobial effect. Release of silver and antimicrobial effect was evaluated by using a 6 -well co-culture system, with <b>inoculated</b> <b>test</b> <b>medium</b> in the wells and dressing pieces in the culture well inserts. Three different test media with increased complexity and nutrient value were inoculated with either Results show that release of silver depends on the test fluid used; for phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the silver concentration was as most 1. 2 ppm, but for a complex media containing calf serum (SWF), it varied from 9 ppm to 134 ppm. The viable counts in PBS were reduced by at least 3 log units for all dressings and bacteria, whereas in SWF there were no reduction and instead growth was observed. In general, a high release resulted in less bacterial growth. Results also indicated that kinetics of silver release affect the antimicrobial effect. It is likely to assume that it is important for a dressing to release silver quickly. It has previously not been possible to correlate silver release of wound care dressings and antimicrobial effect, since the two factors have been measured in different test systems and in different media. Since both factors depend on test medium and method used, it is shown in the present study {{that it is important to}} use relevant test medium for in-vitro evaluation. When measuring silver release and antimicrobial effect in the same test system, a relation is found...|$|E
40|$|We have {{reported}} (Strandskov and Wyss, 1945) that thiouracil and thiothy-mine inhibit bacterial growth and metabolism {{and that the}} inhibition is reversed by the corresponding metabolite analogue. This effect of thiouracil on Escher-ichia coli has also been observed by Roepke and Jones (cited by Roblin, 1946). Hitchens, Falco, and Sherwood (1945) failed to observe inhibition of Lactobacillus casei by 10 mg per cent thiothymine when tested {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 mg per cent thymine. The experiments reported here show the quantitative aspects of the inhibitions and indicate their usefulness as methods of assay for small quanti-ties of pyrimidines.

The long-term survival rate of 20 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) on Dorset egg medium, supplemented Columbia agar base medium, chocolate agar, and Amies medium was compared with that on 70 % GC agar (chocolate) transport medium. N. meningitidis isolates were also inoculated onto 5 % horse blood agar, and Hib was <b>inoculated</b> onto Haemophilus <b>test</b> <b>medium.</b> All of the N. meningitidis isolates remained viable on Dorset egg medium for 21 days; viability on the other media was poor after only 7 days.

On an agar medium which included ornithine, raffinose, and Koser citrate, K. pneumoniae strains grew as yellow mucoid colonies at 24 h {{and there was some}} increase in colony size at 48 h. Other members of Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited or produced small pink colonies on this same medium. Pseudomonas, Providencia, Acinetobacter, and Proteus species did not grow or showed very poor growth.

40|$|International audienceRenewed {{interest}} has arisen {{in the use}} of thromboelastography/thromboelastometry in evaluating coagulation kinetics. The <b>test</b> <b>medium,</b> type of activator, and its concentration may influence the interpretation of coagulation kinetics. This study aimed to investigate methodologic influences of activator and <b>test</b> <b>medium</b> on thromboelastometric parameters of coagulation kinetics. Dynamic clot formation was evaluated by thromboelastometry using whole blood (WB), platelet-rich plasma, or platelet-poor plasma employing different concentrations of extrinsic (tissue factor) and contact activator (synthasil) and with variable concentrations of phospholipids. Plasma samples displayed prolonged clot initiation and enhanced clot propagation compared with WB. Clot firmness was markedly reduced in platelet-poor plasma as compared with platelet-rich plasma and WB. Increasing concentration of activator shortened the clot initiation and increased the velocity of clot propagation, whereas terminal clot firmness remained unaffected. Platelets accelerated clot propagation and raised clot firmness. Phospholipids shortened the time of clot initiation and increased velocity of propagation, while clot firmness remained unchanged. Our results demonstrate that evaluation of coagulation kinetics using thromboelastometry varies according to the composition of the <b>test</b> <b>medium,</b> type, and concentration of activator, as well as the presence and concentration of phospholipids in the test reagent...|$|R
