40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{occurrence}} {{of an early}} Preboreal climatic cooling/oscillation (PBO) in lacustrine and <b>glacial</b> <b>records</b> from northwest Europe, Iceland and Greenland is reviewed and documented. The often subtle response of the proxy records to this oscillation, in combination with its short duration, {{make it difficult to}} detect. Owing to its chronostratigraphic position between the 10 000 – 9900 and 9600 – 9500 14 C plateaux (c. 11 300 – 11 150 calendar yr BP) it is also difficult to 14 C date with precision. We find that the vegetation response to the PBO varies between sites and regions. In contrast to the pioneer vegetation in Iceland and southern Sweden, the expanding birch–pine forest in Germany–Denmark was more susceptible to deteriorating growing conditions. The combined lacustrine, tree-ring and <b>glacial</b> <b>records</b> imply that the PBO was characterised by cool and humid conditions throughout northwestern and central Europe. This is documented by vegetation changes, decreased aquatic production, increased soil erosion, increased 2 H and 13 C content in tree-rings, readvances or stillstands of the ice sheet in Norway and Finland, and ingression of brackish water into the Baltic. Icelandic proxy records from lake sediments and glacial moraines imply cooler conditions than during the previous Preboreal period, but not as extreme as during the Younger Dryas.

5000|$|Analogy is a usual {{geologist}} method, {{using the}} present day observations and project/adapt it to the ancient earth systems. The main problem of this technique is the time-scale considered and the observation methods used. Most of the time, observations of active ice-sheet processes are instantaneous at geological time-scale and hard to apply in the ancient. Furthermore, in the ancient, field and geophysical studies are carried out at lower resolution but on a wider scale (time and space). Finally, even if Subglacial lakes are observed below ice sheets, melt-water drainage system processes ongoing, especially like the tunnel valleys remain unobserved directly. The record of these huge subglacial [...] "rivers" [...] is mainly analysed via the recent ice ages imprints (Weichselian, Saalian and Pre-Illinoian or Elsterian stages) and in the ancient one (Late Ordovician and Permo-Carboniferous) The idea of GRASP is to use methods commonly applied in the ancient onto recent glaciation record (Pleistocene). In the ancient, wide datasets are acquired by oil companies during exploration of sedimentary basins. By using {{the same type of}} data for the Pleistocene <b>glacial</b> <b>record,</b> the project tries to generate data comparable in between ancient and recent glaciations. The studied area is the North Sea that was glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum as well as the Northwestern Europe. On the sea floor, around the North Sea and into the kilometre of sediments below, many traces and evidences of the glacial events are recorded. As this place is a petroleum province, many data, especially geophysics ones are currently released or could be borrowed for academic purposes. [...] So, by joining the skills of three different universities, with the help of many data providers and the funding of six oil companies, new income is made into the knowledge of paleo-glacial systems. Basin analysis containing geophysical, reservoir and sedimentological models are produced in a new way and in a new type of environment. In an economic point of view, oil companies are interested in these models to have comparable data with their oil fields. In an academic one, understanding the recent ice sheet dynamic and is associated subglacial meltwater flow is crucial in the context of climate changes or fundamentally solving the intricate <b>glacial</b> <b>record</b> equation of recent and past ice ages.|$|E

40|$|Holocene glacial moraines in Mt Cook National Park are re-dated by multi-parameter dating techniques. The {{deposits}} {{from six}} main valley glaciers were examined. In earlier studies by other workers the glacial moraine chronology {{of three of}} these valleys had been specified using radiocarbon, historical and lichen dating. Results {{from the present study}} are compared with this earlier work. A chronology of glacial events is here defined using historical, radiocarbon and rock weathering rind thickness dating. In addition, post-depositional surface modifications are described using changes in plant development, lichen growth and soil properties. The more precise dating methods delineate up to fifteen separate glacial expansion phases during the last 10 000 years. The weathering rind chronology defines glacial events around 7200, 4200, 3790, 3350, 2940, 2540, 2160, 1830, 1490, 1150, 840, 580, 340, 135 and < 100 years ago.

40|$|Summary We {{present a}} <b>glacial</b> <b>record</b> {{from the western}} Olympus Range, East Antarctica, that {{documents}} a permanent shift in the thermal regime of local glaciers, from wet to cold based, between 14. 11 and 13. 94 million years ago (Ma).

Chronologic control comes from 40 Ar/ 39 Ar analyses of six in-situ volcanic ash deposits. The shift from wet- to cold-based glaciation reflects a drop in mean annual temperature of 20 to 30 ˚C and is shown to precede one or more major episodes of ice-sheet expansion across the region sometime between 13. 62 and 12. 44 Ma.

40|$|We use 10 Be surface {{exposure}} {{dating to}} construct a high-resolution chronology of glacial fluctuations in the Sierra Nevada, California. Most previous studies focused on individual glaciated valleys, whereas our study compares chronologies developed throughout the range to identify regional patterns in the timing of glacier response to major climate changes. Sites throughout the range indicate Last Glacial Maximum retreat at 18. 8 ± 1. 9 ka (2 σ) that suggests rather consistent changes in atmospheric variables, e. g., temperature and precipitation, throughout the range. The penultimate glacial retreat occurred at ca 145 ka. Our {{data suggest that the}} Sierra Nevada landscape is dominated by glacial features deposited during marine isotope stage (MIS) 2 and MIS 6. Deposits of previously recognized glaciations between circa 25 and 140 ka, e. g., MIS 4, Tenaya, early Tahoe, cannot be unequivocally identified. The timing of Sierra Nevada glacial retreat correlates well with other regional paleoclimate proxies in the Sierra Nevada, but differs significantly from paleoclimate proxies in other regions.

At {{the base of the}} exposed succession, strong evidence supporting glaciation includes diamictites, ice-rafted dropstones and intensely sheared zones of interpreted subglacial origin. These facies collectively represent ice-proximal to ice-rafted deposits. Upsection, dropstone-free mudstones {{in the middle of the}} succession, and the absence of diamictites, imply sedimentation free from glacial influence.

New cosmogenic exposure ages and field mapping from the Rakaia Valley in the South Island suggest that extensive ice survived well into {{the latter half of}} the Last Glacial–Interglacial Transition (18 – 11 ka), with the post- 15 ka period inferred to have near Holocene climate conditions based on ecological proxy data. By as late as ~ 15. 5 ka, glacier termini had retreated as little as 5 – 10 km from glacial maximum positions. Numerous minor ice still-stand positions and oscillations are recognized, but the record specifically excludes evidence for either a major climatic amelioration at ~ 15 – 16 ka or a significant glacial re-advance during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) or the Younger Dryas (YD).

Tillites form both under the ice and during rapid ice recession whereas fluvio-deltaic systems can only originate from a stable ice margin and last until the ice sheets withdraw inland. These two depositional modes are repeated several times generating the progressive burial of the Carboniferous palaeovalleys. This succession of erosions and fills records major glacial stages containing a series of glacial and interglacial phases from the Late Devonian to the Early Permian.

40|$|This paper reports recent {{progress}} made on ice-flow mapping in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland, using multibeam sonar imagery. Flow-parallel features identified on the imagery include drumlins, flutes, mega-lineations, and crag-and-tail land-forms. These features show a general trend of convergent ice flow, which is interpreted to represent fast-flowing ice (an ice stream) down {{the axis of}} Placentia Bay. Drumlins and fluted terrain onshore demonstrate that the convergent ice flow can be traced up-ice to regional dispersal centres. Flow-transverse features interpreted as deGeer moraines occur in water depths of 100 to 350 m, and were likely deposited during the deglaciation of the bay as tidewater margins became grounded in shal-low water. Ice-flow mapping of Placentia Bay also demonstrated that the largely depositional record preserved on the seabed is incomplete, with the apparent absence of a strong westward flow onto the Burin Peninsula.

Large ice advances also occurred during MIS- 2 (at ~ 23 and 17 – 16 ka), but these advances did not exceed the limits reached during MIS- 3. The results indicate that climatic conditions during MIS- 3, characterized by a cool-wet climate with a greater-than-today input from winter precipitation, generated the most favorable setting for glaciation in the study region. Yet, glacial accumulation also responded positively to the far colder and drier conditions of MIS- 2, and again during the last glacial–interglacial transition when precipitation levels increased.

A chironomid transfer function suggests that lake-water temperatures were depressed by 2 °C to 4 °C relative to maximum temperatures during the preceding Bølling–Allerød interstade (BA; ~ 14, 500 – 12, 900 cal yr BP). Diatom and stable isotope records suggest dry conditions during {{the latter part of}} the BA interstade and development of relatively moist conditions during the initiation of the YD stade, with a reversion to drier conditions later in the YD. These paleohydrological inferences correlate with similar timed changes detected in the adjacent Great Basin.

The new records support linkages between the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and widespread YD cooling in western North America, but they also suggest complex hydrological influences.
