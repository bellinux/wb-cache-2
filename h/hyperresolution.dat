40|$|There is {{a strong}} drive towards <b>hyperresolution</b> earth system models in order to resolve finer scales of motion in the atmosphere. The problem of obtaining more {{realistic}} representation of terrestrial fluxes of heat and water, however, {{is not just a}} problem of moving to <b>hyperresolution</b> grid scales. It is much more a question of a lack of knowledge about the parameterisation of processes at whatever grid scale is being used for a wider modelling problem. <b>Hyperresolution</b> grid scales cannot alone solve the problem of this <b>hyperresolution</b> ignorance. This paper discusses these issues in more detail with specific reference to land surface parameterisations and flood inundation models. The importance of making local <b>hyperresolution</b> model predictions available for evaluation by local stakeholders is stressed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze some {{fragments}} of the universal theory of distributive lattices with many sorted bridging operators. Our interest in such algebras is motivated by the fact that, in description logics, numerical features are often expressed by using maps that associate numerical values to sets (more generally, to lattice elements). We first establish a link between satisfiability of universal sentences with respect to algebraic models and satisfiability with respect to certain classes of relational structures. We use these results for giving a method for translation to clause form of universal sentences, and provide some decidability results based {{on the use of}} resolution or <b>hyperresolution.</b> Links between <b>hyperresolution</b> and tableau methods are also discussed, and a tableau procedure for checking satisfiability of formulae of type t 1 ≤ t 2 is obtained by using a <b>hyperresolution</b> calculus. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to give a better {{understanding}} of existing many-valued resolution procedures, and thus help to improve the efficiency of automated theorem proving in finitely-valued logics. First, we briefly present a method for translation to clause form in finitely-valued logics based on distributive lattices with operators, which uses the Priestley dual of the algebra of truth values. We show that the unsatisfiability of the set of signed clauses thus obtained can be checked by a version of signed negative <b>hyperresolution.</b> This extends the results established by Hähnle in the case of regular logics, where the set of truth values is linearly ordered. As in the case of regular <b>hyperresolution,</b> also our version of signed <b>hyperresolution</b> is surprisingly similar to the classical version. In the second part of the paper we explain why regular logics and the logics we consider are so well-behaved. We show that in both cases the translation to clause form is actually a translation to classical logic, and that soundness and completeness of various refinements of the (signed) resolution procedure follow as a consequence of results from first-order logic. Decidability and complexity results for signed clauses follow as well, by using results from first-order logic. This explains and extends earlier results on theorem proving in finitely-valued logics...|$|E

Disjunctive states are built from clauses over the token set of the underlying information system in order to represent disjunctive information.

Bezem [Be] presented a completeness proof for ground resolution that is independent of the cardinality of both the language and the set of clauses. As a corollary, he obtained a completeness result for (first-order) resolution that does not appeal to Herbrand's theorem.

40|$|Monitoring Earth’s {{terrestrial}} {{water conditions}} {{is critically important}} to many hydrological applications such as global food production; assessing water resources sustainability; and flood, drought, and climate change prediction. These needs have motivated the development of pilot monitoring and prediction systems for terrestrial hydrologic and vegetative states, but to date only at the rather coarse spatial resolutions (∼ 10 – 100 km) over continental to global domains. Adequately addressing critical water cycle science questions and applications requires systems that are implemented globally at much higher resolutions, {{on the order of}} 1 km, resolutions referred to as <b>hyperresolution</b> in the context of global land surface models. This opinion paper sets forth the needs and benefits for a system that would monitor and predict the Earth’s terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. We discuss six major challenges in developing a system: improved representation of surface‐subsurface interactions due to fine‐scale topography and vegetation; improved representation of land‐atmospheric interactions and resulting spatial information on soil moisture and evapotranspiration; inclusion of water quality as part of the biogeochemical cycle; representation of human impacts from water management; utilizing massively parallel computer systems and recent computational advances in solving <b>hyperresolution</b> models that will have up to 109 unknowns; and developing the required in situ and remote sensing global data sets.

The first one, called model generation, {{is based on}} an operator TPINT defined on sets of Herbrand interpretations whose least fixpoint is logically equivalent to the set of minimal Herbrand models of the program. The second approach, called state generation, uses a fixpoint operation TPs based on <b>hyperresolution.</b> It operates on disjunctive Herbrand states, and its least fixpoint is the set of logical consequences of P, the so-called minimal model state of the program. We establish a useful relationship between <b>hyperresolution</b> by PPs and model generation by TPINT. Then we investigate the problem of continuity of the two operators TPs and TPINT. It is known that the operator TPs is continuous, and so it reaches its least fixpoint in at most ω iterations. On the other hand, the question of whether TPINT is continuous has been open. We show by a counterexample that TPINT is not continuous.
