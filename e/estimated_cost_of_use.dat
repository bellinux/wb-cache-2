Under the TPA, the Department of Energy is currently under a consent {{order to reduce the}} tritium concentration in the spent fuel storage basin for KE-Reactor from 3. 0 {mu}Ci/L to 0. 3 {mu}Ci/L in the KE spent fuel storage basin, starting in 1996. The 100 KE and 100 KW Area fuel storage basins (K-Basins) at Hanford were built in the early 1950 s to receive and provide temporary storage for irradiated fuel from the now shutdown KE and KW production reactors. In 1977, the KE-Basin began to leak at a rate of 13. 5 gpm (51 L/min.), but, decreased to 0. 03 to 0. 05 gpm (0. 13 to 0. 19 L/min.) by 1980. In 1993, the leak increased to a rate of 0. 42 gpm (1. 6 L/min.). This engineering analysis examines the relative costs to reduce the tritium concentration KE-Basin water using a polyphosphazene polymer membrane under development at Pacific Northwest Laboratory. The <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the membrane to reduce the tritium concentration is compared to three no-treatment alternatives that include: (1) disposing of the tritium-contaminated water directly to the Columbia River, (2) disposing of the contaminated water to the soil at the on-site Effluent Treatment Facility, and (3) disposing of the contaminated water by evaporation using solar evaporation ponds...|$|R

The network model is formulated as a linear network flow problem with side constraints. To find the reduced costs, a technique using Lagrangian Relaxation, a minimum cost algorithm, and a shortest path algorithm were developed in the research. We illustrate this model with a case study of a major north American railroad. The results show that opportunity costs do affect the accuracy of calculated system contributions for services. Moreover, the opportunity costs and system incremental costs (SICs) are unstable over time. To handle the instability we make <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a new risk-pricing approach. ...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To compare program <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> chronic {{hepatitis}} B (CHB) screening and treatment using Australian and other published CHB treatment guidelines. METHODS: Economic modeling demonstrated that in Australia {{a strategy of}} hepatocellular cancer (HCC) prevention in patients with CHB is more cost-effective than current standard care, or HCC screening. Based upon this model, we developed the B positive program to optimize CHB management of Australians born in countries of high CHB prevalence. We <b>estimated</b> CHB program <b>costs</b> using the B positive program algorithm and compared them to <b>estimated</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> the CHB treatment guidelines published by the Asian-Pacific, American and European Associations for the Study of Liver Disease (APASL, AASLD, EASL) and those suggested by an independent United States hepatology panel. We used a Markov model that factored in the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> CHB screening and treatment, individualized by viral load and alanine aminotransferase levels, and calculated the relative <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> program components. <b>Costs</b> were discounted by 5 % and calculated in Australian dollars (AUD). RESULTS: Using the B positive algorithm, total program costs amount to 13 &#x 2005; 979 &#x 2005; 224 AUD, or 9634 AUD per patient. The least costly strategy is based upon using the AASLD guidelines, which would cost 34 % less than our B positive algorithm. Using the EASL and the United States Expert Group guidelines would increase program costs by 46 %. The largest expenditure relates to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> drug treatment (66. 9 % <b>of</b> total program <b>costs).</b> The contribution <b>of</b> CHB surveillance (20. 2 %) and HCC screening and surveillance (6. 6 %) is small - and together they represent only approximately {{a quarter of the}} total program costs.

40|$|Following the {{sequencing}} {{of the human}} genome, the next challenge is to ascertain how variations among genomes of individual persons play significant roles in their variations in disease susceptibility and severity and the efficacy of medical therapies. An individualized approach to medicine requires the ready acquisition {{of information about the}} sequence of individual persons’ genomes with reliable technology at acceptable costs. Thus, the ability to sequence an individual person’s genome for under $ 1, 000 within the next 10 years has been set as a goal. The Problem • What are the critical technological roadblocks and fundamental biological showstoppers? The traditional method of sequencing involves gel-based technology with optical detection. The <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> such a technology for each entire genome would be approximately $ 20 million. However, a variety of new sequencing methods is under development. For example, Shendure and colleagues (2005) have developed a new technology that uses color-coded beads (~ 1 µm in diameter), a microscope, and a camera to replicate thousands of oligo strands of DNA with each strand on its own tiny bead. Fourteen million such beads can be packed in an area of the size of a dime. Each camera frame can analyze beads, each of which has one of four dye colors. The flow of the beads is computer controlled and the camera records the dye color and hence the sequence. It is <b>estimated</b> that the <b>cost</b> per base with this new technology is ~ 1 / 9 of conventional sequencing. With continued development of novel technologies (Shendure et al., 2005; Margulies et al., 2005) that can reduce the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> sequencing by factors of 10, the goal of $ 1, 000 should be achieved.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} remediation of Lower East Fork Poplar Creek (LEFPC) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee was completed. The study was conducted by reviewing the public Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act record documents associated with the remediation of LEFPC and through discussions with the project staff involved or familiar with the project. The remediation took place in two phases. The first phase involved the excavation of about 5, 560 yd{sup 3 } of soil at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) locations in 1996. The second phase involved the excavation of 39, 200 yd{sup 3 } at another NOAA location and at the Bruner location in 1997. For the entire project (remedial investigation through cleanup), a total of 7, 708 samples (1 sample for each 5. 8 yd{sup 3 } of soil remediated) were analyzed for mercury. The project obtained special regulatory approval to use two methods for the determination of mercury in soils that {{are not part of}} the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act SW- 846 methods manual. The mercury analysis cost was $ 678, 000, which represents 9. 6 % <b>of</b> the cleanup <b>cost.</b> During the cleanup phase of the project, an on-site laboratory was used. The <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> savings that the on-site laboratory provided fall into two categories: direct reduction <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> associated with chemical analysis and sample shipment totaling approximately $ 38, 000, which represents a 5. 3 % savings relative to the <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> an off-site laboratory, and savings in the amount of $ 890, 000 (12. 5 % of the $ 7. 1 M cleanup cost), associated with expediting execution of the cleanup work by providing rapid (< 3 hours) sample result turnaround time. The manner in which the analytical services were procured for the LEFPC project suggest that the development of new chemical analysis technology must address deployment, performance, regulatory, robustness, reliability, and business appropriateness factors if the technology is to be used in environmental remediation...|$|R

In this work we present the first study of the sampling bias in BitTorrent measurements. We first introduce a novel taxonomy of sources of sampling bias in BitTorrent measurements. We then investigate the sampling among fifteen longterm BitTorrent measurements completed between 2004 and 2009, and find that different data sources and measurement techniques can lead to significantly different measurement results.

Based on data from 291 households, the study finds that the magnitude of exposure to insecticides and fungicides significantly influenced the occurrence of acute symptoms. The predicted probability of falling sick from pesticide-related symptoms is significantly higher among individuals who apply pesticides compared to individuals in the same household who are not directly exposed. Further, the predicted annual <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> illness as a result <b>of</b> pesticide <b>use</b> {{is estimated to be}} Nepalese Rupees 144 per individual.

One particular new finding {{that has not been}} shown before in previous studies is that cost overruns appear to be more predominant among smaller projects as compared to larger ones. This observation, for the Norwegian road sector in particular, leads us to assert that the greatest potential for cost savings lies in exerting pressure on smaller projects to control their costs. Other factors found to influence the size <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> overruns include completion time of the projects and the regions where projects are situated. Surprisingly, neither project type nor work force type seems to influence the level <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> overrun. Finally, the paper proposes some policy implications. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to <b>estimate</b> the <b>cost</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>using</b> a 9 -cSt lubricant in helicopter transmissions in place of the DOD-L- 85374 oil currently being used. The expected benefits <b>of</b> <b>using</b> this higher-viscosity lubricant include longer lives for bearings and gears and a reduced rate of internal parts corrosion. The study was based on an analysis <b>of</b> direct maintenance <b>costs</b> for the main transmission of the SH- 60 B helicopter and an extrapolation of SH- 60 B cost benefits to other helicopters in the U. S. Navy and Marine Corps inventories. The cost savings projected from this analysis are presented in Table 1 - 1. Overall, the SH- 60 B helicopter would achieve an estimated annual savings of $ 709 thousand in gearbox unscheduled maintenance costs, with the savings for all U. S. Navy and Marine Corps helicopters reaching an estimated $ 7. 5 million annually...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND; AIMS: Endoscopist-directed {{propofol}} sedation (EDP) remains controversial. We {{sought to}} update the safety experience of EDP and <b>estimate</b> the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>using</b> anesthesia specialists for endoscopic sedation. METHODS: We reviewed all published work using EDP. We contacted all endoscopists performing EDP for endoscopy that we were aware of to obtain their safety experience. These complications were available in all patients: endotracheal intubations, permanent neurologic injuries, and death. RESULTS: A total of 646, 080 (223, 656 published and 422, 424 unpublished) EDP cases were identified. Endotracheal intubations, permanent neurologic injuries, and deaths were 11, 0, and 4, respectively. Deaths occurred in 2 patients with pancreatic cancer, a severely handicapped patient with mental retardation, and a patient with severe cardiomyopathy. The overall number of cases requiring mask ventilation was 489 (0. 1 %) of 569, 220 cases with data available. For sites specifying mask ventilation risk by procedure type, 185 (0. 1 %) of 185, 245 patients and 20 (0. 01 %) of 142, 863 patients required mask ventilation during their esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy, respectively (P >. 001). The <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> per life-year saved to substitute anesthesia specialists in these cases, assuming they would have prevented all deaths, was $ 5. 3 million. CONCLUSIONS: EDP thus far has a lower mortality rate than that in published data on endoscopist-delivered benzodiazepines and opioids and a comparable rate to that in published data on general anesthesia by anesthesiologists. In the cases described here, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> anesthesia specialists to deliver propofol would have had high costs relative to any potential benefit...|$|R
