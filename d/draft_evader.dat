50|$|Section 94 of the Security Service Law {{describes}} {{another method}} of draft evasion: defecting {{from the military}} {{on the day of}} recruitment. When a soldier fails to show up to be recruited he is defined by the military as a <b>draft</b> <b>evader.</b> After being defined as a <b>draft</b> <b>evader,</b> an arrest warrant is issued against him and thereafter the military police is responsible for locating and capturing him. After being caught by the military police, it would be decided whether the <b>draft</b> <b>evader</b> would go through disciplinary proceedings (which means that they would get a limited punishment and not a criminal record), or whether he or she would face a military court where the punishment is not limited and the criminal conviction is registered.|$|E

Prior to 2002, the {{passports}} of <b>draft</b> <b>evaders</b> living outside Greece were not renewed after the expiration of the original. Upon re-entering Greece, these people were generally forced to conscribe. However, in 2002, the right was granted to all Greek citizens to be issued passports, regardless of their draft status.

50|$|Nevada City is a {{ghost town}} in Churchill County, Nevada, United States, located just east of Fallon, Nevada near the current {{intersection}} of State Route 116 and U.S. Highway 50. It was founded in 1916 as a socialist community known as the Nevada Cooperative Colony, but due to misleading advertising, mismanagement, and possibly dubious financial dealings by the Nevada Colony Corporation's directors, who were connected with the similar Llano del Rio colony near Los Angeles, the project folded in 1919. Another contributing factor to its demise was the unpopularity of its anti-war position during World War I, which led to bloodshed when Churchill County Sheriff Mark Wildes attempted to arrest colonist Paul Walters as a <b>draft</b> <b>evader.</b> By 1919 most of the families had moved away and the colony fell into receivership.|$|E

[...] (Time Magazine, April 25, 1938) [...] Unable to find work as a writer, Beals took a job with Standard Oil Company, {{but it did not}} suit him. In 1918, he spent a brief period of time in jail as a World War I <b>draft</b> <b>evader.</b> Upon release, he decided to go see the world, and with what little money he had, Beals and his wife Lillian drove to Mexico. [...] There, he founded the English Preparatory Institute, and taught at the American High School. They left Mexico in 1921 for Europe where Beals studied at the University of Madrid, and then the University of Rome. Back in Mexico, he became a correspondent for The Nation, separated from his wife, and became romantically involved with photographer Tina Modotti's sister, Mercedes.|$|E
5000|$|The 1918 Vancouver General Strike was {{the first}} general strike in Canadian history and was held 2 August 1918. It was {{organized}} as a one-day political protest against the killing of <b>draft</b> <b>evader</b> and labour activist Albert [...] "Ginger" [...] Goodwin, who had called for a general strike {{in the event that}} any worker was drafted against their will. The strike was met with violence from returned soldiers who had been mobilized and supplied with vehicles to storm the Labour Temple at 411 Dunsmuir Street (the present-day 411 Seniors Centre). Three hundred men ransacked the offices of the Vancouver Trades and Labour Council (VTLC), twice attempted to defenestrate VTLC secretary Victor Midgely and forced him and a longshoreman to kiss the Union Jack. A woman working in the office was also badly bruised when she prevented Midgely from being thrown out the window. Labour activist and suffragette Helena Gutteridge was also at the scene, but was unscathed.|$|E

(He had married in 1941 to Laurette Kilbourne and they had two children, Alexandria and Dianna.) He also claimed that he worked for vital defense industries. Later, he claimed as a Portuguese citizen from a neutral country, that he could not serve in the United States armed forces. He was indicted for lying about his income to the draft board, when he claimed he only earned $11,000 in 1940, but actually earned $337,000. He was convicted as a <b>draft</b> <b>evader</b> and served two years in the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania from 1947 to 1949. [...] His wife divorced him in 1949 while in prison claiming cruelty. After the divorce and getting out of prison, Rubinstein became noted for his social life, being seen with numerous women at fancy nightclubs.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, {{there was}} no legal {{way to avoid the}} draft, and failure to obey was treated as insubordination, punished by {{execution}} or jail. <b>Draft</b> <b>evaders</b> were forced to escape to the forests and live there as outlaws, in what was called facetiously serving in the käpykaarti (Pine Cone Guard). 1,500 men failed to show up at the draft {{at the start of the}} Continuation War, and 32,186 cases of desertion were handled by the courts. There were numerous reasons: fear or war-weariness, objection to the war as an offensive war, ideological objections or outright support for Communism. However, Communists that considered dangerous were subject to [...] "protective custody", in practice detention in a prison for the course of the war. The käpykaarti was a diverse group including <b>draft</b> <b>evaders,</b> deserters, Communists and Soviet desants. They lived in small groups, sometimes even in military-style dugouts constructed from logs, and often maintained a rotation to guard the camp. They received support from sympatizers who could buy from the black market, or failing that, stole provisions to feed themselves. The Finnish Communist Party was able to operate among the <b>draft</b> <b>evaders.</b> 63 death sentences were handed out to deserters, however many of them were killed in military or police raids on their camps. At the conclusion of the war, the Allied Control Commission immediately demanded an amnesty for <b>draft</b> <b>evaders,</b> and they were not further punished.|$|R

However, in 2007, a [...] cabin used by hiding <b>draft</b> <b>evaders</b> during the American Civil War was discovered on North Mountain.

5|$|While many {{soldiers}} were still arriving, {{the citizens of}} Benton held a meeting on August 14 {{to decide whether or}} not they would resist the soldiers. Many argued against it, but approximately 75 men declared they were prepared to resist any military occupation of their part of Columbia County. These men were led by Jacob Schultz, Samuel Kline, and one person from Orangeville. Kline went south to the town to learn more about the soldiers in Bloomsburg. According to an account by Edward McHenry, the other members of the resistance were told to remain at home until news arrived from Bloomsburg. When the <b>draft</b> <b>evaders</b> discovered that the army coming from Bloomsburg was too strong to defeat, McHenry and 20 other <b>draft</b> <b>evaders</b> in the county escaped to North Mountain.|$|R

5|$|On August 4, 1864, after {{rumors of}} a {{conspiracy}} in Columbia County reached Harrisburg and Washington, D.C., a Captain Manville requested that 40 to 45 soldiers be sent to Columbia County to arrest the local deserters and <b>draft</b> <b>evaders.</b> Forty-eight soldiers arrived on August 13 at the Bloomsburg Fairgrounds in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, {{near the mouth of}} Fishing Creek. They brought two cannons and a battery of artillery. Two days later, 250 more soldiers arrived in Bloomsburg. Several prominent residents in the county, including United States Senator Charles R. Buckalew, assured the soldiers that there was no opposing armed force within the county. On August 16 Major General Darius Couch arrived to oversee the troops, and another group of soldiers arrived that same day. Colonel John Gosse Freeze delivered a message to the northern part of Columbia County, stating that any <b>draft</b> <b>evaders</b> who reported to Bloomsburg by August 20 would be pardoned. By August 21, there were a thousand soldiers in Columbia County, and they began marching up Fishing Creek to search for the alleged fort. That evening the soldiers made camp at Coleman's Grove near Benton, Pennsylvania.|$|R
