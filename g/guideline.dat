40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the quantity, quality, {{and availability of}} practice <b>guidelines</b> currently used in Finland. DESIGN: Cross sectional survey. METHODS: <b>Guidelines</b> from 1989 to 1995 were collected through a database search, through hand searches of the two Finnish general medical journals, and through an inquiry into hospitals, health centres, and medical societies. The content and source of evidence for <b>guidelines</b> was assessed. RESULTS: 719 practice <b>guidelines</b> were found. 578 <b>guidelines</b> (80 %) were retrieved by the inquiry, the database search identified 27 (4 %) and hand searches 106 (15 %). There were 150 <b>guidelines</b> (21 %) developed nationally, 120 (17 %) regionally, and 449 (62 %) locally. The structure and quality of evidence supporting the <b>guidelines</b> was variable and only two <b>guidelines</b> were based on meta-analysis. The references were significantly more often (P < 0. 001) documented in the national <b>guidelines</b> (n = 129, 86 %) than in the regional or local <b>guidelines</b> (n = 65, 11 %). CONCLUSIONS: There are many ways of disseminating <b>guidelines</b> {{and it may be}} difficult for end users to find the appropriate <b>guidelines.</b> Sources of evidence were seldom documented in the regional and local <b>guidelines</b> and even some national <b>guidelines</b> lacked all references. More attention should be paid to documenting the level of evidence, structuring the <b>guidelines,</b> and creating optimal strategies for development and dissemination of <b>guidelines...</b>|$|R

5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 <b>guideline</b> from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine.

5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a <b>guideline,</b> and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} cancer in Europe and accounts for 16. 3 % of female cancer deaths in Europe, being thus a major health problem. Improvements {{in the quality of}} care, in particular increasing the adherence to evidence-based guidelines/recommendations, are therefore welcome. Within the European Commission's Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC), <b>guidelines</b> addressing breast cancer screening and diagnosis, henceforth mentioned as the European Breast <b>Guidelines,</b> are being developed by the <b>Guidelines</b> Development Group (GDG) under the coordination of the JRC Healthcare Quality Team. However, in order to cover all care processes, the <b>guidelines</b> developed by the GDG need to be complemented by the ECIBC <b>Guidelines</b> Platform (later referred to as the <b>Guidelines</b> Platform or platform) that will contain <b>guidelines</b> and recommendations for all breast care processes with main focus on those on treatment, rehabilitation, follow-up and palliative care. For the <b>Guidelines</b> Platform, breast cancer <b>guidelines</b> produced by different entities and stakeholder organisations, such as professional societies, have been searched from all publicly available sources. To be as inclusive as possible, also a public call for <b>guidelines</b> was organised. The identified evidence-based <b>guidelines</b> and those submitted by different stakeholder organizations (altogether more than 250 <b>guidelines)</b> are to be evaluated for their quality, clinical impact, geographical coverage and sustainability. Only those trustworthy <b>guidelines</b> fulfilling the carefully defined eligibility criteria will be included in the <b>Guidelines</b> Platform to be hosted in the ECIBC website. These <b>guidelines</b> - in addition to the European Breast <b>Guidelines</b> - will also become reference documents for the voluntary European quality assurance scheme for breast cancer services, henceforth mentioned as European QA scheme. Besides supporting the European QA scheme, the <b>Guidelines</b> Platform can be foreseen as a valuable resource of <b>guidelines</b> for professionals, policy makers, researchers, <b>guidelines</b> developers, as well as for citizens and patients. The ultimate impact of the <b>Guidelines</b> Platform would be to reduce unnecessary variability in healthcare services and hence contribute to improve the outcomes of breast cancer patients in terms of morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.

5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality <b>guideline</b> recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E

Such systems posed a major deterrent to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were not {{equipped to deal with}} such threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical build-up became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum. This lack of active intelligence collection made estimation of North Vietnamese strength and intentions much more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Radon is a colorless and odorless gas {{generated}} by the breakdown of radioactive radium, {{which in turn is}} the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust. The radiation decay products ionize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes turn cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the USA, causing about 21,000 deaths each year. The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 Bq/m³ increase in the radon concentration. Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. About one in 15 homes in the US has radon levels above the recommended <b>guideline</b> of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).|$|E

The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a <b>guideline</b> for further study.|$|E
