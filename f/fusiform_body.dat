5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a <b>fusiform</b> <b>body,</b> thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial marsupial mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
500|$|Fast and energetic, the {{porbeagle}} can {{be found}} singly or in groups. Its <b>fusiform</b> <b>body,</b> narrow caudal peduncle with lateral keels, and crescent-shaped tail are adaptations for efficiently sustaining speed, which have also been independently evolved by tunas, billfishes, and several other groups of active fishes. It and the salmon shark are the thickest-bodied members of their family (length-depth ratio approaching 4.5), and consequently have the stiffest swimming style: they oscillate their tails while holding their bodies mostly rigid, which confers propulsive power with high energy efficiency, but {{at the cost of}} maneuverability. The large gill surface area of the porbeagle allows more oxygen to be delivered to its tissues. It also has a short band of aerobic [...] "red muscle" [...] along each side, which can contract independently of the regular [...] "white muscle" [...] at a lower energy cost, enhancing the shark's stamina.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rainbow runner}} has {{a body that}} is {{atypical}} of the jack family, which generally have deep, compressed bodies. The rainbow runner has a subcylindrical, elongated to almost <b>fusiform</b> <b>body,</b> with a long pointed head and snout and a tapering rear end before the caudal fin emerges. The eye is relatively small and the teeth are arranged on jaws in villiform bands, with minute teeth also present {{on the roof of}} the mouth and tongue. The fish has two dorsal fins, although the posterior rays of the long second fin have separated into a finlet. The first dorsal consists of 6 spines, the second of a single spine and 25 to 30 soft rays, with the last two as a separate finlet. Approximately 4%(three out of every seventy-seven) of rainbow runner have only five spines in the first dorsal fin, and are apparently born without them.|$|E

It is shown that if the discrete vortex lattice is considered as an approximation to surface-distributed vorticity, then {{the concept of the}} generalized principal part of an integral yields a residual term to the vortex-induced velocity that renders the vortex lattice method valid for supersonic flow. Special schemes for simulating non-zero thickness lifting surfaces and <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> with vortex lattice elements are presented.

5000|$|Hupehsuchians {{were clearly}} well adapted to marine life, as they possessed limbs that were paddle-like {{in shape and}} had <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies.</b> It {{is likely that the}} {{characteristically}} elongated neural spines were associated with well-developed epaxial muscles (muscles lying above the transverse process of the vertebrae) that facilitated lateral undulation in an axial subundulatory mode. The pattern of articulation in the vertebrae suggest that such undulation was concentrated posteriorly near the pelvic girdle and tail. It is likely that Hupehsuchus was better equipped for lateral undulation as a means of locomotion than Nanchangosaurus was. This is evidenced by the assumed greater degree of lateral compression {{in the body of the}} former genus as well as generally more elongate neural spines.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{sea turtles}} {{have a more}} <b>fusiform</b> <b>body</b> plan than their {{terrestrial}} or freshwater counterparts. The reduced volume of a <b>fusiform</b> <b>body</b> means sea turtles can not retract their head, legs, and arms into their shells for protection like other turtles can. However this more stream-line body plan reduces drag {{in the water and}} allows the turtle to swim more easily.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fusiform</b> <b>body</b> area (FBA) {{is a part}} of the extrastriate visual cortex, {{an object}} {{representation}} system involved in the visual processing of human bodies in contrast to body parts. Its function is similar to but distinct from the extrastriate body area (EBA), which perceives bodies in relation body parts, and the fusiform face area (FFA), which is involved in the perception of faces. Marius Peelen and Paul Downing identified this brain region in 2004 through an fMRI study.; in 2005 Rebecca Schwarzlose and a team of cognitive researchers named this brain region the <b>fusiform</b> <b>body</b> area.|$|E
40|$|The mode of {{occurrence}} and chemical composition of garnet amphibolite in the Momose-Mizunashi district of the Hida Metamorphic Belt are described. The masses of garnet ampibolite form thin <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> whose occurrence is concordant with surrounding pelitic and basic gneisses. Formation of garnets is inferred {{to depend on}} chemical speciality of the original rocks such as high ΣFeO/MgO and low CaO/Al 2 O 3, ratio. They are classified into two kinds of garnet amphibolite according to CaO content in garnet, i. e., one comparatively low in the CaO content, and the other rather high in the CaO content.

40|$|Many {{fish pass}} a {{transverse}} wave down their body to produce thrust. Undulatory swimming comprises {{a continuum of}} swimming styles from curvilinearly increasing body waves running down <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> and generating thrust mainly at the tail to rectilinearly increasing body waves along elongate bodies generating thrust along the whole body. At {{one end of the}} spectrum are fish such as mullet Chelon labrosus (Müller et al., 1997) and danio Danio malabaricus (Wolfgang et al., 1999), both with a curvilinearly increasing amplitude envelope and thrust production dominated by the contribution of the tail. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the body contributes to the thrust generated at the tail. First, the body undulations create circular flow patterns that travel posteriorly along with the body wave and ultimately modify the flow around the tail to increase swimmin...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} linearized-body theory and {{reverse-flow}} theorems, the wave drag {{of a system}} of <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> at zero angle of attack and supersonic speeds is studied to determine the effect of varying the relative location of the component parts. The investigation is limited to two-body and three-body arrangements of Sears-Haack minimum-drag bodies. It is found that in certain arrangements the interference effects are beneficial, and may even result in the two or three-body system having no more wave drag than that of the principal body alone. The most favorable location appears to be one in which the maximum cross-section of the auxiliary body is slightly forward of the Mach cone from the tail of the main body. The least favorable is the region between the Mach cone from the nose and the forecone from the tail of the main body. (author) ...|$|R

60|$|Section 112. The {{structure}} of the retina demands fuller notice. Figure 9 shows an enlarged, diagram of {{a small portion of}} this, the percipient part of the eye. The optic nerve (o.n. in Figure 8) enters the eye at a spot called the blind spot (B.S.), and the nerve fibres spread thence over the inner retinal surface. From this layer of nerve fibres (o.n. in Figure 9) threads run outward, through certain clear and granular layers, to an outermost stratum of little rods (r.) and <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> called cones (c.), lying side by side. The whole of the retina consists of quite transparent matter, and it is this outermost layer of rods and cones (r. and c.) that receives and records the visual impression. This turning of the recipient ends away from the light is hardly what one would at first expect-- it seems such a roundabout arrangement-- but it obtains in all vertebrata, and it is a striking point of comparison with the ordinary invertebrate eye.|$|R

40|$|The {{cytoplasm}} of the vegetative cell of the ungerminated {{pollen grain}} of Endymton non-scriplus and other angiosperm species contains numerous <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> sometimes exceeding 15 /lm {{in length and}} 2 - 5 fim in width, which bind fluorescent-labelled phalloidin and are likely therefore to constitute a storage form of actin. The bodies are dispersed during the activation of the pollen, being replaced by aggregates of slender phalloidin-binding fibrils, which converge towards the germination apertures and {{are present in the}} emerging pollen tube. The storage bodies appear to be homologous with crystalline-fibrillar structures, shown in an earlier paper to be abundantly present in the vegetative cells of Nicotiana pollen. These are composed of massive aggregates of linearly disposed units with individual widths of 4 - 7 nm, probably to be interpreted as actin microfilaments. Vegetative-cell protoplasts from mature but ungerminated pollen disrupted in osmotically balancing medium release extended phalloidin-binding fibrils of a kind not observed in the intact grain. It is suggested that these are derived by the rapid dissociation of the compact actin storage bodies present in the vegetative cell at this stage of development...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} potentially {{novel and}} essential components of plant membrane trafficking mechanisms {{we performed a}} GFP-based forward genetic screen for seedling-lethal biosynthetic membrane trafficking mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. Amongst these mutants, four recessive alleles of GSH 2, which encodes glutathione synthase (GSH 2), were recovered. Each allele was characterized by loss of the typical polygonal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network and the accumulation of swollen ER-derived bodies which accumulated a soluble secretory marker. Since GSH 2 is responsible for converting γ-glutamylcysteine (γ-EC) to glutathione (GSH) in the glutathione biosynthesis pathway, gsh 2 mutants exhibited γ-EC hyperaccumulation and GSH deficiency. Redox-sensitive GFP revealed that gsh 2 seedlings maintained redox poise in the cytoplasm but were more sensitive to oxidative challenge. Genetic and pharmacological evidence indicated that γ-EC accumulation rather than GSH deficiency {{was responsible for the}} perturbation of ER morphology. Use of soluble and membrane-bound ER markers suggested that the swollen ER bodies were derived from ER <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies.</b> Despite the gross perturbation of ER morphology, gsh 2 seedlings did not suffer from constitutive oxidative ER stress or lack of an unfolded protein response, and homozygotes for the weakest allele could be propagated.

50|$|The assumed {{position}} of the naris in hupehsuchians as explained above can be taken as evidence for possible ichthyosaurian affinities, {{as it is in}} the same general area as those of ichthyosaurs. Hupehsuchians do resemble earlier ichthyosaurs in outward appearance with slightly <b>fusiform</b> <b>bodies</b> and long, straight, non-lunate tails. Other features shared with ichthyosaurs include a supraoccipital similar to what is seen in early forms, a relatively long antorbital region, and a short transverse process for the ribs. Many more differences exist between hupehsuchians and ichthyosaurs, however. In hupehsuchians, the surfaces of the vertebral centra that articulate with one another are distinctively flat, or acelous, while in ichthyosaurs they are noticeably heterocelous (it is also important to note that the surfaces of centra in the possible early diapsid ancestors of hupehsuchians were amphicelous). However, there are some early ichthyosaurs and ichthyosaur relatives such as Chaohusaurus and Utatsusaurus that possess vertebrae that are not deeply heterocoelus and more closely resemble those of hupehsuchians. Unlike more derived ichthyosaurs, the centra of these two genera are about as long as they are high. In hupehsuchians, where the neural arches dominate the vertebral column, the height of the centra is reduced and the height to length ratio of the centra is smaller, meaning that they are also about as long as they are high. This may suggest that hupehsuchians may have evolved from an ichthyosaur relative. It has also been suggested that hupehsuchians were related to or members of Sauropterygia. Indeed, Nanchangosaurus was classified as a sauropterygian upon its initial description.|$|R

We determined the intrinsic properties of the rNST GABAergic interneurons using a transgenic mouse model that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of a GAD 67 promoter. Glutamic acid decarboxylase–green fluorescent protein (GAD 67 –GFP) neurons were distributed throughout the rNST but were concentrated in the ventral subdivision with minimal interaction with the terminal field of the afferent input. Furthermore, the density of the GAD 67 –GFP neurons decreased in more rostral areas of rNST. In whole cell recordings, GAD 67 –GFP neurons responded with either an initial burst (73 %), tonic (18 %), or irregular (9 %) discharge pattern of action potentials (APs) in response to membrane depolarization. These three groups also differed in passive and AP characteristics. Initial burst neurons had small ovoid or <b>fusiform</b> cell <b>bodies,</b> whereas tonic firing neurons had large multipolar or <b>fusiform</b> cell <b>bodies.</b> Irregular firing neurons had larger spherical soma. Some of the initial burst and tonic firing neurons were also spontaneously active. The GAD 67 –GFP neurons could also be categorized in subgroups based on colocalization with somatostatin and parvalbumin immunolabeling. Initial burst neurons would transmit the early dynamic portion of the encoded sensory stimuli, whereas tonic firing neurons could respond to both dynamic and static components of the sensory input, suggesting different roles for GAD 67 –GFP neurons in taste processing...|$|R

Correlation between diet and general morphology was not significant in our analysis, unless when the analyzed set included only nektonic and benthic species, indicating that the lack of correlation between these factors is most pronounced in the group of nektobenthic species. The unequivocal case of morphological convergence found between the nektobenthic Characidiinae and Parodontidae is a clear example of the integration between phylogenetic information and ecomorphology, and provides a way to objectively identify cases of morphological and adaptive convergence and divergence.
