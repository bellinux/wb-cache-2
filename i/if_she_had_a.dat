5|$|Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in {{his absence}} the papal envoy Maurice Bourdin, later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at St. Peter's Basilica, {{probably}} that Easter and certainly by Pentecost. Matilda used these ceremonies to claim {{the title of the}} Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear. As a result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> legitimate claim to the title of empress.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, the White House feared {{reaction}} from Congress and the public, {{as well as}} that from radio and television talk shows, in the apparent, if not actual, repetition of the Baird controversy, and asked Wood to withdraw. A further burden was the disclosure that while she was a student in London, Wood had trained for five days as a Playboy bunny. [...] The White House was annoyed with Wood, because they said that when they had initially asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Zoë Baird problem," [...] she had responded in the negatory. [...] Allies of Wood gave a starkly different account and said that she had been fully forthcoming about the details of her dealings with the immigrant. [...] According to a Gallup Poll, 65percent of the American public did not think Wood should have been forced down.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E

She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection. This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Thunder", JB Kobask, was loaned to the Denver Broncos by Sharon Magness-Blake of Magness Arabians {{after she}} {{received a phone call}} from team officials asking <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> [...] "white" [...] horse. Thunder's debut as team mascot was on September 12, 1993, during the Broncos' victory over the San Diego Chargers. Angela Moore, his rider at the time, galloped him down the field after each Broncos touchdown. Thunder's mascot duties were expanded to include delivering the game ball to the referees at the start of each home game. [...] Spectators were allowed to interact with Thunder and pet him prior to the game. Magness said, [...] "Thunder is friendly, and Broncos fans think it's good luck for the opposing team to pet our mascot". [...] He was particularly popular with children, appeared on T-shirts, and was referred to as the [...] "second most popular Bronco" [...] after former quarterback John Elway. Thunder appeared at Elway's 1999 retirement gala. When team uniforms were redesigned in 1997, Thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horse-head profile as part of the logo on the team's helmets. During a February 4, 1997 press conference introducing the new logo, the team president and the art director for Nike, creators of the new design, described it as [...] "a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane." ...|$|E

500|$|Kim {{is raised}} in a nuclear family. Unlike popular {{animated}} sitcoms such as The Simpsons and Family Guy, both of Kim's parents are intelligent, accomplished and attractive; Kim's own intelligence is often attributed {{to the fact that}} she is born to a rocket scientist father and neurosurgeon mother. Kim's inherent confidence is a Possible family trait; her father James, who views women as equals, proudly reiterates the phrase [...] "Nothing is impossible for a Possible" [...] on numerous occasions. In her younger years, Kim's grandmother [...] "Nana" [...] Possible fought crime much like Kim herself. Kim Possible approaches the subject of the friend zone via Kim and Ron's relationship, discussing male-female friendship in a manner reminiscent to that of the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989). According to Sarah Freymiller of Bustle, the protagonists friendship evokes that of Batman and the Joker, [...] "Kim holds the functional and social power, while Ron exerts more of a calming, occasionally slapstick influence on the show ... he is the intelligent, kind chaos in her highly-organized life." [...] Kim and Ron are solely platonic friends for the show's first three seasons and remain best friends even after they start dating in Season 4, defying the popular belief that [...] "being romantically involved is worth more than being in a friendship." [...] The series avoids the popular [...] "Will they or won’t they?" [...] trope often used in television shows, keeping them as a couple for the remainder of the series. Having grown up together and learned from each other's mistakes, Kim and Ron ultimately make up for each other's shortcomings. According to Feminist Fairytales, [...] "Ron has a very relaxed attitude towards life which often provides a balance to Kim's assertive nature and perfectionism, while Kim helps Ron become much more independent and self-reliant." [...] Freymiller also believes Ron might have been conceived because [...] "the creators sensed that television would only be able to accept a strong female character <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> male counterpart," [...] eliminating fears Kim might be perceived as too bitchy, complementing her actions as opposed to dominating.|$|E

Following {{suggestions}} from Elvis, Priscilla began taking lessons from Mike Stone, a karate instructor she had met in 1972 backstage at one of Elvis' concerts. She soon began an affair with him. Priscilla states in her book, [...] "My relationship with Mike had now developed into an affair. I still loved Elvis greatly, but over the next few months I knew I would have to make a crucial decision regarding my destiny." [...] She later states [...] "Elvis must have perceived my new restlessness." [...] A couple of months later, she said that Elvis had requested to see her in his hotel suite. It was then that she writes in her book that Elvis [...] "forcefully made love to me... 'This is how a real man makes love to his woman.'" ...|$|E

Also, when Burke was asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.|$|E
