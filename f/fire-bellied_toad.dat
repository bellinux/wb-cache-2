5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, {{it is likely to}} remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a strategy that may deceive predators.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
500|$|The use of {{the common}} names [...] "frog" [...] and [...] "toad" [...] has no taxonomic justification. From a {{classification}} perspective, {{all members of the}} order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered [...] "true toads". The {{use of the}} term [...] "frog" [...] in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term [...] "toad" [...] generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The European <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.|$|E
50|$|European <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> have {{a bright}} lime green dorsal traversed by black spots, and orange to bright red bellies with black bars and stripes. The skin is mildly bumpy, the eyes set high to suit a {{semi-aquatic}} life style, and also well webbed back feet. Color and body variations will be described {{for each of}} the other 3 species commonly sold as or mistaken for Oriental <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads.</b> They are the largest of the bombina family. They are commonly darker than <b>Fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> from Asia.|$|R

500|$|The skin of many frogs {{contains}} mild {{toxic substances}} called bufotoxins {{to make them}} unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located {{on the sides of}} their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future. Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as aposematism. The poison dart frogs in the family Dendrobatidae do this. They are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators. [...] Other species, such as the European <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> (Bombina bombina), have their warning colour underneath. They [...] "flash" [...] this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} was to revise the localities where the {{occurrence}} of <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> was confirmed by earlier research. Specifically it covers the state of localities and a number of individuals, who inhabit them according to the previously found data. First of all I wanted to find out whether the floods which took place here or some other causes of the decline of amphibian population left some impact or if the localities are given some protectionist care. The revision was accomplished in several localities chosen from the works of Horak, Havelkova, and Stefka. I took picture of the places, measured the pH of the water and captured all the <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> which could be found here. I documented everything photographically for identification and I took a sample of their tissue. Then I released toads again. Alltogether I revised 14 localities where the occurrence of some of the local kinds of <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> was previously confirmed. Two of them can be considered defunct {{from the point of view}} of the occurence the amphibians. Another seven were repeatedly without any findings and therefore we can also consider them defunct. I would define three of the spots stable even though one of them went through a physical change and yet it shows a stable occurrence of the toads. One of the localities has changed very positively in terms of the occurence of the <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads.</b> It is also positive that we have found another new locality...|$|R
50|$|The Bombinatoridae {{are often}} {{referred}} to as <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> because of their brightly colored ventral sides, which show they are highly toxic. This family includes two genera, Barbourula and Bombina, both of which have flattened bodies.|$|R
50|$|Oriental <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> {{should be}} kept in water, with some kind of land or island to allow them to {{periodically}} climb out of the water. These frogs are not strong swimmers and may (but rarely) drown in water that is too deep. An ideal enclosure has plenty of land and water-based hiding places, as well as a land-based location suitable for depositing live food. <b>Fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> have a sensitivity to chlorine and chloramine - tap water should be treated or allowed to stand for several days, to allow chlorine to dissipate, before adding it to their environment. Chloramine will not dissipate in this manner, so tap water treated with chloramine must be treated with a dechloramine agent (and then allowed to stand) before being added.|$|R
50|$|The food of the European <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> {{consists}} of insects, spiders, millipedes, mollusks and earthworms captured in or nearby the water. The tadpoles mainly feed on algae, bacteria and plankton by grazing {{the surfaces of}} stones and plants. If attacked by a vertebrate on land the European <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> makes a hollow-back and lifts its four legs so that the ventral warning colour is displayed. The combination of dark and red is a learned signal meaning “attention poison” to the enemy.|$|E

50|$|Bombesin is a 14-amino acid peptide {{originally}} {{isolated from}} {{the skin of the}} European <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toad</b> (Bombina bombina). It has two known homologs in mammals called neuromedin B and gastrin-releasing peptide. It stimulates gastrin release from G cells. It activates three different G-protein-coupled receptors known as BBR1, -2, and -3. It also activates these receptors in the brain. Together with cholecystokinin, it is the second major source of negative feedback signals that stop eating behaviour.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{establish}} an effective alfaxalone concentration {{to be used}} for bath immersion of <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> (Bombina orientalis) and to describe its effects. STUDY DESIGN Prospective experimental study. ANIMALS Thirteen oriental <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads.</b> METHODS The study was carried out in two phases. The pilot phase involved five animals and aimed to identify an alfaxalone concentration capable of producing induction of anesthesia, defined as immobility with a head down position and loss of responsiveness to stimulation with a stick. The following trial in an additional eight toads used the effective alfaxalone concentration established during the pilot phase. Data from 11 animals (three toads in the pilot study and the eight additional toads) were analyzed. Twenty minutes after immersion in the anesthetic solution, the toads were removed from the bath, and heart rate, respiratory rate, the righting, myotactic and the nociceptive withdrawal reflexes were evaluated every 5  minutes. The loss of both righting and nociceptive withdrawal reflexes was considered indicative of a surgical depth of anesthesia. The time elapsed from anesthetic induction to return of righting reflex, the quality of recovery and the occurrence of undesired effects were observed and recorded. RESULTS Immersion was found to be a suitable anesthetic technique for oriental <b>fire-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> and 200  mg L(- 1) alfaxalone concentration produced anesthetic induction in 10 out of 11 toads. Side effects, such as skin irritation, erythema and changes in cutaneous pigmentation, were not observed in any animal. The duration of anesthesia ranged from 10 to 30  minutes after removal of the toads from the alfaxalone bath, and surgical depth of anesthesia was never achieved. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE It was concluded that alfaxalone anesthesia induced by immersion in a concentration of 200  mg L(- 1) is only suitable for toads undergoing non-invasive short procedures...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{behavior}} in a B. variegata female (female amplexus) is described. It {{is similar to a}} kind of aggressive behavior known for Rana temporaria.
