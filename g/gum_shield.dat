25|$|The {{stage was}} set for Louis's title shot. On {{the night of the}} fight, June 22, 1937, Braddock was able to knock Louis down in round one, but {{afterward}} could accomplish little. After inflicting constant punishment, Louis defeated Braddock in round eight, knocking him out cold with a strong right hand that busted James' teeth through his <b>gum</b> <b>shield</b> and lip and sent him to the ground for a few minutes. It was the first and only time that Braddock was knocked out (the one other stoppage of Braddock's career was a TKO due to a cut). Louis's ascent to the world heavyweight championship was complete.|$|E
50|$|The main {{turning point}} of the fight came very late. It came midway through the thirteenth round when one of two {{tremendous}} right-hand smashes sent the <b>gum</b> <b>shield</b> sailing out of Frazier's mouth. The sight of this man actually moving backwards seemed to inspire Ali. I swear he hit Frazier with thirty tremendous punches—each one as hard as those which knocked out George Foreman in Zaire—during the fourteenth round. He was dredging up all his own last reserves of power {{to make sure there}} wouldn't have to be a fifteenth round.|$|E

50|$|Sportswear also {{includes}} the variety of protective gear required for contact sports such as lacrosse, boxing and ice hockey. Different types of protective equipment are needed {{depending on the type}} of sport and position. The types of gears include the following: head gear, <b>gum</b> <b>shields,</b> shin pads, shoulder pads, and joint supports.|$|R
30|$|However, one {{functional}} attribute, protection, did {{not influence}} stratification {{of the current}} uniforms (β = −. 02, p = . 71). The reason might be because the current martial arts uniforms are made from nonperformance fabric (e.g., cotton canvas) {{and they do not}} offer protective features, except when practitioners wear additional protective equipment, such as protective gloves and <b>gum</b> <b>shields</b> (Macan et al. 2006).|$|R
50|$|In this event, each {{candidate}} is paired with another of 'similar weight and build', and is given 60 seconds to demonstrate 'controlled physical aggression' in a milling contest - similar to boxing, except neither winning, losing, nor skill are pre-requisites of passing. Candidates are instead scored on their determination and aggression, while blocking and dodging result in points deducted. Candidates wear head protection, <b>gum</b> <b>shields</b> and boxing gloves.|$|R
50|$|In career mode, {{the player}} must {{create their own}} boxer; they cannot use any of the game's pre-created boxers. Options to edit are: name, body size, handedness, skin colour and short colour. Each boxer in the game also has four {{attributes}}: power, speed, stamina and defense. These attributes all vary widely between the 30 boxers featured in the game (Evander Holyfield has the maximum rating on all of them). During career mode, all of the attributes can be increased by selecting various training activities, such as free weights sessions or a protein diet. Many of these portray somewhat unusual ways for a fighter to attempt to improve their boxing ability; for example, taking Karate lessons, paying {{a visit to a}} health club, or obtaining an iron <b>gum</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lawton {{challenged}} previous victim Derry Mathews for the IBO International lightweight title on 22 January 2011, stating {{prior to}} the fight {{that it would be}} his last. [...] The fight, in Liverpool, resulted in all three judges scoring for Mathews with the fight going the full 12 rounds despite a knock down for Lawton in the sixth. [...] Speaking after the fight Lawton said [...] "I finished off with a good last round ... I was getting to him {{towards the end of the}} fight and he didn't want to stand and trade with me ... I kept throwing shots and nothing was coming back. I had him on the ropes and he had to bite on his <b>gum</b> <b>shield</b> to get through it". [...] Announcing his retirement from boxing Lawton said that he would now concentrate on training boxers at the Impact gym saying [...] "I'm going to miss boxing. It's been a massive part of my life - and it's been fun ... But I'm getting on and needed to start thinking of doing something else. I'm going to concentrate on training champions." ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{double-blind}} {{randomized controlled}} trial assessed {{the effect of}} subgingival ozone (O 3, gaseous ozone, HealOzone MK II, KaVo) and/or hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) {{on the development of}} peri-implant mucositis. Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects (mean age, 60 ± 7. 7 years) with 80 implants (4 implants each) were recruited. First, a 2 -week pretrial phase took place to achieve healthy gingiva. Subsequently, partial gum shields were constructed for the experimental area (around the 4 implants); subjects were asked to refrain from brushing in that area by wearing the <b>gum</b> <b>shield.</b> The following treatments were randomly applied (for 60 seconds) to implant sites on days 0, 7, and 14 : (1) air (O 2) and saline (0. 9 % NaCl) (control group), (2) O 2 and H 2 O 2 (3 %), (3) O 3 and saline, and (4) O 3 and H 2 O 2. Plaque, gingival, and bleeding indices were recorded on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Results: Significant differences were seen among the treatments (P <. 01) in plaque (F = 16. 68), modified gingival (F = 7. 86), and bleeding (F = 18. 42) indices. O 3 + saline and O 3 + H 2 O 2 produced optimum gingival health scores and were equally effective and the most effective in controlling bleeding (mean score = 0. 05), while O 2 + saline was the least effective (mean score = 0. 56). Conclusion: Ozone showed great potential for management of peri-implant mucositis...|$|E
50|$|Since {{reaching}} an interim {{agreement with the}} GAA in 2009, the GAA has supported the GPA's Player Development Programme which provides off-field support services for inter-county players {{in the areas of}} education, career development, health and wellbeing and general such as a benevolent fund. With the Programme running since March 2010, inter-county players can now avail of scholarships, educational advice, an enhanced injury scheme, job searching advice, benevolent fund assistance for players in difficulty and a nationwide counselling service, <b>gum</b> <b>shields,</b> financial and budgeting advice, business start-up support and media training.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of body fluids contains crucial {{information about the}} state of health of an individual. While many efforts have been already directed toward real time analysis of blood and urine, there is still a pressing need for new solutions to non-invasively monitor other fluids like saliva and sweat 1. Towards this aim, the main technological challenge is the development of devices that are at the same time low-cost, minimally invasive and wearable, so that they could be used for in situ and real-time monitoring of physiological conditions 2. For example, continuous recording of sodium levels in sweat could be an informative tool to assist clinicians in prescribing a more personalised treatment of diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis 3 and in assessing athletes’ performances 4. Similarly, the monitoring of pH levels in saliva provides valuable information for the treatment of pathologies where physiological mouth conditions are compromised, like in Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) 5. Ion Selective Electrodes (ISEs) are potentiometric sensors designed to detect specific ions in blood and saliva. Using dual-screen printed electrodes as substrates, we were able to reduce their production cost, improve reproducibility, and combine pH 5 and sodium ISEs with solid contact reference electrodes. In our design, the sensors will be interfaced to two miniaturized potentiometric platforms (WIXEL for pH and Tyndall Mote for sodium detection) that were wirelessly connected to a base station. For pH measurements, the device will be accommodated into a <b>gum</b> <b>shield.</b> For sodium detection instead, we will use a microfluidic channel to convey sweat to the electrodes. The mote communication platform was adapted so that it could be worn on the upper shoulder through a fiber strip...|$|E
