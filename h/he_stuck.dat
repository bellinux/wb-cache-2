5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} {{problem with this}} approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Brooklyn Dodgers, winning 55–7. The Browns scored three touchdowns {{in five minutes}} during the first quarter. Cleveland added five more touchdowns {{in the second half}} and held a {{comfortable}} lead to the end. Fullback Marion Motley ran for 111 yards on five carries and scored two touchdowns, including a 50-yard run {{at the beginning of the}} second half. Tommy Colella scored a touchdown on an 82-yard punt return, and Bill Lund ran back an interception 28 yards for another. It was in this game that the Draw play was accidentally invented when Otto Graham tripped while dropping back for a pass. As he went down, sensing blitzers about to wallop him, <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> the ball in Motley's stomach who scampered for a sizable gain. Liking the effect, Brown added it to the playbook during halftime. By the next game the play became a staple of the offense with several versions for different situations. As Cleveland's lead increased in the second half, Brown put in second-string players. Quarterback Otto Graham was replaced by Ermal Allen, who threw for two of the Browns' touchdowns and intercepted a pass while playing on defense. Cliff Lewis, Graham's primary backup, also played in the game. Brooklyn's only score came in the second quarter on a Bob Hoernschemeyer rush. The Dodgers were hurt by short punts from Mickey Colmer and a poor passing game. The team was held to 39 yards of passing. Edgar Jones, Cleveland's primary halfback suffered an elbow injury during the game.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> to his advice to {{concentrate}} {{effort on the}} Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that “Germany may be much nearer {{the end of her}} staying power than available evidence shows” but that given French and Italian weakness it was “not an easy business to see through the problem”.|$|E

25|$|Through May 16, he was 1–2 with a 4.60 ERA {{in seven}} games. Due to his {{performance}} {{to that point}} in the season, Phillies manager Art Fletcher requested waivers for Winters, which could have potentially ended the pitcher's major league career at that point. However, <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> around until July 30, his final major league game. After his final big league appearance, the Phillies sent Winters to the Hartford Senators of the Eastern League, with whom he played {{until the end of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|The other {{important}} figure is Uehara Naohiko, a radio personality and songwriter of the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation. Around 1970, he visited Amami Ōshima and was taught the name shima-uta by local singers. <b>He</b> <b>stuck</b> to the mixed writing (島うた). He {{claimed that the}} name {{had been used in}} Okinawa too, but Takahashi found no evidence to support his claim. His notion of shima-uta was drastically different from that of academics: he applied the term not only to traditional folk songs but to shin min'yō (contemporary folk music) and even to pop music. He used his radio programs and musical events to popularize the name shima-uta in Okinawa. Uehara was different from Nakasone in that he engaged in transforming folk songs into popular music.|$|E
25|$|Early {{historical}} records are replete with instances of noblemen breaking into each other's parks and killing deer therein, {{often as a}} result of a local territorial dispute or vendetta or merely from high spirits. The penalties inflicted by royal justice were severe in such instances. For example, in 1523 Sir William St Loe (d. 1556) of Sutton Court, Chew Magna, Somerset, together with 16 others, armed with bows and arrows, crossbows and swords, broke into Banwell Park in Somerset, attached to Banwell Abbey, a residence belonging to Bishop of Bath and Wells William Barlow, and killed 4 bucks and other deer. In the following August he made a similar raid and killed more than 20 deer, the heads of which <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> on the boundary palings. He was ordered to appear before a magistrate, but the record of his punishment if any has not survived. However, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries a short while later, in 1552 Sir William obtained for himself from the crown the office of Keeper of Banwell Park.|$|E

25|$|Marden {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} Captain Bligh's HMS Bounty in January 1957. After spotting a rudder from this ship in a museum on Fiji, he persuaded his editors to let him dive off Pitcairn Island, where the rudder had been recovered. Despite the warnings of one islander—"Man, you gwen be dead as a hatchet!"—Marden dived for several days in the dangerous swells near the island and found {{the remains of the}} fabled ship. He subsequently met with Marlon Brando to counsel him on his role as Fletcher Christian in the 1962 film Mutiny on the Bounty. Later in life, when <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> with his tailored English suits while his colleagues wore more casual attire, Marden also wore cuff links made of nails from the Bounty. MGM had a reconstruction of the Bounty built for their 1962 film, also named Bounty. This vessel was built, of wood, to the original plans, in a traditional manner in a shipyard in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. However, all the dimensions were increased by approximately one third to accommodate the large cameras in use at that time.|$|E
25|$|Brown was a leg-spinner in his youth, {{but turned}} to medium paced bowling after the war. He {{was able to}} turn or cut the ball with his large hands and was a wicket taker rather than a {{container}} of batsmen, but sometimes lost his line and length. As a pace bowler he was more accurate, was able to tie down even the best batsmen and proved adept at breaking solid partnerships. In particular {{he was able to}} dismiss the stonewalling Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. He still used his leg-spin when required by conditions or the frailties of the batsmen, sometimes mixing them up in the same over. His bucket hands made him a good catcher and he once caught and bowled Keith Miller in both innings of a Test, so the Australian all-rounder nicknamed him 'C and B'. As a batsman <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> to the simple expedient of blocking the good balls and thumping the bad ones. With his height, weight and strength he could strike the ball as hard as anyone and once hit a six into the Lord's Pavilion. His first-class centuries were noted for their plentiful boundaries and this was another reason why his was popular with the crowds.|$|E
25|$|Finally after Australia {{ended their}} innings on 323, the Indian openers Chopra and Virender Sehwag faced the uphill task of facing 35 overs of {{high-quality}} swing and seam bowling, which was {{aided by a}} track which had enough grass on it {{to suggest that it}} would assist seam movement. Further, the overcast and gloomy skies did not bode too well for the Indian openers. Taking advantage of these conditions and the fact that Chopra was playing in only his third test, Jason Gillespie produced an incisive spell of bowling. His very first ball indicated {{that there would be a}} touch of outswing for him. <b>He</b> <b>stuck</b> the right length time and again, and he beat Chopra's edge frequently, making him play and miss. However, if he was beaten, Chopra did not betray any sign of that fact and played out the two frontline bowlers with assurance. Sehwag was beaten time and again by Nathan bracken, who, despite playing only his first test, generated a lot of bounce with his natural high-arm action and dominated Sehwag throughout. Sehwag, though treated his sluggish start without the slightest care and played on with nonchalance. Both of the openers made five each and India had reached 11/0 from 6.1 overs when play was concluded at that stage.|$|E

25|$|During the 2008 off-season, Wellwood broke a bone in {{his right}} foot while playing indoor soccer. With his {{contract}} set to expire, the Leafs placed him on waivers on June 24. He was claimed the following day by the Vancouver Canucks and was subsequently signed to a one-year, $998,000 contract. Reporting to training camp, he failed his initial fitness test and, although he passed a later evaluation, he was a healthy scratch to begin the season. On October 17, after having played just one game for the Canucks, he was placed on waivers by the team; after clearing, {{he was assigned to}} the Manitoba Moose of the AHL. Because the addition of Wellwood would have put the Moose over the limit for veteran players, Wellwood began assessing playing options in Europe; however, two days after clearing waivers, injuries to the Canucks prompted them to recall Wellwood to the NHL; he cleared re-entry waivers 24 hours later. Wellwood took advantage of this opportunity by scoring a goal and an assist in a 4–2 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets, and <b>he</b> <b>stuck</b> with the club. Later in the season, on February 17, 2009, Wellwood ended a streak of 159 games without a penalty by taking a high-sticking penalty against the Calgary Flames. It was his first penalty since April 11, 2006. Wellwood ended his first regular season in Vancouver with 18 goals and nine assists. Having never reached the Stanley Cup playoffs with Toronto, Wellwood made his NHL playoff debut with the Canucks in 2009 and scored his first NHL playoff goal in Game 4 of the first round against the St. Louis Blues, helping Vancouver complete a four-game sweep after a 3–2 overtime win.|$|E

500|$|Hecht-Hill-Lancaster allowed Mackendrick to {{familiarize}} himself with New York City before shooting the movie. In Notes on Sweet Smell of Success, Mackendrick said, [...] "One of the characteristic aspects of New York, particularly {{of the area}} between 42nd Street and 57th Street, is the neurotic energy of the crowded sidewalks.

[...] "If it were [...] a suicide, why did he do a head shot instead of a chest shot?" [...] asked Bessie DuBois.
