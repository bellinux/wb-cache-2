25|$|Before the New 52, the Trident, {{granted by}} Poseidon to the {{rightful}} ruler and {{protector of the}} seas, was indestructible and a very powerful melee weapon, able to destroy the very powerful Imperiex Probes for instance, which Aquaman wielded with unmatched skill. Apart from its power as a melee weapon, the Trident also {{had the power to}} manipulate water, fire bolts of powerful energy and act as a focus to amplify the magical power of others, most notably Tempest. In the New 52, the Trident is now part of a collection of seven very powerful Atlantean magical items, forged by the first king of Atlantis who calls himself 'The Dead King'. Thought to be the most powerful weapon of the set, {{with the possible exception of}} the recently discovered seventh item, the Trident is completely indestructible and able to hurt even the most powerful of opponents, such as the evil god Darkseid, with Aquaman being the only leaguer to puncture and make him bleed out. He was also able to break the mystical barrier of Dr. Graves which was deemed indestructible at the time. In one instance, the Trident was shown <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> magical power when Black Manta used the rest of the items to discover the hidden seventh one. For a time, Aquaman withheld the Trident of said aforementioned god of the oceans in his battles against the Thule and Rao's disciples, which gave him the power to summon tsunamis and deluges, call down thunder and lighting, project and control ice, move the earth making it rise and tremble at his command, as well as teleport himself from global to interplanetary distances using water as a medium. It could also transform into a gladius and back at will. Arthur also uses both versions of the trident to boost the range his telepathy.|$|E

Some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls. When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps {{the ball in}} its mouth or carries it on its tail. Jewels are a common symbol of Inari, and representations of sacred Inari foxes without them are rare.|$|E

Within half an hour, the lead roof was melting, and the books and papers in the crypt caught with a roar. [...] "The stones of Paul's flew like grenados," [...] reported Evelyn in his diary, [...] "the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them." [...] The cathedral was quickly a ruin.|$|E

500|$|After the war, Turner {{was cast}} in a lead part in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946) {{opposite}} John Garfield, a film noir based on James M. Cain's debut novel of the same name. Turner reportedly did not get along with Garfield on the set; according to one documentary, when she found he was her male lead, she responded: [...] "Couldn't they at least hire someone attractive?" [...] The now-classic film noir marked {{a turning point in}} Turner's career as her first femme fatale role. Reviews of the film, and in particular, Turner's performance, were <b>glowing,</b> <b>with</b> a critic of The New York Times writing it was [...] "the role of her career."

500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious and widely {{condemned}} scenes in Gone with the Wind depicts what is now legally defined as [...] "marital rape". The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett {{at the bottom of the}} staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no' by the struggling and frightened Scarlett; Rhett overcomes her resistance and carries her up the stairs to the bedroom, where the audience is left in no doubt that she will [...] "get what's coming to her". The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> barely suppressed sexual satisfaction; Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking. The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other, and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} of The Judy Garland Show aired on September 29, 1963. The show, {{featuring}} guest star Donald O'Connor, was the seventh one taped. Episodes {{would continue to}} be shown out of sequence throughout the series' run. The show scored an 18.7 rating and reviews were largely positive. Variety wrote [...] "If Judy Garland ... is of a mind to work every week with the same dedication and zeal that characterized her premiere this week, Bill Paley and his associates should be in clover. ... Miss Garland was in fine fettle." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle characterized the show as [...] "tasteful, elegant and exciting." [...] Not every review was as <b>glowing,</b> <b>with</b> the New York Herald Tribune noting [...] "Miss Garland is fine, just fine. The rest of the show, however, needs help." [...] Other negative reviews were in a similar vein, focusing on Van Dyke in particular and the show's format and writing in general.|$|E

500|$|Historically Bhutan {{is known}} by {{numerous}} names, but the Bhutanese call the country Druk after {{the name of}} the Bhutanese thunder dragon. This tradition dates to 1189 when Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje, founder of the Drukpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, was in Phoankar (Tibet) where he reportedly witnessed the Namgyiphu valley <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> rainbow and light. Considering this an auspicious sign, he entered the valley to choose a site {{for the construction of a}} monastery, whereupon he heard three peals of thunder – a sound produced by the druk (dragon) according to popular Bhutanese belief. The monastery that Tsangpa Gyare built that year was named Druk Sewa Jangchubling, and his school of teaching became known as Druk. The Druk school later split into three lineages. One of these three, Drukpa, was founded by Tsangpa Gyare's nephew and spiritual heir Önrey Dharma Sengye and afterward spread throughout Bhutan. The nation itself would also later become known as Druk. This legend offers one explanation for how the symbolism of the dragon came to form the basis of the national flag of Bhutan. [...] An alternative hypothesis maintains that the notion of symbolizing sovereign and state in the form of a dragon emerged in neighboring China and was adopted by the rulers of Bhutan as a symbol of royalty in the early 20th century.|$|E
500|$|A fourth Broadway revival began previews on March 12 {{and opened}} on April 16, 2015 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater. The {{production}} {{was directed by}} Bartlett Sher and starred Kelli O'Hara as Anna and Ken Watanabe, as the King, in his American stage debut. It featured Ruthie Ann Miles as Lady Thiang, Paul Nakauchi as the Kralahome, Ashley Park as Tuptim, Conrad Ricamora as Lun Tha, Jake Lucas as Louis Leonowens, and Edward Baker-Duly as Sir Edward Ramsey. Choreography by Christopher Gattelli {{was based on the}} original Jerome Robbins dances. The designers included Michael Yeargan (sets), Catherine Zuber (costumes) and Donald Holder (lighting). Reviews were uniformly <b>glowing,</b> <b>with</b> Ben Brantley of The New York Times calling it a [...] "resplendent production", praising the cast (especially O'Hara), direction, choreographer, designs and orchestra, and commenting that Sher [...] "sheds a light [...] that isn't harsh or misty but clarifying [...] balances epic sweep with intimate sensibility." [...] The production was nominated for nine Tony Awards, winning four, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Leading Actress (for O'Hara), Best Featured Actress (for Miles) and best costume design (for Zuber), and won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival. Replacements for the King included Jose Llana Hoon Lee and Daniel Dae Kim. Replacements for Anna included Marin Mazzie. The revival closed on June 26, 2016 after 538 performances. A U.S. national tour of the production began in November 2016. The cast includes Laura Michelle Kelly as Anna, Llana as the King and Joan Almedilla as Lady Thiang.|$|E

O'Connor of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "With only the premiere to go on, The Cosby Show {{is by far}} the classiest and most {{entertaining}} new situation comedy of the season." [...] After the pilot aired, David Bianculli wrote in the Sunday Philadelphia Inquirer that [...] "This sitcom will lose to CBS's Magnum, P.I., but it's too funny, and Cosby is too good, for NBC to dump it." [...] In a separate article in the same edition, he spoke more glowingly describing it as [...] "the best TV sitcom since Cheers, and a good bet to become an instant classic. Cosby is delightful, and his series is both funny and intelligent." [...] He also described the family as [...] "amazingly real". According to Associated Press syndicated writer Jerry Buck, in the episode, [...] "Cosby handles his son {{in a manner that is}} not only funny but intelligent." [...] Mike Boone of The Gazette described Cosby and Ayers-Allen as [...] "credible parents" [...] and Cosby's fatherly advice as a [...] "delightful confrontation". Boone also noted that [...] "understanding the special world of children" [...] has always been a part of Cosby's comedy, and that this was present in the comical scene where Cliff and Theo discuss serious matters using play money. Star-Banner said [...] "The dialogue is typically Cosby [...] easy and funny [...] and you can just see yourself getting to like these people very much." [...] According to Associated Press writer Fred Rothenberg, the response to the opening episode was <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> the Los Angeles Times praising the show as [...] "the best comedy of the fall season by a long, long, lonnnnnnng shot."; The New York Times saying [...] "by far the classiest and most entertaining situation comedy."; and The Washington Post calling it [...] "the best, funniest, most humane new show of the season." [...] He also noted that marketing executives were not surprised at the reaction to the show.|$|E

2500|$|Weekes was {{affected}} by sinusitus throughout the tour, requiring five operations, and broke a finger in late June.

[...] Denis Compton said of Weekes following this innings; [...] "In every respect, it was the innings of a genius." [...] During the tour Weekes became only the fourth West Indian to pass 10,000 first-class runs. Weekes was the first West Indian to pass 3,000 Test runs, in 31 Test matches, and the first to score 4,000 Test runs, in 42 Tests.|$|E
2500|$|Braham's {{struggles with}} {{alcoholism}} are {{portrayed in the}} 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, and during the run of The Mikado she was threatened with dismissal for this reason. [...] During the summer of 1886, she secretly married J. Duncan Young, previously a principal tenor with the company, and Carte soon had another reason to dismiss the actress. [...] In early 1887, shortly into the run of Ruddigore, Braham finally informed Carte {{that she was pregnant}} with her second child, a daughter, born on 6 May. This was not acceptable, particularly as the chorus sings to her prim and proper character in Ruddigore, Rose Maybud, [...] "Rose, all <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> virgin blushes, say – Is anybody going to marry you today?" [...] She shortly left the Savoy, and Geraldine Ulmar was hastily called back from America to assume the role.

The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as [...] "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other.

2500|$|Although the {{character}} of Tarzan does not directly engage in violence against women, feminist scholars have critiqued {{the presence of other}} sympathetic male characters who do with Tarzan's approval. In Tarzan and the Ant Men, the men of a fictional tribe of creatures called the Alali gain social dominance of their society by beating Alali women into submission with weapons that Tarzan willingly provides them. Following the battle, Burroughs states: [...] "To entertain Tarzan and to show him what great strides civilization had taken—the son of The First Woman seized a female by the hair and dragging her to him struck her heavily about the head and face with his clenched fist, and the woman fell upon her knees and fondled his legs, looking wistfully into his face, her own <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> love and admiration. (178)" [...] While Burroughs depicts some female characters with humanistic equalizing elements, Torgovnick argues that violent scenes against women in the context of male political and social domination are condoned in his writing, reinforcing a notion of gendered hierarchy where patriarchy is portrayed as the natural pinnacle of society.|$|E

Manifest Destiny portrays the Brooklyn waterfront amidst tropical vegetation and absent any humans, in the year 5004, after climate change has caused catastrophic sea level rise. [...] Rockman sketched out initial ideas for the mural in January 2000, and Brooklyn Museum director Arnold L. Lehman officially commissioned the mural in 2002. [...] Rockman began work on the mural in March 2003, consulting with experts in various fields, including Peter Ward and scientists at Columbia University's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, as well as architects Diane Lewis and Chris Morris. [...] Rockman shows the outcome 3000 years in the future, depicting tropical plants, mutated fish and sea creatures <b>glowing</b> <b>with</b> radioactivity amidst the ruins of buildings, the Brooklyn Bridge, the wrecks of a Dutch sailing ship and a 20th-century submarine.
