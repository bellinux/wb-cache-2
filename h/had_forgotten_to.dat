5|$|Some of Josquin's compositions, {{such as the}} {{instrumental}} Vive le roy, have been tentatively dated to the period around 1500 {{when he was in}} France. A motet, Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo ("Remember thy promise unto thy servant"), was, according to Heinrich Glarean writing in the Dodecachordon of 1547, composed as a gentle reminder to the king to keep his promise of a benefice to Josquin, which he <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> keep. According to Glarean's story, it worked: the court applauded, and the king gave Josquin his benefice. Upon receiving it, Josquin reportedly wrote a motet on the text Benefecisti servo tuo, Domine ("Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant") to show his gratitude to the king.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his determination, and envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

She refused because it belonged to the production company.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Bittaker {{was arrested}} for assault with attempt to commit murder. This charge arose from an {{incident}} in which he stabbed a young supermarket clerk named Gary Louie following a confrontation in a supermarket parking lot: Louie had observed Bittaker steal a steak from the supermarket in which he (Louie) worked. Upon observing Bittaker's actions, Louie had followed Bittaker into the car park and calmly asked him whether he <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> pay for anything. In response to this question, Bittaker stabbed Louie once in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. Bittaker attempted to flee {{the scene of the}} stabbing, but was restrained by two of Louie's fellow employees.|$|E
25|$|On 14 September 2011, {{a report}} in the {{newspaper}} Moskovsky Komsomolets, quoting a source in the aviation industry, claimed that the parking brake of the aircraft was on during the take-off, which significantly slowed it down and prevented it from accelerating properly. According to this theory, the captain had turned over control to the co-pilot before take-off, as he was not feeling well. As it is the captain's duty to release the brake, the co-pilot may not have been aware that it had not been done, or <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> do so. Another newspaper, Lifenews.ru, reported that investigators were investigating the pilots' professional history, and that the pilots did not have sufficient experience on the Yak-42.|$|E

Soon after, Wheatley found {{a message from}} the cruise line Sitmar and {{returned}} the call, only to be roundly abused by Sitmar's furious entertainment manager; he then discovered that Sitmar had offered the band work on a London-bound cruise liner, which had left the previous week, while the band had been in Brisbane. Unable to locate them, the liner had been delayed for an entire day while Sitmar found a group to replace them. The band confronted Sambell, who denied any knowledge, but a further check with Sitmar confirmed that the deal had been arranged, but that Sambell had been caught up with Farnham's affairs and <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> tell them about it.|$|E

However, Professor Lupin <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> take the Wolfsbane Potion that night and so, when touched by moonlight, transforms into a werewolf with no control over his actions. Sirius, in dog form, drives Lupin safely away from the others into the Forbidden Forest, where he wakes the next morning restored to his human body and mind. Snape, however, furious over Sirius's eventual escape and his resultant loss of the Order of Merlin promised to him by Cornelius Fudge, publicly reveals the nature of Professor Lupin's lycanthropy. Anticipating a public outcry {{in response to the}} threat he himself agrees he poses to the students, Professor Lupin resigns from his post.|$|E
25|$|The club's colors {{at first}} were not cream. They {{started out with}} a white kit which had the badge on the chest. During one of their early seasons, Universitario could not {{participate}} in an upcoming match because their uniforms had been sent to the laundry to be washed. The managers pleaded that they hurry with the laundry and they quickly washed them. However, when the club received the jerseys, they found that they were no longer white, but yellow. The laundry workers <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> remove the badges from the jerseys and consequently the red color from the badges mixed with the white jerseys giving it a yellow tint. The club {{had no choice but to}} use the jersey to play. They managed to win that game and a few others as well and thus the club kept the new-colored kit as a good-luck charm.|$|E

25|$|Merckx {{returned}} to the Giro in 1972 and resumed his domination. He grabbed the lead after a long solo attack during the race's seventh stage and never {{let go of the}} lead. Merckx led the 1973 Giro d'Italia from start to finish; a feat that had not been done since Alfredo Binda did in 1927. José Manuel Fuente gained the lead early on in 1974 and held it {{all the way up to}} the Giro's fourteenth stage. Fuente <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> eat properly during the fourteenth stage and suffered because of it; he lost over ten minutes to Merckx. Merckx would go on to win his fifth and final Giro d'Italia by just 12 seconds, joining the likes of Alfredo Binda and Fausto Coppi as the only five-time winners of the Giro d'Italia. Merckx success continued on into the season as he won the Tour de France and the men's road race at the World Championships and became the first rider to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling– which consists of winning two Grand Tours and the men's road race at the World Championships in one calendar year.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other recent {{narratives}} extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who {{was working in the}} Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest's devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba she meant, he thought it was the Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed there for a few days. In the process, he still did not get the feeling of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba she meant was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest was very pleased, and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed {{at the feet of the}} goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother's vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.|$|E

500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>to</b> remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} take them off.
