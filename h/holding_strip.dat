50|$|The {{image is}} set in a {{twilight}} atmosphere with deep blue sky. There are two female figures in the foreground, one with drawers opening from her side like a chest. They both have undefined phallic shapes (perhaps melted clocks, as a recurring image from Dalí's previous works) protruding from their backs which are supported by crutch-like objects. The hands, forearms and face of the nearest figure are stripped down to the muscular tissue beneath the skin. One figure is <b>holding</b> a <b>strip</b> of meat. Both humanures that double as a chest of drawers as well as the crutch like shapes are common archetypes in Dalí’s work.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{typically}} strums the chords {{with the}} left hand. The right hand plays the melody strings by depressing spring steel <b>strips</b> that <b>hold</b> small lead hammers over the strings. A brief stab on a metal strip bounces the hammer off a string pair to produce a single note. <b>Holding</b> the <b>strip</b> down makes the hammer bounce on the double strings, which produces a mandolin-like tremolo. The bounce rate is somewhat fixed, as {{it is based on}} the spring steel strip length, hammer weight, and string tension—but a player can increase the rate slightly by pressing higher on the strip, effectively moving its pivot point closer to the lead hammer.|$|R

These electrodes are placed on the nerve and secured by suturing to the epineurium. The suturing process requires delicate surgery and can be torn from the nerve if excessive motion creates tension. Since the electrode is sutured to the epineurium {{it is unlikely to}} damage the nerve trunk.|$|R
50|$|Placed on {{and around}} the head and face, the beauty {{micrometer}} uses flexible metal strips which align with a person's facial features. The screws <b>holding</b> the <b>strips</b> in place allow for 325 adjustments, enabling the operator to make fine measurements with a precision of one thousandth of an inch. The inventors stated {{that there are two}} key measurements that they looked for: the heights of the nose and forehead should be the same, and the eyes should be separated by the width of one eye. When an imperfection is identified, corrective make-up can be applied to enhance or subdue the feature. The company Max Factor claims that the device helped Max Factor, Sr. to better understand the female face.|$|R
25|$|The plan, code-named Operation 'Wild Rose', is {{a plot to}} use black mercenaries in a {{terrorist}} attack on the United States to discredit the AAR and win sympathy for the white minority government in South Africa. De Vaal recruits Captain Patrick McKenzie Fawkes, late of the Royal Navyand who believes his family was slaughtered by the AARto lead the attack.

Raising the draft enables Fawkes to sail the ship up the Potomac River and proceed with the plan for an attack by shelling Washington D.C.|$|R
5000|$|Carbon ribbons are on {{rolls and}} are fitted onto a spindle or reel holder within the printer. The used ribbon is rewound by a take-up spindle forming {{a roll of}} ‘used’ ribbon. It is termed a ‘one-trip’ ribbon because once it has been rewound the used roll is {{discarded}} and replaced with a new one. If one were to <b>hold</b> a <b>strip</b> of used carbon ribbon {{up to the light}} one would see an exact negative of the images that have been printed. The main benefit of using a one-trip thermal transfer ribbon is that providing the correct settings are applied prior to printing, an 100% density of printed image is guaranteed; compare this with a pre-inked ribbon on a dot matrix impact printer ribbon which gradually fades with usage.|$|R
50|$|The {{rotating}} drum, or Dynafax, camera {{works by}} <b>holding</b> a <b>strip</b> of film in a loop {{on the inside}} track of a rotating drum. This drum is then spun up to the speed corresponding to a desired framing rate. The image is still relayed to an internal rotating mirror centered at the arc of the drum. The mirror is multi-faceted, typically having six to eight faces. Only one secondary lens is required, as the exposure always occurs at the same point. The series of frames is formed as the film travels across this point. Discrete frames are formed as each successive face of the mirror passes through the optical axis. Rotating drum cameras are capable of speed from {{the tens of thousands}} to hundreds of thousands of frames per second.|$|R

5000|$|Rarely seen was the IBM 2321 Data Cell, a {{mechanically}} complex {{device that}} contained multiple magnetic <b>strips</b> to <b>hold</b> data; <b>strips</b> could be randomly accessed, placed upon a cylinder-shaped drum for read/write operations; {{then returned to}} an internal storage cartridge. The IBM Data Cell picker was among several IBM trademarked [...] "speedy" [...] mass online direct-access storage peripherals (reincarnated {{in recent years as}} [...] "virtual tape" [...] and automated tape librarian peripherals). The 2321 file had a capacity of 400 MB, at the time when the 2311 disk drive only had 7.2 MB. The IBM Data Cell was proposed to fill cost/capacity/speed gap between magnetic tapes—which had high capacity with relatively low cost per stored byte—and disks, which had higher expense per byte. Some installations also found the electromechanical operation less dependable and opted for less mechanical forms of direct-access storage.|$|R
50|$|A Johansson Mikrokator (also called Abramson's movement) is a {{mechanical}} comparator {{used to obtain}} mechanical magnification {{of the difference in}} length as compared to a standard. It works on the principle of a button spinning on a loop of string. A twisted thin metal <b>strip</b> <b>holds</b> a pointer, which shows the reading on a suitable scale. Since there is no friction involved in the transfer of movement from the strip to the pointer, it is free from backlash. It was reportedly designed by Hugo Abramson in 1938.|$|R
50|$|The bulk of Cutler Park {{falls within}} the borders of Needham, Massachusetts. The {{southern}} end is part of Dedham; and the park also <b>holds</b> the <b>strip</b> of land on the Newton/Boston side of the Charles River running from Nahanton Street, Newton, south to the City of Boston's Millennium Park (part of West Roxbury). Much of the park's area is marsh or wetland, while forest makes up the rest and bears most of the trails. In two sections the Blue Heron Trail bears foot or bicycle traffic through the marsh on wooden boardwalks. At the park's north end, a trail goes around Kendrick Pond (also called Cutler Pond). A railroad line, used primarily by the MBTA Commuter Rail, runs roughly east-west on a raised right-of-way through the southern half of the park. A trail runs adjacent to the right-of-way the entire width of the park, and a tunnel under the railroad provides access across it.|$|R
50|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern times Collingham {{operated}} an openfield system and enclosure {{did not take}} place until the turn of the 18th/19th centuries, changing much local farming from a small <b>holding</b> of <b>strips</b> and the right to extensive grazing, to individual small cottage holdings or a precarious existence as a landless agricultural labourer. The wide square fields and relatively few isolated farms are the result. One field was set aside in the enclosure award of 1790 for lease every year with the revenues being put {{to the use of the}} poor of the parish. Around the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century there was an influx of agricultural labour, displaced from the enclosures of the upland Lincolnshire villages in places like Boothby Graffoe, Coleby and Harmston, taking the place of former Collingham people who had moved to towns such as Lincoln, Newark and Nottingham in search of better employment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of continuing a zombie comic strip is commonly criticized by cartoonists, particularly younger {{ones in the}} new generation, including Bill Watterson and Stephan Pastis. Pastis addressed the issue in his strip, Pearls Before Swine, in 2005. Mark Tatulli also commented on zombie strips in his strip Liō in 2010. and in 2013. After an incident in which United Feature Syndicate secretly retained the services of superhero comic artist Al Plastino to continue the comic strip Peanuts {{in case of an}} interruption, [...] Charles Schulz, author and creator of Peanuts, requested that his strip (which, in contrast to most comic strips today, he drew completely on his own with no assistants of any kind) not be continued by another cartoonist after his death; Schulz's family (as well as Universal Uclick, which currently <b>holds</b> the <b>strip's</b> publication rights) has honored his wishes. Peanuts instead is seen in reruns under the banner Classic Peanuts.|$|R

Further, the <b>strips</b> <b>hold</b> centrally placed straight through crack shaped voids, and are subjected to tensile displacement controlled mode I loading. The tensile stresses and displacements are studied. It is found that if a copper strip is 2. 16906. nm in a direction orthogonal to the loading direction, the strip does not experience plane strain conditions. However, if this dimension is ≥ 3. 6151. nm, the strip shows states of both plane stress and plane strain...|$|R
25|$|At No Way Out, The Undertaker {{defeated}} Batista, Finlay, The Great Khali, Montel Vontavious Porter, and Big Daddy V in an Elimination Chamber {{match to}} become the number one contender for Edge's World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXIV, where he defeated Edge with the Hell's Gate submission hold, to win his second World Heavyweight Championship in his 16th WrestleMania win. In a WrestleMania rematch, The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Vickie Guerrero banned the Undertaker's Hell's Gate submission <b>hold</b> and <b>stripped</b> him of the title. The Undertaker battled Edge for the vacant title at Judgment Day, which he won by countout. Guerrero ordered that the title remain vacant, because titles cannot change hands in this way.

There were no troop facilities on board, and the men slept in one of the <b>holds</b> on <b>strips</b> of plywood laid on the floor. Strict smoking orders were enforced since there were thousands of tons of live ammunition, torpedoes, and bombs on board. After a seven-day strenuous trip, Port Moresby, New Guinea was reached on 28 December 1942. The meeting of the air and ground echelons was a never-to-be-forgotten moment.

2500|$|Sittellas forage on {{horizontal}} {{branches and}} {{the trunks of}} trees. Their foraging techniques {{has been described as}} hopping rapidly along the length of a horizontal branch, pausing briefly to peer for prey, occasionally hanging underneath the branch but usually on top of it. Most of the time is spent on branches rather than on the trunks. Birds on the trunks may travel upwards or downwards. Within the forest sittellas usually forage in the canopy. There are sexual differences in foraging, with males and females choosing to forage in slightly different microhabitats within the tree. Prey items are usually gleaned directly from the bark, although in a few instances sittellas will sally from the branch in order to snatch aerial prey. Having obtained prey sittellas will use their feet to hold it while they eat it, in a similar manner to parrots, and will also use their feet in order to <b>hold</b> back <b>strips</b> of bark in order to pry underneath it. [...] There have even been isolated reports of tool use in some populations of sittellas. Sticks were used to pry boring beetle larvae out of cavities, in a similar fashion to that of tool using woodpecker finches of the Galapagos.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies Dawid’s prequential {{framework}} {{from the}} point of view of the algorithmic theory of randomness. The main result is that two natural notions of randomness coincide. One notion is the prequential version of the standard definition due to Martin-Löf, and the other is the prequential version of the martingale definition of randomness due to Schnorr. This is another manifestation of the close relation between the two main paradigms of randomness, typicalness and unpredictability. The algorithmic theory of randomness can be stripped of the algorithms and still give meaningful results; the typicalness paradigm then corresponds to Kolmogorov’s measure-theoretic probability and the unpredictability paradigm corresponds to game-theoretic probability. It is an open problem whether the main result of this paper continues to <b>hold</b> in the <b>stripped</b> version of the theory...|$|R

40|$|A small field site {{adjacent}} to a lake in Amana, Iowa was used to investigate the fate of nitrate fertilizer in the unsaturated zone. The fertilizer was applied to a barren plot, a plot planted with corn, and a plot planted with deep-rooted poplar trees (Populus spp.) to study the characteristic behavior of a typical agricultural environment and a novel pollutant-interception technique in comparison to unmanaged land. Nitrate concentrations were lower in the corn and especially the poplar plot due to plant uptake, but concentrations increased markedly in September after the plants began to shut down and nitrification occurred. The poplar trees were most effective in long-term nitrate reduction; they provide perennial interception. Statistical analysis confirmed plant uptake was an important process in the fate of nitrate, and hence, vegetative buffer <b>strips</b> <b>hold</b> promise for protecting water supplies...|$|R
