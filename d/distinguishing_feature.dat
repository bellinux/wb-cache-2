5|$|Cormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, {{usually with}} mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin on the face. The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked.

5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as both have prickly foliage and domed flowerheads. However, the former grows on deep sand {{while the latter}} grows on grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of B. ilicifolia compared with the loose ones of B. sessilis are another <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{families}} of moths have special organs to help detect bat echolocation. These organs {{are known as}} tympana (singular – typanum). The Pyraloidea and almost all Geometroidea have tympana located on the anterior sternite of the abdomen. The Noctuoidea also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located {{on the underside of}} the metathorax, the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> of the superfamily.|$|E
5|$|Szent István {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed. A further <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> was the modified ventilator trunk {{in front of the}} mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E

5|$|The Fire Station Number 4 is architecturally {{significant}} {{as an example}} of a late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse. The firehouse's <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> is the corbeled cornice and terracotta trim, but also it is historically {{significant as}} an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E
5|$|In {{identifying}} the remains {{as those of}} Palaeoscincus, Broom initially classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature,</b> and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E
5|$|One major <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> {{between all}} loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, {{typically}} with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between branches with little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E

5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high quality of its meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|E
5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong enough to withstand the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E

5|$|The <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> of Zobel network filters is {{that they}} have a {{constant}} resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E
5|$|The <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> of the rodents {{is their}} pairs of {{continuously}} growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front}} and little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
5|$|The walrus is a mammal in {{the order}} Carnivora. It is the sole {{surviving}} {{member of the family}} Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the suborder Pinnipedia along with true seals (Phocidae) and eared seals (Otariidae). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are monophyletic, i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or diphyletic, recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a caniform ancestor most closely related to modern bears. Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20–26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15–20 million years ago. Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the subfamilies Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae. The key <b>distinguishing</b> <b>feature</b> was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining (relict) species.|$|E
