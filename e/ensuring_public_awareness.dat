40|$|The 2015 MDG {{deadline}} draws nigh and {{the need}} to assess the progress that has been made towards their achievement has never been greater. So great is the need, it calls for robust strategies to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs. On the other end, the Zimbabwean populace still suffers extreme poverty. Unemployment is on the upsurge and the gap between {{the rich and the poor}} is widening. The consequences of the catastrophe are even more severe in the rural populace. Although there are trivial developments in gender equality and the reduction of HIV/AIDS, this has not translated to the betterment of the countryâ€™s position towards the meeting of the 2015 MDG deadline. Local Authorities on the other hand are failing to deliver services efficiently and effectively. Rural Local Authorities are not spared from the challenges of delivering services to the attainment of the MDGs. It is in this light perhaps that this study sought to measure the extent to which Local Authorities will manage to meet the 2015 MDG deadline. The research begins with a synopsis of why the research was carried out. This includes the background of the study, statement of the problem, research objectives, research questions, delimitation and limitations of the study. The research identifies the problem as failure by Local Authorities to deliver services that are essential to the achievement of the MDGs yet there is very little time left for their achievement. The research goes further to review available literature on the subject of MDG and local governance, first highlighting the nexus between local governance and the achievement of the MDG. The historical development of the MDGs is given after which an outline of all the MDGs will be given. The research also highlights the role of Local Authorities in the achievement of the MDGs, strategies employed and the challenges faced in their achievement. Quantitative and qualitative technics were used and the researcher targeted Bulilima RDC employees and residents as the research population. The research sample was selected using random sampling. Findings of the research revealed that there is progress towards the achievement of MDGs 3 and 6 though this cannot entail the meeting of the deadline. The research results revealed that B RDC is quite off track in terms of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. The research also revealed that residents lack knowledge on the subject of the MDGs. Finally the research gives recommendations to rural local authorities for the achievement of the MDGs which are <b>ensuring</b> <b>public</b> <b>awareness,</b> integrated results based MDG programme, established of Public-Private Partnership and exchange visit programs among other recommendations...|$|E

40|$|This article {{sets forth}} {{a new model}} of “notice” and {{deterrence}} that helps explain some long-standing contradictions in the literature on deterrence. Nearly all the work in the area of criminal law and deterrence has included an assumption that would-be offenders know the laws and the threatened sanctions, and therefore adjust their behavior in light of these disincentives. The fact that most people seem to be ignorant of the exact boundaries of the rules, and ignorant of the sanctions, presents an enormous conceptual problem for the classic model of deterrence. This new model presents an alternative mechanism for deterrence based on the distinction between risk and uncertainty that is frequently discussed in economic literature: in a nutshell, people “play it safe” or steer clear of violating the law more when there is some uncertainty about the parameters of the law and the sanctions. Economic understandings of aversion to uncertainty help explain why deterrence works as well as it does in an environment where comprehensive legal knowledge is generally impossible. In addition, this article demonstrates that public ignorance of the law or uncertainty is an unavoidable function of the verbal formulations used in modern statutes. The “notice requirement” does not <b>ensure</b> <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> of the law (which the courts have never required in any actual sense), but rather sets limits on the range of prohibitions and sanctions confronting the citizenry, striking an optimal balance between under-deterrence and over-deterrence...|$|R
40|$|Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE Transmission of the Influenza A {{virus has}} been widely studied by scientists, as {{influenza}} states itself a disease capable of easily causing worldwide pandemic. Influenza pandemics are mediated by its virus, which holds the ability to undergo mutation in a vast speed. As a threatening nosocomial infection especially among patients with {{a high risk of}} contamination, influenza must be given serious attention. The objective {{of this article is to}} comprehend the effectiveness of aerosol particles in influenza transmission, as well as the role of health care centers in facilitating the spreading of this disease. Reviews in this article show that experimental animals demonstrate how aerosol particles do play a role in the transmission of the disease. In its relation with health care facilities, reviews show that different hospitals or clinics represent various numbers of aerosol particles necessary for causing clinical symptoms and signs of influenza in a group of patients. On the other hand, basic precaution instruments significantly reduce influenza transmission. In addition, this study also reviews a number of possible actions to prevent further transmission. Commitment and teamwork of involved stakeholders are necessary to <b>ensure</b> <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> and initiate health promotions to eliminate any possibility of further pandemics. /* Style Definitions */ table.

40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{increasing}} production of industrial toxic substances (TIC; Toxic Industrial Compound), the risk of accidental release of hazardous substances is growing in spite of the gradual implementation of safer technological processes and safety improvement measures. To mitigate the consequences of chemical accidents or to prepare preventive protective measures before the accident, it is necessary to know or at least estimate the course of accidents. In particular, it applies to the range of traumatic events and fatal accidents. One of the tools that can express the impact of accidents is modelling programs. This diploma thesis presents a comparison of outputs from two special types of software ? a foreign program the ALOHA and the TerEx developed in the Czech Republic. The purpose of the thesis was to indicate theoretical aspects related to gaseous toxic substances diffusion in the ground atmospheric layer and to describe modelling of their ill effects range. To achieve this objective, scientific literature and consultation with experts were used. The practical section of the thesis aimed at determining to what extent the results of both programs differ when initial conditions were identical. To achieve this goal, the intercomparison of outputs (e. g. hurtful concentration range) of the two programs that provided results for the same input data sets (type and quantity of hazardous substances, environmental temperature, wind speed, degree of cloud cover, weather stability class, type of ground surface) was used. After the assessment of the comparison it is possible to generalize the results stating that the software ALOHA compared to the TerEx is more conservative, which means that the ALOHA software provides longer anticipated ranges of danger. Therefore, it depends on the user (the person responsible ? crisis manager, intervention commander, mayor of the village), which approach they select or recommend ? to prepare a greater or a smaller area for a possible accident (to <b>ensure</b> <b>public</b> <b>awareness,</b> to implement technical measures to mitigate the impact of that accident, to assess the amount of financial resources, etc.). As a subsequent step it would be appropriate to verify the theoretical results experimentally, by field testing, which would be conducted under the same meteorological conditions under which the modelling was made by the mentioned programs. This would thus confirm the legitimacy of the special software use for the purpose of estimating the range of negative effects of chemical accidents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Excessive and {{inappropriate}} {{use of antibiotics}} {{is considered to be}} the most important reason for development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. As antibiotic resistance may spread across borders, high prevalence countries may serve as a source of bacterial resistance for countries with a low prevalence. Therefore, bacterial resistance is an important issue with a potential serious impact on all countries. The majority of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are treated in general practice. Most infections are caused by virus and antibiotics are therefore unlikely to have any clinical benefit. Several intervention initiatives have been taken to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary health care, but the effectiveness of these interventions is only modest. Only few studies have been designed to determine the effectiveness of multifaceted strategies in countries with different practice setting. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted intervention targeting general practitioners (GPs) and patients in six countries with different prevalence of antibiotic resistance: Two Nordic countries (Denmark and Sweden), two Baltic Countries (Lithuania and Kaliningrad-Russia) and two Hispano-American countries (Spain and Argentina). Methods/Design HAPPY AUDIT was initiated in 2008 and the project is still ongoing. The project includes 15 partners from 9 countries. GPs participating in HAPPY AUDIT will be audited by the Audit Project Odense (APO) method. The APO method will be used at a multinational level involving GPs from six countries with different cultural background and different organisation of primary health care. Research on the effect of the intervention will be performed by analysing audit registrations carried out before and after the intervention. The intervention includes training courses on management of RTIs, dissemination of clinical guidelines with recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, posters for the waiting room, brochures to patients and implementation of point of care tests (Strep A and CRP) to be used in the GPs'surgeries. To <b>ensure</b> <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> of the risk of resistant bacteria, media campaigns targeting both professionals and the public will be developed and the results will be published and widely disseminated at a Working Conference hosted by the World Association of Family Doctors (WONCA-Europe) at the end of the project period. Discussion HAPPY AUDIT is an EU-financed project with the aim of contributing to the battle against antibiotic resistance through quality improvement of GPs' diagnosis and treatment of RTIs through development of intervention programmes targeting GPs, parents of young children and healthy adults. It is hypothesized that the use of multifaceted strategies combining active intervention by GPs will be effective in reducing prescribing of unnecessary antibiotics for RTIs and improving the use of appropriate antibiotics in suspected bacterial infections. </p...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Johannesburg generates {{in excess}} of 1 500 000 tonnes of general waste {{annually}} and has on average 10 years’ lifespan remaining on its four landfill sites. As a signatory to the Polokwane Declaration, the City of Johannesburg has recognised {{the need for new}} interventions to divert waste from landfills by various methods, such as separation at source; alternative treatment methods and the conversion of waste to energy. Progress has, however, been slow and this research aims to investigate alternative waste management techniques that can be applied in the City of Johannesburg to fast track the realisation of these targets. Using scenario planning techniques, the research considers implications for policy and management decisions in realising the best possible future in the area of waste management in Johannesburg. The scenario process was used to develop the following scenarios for waste management in Johannesburg: Long walk to freedom. Waste collection coverage includes pockets of the community where waste collections services are less than optimal. The residents of the city, particularly in these underserviced areas, are also not very knowledgeable of the impact that the waste generated within their communities can have on the environment and what alternatives there are to manage this. Pick it up. The City provides full services to a society that functions in relative oblivion of the implications of their behaviour on the environment. It is assumed to be the role of government to “pick up” after communities and dispose of waste. This scenario is oblivious of the waste hierarchy and the role communities could play in minimising waste. Wishing on a star. The city continues to have under-serviced areas, <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> is high and this fuels correct behaviour and a mind-set shift with regard to waste management. Working together we can do more. The City optimises its service provision to cover all areas while also <b>ensuring</b> maximum <b>public</b> <b>awareness</b> and behaviour change with regard to waste management...|$|R
