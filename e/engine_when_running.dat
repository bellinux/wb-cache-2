50|$|Retarding {{ignition}} timing reduces four-stroking, as it allows {{more time for}} scavenging to take effect. Two-stroke <b>engines,</b> <b>when</b> <b>running</b> at low power, are less sensitive to {{ignition timing}} changes than four-stroke engine. If the timing is retarded for low throttle positions, from perhaps 35° BTDC at normal speeds to TDC or even 10° after TDC at slow idle, the engine runs well without four-stroking. Opening up the throttle and simultaneously advancing the timing, allows a rapid pickup in speed. This system is widely used for outboard motors, particularly when used to pull water skiers.|$|R
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the fuel mixture {{is set at}} full rich on an {{aircraft}} <b>engine</b> <b>when</b> <b>running</b> it at high power settings (such as during takeoff). The extra fuel does not burn; its only purpose is to evaporate to absorb heat. This uses fuel faster and also decreases {{the efficiency of the}} combustion process. By using water injection, the cooling effect of the water lets the fuel mixture run leaner at its maximum power setting. Many military aircraft engines of the 1940s utilized a pressure carburetor, a type of fuel metering system similar to a throttle body injection system. In a water-injected engine, the pressure carburetor features a mechanical derichment valve that makes the system nearly automatic. When the pilot turns on the water injection pump, water pressure moves the derichment valve to restrict fuel flow to lean the mixture {{while at the same time}} mixing the water/methanol fluid into the system. When the system runs out of fluid the derichment valve shuts and cuts off the water injection system, while enriching the fuel mixture to provide a cooling quench to prevent sudden detonation.|$|E

40|$|While {{hardware}} {{technology has}} undergone major advancements {{over the past}} decade, transaction processing systems have remained largely unchanged. The number of cores on a chip grows exponentially, following Moore's Law, allowing for an everincreasing number of transactions to execute in parallel. As the number of concurrently-executing transactions increases, contended critical sections become scalability burdens. In typical transaction processing systems the centralized lock manager is often the first contended component and scalability bottleneck. In this paper, we identify the conventional thread-totransaction assignment policy as {{the primary cause of}} contention. Then, we design DORA, a system that decomposes each transaction to smaller actions and assigns actions to threads based on which data each action is about to access. DORA’s design allows each thread to mostly access thread-local data structures, minimizing interaction with the contention-prone centralized lock manager. Built on top of a conventional storage engine, DORA maintains all the ACID properties. Evaluation of a prototype implementation of DORA on a multicore system demonstrates that DORA attains up to 4. 8 x higher throughput than a state-of-the-art storage <b>engine</b> <b>when</b> <b>running</b> a variety of synthetic and real-world OLTP workloads.

50|$|The oiling system {{addresses}} {{the need to}} properly lubricate an <b>engine</b> <b>when</b> it’s <b>running.</b> Properly lubricating an engine not only reduces friction between moving parts but is also the main method by which heat is removed from pistons, bearings, and shafts. Failing to properly lubricate an engine will result in engine failure. The oil pump forces the motor oil through the passages in the engine to properly distribute oil to different engine components. In a common oiling system, oil is drawn out of the oil sump (oil pan, in US English) through a wire mesh strainer that removes {{some of the larger}} pieces of debris from the oil. The flow made by the oil pump allows the oil to be distributed around the engine. In this system, oil flows through an oil filter and sometimes an oil cooler, before going through the engine’s oil passages and being dispersed to lubricate pistons, rings, springs, valve stems, and more.|$|R
5000|$|Many water {{injection}} systems use {{a mixture of}} water and alcohol (often close to 50/50), with trace amounts of water-soluble oil. The water provides the primary cooling effect due to its great density and high heat absorption properties. The alcohol is combustible, and also serves as an antifreeze for the water. The main purpose of the oil is to prevent corrosion of {{water injection}} and fuel system components; it may also assist in <b>engine</b> lubrication <b>when</b> <b>running</b> in a high power state. Because the alcohol mixed into the injection solution is often methanol (CH3OH), the system is known as methanol-water injection, or MW50. In high performance automotive applications some tuners use 100% methanol {{as opposed to a}} water-methanol mixture and then referred to simply as [...] "methanol injection". Safety concerns and part longevity concerns keep this as a controversial option. In the United States, the system is also commonly referred to as anti-detonant injection, or ADI.|$|R

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engine power supplies offer high energy output, {{but they also}} typically idle, or continue to operate at a low power level sufficient to keep the <b>engine</b> <b>running,</b> <b>when</b> not actively in use, which continuously consumes fuel. Battery-based power sources are better at providing instantaneous and modulated power; stored chemical energy is conserved when load requirements cease.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} engine performance using a mixture of palm oil methyl ester blends with diesel oil as biodiesel in a diesel engine, and optimizes the engine performance using artificial neural network (ANN) modeling. To acquire data for training and testing of the proposed ANN, a four-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine was fuelled with different palm oil methyl ester blends as biodiesel, operated at different engine loads. The properties of biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil were measured based on ASTM standards. The experimental results revealed that blends of palm oil methyl ester with diesel fuel provided better engine performance. An ANN model was developed based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for the engine. Logistic activation was used for mapping between the input and output parameters. It was observed that the ANN model could predict the engine performance quite well with correlation coefficients (R) of 0. 996684, 0. 999, 0. 98964 and 0. 998923 for the incylinder pressure, heat release, thermal efficiency, and volume, respectively. The predicted MSE (mean square error) error was between the desired outputs, as the measured and simulated values were obtained as 0. 0001 by the model. Long-term effects on <b>engine</b> performance <b>when</b> <b>running</b> on biodiesel fuel can be further studied and improved...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{consumer}} and legislation requirements, big investments on key technology strategies {{have been made to}} ensure fuel consumption is reduced. Recent technologies for gasoline engines are lean combustion technologies (including direct injection and homogenous charged compression ignition), optimizing intake and exhaust valve timing with valve lift and also cylinder deactivation system (CDA) have been practised to improve the engine efficiency. In this study, the purpose is to investigate the <b>engine</b> behaviour <b>when</b> <b>running</b> at different cylinder deactivation (CDA) strategies. One-dimensional engine model software called GT-Power is used to predict the engine performances. There are total of five strategies that have been studied which include normal mode, spark plug off mode, cylinder deactivation mode, intake normal with exhaust off mode, and intake off with exhaust normal mode. Engine performance outputs of each strategy are predicted and compared at BMEP of 3 bars with engine speed of 2500 rpm. Also, the effect of CDA strategies on in-cylinder pressure and pumping loss are performed. The study shows that all of these cylinder deactivation strategies are significantly reduce the pumping loss (PMEP) and fuel consumption, furthermore increasing the thermal efficiency of the engine. The results suggest that the most beneficial strategy for activating CDA is for the case whereby both the intake and exhaust valves are kept closed. This strategy successfully reduced the BSFC.

The 2-litre, [...] diesel unit designed and built by Rover for its 4x4 had entered production in 1956 and was one of Britain's first modern high-speed automotive diesel engines. Experimental projects were undertaken to improve the engine's power delivery, running qualities, and fuel tolerances.

40|$|Motivation: Peptide mass {{fingerprinting}} (PMF) is {{a method}} for protein identification in which a protein is fragmented by a defined cleavage protocol (usually proteolysis with trypsin), and the masses of these products constitute a ‘fingerprint’ that can be searched against theoretical fingerprints of all known proteins. In {{the first stage of}} PMF, the raw mass spectrometric data are processed to generate a peptide mass list. In the second stage this protein fingerprint is used to search a database of known proteins for the best protein match. Although current software solutions can typically deliver a match in a relatively short time, a system that can find a match in real time could change the way in which PMF is deployed and presented. In a paper published earlier we presented a hardware design of a raw mass spectra processor that, when implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware, achieves almost 170 -fold speed gain relative to a conventional software implementation running on a dual processor server. In this article we present a complementary hardware realization of a parallel database search <b>engine</b> that, <b>when</b> <b>running</b> on a Xilinx Virtex 2 FPGA at 100 MHz, delivers 1800 -fold speed-up compared with an equivalent C software routine, running on a 3. 06 GHz Xeon workstation.
