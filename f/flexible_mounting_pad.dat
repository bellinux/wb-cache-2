40|$|Certain {{devices such}} as optical {{instruments}} must preserve their alignmental integrity while being subjected to mechanical strain. A mechanical strain isolator mount is provided to preserve the alignmental integrity of an alignment sensitive instrument. An alignment sensitive instrument is mounted on a rectangular base. Flexural legs are connected at their proximal ends to the rectangular base. Flexural legs are also spaced parallel to the sides. <b>Mounting</b> <b>pads</b> {{are connected to the}} legs at the distal end and the mechanical strain isolator mount is attached to the substrate by means of threaded bolts. When a <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> and its respective leg is subjected to lateral strain in either the X or Y direction via the substrate, the respective leg relieves the strain by bending {{in the direction of the}} strain. An axial strain on a <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> in the Z direction is relieved by a rotational motion of the legs in the direction of the strain. When the substrate is stress free, the flexural legs return to their original condition and thus preserve the original alignment integrity of the alignment sensitive instrument...|$|R

40|$|Here are {{guidelines}} for deembedding the <b>mounting</b> <b>pads</b> in standard component models to achieve accurate EM simulation By default, Modelithics library models include <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> effects. Hence, when performing full wave electromagnetic (EM) analyses the pad geometries {{should not be}} included in the geometry setup used to define the EM analysis. However, there are reasons to include the pads in the EM simulation instead of having them inside the components models. Some of these reasons are: • Use of a pad size different from the one included with the model, or outside the range of pad dimensions if using a padscalable model. • Including the step effect when the feed line is different from the pad width. This step can also be included using an analytical model in a circuit simulation. • Including the effects of coupling between the pads and another part of the circuit. • Desire to simulate the pads along with other printed circuit patterns as a standard practice. Modelithics models include a feature that allows the pads to be deembedded from the model, thus leaving the part effectively without the pads. This feature, named simulation mode 2, is useful in the case that the pads need to be included in an EM simulation. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide some {{guidelines for}} the use of Modelithics models when the effect of the pads is included in EM simulations. The EM simulation examples shown here were performed using the Figure 1 · (a) the <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> used to extract the model; (b) different <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> used for validation.

5000|$|The {{center of}} {{octagonal}} concrete <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> on the eight floor of 131-1A (which {{was meant to}} support a depression position finder) was usually the surveyed point {{at the end of}} the baseline (and thus the precise location of the base end station). A survey marker embedded in the tower's roof directly above this pad defined this point. Other observing instruments on lower floors of the tower were usually lined up directly beneath the eighth floor <b>mounting</b> <b>pad</b> and the rooftop marker, so they shared the same latitude and longitude. The pipe stands shown on floors six and seven of the Nahant Site 131-1A tower probably held azimuth scopes, which were less complex telescopes that determined bearings to a target but not its range from the tower.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 7 Three {{vertical}} pumps at a wastewater {{transfer station}} {{a few miles}} away from the San Andreas Fault and next to an apartment building were the source of vibration and noise complaints. To attune the transmitted vibration, a typical isolation system was installed without a significant amount of analysis, and consisted of unrestrained pump base <b>mount</b> <b>pads</b> and <b>flexible</b> couplings on the suction and discharge pipes. Initial testing shows that while the base <b>mount</b> <b>pads</b> worked well, the lack of a positive seismic restraint made those devices unsuitable for use in an earthquake zone. The flexible couplings however actually increased vibration transmitted into the piping because of excessive stiffness. Based on the initial test results and site observations, a new isolation system was required. Although isolation theory is relatively simple, this paper describes how a detailed three-dimensional analytical treatment was required to properly determine the properties of the isolators, including the influence of adequate seismic restraints. Test results are included showing the redesigned system effectively isolates the pumps...|$|R
