In 1940 Casey resigned from parliament when Menzies appointed him as the first Australian Ambassador to the United States. This was a vital posting in wartime, but it also served to remove Casey from domestic politics. Casey was in Washington, D.C. when the US entered the war, and {{played an important role}} in establishing the alliance between the US and Australia.

He once vowed that he would play [...] "twelve to twenty" [...] instruments simultaneously, including playing the piano and organ with his elbows. He noted in interviews that his primary heroes and influences were Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Little Richard, and Col. Harland Sanders, the inventor of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Adkins attributed his desire to perform as a one-man band to these artists, stating that when he was a child, he assumed the only credited musician in the band must have played all the instruments in the recordings.

Keen to fly from the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an aeroplane, he travelled to Britain in March 1911 and trained as a pilot at the Bristol School on Salisbury Plain. [...] Six months later, having accumulated some thirty minutes' flight time, he qualified for his Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate, becoming only the third Australian to do so. Gaining employment as an instructor for Bristol, he taught flying on behalf of the company in Spain and Italy, as well as in Halberstadt, Germany, where he became aware first-hand of that country's militarism; some of the students he trained and examined later served as pilots in the Luftstreitkräfte during World WarI.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{had said}} that he was {{attracted}} to the initial novel based on how [...] "raw and honest" [...] it felt. In an interview with AMC he noted that reading the book brought back a memory from his childhood of a young abused girl who knocked on his family's door, claiming that her mom was going to kill her. Daniels recalls that the incident was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> his mother frightened, specifically noting the helplessness of the situation, and stating [...] "she knew that she’d have to send this little girl home, and that was what disturbed her— that she couldn’t save her. She tried {{to make it easier for}} her. That’s all she could do." [...] In creating the movie Daniels hoped that the experience would be cathartic and that [...] "maybe I could heal. And maybe I could heal other people, too." [...] Another stated goal Daniels had was to challenge the general public's perception of incest.|$|E

500|$|The second track, [...] "July 1st" [...] was {{composed}} by Nagao and Hamasaki. Japanese disc jockey Cool-K also included additional scratching on the track. As H was released during the Japanese summer, Hamasaki decided to incorporate a [...] "summer vibe" [...] to the tracks and, according to Tomita, [...] "July 1st" [...] was her strongest song to feature this. These themes {{had also been}} explored throughout I Am.... The lyrical content is [...] "uplifting and cheerful" [...] and talks about fun experiences; Hamasaki commented, [...] "This {{was the first time}} I had ever written a song [...] from this viewpoint, and I even surprised myself!" [...] "Hanabi" [...] talks about Hamasaki's views of the world, and discusses personal nostalgia. Hamasaki wanted the songs to be deeper, and Tomita commented that [...] "Hanabi" [...] was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Hamasaki feel more engaged with global artists and incorporating those influences, rather than simply being influenced by Japanese music. [...] "Hanabi"'s title was written in English characters, and is the Japanese word for fireworks. The title was re-used on her single & for the track [...] "Hanabi (Episode II)".|$|E
500|$|The two Scottish {{players were}} centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively. With Sawyer's help, Shankly signed {{them both in}} the spring of 1961 and {{challenged}} the Liverpool board to [...] "sack me if they can't play". At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool, Shankly emphasised Yeats's huge size by inviting the journalists to [...] "go and walk round him; he's a colossus!" [...] Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club's junior teams, so Shankly now had his [...] "strength through the middle" [...] and the team building continued with the transfer of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston. Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia, Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt. Shankly said of goalscorer Hunt the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> him: [...] "Christ, this one can play!" [...] Liverpool had finished third in both 1959–60 and 1960–61 (only the top two clubs were promoted); but the new team gained promotion in the 1961–62 season by winning the Second Division championship, Hunt scoring 41 goals.|$|E

[...] The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. [...] "Potshot Heard Round the World" [...] is about U.S. military actions in the Middle East, [...] "with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes." [...] Reagan plays the title role in the song, [...] "Rambozo the Clown," [...] a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist.

Those cruel girls and grinning boys had shown him that clothes made the man, even in a western school. The worst {{part of it was}} that he had been humiliated by a girl and there was no redress.

Yarrell gave invaluable advice, and bargained with shopkeepers so Darwin paid £50 for two pistols and a rifle, while FitzRoy had spent £400 on firearms. On Sunday 11 September, FitzRoy and Darwin took the steam packet for Portsmouth. Darwin was not seasick, and had a pleasant [...] "sail of three days". For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the [...] "very small" [...] cramped ship, met the officers, and was glad to get a large cabin, shared with the assistant surveyor John Lort Stokes. On Friday Darwin rushed back to London, [...] "250 miles in 24 hours", and on via Cambridge to arrive in Shrewsbury on 22 September for a last quick visit to family and friends, leaving for London on 2 October. Delays to the Beagle gave Darwin an extra week to consult experts and complete packing his baggage. After sending his heavy goods down by steam packet, he took the coach along with Augustus Earle, and arrived at Devonport on 24 October.|$|E
500|$|Marko: The male {{lead of the}} series, Marko is Alana's {{husband and}} Hazel's father. He is from Landfall's moon Wreath, whose people have horns or antlers and can wield magic. Marko was a foot soldier in his people's war against the Coalition of Landfall. He was raised since a young age with the {{knowledge}} of the atrocities that Landfall committed against their people. When Marko left Wreath as an adult, he was still [...] "a gung-ho kid who just wanted to do [...] moon proud and kick some ass." [...] This changed the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> battle, after which he began to develop a less militant and more pacifist outlook. When he tried to share these misgivings with his fiancée Gwen, he realized from her unsympathetic and jingoistic responses that they had grown too far apart to continue their relationship. Marko surrendered to Coalition forces as a [...] "conscientious objector" [...] 18 months before the beginning of the series. He was a prisoner of war on the planet Cleave until his guard, Alana, escaped with him, married him and conceived their daughter, Hazel. Wreath High Command sent The Will after Marko because Marko [...] "renounced his oath and betrayed The Narrative" [...] by fraternizing with an enemy combatant. Though he is a pacifist who vows upon the birth of his daughter to never again use his sword, and dislikes the practice of owning firearms, he does so nonetheless when his family is threatened and is so skilled with a sword that he can dispatch an entire squad of enemy soldiers armed with firearms, for which he is referred to by Prince Robot IV as a [...] "force of nature".|$|E

Edwards, he wrote, had a great move {{with his back to}} the basket. He would turn left, dribble with his right hand and he'd use his left hand to push the defender out of the way. As long as his move wasn't too obvious, the ref would not call a foul. Meyer said this was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>saw</b> that move.|$|R

Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him.
