40|$|The {{paradigm}} shift where realtime communication will be handled {{on the web}} is soon becoming a reality. With only a few lines of Javascript code developers can easily turn a web browser into a voice or video terminal using the WebRTC API. While the IETF is actively working on standardizing the RTCWeb protocol to enable realtime communication across browsers and to avoid failures in session setups and enhance the session’s Quality of Experience (QoE), {{there is still a}} lack of a standardized congestion control mechanisms in the area. This paper proposes and evaluates a congestion avoidance mechanism and a rate adaptation model for WebRTC <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>sessions</b> in LTE networks where the model is based on realtime available bandwidth estimation and measurements. Our simulation results show that the proposed model provides a fair bandwidth allocation between TCP traffic flows and realtime media traffic flows. The results also show that excessive video frame delays and packet losses can be prevented with the proposed congestion avoidance mechanism. Consequently the proposed model improves performance and perceived QoE of WebRTC. Validerad; 2014; 20140129 (karand) NIMO - Nordic Interaction and Mobility Research Platfor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{context-aware}} userdriven strategy to efficiently exploit all available bands and licensing regimes in ultra-dense deployments without prior knowledge about each combination. It relies first on fuzzy logic {{to estimate the}} suitability of each radio access technology (RAT) to support the requirements of various applications. Then, a fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (MADM) approach is developed to combine these estimates with the heterogeneous context components to assess the in-context suitability. Based on this metric, a spectrum management strategy is proposed to support <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>sessions</b> {{for a set of}} Bronze and Gold subscriptions. The results reveal that the proposed approach always assigns Gold users to the well-regulated licensed band, while switches Bronze users between licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the operating conditions. This results in a significant improvement of the quality-of-experience (QoE) compared to a baseline that exploits only licensed bands. Then, a comparative study is conducted between the available options to exploit unlicensed bands, namely Offloading and Sharing. The results show that the best option strongly depends on the existing load on WLAN. Therefore, a combined approach is proposed to efficiently switch between both options, which achieves the best QoE for all considered loads...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} optimal power control for multiuser variable bit rate (VBR) video streaming in a cellular network with orthogonal channels. We adopt a deterministic model for VBR video traffic that incorporates video frame and playout buffer characteristics, and formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem. We then develop a majorization-based solution approach. For {{the case of a}} single VBR <b>video</b> <b>session</b> with relaxed peak power constraint, we develop a power optimal algorithm with low complexity. We prove the power optimality of the proposed algorithm and the uniqueness of the global optimum, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is also smoothness optimal. For the case of multiuser VBR video streaming, we develop a heuristic algorithm that selectively suspends some <b>video</b> <b>sessions</b> when the peak power constraint is violated. In addition to the traditional VBR video streaming application, we also consider the case of <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> streaming, and show that the proposed schemes can be easily adapted and applied. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with trace-driven simulations, and are shown to achieve considerable power savings and improved video quality over a conventional “lazy” scheme.
