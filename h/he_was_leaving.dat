The decision shocked Tennessee administrators and fans, who believed Kiffin would stay longer than one season. To replace Kiffin, Tennessee hired Derek Dooley, who had been coaching football at Louisiana Tech. Defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron also left with Kiffin. They were replaced by Justin Wilcox and Chuck Smith, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In early 1898, The Montreal Gazette {{reported}} that NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire {{for the coming}} season. Chamberlain did not ultimately work for the NL because he was unhappy with the salary that he was offered.

Perkins then {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> to take the head coaching job at Alabama after the season, and the team lost the next two games, effectively eliminating them from the playoffs (despite defeating the Eagles in the season finale to go 4–5). Taylor remained a bright spot, repeating as the league's Defensive Player of the Year. Young chose Bill Parcells, the Giants' defensive coordinator, as the team's new head coach.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{situation}} was not reflected at Clemson, where offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> {{the team for}} the head football coach job at West Virginia University, where he competed as {{a player in the}} 1980s.

5|$|Although Warner {{announced}} {{before the}} 1922 season that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> {{to take the}} head-coaching position at Stanford, he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. The 1922 team had an 8–2 record, and the season ended with the Panthers taking their first cross-country train trip to defeat Stanford 16–7 in Palo Alto (coached by two Pitt assistants, sent ahead by Warner). Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923. However, the Warner era ended on a high note with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, {{the child of a}} Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E
5|$|Fahey {{returned}} to the team in mid-September, and made seven appearances, four of which were starts. In November, he returned home to Ireland on indefinite compassionate leave for personal and family reasons. After two months away, Fahey took part in pre-season training with Shamrock Rovers, ahead of a full fitness assessment which preceded his return to training with Birmingham in mid-February. However, Fahey was ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season in April with a recurrence of a hip problem, having played just twice since his return from compassionate leave. At the end of the season, Fahey announced <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> Birmingham as the club had decided not to take up their option to extend his contract.|$|E

5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's bereavement, Scott announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Moelis {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>leaving</b> the company, and shortly thereafter founded a new business, Moelis & Company. As {{he had when}} joining UBS, Moelis took a large team of senior UBS investment bankers. Moelis's departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the bank's balance sheet to pursue large transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts. The bank's apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees. After Moelis, other notable departures included investment banking co-head Jeff McDermott in early 2007 and, as the financial crisis set in, other high-profile bankers such as Oliver Sarkozy in early 2008 and Ben Lorello in 2009.|$|E

He went on to miss eight games before returning on December 29 against the Orlando Magic. After playing in the 2015 All-Star Game, Bosh was admitted to a Miami hospital for lung tests during the All-Star break. On February 21, 2015, he was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} season due to a blood clot in one of his lungs.|$|E
