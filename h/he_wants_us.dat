500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells us everything <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to know about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{heard him}} grumble over my happy anticipation. Jim laughed {{and so did}} the Navajo, which made me suspect that he could {{understand}} more English than <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to suppose.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy {{the wind}} is setting inshore {{moderately}} fresh, and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to come off before it roughens the water," [...] said Nasmyth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to {{come back}} and help pull him out," [...] {{answered}} Dave, and sounded a reply to show that he had heard the call of distress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not more 'n {{three or}} four days. I'm expectin' word from Bimbel as soon as I reach the Junction, and then I'll know just what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Then, Richard took over, and said: <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to put {{together}} a medley of his songs; any tunes of his that we wanted to do, and it took a couple of months. We arrived at 8 tunes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he {{was there}} to give his daughters a holiday during the manoeuvres; and they made the most of it. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to go to the parade with his family but we declined. The twins were pretty nearly the death of General Triscoe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing at}} a time then. Let us by all means be convivial. Only you must show me how," [...] Mrs. Dallow went on to Nick. [...] "What does he mean, Cousin Agnes? Does <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to drain the wine-cup, to flash with repartee?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as I thought," [...] {{continued}} Shep. [...] "And {{just what}} I told my father. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to go out, you know," [...] and Shep's eyes began to twinkle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay {{just where}} you are," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "Before we do {{anything}} else, we must know what Captain Horn intends to do, and what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's from Uncle Randolph. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to {{come home}} at once. He says -- but read it for yourselves," [...] and the elder Rover handed over the message, which ran as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is true, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to {{tell you}} that nothing but entire rest would cure you. I know it's dreadfully hard, but we'll all help you; I'll read all day long, and lead you, and wait upon you, and try to make it easier." ...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘Remembering what <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to be - {{his pride}} {{in what has}} been done well, his indulgence for what has been done less well - we must go forward, humbly, but confidently, in the work of making his vision a reality.’James Herbert Simpson, {{founding}} Headmaster of Rendcomb College ...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{paddling}} up, {{he told us}} that a canoe {{had arrived}} overnight, from Papeetee, with an order from a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes; and as they must be on board the vessel by noon, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to assist in bringing them down to his sail-boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Anne; [...] "but Aunt Alice is so finikin and fidgety; {{she never}} wets her feet, and can't get over a stile, and {{is afraid of}} a cow; and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> all to be like her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked my}} father that, and he said most likely by next Monday. He will want to give us all some {{instructions}} before we leave. And <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to read this book," [...] and Shep drew a small volume from his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "He's comin' up yer to-night, bringin' {{a friend}} of his--a patient that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to board and keep for three weeks until he's well agin," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Rivers. [...] "Ye know how the doctor used to rave about the pure air on our hill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the pack}} are out," [...] said Leo grimly, [...] "and Rassen {{has brought a}} second mount with him.

5000|$|The band is {{not named}} after a real town in Alaska.

6000|$|... "Why, you know, papa," [...] she said, in a whisper, [...] "cousin {{told me that}} God {{wants to}} have us; and he gives us everything, you know; and it isn't much to do it, if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to. It isn't so very {{tiresome}} after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't do it. All I {{can say is}} this: he {{believes}} mother is honest, and that she has some strange power. He will defend her in court; but he intends to study into the whole business very closely, and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to help him." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{a minute}} Felix {{was up and}} had called out Mali from the {{neighboring}} hut. [...] "Tell Missy Queenie," [...] he cried, [...] "to {{come with me to}} see the man-a-oui-oui!

6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} I like better, though I'd be very sorry {{to lose my}} report. It's the fun of telling Ed I tried to do as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to, and seeing how pleased he'll be," [...] added Jack, rather bashfully, for the boys laughed at him {{sometimes}} for his love of this friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vernon's a good sort {{and more}} fastidious than one thinks; he saw he'd {{be forced to}} venture on rather awkward ground, {{and there was some}} doubt. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to weigh the story and judge if the clew he gave us ought to be followed. This was not Vernon's job, {{although}} I think he was satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] {{said the}} child, with her insolent, high-pitched superiority, [...] "It's some money that <b>he</b> doesn't <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to know about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see {{the gentleman}} in red? Well, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> and we don't want him. That {{is the only}} {{difference}} between us. Now, you take this sword, and when you see him coming show him the hilt. Don't hurt him; just show him the sword and shake your head. He will understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Looks like <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to {{keep out}} of the fight," [...] replied Jean, thoughtfully. [...] "Maybe, though ... Dad's no fool. Colmor, you wait here till I get out of sight. I'll go round an' come up as close as {{advisable}} behind Greaves's store. You take the right side. An' keep hid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I hope not, indeed, I hope not. Only <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>us</b> to get {{the good}} society manners and tone--like your cousins, you know. You are young enough for it, and a real Egremont, you know Nuttie, {{and when you have}} learnt it, he will trust you there,' said the mother, making a very mild version of his speech about the umbrella-mongers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Will Morrison in New York, Hannah," [...] {{he said to}} his wife. [...] "He {{was just}} sailing for London with his family and will remain abroad all summer. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to occupy his {{mountain}} place, Hillcrest Lodge, during July and August, and although I told him we couldn't use the place he insisted on my taking an order on his man to turn the shack over to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jamie Thomas {{came out}} to Arizona. We talked-me and Scott Copalman talked to Jamie quite a bit, and it was, like, we were on Balance at the time, and he was {{starting}} Zero clothing. So, like, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> to ride for the clothing-actually, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> Scott to ride for the clothing, and then, uh, Scott said he wouldn't do it unless I, unless I was on too. Well he just said, like, [...] "I won't leave Balance unless Erik comes with me.", you know? So, by default, I got on Zero.|$|R
