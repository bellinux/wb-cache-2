40|$|The most {{frequent}} use of co-axial cable is to prevent electrical noise <b>entering</b> <b>signals</b> being passed between equipment. Ground voltage di#erences are common and add in series with the signal voltage. The screen of co-axial cable grounded at both ends induces avoltage in the inner conductor which cancels higher frequency ground voltage di#erences, starting from a break pointoftypically 2 kHz. The signal current also produces a #ux external to the screen, which induces a loop current through the screen and earth path which opposes the earth current. Signal currents above 2 kHz thus increasingly return through the screen, in spite of alower impedance ground path. An equivalent circuit explains the phenomena and the extreme sensitivityof co-ax and oscilloscope probes to short pigtail leads. Experiments are described and data presented which justify the theory. Remarks are made on end connections, cable trays, and feeding power lines via co-ax...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} in {{creating}} disturbance in radar is to apply appealing jammer. These jammers send strong signals like target-return signals into radar. If these <b>signals</b> <b>enter</b> from main lobe of radar antenna, create false targets in different ranges. Besides if they enter from secondary lobes, radar receiver {{is not able to}} distinguish between <b>signals</b> <b>entered</b> from primary and secondary lobes, and they are interpreted as signals of primary lobes, consequently some false targets are detected in different angles.

40|$|We {{consider}} on-board {{networks in}} satellites interconnecting <b>entering</b> <b>signals</b> (inputs) to amplifiers (outputs). The connections are made via expensive switches with four links available. The paths connecting inputs to outputs should be link-disjoint. Among the input signals, some of them, called priorities, must {{be connected to}} the amplifiers which provide the best quality of service (that is to some specific outputs). In practice, amplifiers are subject to faults that cannot be repaired. Therefore we need to add extra outputs to ensure the existence of sufficiently many valid ones. Given n inputs, p priorities and k faults, the problem consists in designing a low cost network (i. e. with the minimum number of switches) where it is possible to route the p priorities to the p best quality amplifiers and the other inputs to some valid amplifiers, for any sets of k faulty and p best quality amplifiers. Let N(n; p;k) be the minimum number of switches of a such a network, called repartitor.
