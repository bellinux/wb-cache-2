50|$|The first button {{added to}} the {{steering}} wheel was a switch to activate the car's electric horn. Traditionally located {{on the steering wheel}} hub or center pad, the <b>horn</b> <b>switch</b> was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, the Rim Blow steering wheel, integrated the <b>horn</b> <b>switch</b> into the steering wheel rim.|$|E

50|$|A Motorcycle {{handlebar}} is a {{tubular component}} of a motorcycle's steering mechanism. Handlebars provide a mounting place for controls such as brake, throttle, clutch, <b>horn,</b> light <b>switch</b> and rear view mirrors; and they may support part of the rider's weight. Even when a handlebar is a single piece it is usually {{referred to in the}} plural as handlebars.|$|R

50|$|Bandas {{usually have}} a strong percussion. The percussionists {{generally}} provide the accents and do not usually play all the time or keep a 'groove'. Often the percussionists will enter only when the singer is not singing, such as in an instrumental chorus. The groove is mostly provided by the sousaphone (or bass guitar in a few recordings) playing the bass line, and the alto horns playing sharp upbeats. Typically when a banda plays a cumbia, the alto <b>horn</b> players <b>switch</b> to Latin percussion instruments such as maracas, cowbell, congas, bongos and guiro.|$|R
50|$|Murakami {{first learned}} to play French <b>horn,</b> but <b>switched</b> to {{classical}} percussion as a teenager before settling on the drum kit. He worked extensively as a sideman on jazz sessions in the 1970s and 1980s, with, among others, Sadao Watanabe, Yosuke Yamashita, Kazumi Watanabe, Akira Sakata, and Takashi Kako. He founded the group Ponta Box (featuring sidemen Masahiro Sayama and Masatoshi Mizuno) which recorded three albums for JVC Victor and appeared at the 1995 Montreux Jazz Festival, and has recorded several albums under his own name. He also worked as a session musician for J-pop stars for several decades.|$|R
5000|$|CRN {{was founded}} in 1983 as Cable Radio Network to provide {{commercial}} radio programming to local cable television systems. CRN founder Michael Horn (who, at the time, was an on-air personality at Los Angeles’ KFI AM) read an article in trade publication Radio & Records that mentioned Los Angeles radio station KMET earned ratings points in the Phoenix market. Horn learned KMET was the audio source for a channel on a local cable system in Phoenix. Horn brought the radio-on-television idea to San Fernando Valley cable provider King Cable, where he soon programmed a country music channel. Seeking a more mass appeal, Horn changed the channel’s format to oldies music. Two other cable systems - Valley Cable and Falcon Cable - then became interested. Broadcast hookups were initially conducted through phone lines before the method became cost prohibitive. Horn invested more money and switched to satellite transmission. A branding change from [...] "Cable Radio Network" [...] to [...] "CRN Networks" [...] eventually followed. Noncommercial music channels from companies such as Digital Planet and DMX eventually were picked up by cable providers. Instead of competing with them, <b>Horn</b> <b>switched</b> CRN’s programming to a talk radio platform. CRN Networks then became [...] "CRN Talk" [...] and, in 2007, [...] "CRN Digital Talk Radio." [...] Horn commissioned a company that worked with Arbitron (now Nielsen Audio) to determine CRN’s listenership. Results indicated that CRN shared a similar-size audience as MSNBC, Cinemax, and Fox Sports.|$|R
50|$|In high school, Zdechlik {{began playing}} E-flat alto <b>horn</b> before <b>switching</b> to trumpet. During {{his high school}} years he also began to take an {{interest}} in jazz, and began to compose jazz band arrangements under the tutelage of his trumpet instructor Harry Strobel and local arranger and jazz pianist Herb Pilhofer. According to Zdechlik, he was most interested in jazz ensembles in the style of Stan Kenton and Count Basie and he began to arrange works in a similar style for individuals and bands in the Minneapolis area, including the Denny Murphy Band. Zdechlik also credits the work of jazz pianist George Shearing as an important early reference of learning tonal harmony.|$|R
50|$|Having {{originally}} {{learned to}} play the baritone <b>horn,</b> Greenwood <b>switched</b> to guitar following high school. Her first band, the Dames, won the WBRU Rock Hunt in 1986. Later, Greenwood {{was a member of}} the Providence, Rhode Island-based band known as Boneyard, who opened for the Goo Goo Dolls and Social Distortion. In 1993, Throwing Muses alumna Tanya Donelly recruited Greenwood to join Belly as a bass guitarist. She played on that band's second album King and appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone. Donelly disbanded Belly in 1996 and Greenwood joined L7 as a bassist the following year. She continued with that group for three years. In 2001, Greenwood was recruited to play bass on tour in support of Canadian pop punk artist Bif Naked.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Phil Freeman states [...] "While {{the group}} is capable of Ayler-esque blare, the two <b>horn</b> players (McPhee <b>switches</b> {{back and forth between}} saxophones and trumpet or cornet) can also bring things down quite a bit, murmuring introspective phrases with the rhythm section at rest. This happens during each of the two long pieces that make up Guts, and it helps give the listener's ears a momentary break, but also builds tension for when the full ensemble comes back".|$|R

The four classes which were not present in Tri (Dual blades, Hunting Horn, Gunlance and Bow) have been revised. The equipment creation and fortification systems received a variety of changes. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto claimed that this area of the game will keep what was good from Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Monster Hunter Tri and add new elements.|$|R
5000|$|Holme is {{a popular}} pop-rock band from West Orange, New Jersey that {{dominated}} the New Jersey dance/rock club scene in the 1970s and 1980s. The band describes itself as a [...] "mainstream" [...] rock band and {{has been described as}} a [...] "legendary bar band" [...] and [...] "legendary Shore party band." [...] Although the members' musical influences vary, most credit the Beatles as an important musical influence. Frank Sementa (drums), was influenced by watching Arthur Godfrey's TV show and listening to his parents' Glenn Miller and McGuire Sisters records. Keyboardist Danny Gralick, from Belmar and Philadelphia, who had played for Jim Croce for a time, was inspired by Buddy Greco. [...] Guitarist Joel Krauss, who was from Brooklyn, originally played the French <b>Horn,</b> but <b>switched</b> to guitar because it was more popular with his peers. Krauss was a cab driver when he saw the ad for a guitarist. Krauss later quit the band for a while, but rejoined the band later.|$|R
5000|$|The rim blow wheel was {{available}} {{in place of the}} traditional button-type or suspended ring used to activate the vehicle's horn. Some models such as the AMC AMX featured the new design as standard equipment, or it was optional such as on the compact AMC Hornet for an additional $37. A rubber pad encasing wires was mounted around the entire inner surface of the steering wheel rim. Rather than pressing a suspended horn ring, a center <b>horn</b> pad, or <b>switches</b> on the spokes, to make the electrical contact, the inside of the rim could be pressed anywhere on its circumference. Applying pressure to soft rubber inner rim of the steering wheel, a driver could activate the car's horn without moving their hands from the wheel rims.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{instrument}} {{is used in}} modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a [...] "marching mellophone" [...] or mellophone. A derivative of the F alto horn, it is keyed in F. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell. These horns are generally considered better marching instruments than regular horns because their position is more stable on the mouth, they project better, and they weigh less. It is primarily used as the middle voice of drum and bugle corps.

5000|$|Chicago's cover {{arrangement}} {{features an}} extended percussion and drum section {{with a total}} run time of 7 minutes and 40 seconds, and is based around the distortion-heavy blues-rock guitar of Terry Kath, the drumming of Danny Seraphine, the bass of Peter Cetera, the soaring Hammond organ of Robert Lamm and the <b>horn</b> players periodically <b>switching</b> over to auxiliary percussion instruments, such as claves, cowbell, maracas, and tambourine.

40|$|Since 1990, {{much effort}} {{has been devoted to}} {{optimizing}} Goldstone's capability to study near-Earth objects (NEOs). Three different configurations are now available. The nominal system on the 70 -m antenna (DSS 14) uses separate feed horns for transmitting and receiving, and the 15 -plus seconds required for transmit-to-receive switching renders the system useless for targets much closer than about 0. 025 AU (about 10 lunar distances, about 25 seconds of echo time delay) and unwieldy even for targets twice that far. However, an additional, recently installed single <b>horn</b> system shrinks <b>switching</b> time to about 5 seconds, letting DSS 14 observe NEOs as close as about 5 lunar distances. Closer targets will require two-station observations, with DSS 14 transmitting continuously while DSS 13, a 34 -m antenna 22 km away, receives. That configuration, first used for Toutatis, will also be required for delay-Doppler imaging that places thousands of pixels on any NEO whose rotation period P(h) and echo roundtrip time delay RTT (s) satisfy P > RTT. Between January 1990 and June 1994, the Goldstone radar has detected 11 asteroids. During the next 2 years, seven asteroids are scheduled for Goldstane observations. After completion of the Arecibo upgrade, Goldstone will play an important complementary role to that much more sensitive instrument...|$|R
5000|$|In September 1968, the '69 Torana' was released, {{sometimes}} called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan which was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new indicator switch, and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was {{the loss of the}} stalk-operated headlight dip <b>switch</b> and <b>horn.</b> The dip <b>switch</b> ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard [...] engine. The Brabham Torana was still available, in two-door form only. It now included a sports steering wheel similar to the contemporary Holden Monaro GTS, full instrumentation, different badging, and different black accenting. The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.|$|R
5000|$|IMTS systems {{typically}} had 25 {{watts of}} transmitter {{power at the}} mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal — unlike the older cellular car telephones that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. Mobile installations normally consisted of a [...] "head unit" [...] or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was lifted from the cradle {{and in this way}} seemed more like a landline telephone than a cellular handset. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, that was mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a multi-conductor cable usually around [...]5 inch thick. The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled {{in the body of the}} car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no [...] "on-glass" [...] antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. The antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile's battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile's battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car's <b>horn</b> and were <b>switched</b> to honk the horn as a ringer when receiving an incoming call if the user was away from the car at the time of the call.|$|R
