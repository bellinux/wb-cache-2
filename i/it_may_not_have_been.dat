5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent findings suggest that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} Norman castles were built from timber, {{but by the end}} of the 11thcentury a few, {{including}} the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. Work on the White Tower– which gives the whole castle its name– is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, responsible for its construction, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completed until after William's death in 1087. The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point {{of the early}} castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft.|$|E

25|$|During the Babylonian captivity, Daniel and {{his fellow}} Jews abstained from the meat and wine given {{to them by the}} king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though {{precisely}} how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text.

500|$|Feature films made in {{the west}} during the war were subject to {{censorship}} and were not always realistic. One {{of the first to}} attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for [...] "gritty realism", was Tay Garnett's Bataan (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the [...] "worst image for stark violence" [...] when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.|$|E

The device, which seems to have been unique in England, consisted of two [...] tall parallel beams of wood joined at the top by a transverse beam. Running in grooves within the beams was a square wooden block [...] in length, into the bottom of which was fitted an axe head weighing [...] The whole structure sat on a platform of stone blocks, [...] square and [...] high, which was ascended by a flight of steps. A rope attached {{to the top of the}} wooden block holding the axe ran over a pulley at the top of the structure, allowing the block to be raised. The rope was then fastened by a pin to the structure's stone base.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} groups of graves, {{numbering}} around 22 per {{cent of the}} total, that do not fit into the overall square plan of the cemetery. A few of these {{seem to have been}} older burials, possibly Romano-British, but the others may have been laid out by different groups of people in Saxon times. The most notable of these [...] "non-standard" [...] burials is that of the woman dubbed the [...] "Saxon Princess" [...] near the very centre of the enclosure. Although her burial has attracted the most attention for the quality of its finds, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the most important grave in the cemetery. A second larger mound stood a short distance away, partly surrounded by a ring ditch. No burial was found within and the mound has been interpreted as a mausoleum or memorial to an important individual. It is noteworthy that the [...] "Saxon Princess" [...] and a number of burials in the cemetery's north-east quadrant were arranged in an arc around the mound, suggesting that it may have been seen as {{the focal point of the}} cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Although King Henry doubtless {{intended}} to tie political opponents together, John's marriage to Elizabeth of York {{may have had}} the unintended consequence of tying Suffolk to York's future opposition of Henry. And, as Hicks says, Suffolk [...] "once again hazarded the future of his House" [...] by involvement in national politics. The year following their marriage, York's political opposition to Henry had become an armed campaign. Following their rout at Ludford Bridge in October 1459, Suffolk's brother-in-law and allies had been forced into exile and attainted at the Coventry parliament. Suffolk himself appears to have taken no part in York's military campaign, but according to one contemporary chronicler, at the same parliament, Suffolk was stripped of his dukedom and reduced {{to the rank of}} earl, because he had married a daughter of York. Official records continued to refer to John as duke, and in any case, as he was still strictly a minor, and not in official receipt of any of his titles, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> true. Or, if it did happen, it may well have been on the grounds of his fiscal inability to uphold the status of a duke.|$|E

500|$|The Choiseul pigeon was {{described}} by Walter Rothschild in 1904 {{on the basis of}} six skins—three male and three female—and an egg collected by Albert Stewart Meek earlier that year. It was placed in the monotypic genus Microgoura, whose name comes from the Ancient Greek word mikros [...] "small", and goura, a New Guinean aboriginal name for the similarly-crested crowned pigeons of the genus Goura. Rothschild named the species after Meek, giving the bird the specific name meeki. Though its relationships are unclear, the Choiseul pigeon {{is believed to have been}} closest to the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, which has similar plumage. It has been suggested that the Choiseul pigeon was a link between the thick-billed ground pigeon and the crowned pigeons; however, other sources argue that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> closely related to the crowned pigeons as its crest was quite different. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the Choiseul pigeon should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Groura pigeons, the dodo, the Rodrigues solitaire, and others. The Choiseul pigeon has no known subspecies.|$|E
500|$|Although it wagered only $947 on the clue, Watson was {{the only}} {{contestant}} to miss the Final Jeopardy! response in the category U.S. CITIES ("Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle"). Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago, but Watson's response was [...] "What is Toronto?????" [...] Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city: categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired, the phrase [...] "U.S. city" [...] did {{not appear in the}} question, there are cities named Toronto in the U.S., and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team. Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to correctly parse {{the second part of the}} clue, [...] "its second largest, for a World War II battle" [...] (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon, and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest airport). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago. Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. (This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson's response.) ...|$|E
