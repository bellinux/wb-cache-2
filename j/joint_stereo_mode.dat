50|$|When used {{within the}} MP3 {{compression}} process, joint stereo normally employs multiple techniques, and can switch between them for each MPEG frame. Typically, a modern encoder's <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> <b>mode</b> uses M/S stereo for some frames and L/R stereo for others, whichever method yields the best result. Encoders use different algorithms {{to determine when}} to switch and how much space to allocate to each channel; quality can suffer if the switching is too frequent or if the side channel doesn't get enough bits. With some encoding software, {{it is possible to}} force the use of M/S stereo for all frames, mimicking the <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> <b>mode</b> of some early encoders like Xing. Within the LAME encoder, this is known as forced joint stereo.|$|E

We encoded localized speech using <b>Joint</b> <b>Stereo</b> and Parametric <b>Stereo</b> <b>modes</b> within the HE-AAC (High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding) encoder at identical data rates. First, the sound quality of the localized speech signal was checked using MUSHRA subjective tests. The result showed that the speech quality for <b>Joint</b> <b>Stereo</b> is higher than Parametric Stereo when localized at 45 (where 0 refers to localization {{directly in front of}} the listener) by 20 to 30 MUSHRA score points. The scores for <b>Joint</b> <b>Stereo</b> were relatively proportional to bit rate. However, Parametric Stereo scores were not proportional to bit rate, and remained fairly constant with bit rate. Next, the Japanese word intelligibility tests were conducted using the Japanese Diagnostic Rhyme Tests (JDRT). Test speech was localized in front, while competing noise were localized at various angles. The result showed that speech could not be separated from the noise for <b>Joint</b> <b>Stereo</b> when the noise was in located in the frontal region, from 45 to 45, and intelligibility degrades significantly.

50|$|The term <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> {{has become}} {{prominent}} as the Internet has {{allowed for the}} transfer of relatively low bit rate, acceptable-quality audio with modest Internet access speeds. <b>Joint</b> <b>stereo</b> refers to any number of encoding techniques used for this purpose. Two forms are described here, {{both of which are}} implemented in various ways with different codecs, such as MP3, AAC and Ogg Vorbis.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Layer II's intensity encoded <b>joint</b> <b>stereo,</b> MP3 can use middle/side (mid/side, m/s, MS, matrixed) <b>joint</b> <b>stereo.</b> With mid/side stereo, certain frequency ranges of both channels are merged {{into a single}} (middle, mid, L+R) mono channel, while the sound difference between {{the left and right}} channels is stored as a separate (side, L-R) channel. Unlike intensity stereo, this process does not discard any audio information. When combined with quantization, however, it can exaggerate artifacts.|$|R

50|$|As with MP3, Ogg Vorbis stereo files can employ either L/R <b>stereo</b> or <b>joint</b> <b>stereo.</b> When using <b>joint</b> <b>stereo,</b> both M/S {{stereo and}} {{intensity}} stereo methods may be used. As opposed to MP3 where M/S stereo (when used) is applied before quantization, an Ogg Vorbis encoder applies M/S stereo to samples {{in the frequency}} domain after quantization, making application of M/S stereo a lossless step. After this step, any frequency area {{can be converted to}} intensity stereo by removing the corresponding part of the M/S signal's side channel. Ogg Vorbis' floor function will take care of the required left-right panning.|$|R

30|$|Since 1990, <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> coding {{algorithm}} {{has been widely}} used in the two-channel audio coding. Various techniques {{have been developed for}} compressing stereo or multichannel audio signals. Recently, the ISO/MPEG standardization group has published a new audio standard, that is, MPEG Surround, which is a feature-rich open standard compression technique for multichannel audio signals [1]. MPEG Surround coding can be regarded as an enhancement of the <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> coding and an extension of BCC [[2, 5]]. BCC exploits binaural cue parameters for capturing the spatial image of multichannel audio and enables low-bit-rate transmission by transmitting mono signals plus side information in relation to binaural perception.|$|R

50|$|This form of <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> uses a {{technique}} known as joint frequency encoding, which functions {{on the principle}} of sound localization. Human hearing is predominantly less acute at perceiving the direction of certain audio frequencies.

5000|$|It is {{sometimes}} stated that operating an amplifier pair in bridge mode can give {{four times the}} power (of one of the pair). This statement makes reference {{to the fact that}} power is proportional to the square of the voltage, implying that if the output voltage is doubled - as it is in bridge mode - then the power available increases by a factor of four. This would be true if the amplifier in bridged mode were used to drive loudspeakers of the same impedance used in <b>stereo</b> <b>mode.</b> However, in this case, the current through the loudspeaker and the amplifier would also double, which could exceed the amplifier ratings and lead to overheating and finally destruction of the amplifier. In fact, the minimum impedance of the loudspeaker in bridged mode should be double the minimum impedance rated for <b>stereo</b> <b>mode.</b> Consequently, operating a pair of existing amplifier channels in bridge mode doubles available power output to the load.|$|R

50|$|If the {{difference}} between the left and right channels is small, the side channel will be small, which will offer as much as a 50% bitrate savings, and associated quality improvement.

50|$|The idea is {{to merge}} a given {{frequency}} range of multiple sound channels together so that the resulting encoding will preserve the sound information of that range not as a bundle of separate channels but as one homogeneous data stream. This will destroy the original channel separation permanently, as the information cannot be accurately reconstructed, but will greatly lessen the amount of required storage space. Only some forms of <b>joint</b> <b>stereo</b> use the <b>joint</b> frequency encoding technique, such as intensity stereo coding.|$|R
50|$|Audio can {{be stored}} in either of two forms: 16-bit Linear PCM stereo at 48 kHz {{sampling}} rate (768 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 Mbit/s stereo), or four nonlinear 12-bit PCM channels at 32 kHz sampling rate (384 kbit/s per channel, 1.5 MBit/s for four channels). In addition, the DV specification also supports 16-bit audio at 44.1 kHz (706 kbit/s per channel, 1.4 Mbit/s stereo), the same sampling rate used for CD audio. In practice, the 48 kHz <b>stereo</b> <b>mode</b> is used almost exclusively.|$|R
50|$|In {{discrete}} quadraphonic systems all 4 channels remain {{fully independent}} {{of each other}} throughout the entire recording and reproduction chain.
