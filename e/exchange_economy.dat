Why do unbounded <b>exchange</b> <b>economies</b> admit existence without local or global nonsatiation? This question is the focus of our paper. We make two main contributions to the theory of arbitrage and competitive equilibrium. First, we show that, in general, in unbounded <b>exchange</b> <b>economies</b> (for example, asset <b>exchange</b> <b>economies</b> allowing short sales), even if some agents' preferences are satiated, the absence of arbitrage is sucient for the existence of competitive equilibria, as long as each agent who is satiated has a nonempty set of useful net trades - that is, as long as agents' preferences satisfy weak nonsatiation. Second, we provide a new approach to proving existence in unbounded <b>exchange</b> <b>economies.</b> The key step in our new approach is to transform the original economy to an economy satisfying global nonsatiation such that all equilibria of the transformed economy are equilibria of the original economy. What our approach makes clear is that it is precisely the condition of weak nonsatiation - a condition considerably weaker than local or global nonsatiation - that makes possible this transformation. Moreover, as we show via examples, without weak nonsatiation, existence fails. Arbitrage; Asset Market Equilibrium; Nonsatiation; Recession Cones. ...|$|R
