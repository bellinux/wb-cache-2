We calculate the dc current through one dot and find satisfactory agreement with recent experiments by Oosterkamp et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 1536 (1997) ].

40|$|An {{analogy between}} Wigner {{resonant}} tunneling and tunneling across a static potential barrier in a {{static magnetic field}} is found. Whereas {{in the process of}} Wigner tunneling an electron encounters a classically allowed regions, where a <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> coincides with its energy, in the magnetic field a potential barrier is a constant in the direction of tunneling. Along the tunneling path the certain regions are formed, where, in the classical language, the kinetic energy of the motion perpendicular to tunneling is negative. These regions play a role of potential wells, where a <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> can coincide with the electron energy. Such phenomenon, which occurs at the certain magnetic field, is called Euclidean resonance and substantially depends on a shape of potential forces in the direction perpendicular to tunneling. Under conditions of Euclidean resonance a long distance underbarrier motion is possible. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Charge {{transport}} dynamics through molecular scale {{materials is}} of common interest to both scientific and engineering disciplines. Putting molecules on nanoscale break junctions {{is the most}} straightforward setup to study charge transport dynamics through single molecules. Electromigration process can provide a simple and easy method of forming metallic oxide nanogap junctions. By using silver oxide thin films to form such nanogap junctions, silver nanoclusters (Ag 2 ~Ag 8) are also formed in-situ within the junctions. Formed silver nanoclusters strongly and stably electroluminesce under DC, AC, and customized pulse train excitation. By detecting extremely sensitive feedback, i. e. photons, two interesting behaviors of single molecule charge transport dynamics were revealed: 1) asymmetric charge transport and 2) <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> tunneling. The <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> tunneling of field emitted electrons yields negative differential resistance (NDR). Combined with photoconductivity and optical reduction of silver oxide to form silver nanoclusters, junction-asymmetry and NDR can be very useful in both electronic and optoelectronic applications such as on-demand electronics fabrication, single photon sources, and nanoscale photon detectors.

The smaller the distance between atoms, the larger the <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> by the quantum energy level theory [17], which means that the bandgap becomes wider with the stress and the PL peak becomes small.

40|$|Electron {{transfer}} (ET) between {{primary electron}} donors and acceptors is modeled in the photosystem II reaction center (RC). Our model includes (i) two <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> associated with donor and acceptor, interacting through a dipole-type matrix element and (ii) two continuum manifolds of electron <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> ("sinks"), which interact {{directly with the}} donor and acceptor. Namely, two <b>discrete</b> <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> of the donor and acceptor are embedded in their independent sinks through the corresponding interaction matrix elements. We also introduce classical (external) noise which acts simultaneously on the donor and acceptor (collective interaction). We derive a closed system of integro-differential equations which describes the non-Markovian quantum dynamics of the ET. A region of parameters is found in which the ET dynamics can be simplified, and described by coupled ordinary differential equations. Using these simplified equations, both sharp and flat redox potentials are analyzed. We analytically and numerically obtain the characteristic parameters that optimize the ET rates and efficiency in this system. Comment: 15 pages, 15 figura...|$|R
