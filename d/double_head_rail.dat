There were second hand <b>double</b> <b>headed</b> <b>rails</b> formerly in use on the London and South Western Railway. They had been inverted on the LSWR line, using the second running table. The rails were badly galled by the chairs and there were splits and bulges in the head. They had been cropped to 16 feet, and the head wear was not matched, so that the joints were uneven. The fishplate bolts were not long enough in many cases.|$|R
