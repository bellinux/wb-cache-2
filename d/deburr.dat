40|$|Abstract: Finish {{machining}} {{of precision}} components constitutes {{one of the}} most challenging and expensive stages in a manufacturing process. Abrasive flow machining (AFM) is a non-traditional machining technique that <b>deburrs,</b> polishes, and radiuses surfaces and edges by flowing an abrasive-laden medium over these areas. The process is used in particular for inter-nal shapes that are difficult to process by other non-conventional machining processes. A low material removal rate happens to be one serious limitation of this process. This paper discusses a few of the issues arising when attempting to enhance the capabilities of the conventional AFM process. In this process, a centrifugal force is imparted to the abrasive particles in the medium, making the process a hybrid one. The set-up has been suitably modified for this purpose, and the resulting process is called centrifugal force assisted abrasive flow machining (CFAAFM). The effect of key parameters on the performance of the process has been studied through response surface methodology (RSM). Relationships were developed for material removal and percentage improvement in surface finish of cast Al alloy (2014) cylindrical components. Ana-lysis of variance (ANOVA) has been applied to identify significant parameters. Experimental results indicate the significantly improved performance of CFAAFM over AFM in terms of enhanced surface finish and material removal. It was observed that the combination of a high extrusion pressure and a higher speed of the centrifugal force generating (CFG) rod is more favourable to obtain a higher degree of surface finish, while the combination of a larger grain size and a higher speed of the CFG rod causes higher material removal...|$|R

Poor ergonomics, repetitive stress and strain injuries for the human operators, as well as high cost are all reasons to automate this process.

Although mainly used to <b>deburr</b> and clean castings and machined parts, the process was able to greatly improve the surface finish under the right operating conditions. Six major topics were investigated: The nature of the surface finish produced, the significance and effects of runtime, vibratory frequency and fixture clearance, the effects of four different media types, the effects of surface orientation, the effects of different initial surface finishes, and the integrity of the surfaces produced, including residual stresses and micro-hardness;Using abrasive media the vibratory action produced directional, matte surfaces with Ra values as fine as. 27 [mu]m Ra. Surfaces perpendicular to the vibratory motion were found to have undergone a peening action with surfaces having initial roughnesses of 6. 7 [mu]m Ra being smoothed to 1. 5 [mu]m under the proper operating conditions. Many profile tracings and micro-photographs of the surfaces produced by the process are included in this paper. Almen strip tests indicate that the peening action observed is less intense than standard shot peening.

40|$|Finishing operations, which {{presently}} {{account for}} approximately 15 % {{of the total}} machining costs, {{have been identified as}} the single greatest hurdle remaining in fully automating the production of precision components. A new process called Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM) offers the possibility of effective automation needed by the manufacturing community. AFM is a nontraditional finishing process that is used to <b>deburr,</b> polish, and radius workpieces by flowing an abrasive-laden viscoelastic compound across the surface to be machined. ^ Due to the complex and random nature of AFM, deterministic and stochastic analysis techniques are needed to understand the process and to find a quantitative measure of the metal removal mechanism which can be integrated with an on-line control strategy. Therefore, this dissertation presents research on the following specific topics related to the AFM process: metal removal and surface roughness characteristics per cycle for a single hole part, machining of multiple hole components, prediction of metal removal and flow rate in AFM using an acoustic emission monitoring system, and stochastic modeling and analysis of AFM surface roughness profiles and acoustic emission signal data. ^ In studying the machining characteristics per cycle, the largest change in bore diameter and surface roughness always occurred from the raw workpiece to the first AFM cycle. A better starting surface roughness was associated with a better final roughness value. ^ A velocity distribution of the abrasive-laden media was proposed for a multiple hole component. Experimental results showed that the center hole had, on average, 30 % more metal removal as compared to the outer holes. The effect of media temperature on flow rate also helped to clarify the results. ^ An AFM monitoring system using acoustic emission (AE) technology was designed, built and tested. Relationships were proposed between the acoustic emission level and the AFM process parameters. It was shown that metal removal in AFM could be fairly accurately predicted knowing the RMS of the AE signal and the levels of the machining parameters. A high correlation was found between AFM flow rate and AE RMS over certain ranges. Data Dependent Systems (DDS) analysis of the acoustic emission signals revealed distinct frequency bands during AFM that were linked to the process mechanisms. Good agreement was found between DDS frequency decomposition and the results of a spectral analysis option on the new data acquisition system. ...|$|E
40|$|Extrusion honing is a {{technique}} used for the finish machining of engineering components. The process {{may be used to}} <b>deburr,</b> radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion honing machine to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require a greater understanding {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C- 11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results produced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s- 1 and a temperature of 30 °C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K. = 989 KPas; n= 0. 935). At shear strain rates greater than 100 s- 1 the pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. In some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant ram velocity extrusion of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the polyborosiloxane temperature, the extrusion ram velocity and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C- 11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion honing machine and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the periphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion honing machine. It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an orifice restriction...|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional tubing instrumentation for measuring airflow, designers and technicians at Glenn Research Center have been fabricating packaging components and assembling a set of unique probes that contain commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor chips. MEMS sensor chips offer some compelling advantages over standard macroscopic measurement devices. MEMS sensor technology has matured through mass production and use in the automotive and aircraft industries. At present, MEMS are the devices of choice for sensors in such applications as tire-pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances. Compactness, minimality of power demand, rugged construction, and moderate cost all contribute to making MEMS sensors attractive for instrumentation for future research. Conventional macroscopic flow-measurement instrumentation includes tubes buried beneath the aerodynamic surfaces of wind-tunnel models or in wind-tunnel walls. Pressure is introduced {{at the opening of}} each such tube. The pressure must then travel along the tube before reaching a transducer that generates an electronic signal. The lengths of such tubes typically range from 20 ft (approx. = 6 m) to hundreds of feet (of the order of 100 m). The propagation of pressure signals in the tubes damps the signals considerably and makes it necessary to delay measurements until after test rigs have reached steady-state operation. In contrast, a MEMS pressure sensor that generates electronic output can take readings continuously under dynamic conditions in nearly real time. In order to use stainless-steel tubing for pressure measurements, it is necessary to clean many tubes, cut them to length, carefully install them, delicately <b>deburr</b> them, and splice them. A cluster of a few hundred 1 / 16 -in. - (approx. = 1. 6 -mm-) diameter tubes (such clusters are common in research testing facilities) can be several inches (of the order of 10 cm) in diameter and could weigh enough that two technicians are needed to handle it. Replacing hard tubing with electronic chips can eliminate much of the bulk. Each sensor would fit on the tip of a 1 / 16 -in. tube with room to spare. The Lucas NovaSensor P 592 piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor was chosen for this project because of its cost, availability, and tolerance to extreme ambient conditions. The sensor chip is 1 mm square by 0. 6 mm thick (about 0. 039 by 0. 039 by 0. 024 in.) and includes 0. 12 -mm (approx. = 0. 005 -in.) wire connection tabs. The figure shows a flow-angularity probe that was built by use of three such MEMS chips. It is planned to demonstrate this MEMS probe as {{an alternative}} to a standard tube-type "Cobra" probe now used routinely in wind tunnels and aeronautical hardware. This MEMS probe could be translated across a flow field by use of a suitable actuator, so that its accuracy and the shortness of its response time could be exploited to obtain precise dynamic measurements of a sort that cannot be made by use of conventional tubing-based instrumentation...|$|E
40|$|Vibrations from {{hand-held}} machinery are a {{major problem}} in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how anti-vibration gloves (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work {{to a greater or lesser}} degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection, and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. Nine subjects, whose work task was to <b>deburr</b> and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. Only one model of AVG was tested. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period, they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements, a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. The vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands. So-called “AVGs” generally give insufficient reduction in vibration exposure. This is demonstrated already by the standard for CE certification of AVGs. For a glove to protect against normal, low-frequency vibrations, it would have to be too heavy and thick to be practical. Despite the limitations of the protection that the CE-marked protective gloves offer against vibrations, we still recommend the use of gloves because: 1. High-frequency vibrations, which are presumed to be harmful, will be damped. 2. The gloves will ensure that vibrations will not be amplified. 3. Gloves keep the hands warm, which is believed to reduce vibration-related disorders...|$|E
