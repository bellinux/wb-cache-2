5|$|The Theban Cycle {{deals with}} events {{associated}} especially with Cadmus, the city's founder, and {{later with the}} doings of Laius and Oedipus at Thebes; a series of stories {{that lead to the}} eventual pillage of that city {{at the hands of the}} Seven Against Thebes and Epigoni. (It is not known whether the Seven Against Thebes figured in early epic.) As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the revelation that Iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — markedly different from the tale <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> through tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E
5|$|The peoples <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, {{began to}} arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in {{southern}} and eastern Britain, and {{by the beginning of}} the seventh century, southern England was almost entirely under their control. Tytila was a member of the Wuffingas family, the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of the East Angles that was named after his father Wuffa. The Wuffingas may have been descendants of an earlier Scandinavian dynasty. Both he and his father are semi-historical figures.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} about pre-Christian Armenian {{literature}}. Many literature pieces <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> were saved and then presented to us by Moses of Chorene. This is a pagan Armenian song, telling about the birth of Vahagn.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on how we}} {{interpret}} the historical facts <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> Solon's constitutional reforms were either a radical anticipation of democratic government, or they merely provided a plutocratic flavour to a stubbornly aristocratic regime, or else the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from a few}} fragments, the {{mathematics}} of Classical Greece is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period. In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, Plato and Euclid, respectively.|$|E

They agree, however, with the birds and mammals in their general approximation to Malayan forms, but the number of peculiar species is perhaps larger.|$|R
25|$|John Audelay (or Awdelay; … – c. 1426) was an English {{priest and}} poet from Haughmond Abbey, in Shropshire; {{he is one}} of the few English poets of the period whose name is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Some of the first Christmas carols {{recorded}} in English appear among his works.|$|E
25|$|Tolkien devised this runic {{alphabet}} in a {{very early}} stage of his shaping of Middle-earth, but they are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> only from {{a slip of paper}} written by J.R.R. Tolkien, a photocopy of which Christopher Tolkien sent to Paul Nolan Hyde in February 1992, who published it, together with an extensive analysis, in the 1992 Summer issue of Mythlore, no. 69.|$|E
25|$|In {{general the}} poets {{of the ancient}} Sangam period were not overtly religious. They were content writing in praise of their patron the king or about the {{idealised}} man and his paramour. But Paripaatal is a notable exception. This {{is a collection of}} poems, which are set to music and written about Thirumaal, Murugan and the river Vaigai. This must be the earliest Tamil religious work <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E

At the same time she sponsored the introduction of early machine support for cryptanalysis against Japanese naval code systems.|$|R
25|$|In {{these two}} centuries the ecclesiastical {{authorities}} were quite active {{in their efforts}} to withstand the decay of Christian discipline; the evidence of this is seen in the frequency of councils, mixed assemblies of bishops and imperial officials and diocesan synods whose decrees (capitularies) were often published by the bishops. In this period many new collections of canons were made, some forty of which, as already said, are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
25|$|The magical tale of Ambrosius Aurelianus {{and the two}} dragons found beneath Dinas Emrys. This {{origin of}} the later legend of Merlin is clearly a local tale that had {{attracted}} the names of Vortigern and Ambrosius to usurp the roles of earlier characters. Neither of them has any association with that remote part of Wales, but the character Vortigern is best <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> because of this tale.|$|E
25|$|In the Platonic Academy the scholarchs (school heads) Xenocrates and (probably) Polemon {{pleaded for}} vegetarianism. In the Peripatetic school Theophrastus, Aristotle's {{immediate}} successor, supported it. Some of the prominent Platonists and Neo-Platonists {{in the age}} of the Roman Empire lived on a vegetarian diet. These included Apollonius of Tyana, Plotinus, and Porphyry. Porphyry wrote a treatise On abstinence from beings with a soul, the most elaborate ancient pro-vegetarian text <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{surgical}} {{teachings of}} Hanaoka were also preserved {{in a series}} of eight handwritten books by unnamed pupils, but <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> by the following titles: Shoka shinsho, Shoka sagen, Kinso yojutsu, Kinso kuju, Geka chakuyo, Choso benmei, Nyuiganben, and Koho benran. No dates are known for any of these writings. Since Hanaoka himself made only manuscript copies and none were ever published, it is doubtful if many copies of his surgical writings are now extant.|$|E
25|$|The first {{systematic}} scholarly {{treatment of}} the modern Greek dialects took place after {{the middle of the}} 19th century, mainly thanks to the work of the prominent Greek linguist Georgios Hadjidakis. The absence of descriptive accounts of the speech of individual regions made the efforts of the researchers of the 19th century more difficult. Therefore, the dialects' forms are <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> only during their last phase (from the middle of the 19th century, and until the panhellenic dominance of the Standard Modern Greek).|$|E
25|$|Some early Christian Gnostic sects professed reincarnation. The Sethians and {{followers}} of Valentinus believed in it. The {{followers of}} Bardaisan of Mesopotamia, a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon Chaldean astrology, to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including {{a sort of}} metempsychosis. Another such teacher was Basilides (132–? CE/AD), <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> through the criticisms of Irenaeus {{and the work of}} Clement of Alexandria (see also Neoplatonism and Gnosticism and Buddhism and Gnosticism).|$|E

25|$|The {{little that}} is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about Audelay's life comes mainly from Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Douce 302. The {{manuscript}} contains {{the text of}} all sixty-two of his surviving poems. The dialect of Middle English used in MS Douce 302 is local to Staffordshire, {{and it has been}} suggested that Audelay may therefore have come from the Staffordshire village of Audley. However, the earliest biographical record of Audelay places him in London in 1417, when he was part of the household of Richard, 7th Baron Strange of Knockin.|$|E
25|$|Hermeticists {{believe in}} a prisca theologia, the {{doctrine}} that a single, true theology exists, that it exists in all religions, {{and that it was}} given by God to man in antiquity. In order to demonstrate the truth of the prisca theologia doctrine, Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was (according to the fathers of the Christian church) either a contemporary of Moses or the third in a line of men named Hermes—Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest-king who is <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as Hermes Trismegistus.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori. Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Ward’s {{argument}}, however, {{does not}} touch mine {{as it stands}} in [...] the text. My argument is grounded {{on the fact that}} the uniformity of [...] the course of nature as a whole, is constituted by the uniform [...] sequences of special effects from special natural agencies; that the [...] number of these natural agencies in the part of the universe <b>known</b> [...] <b>to</b> <b>us</b> is not incalculable, nor even extremely great; that we have [...] now reason to think that at least the far greater number of them, if [...] not separately, at least in some of the combinations into which they [...] enter, have been made sufficiently amenable to observation, to have [...] enabled <b>us</b> actually <b>to</b> ascertain some of their fixed laws; and that [...] this amount of experience justifies the same degree of assurance [...] that the course of nature is uniform throughout, which we previously [...] had of the uniformity of sequence among the phenomena best <b>known</b> <b>to</b> [...] <b>us.</b> This view of the subject, if correct, destroys the force of Dr. [...] Ward’s first argument.|$|R
60|$|Truth is {{correlative}} to being. Knowledge {{without a}} correspondent reality is no knowledge; if we know, {{there must be}} somewhat <b>known</b> by <b>us.</b> <b>To</b> <b>know</b> is in its very essence a verb active.|$|R
