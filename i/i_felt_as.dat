25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>as</b> I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

He further stated that [...] "this is from someone who was quoted early on as saying I hated them. Not that I hated them as a listener; I just don’t want to play any; I shirked guitar solos. Early on, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the songs we were making aesthetically didn't want them. This new batch of songs, to me, always want solos. I feel like every song has one." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up all the things <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a youth but was never able to voice articulately." [...] He summed up by stating, [...] "I'm waving goodbye to me in the rear view mirror, tying a knot around my youth and putting it under the bed." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Trapped in the Sky" [...] {{received}} a positive, contemporary critical response from L. Marsland Gander of The Daily Telegraph, who commented, [...] "It {{is a show}} {{that has to be}} seen to be disbelieved." [...] Writing for the same newspaper in 2011, Simon Heffer remembered his enthusiastic impressions of watching [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] as a boy in 1965, and how it endeared him {{to the rest of the}} series: [...] "... I had just watched the first episode of Thunderbirds. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though the whole landscape of what passes for my imagination had been changed... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday night was a renewal of the miracle." [...] Co-creator Sylvia Anderson observes that, by necessity, the pilot episode comprises many examples of exposition for the purposes of introducing the primary characters and vehicles. However, she considers the roles of Lady Penelope and Parker to be [...] "brief but effective".|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was in the}} process of breaking down rapidly. Northrup and Hubbard had frequent rows and his violent behaviour towards her continued unabated. On one occasion, while Northrup was pregnant, Hubbard kicked her several times in the stomach in an apparent – though unsuccessful – attempt to induce an abortion. She recalled that [...] "with or without an argument, there'd be an upsurge of violence. The veins in his forehead would engorge" [...] and he would hit her [...] "out of the blue", breaking her eardrum in one attack. Despite this, she still [...] "felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though he had given so much to our country and I couldn't even bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of great honor, had sacrificed his well being to the country ... It just never occurred to me he was a liar." [...] He told her that he didn't want to be married [...] "for I can buy my friends whenever I want them" [...] but he could not divorce either, as the stigma would hurt his reputation. Instead, he said, if Northrup really loved him she should kill herself.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

I was smiling and I was dancing, and I was living through this music." [...] As with her earlier recordings and many of her performances, Bear donates a portion of all proceeds to charity. In July 2013 {{she was part of}} a few Quincy Jones 80th birthday concerts in Montreux, Switzerland, Seoul, South Korea and in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, {{stated that}} {{she is no longer}} invited to schools that have a large Muslim {{presence}} to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmo in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmo schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated that [...] "Malmo reminds me of the antisemitism <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> a child in Poland before the war. I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1935: Film {{director}} King Vidor {{was born}} in Galveston and survived the great Galveston Hurricane of 1900. [...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away.

2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{feeling the}} call of God on his life after {{his first year in}} college, {{while he was in the}} kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. [...] "I was totally surprised," [...] Haggard wrote in The Life-Giving Church. [...] "I [...] [...] [...] told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. But before I mentioned this to anyone, especially to my parents, I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though He consented [...] [...] [...]" [...] Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, author Meyer Levin, a University of Chicago classmate, {{requested}} Leopold's cooperation in {{writing a novel}} based on the Franks murder. Leopold responded {{that he did not}} wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. [...] Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. [...] The novel, entitled Compulsion, was published in 1956. [...] Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him [...] "... physically sick ... More than once I had to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{did receive}} {{some level of}} criticism, though. thenewreview.net stated [...] "With songs like 'Ride Insane' 'Here and Now' and 'Nowhere', I became a little bored. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if I were {{listening}} to songs I had already heard before by the band, or perhaps even elsewhere, and wasn’t completely blown away by what was there." [...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that they deserve to be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

2500|$|The Waifs {{formed in}} August 1992 in Albany, Western Australia as a folk rock band. The Simpson sisters, Donna and Vikki (now Vikki Thorn), {{had formed a}} duo, Colours, in Albany to perform cover {{versions}} of Bob Dylan and Everly Brothers at local pubs. Their father, Jimmy Simpson, was a seasonal salmon fisherman at Cosy Corner beach and had bought Donna her first guitar when she was 15. In February 1992, 20-year-old Donna and her 16-year-old sister, Vikki headed off in a Kombi van to tour the state as Colours. Josh Cunningham, a Moruya farmer's son, had started playing guitar in 1987, he was touring Australia playing bass guitar for a band. The Simpsons met 18-year-old Cunningham while Colours were playing twelve-bar blues in Broome. After a ten-minute jam session, Donna invited Cunningham to join Colours, Cunningham later recalled, [...] "there was a connection that Donna felt that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> well ... it's always felt {{very much like a}} family to me and I felt instantly welcomed into that right from the very start". Upon return to Albany, Colours changed its name to The Waifs (initially styled as The WAiFS) with Cunningham on guitars, ukulele, mandolin, dobro and vocals, Donna on vocals, guitar and tambourine, and Vikki on vocals, harmonica and guitar. The Waifs used the Kombi van from 1992 to 1996 to travel to gigs across Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J. Liebling New Yorker short story about a {{boarding}} house for boxers, they spent [...] {{the next six months}} writing the adaptation, Sunday Punch (1942). They knew they were on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would put it all together into a single draft. We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> if we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] remember that it was a challenge convincing the powers that be that we had been successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Antisemitism, stated, [...] "Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It's a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for." [...] Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet, has sharply criticized politicians who he claims offer [...] "weak excuses" [...] for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. [...] "Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault." [...] Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust.
