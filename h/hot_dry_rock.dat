5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rock</b> geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

However, bentonite particles suspended in water-based drilling fluids could form dispersions or coalescence at elevated temperatures, resulting in drastic changes in rheological properties of drilling fluids (Guven et al. 1988; Zhang 2010; İşçi and Turutoğlu 2011; Yao et al. 2014).|$|R

The boost concept of EGS (Lu 2018) consists of extracting heat from HDR volumes even where the permeability is naturally low but improvable by means of hydraulic and/or chemical stimulations. Two or more wells are drilled into the HDR and operate as production and injection wells. Heat is exploited using water as working fluid as follows: the HDR is stimulated to produce fractures by the injected fluids, which run through the permeable pathways made in the rock, collecting heat which is then extracted via production wells.|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{differences}} between the hot interior of the Earth and its cold surface, estimated {{at the level of}} 3, 000 - 6, 200 °C, renders the flow of geothermic heat with average density of about 63 mW/m 2. However, this value is not uniform throughout the globe [1, 2]. For example, within the Polish Lowlands there is differentiation of the heat flux density in the range of 38 to 105 mW/m 2 (Fig. 1) [3]. Temperature change is caused by the radial flow of heat in the crust, i. e. the so-called geothermic gradient. The local values of rock temperatures that cause geothermic gradient depend on geological building of the Earth’s crust and the average temperature {{on the surface of the}} Earth.

40|$|Abstract: Renewable {{energy is}} a source of energy derived from natural {{resources}} such as sunlight, wind, water, tides, <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks,</b> magma, <b>hot</b> water springs, fire wood, animal manure, and crop residues and waste. These renewable energy technologies are called with its source such as solar power, wind power, hydropower, geothermal and biomass. Energy resources are so important in perspective of economics and politics for all countries. Hence, the selection of the best alternative for any country takes an important role for energy investments. In this paper, axiomatic design (AD) methodology is suggested for the selection among renewable energy alternatives under fuzzy environment. AD methodology works under fuzziness which evaluates the alternatives under objective or subjective criteria with respect to the functional requirements obtained from experts. In the application of the proposed methodologies the most appropriate renewable energy alternative is determined for Turkey under fuzziness...|$|R

The target was a granite beginning at 1417 m depth, overlain by post-Paleozoic sedimentary cover. Structural analysis and petrographic examination of the 800 -m porphyritic granite core, have shown that this rock has undergone several periods of hydrothermal alteration and fracturing. More than 3000 natural structures were recorded, whose distribution pattern shows clusters where low-density fracture zones (less than 1 per meter) alternate with zones of high fracture density (more than 20 per meter). Vein alteration, ascribed to paleohydrothermal systems, developed within the hydrothermally altered and highly fractured zones, transforming primary biotite and plagioclase into clay minerals. One of these zones at 2. 2 km depth produced a hot-water outflow during coring, indicating the existence of a hydrothermal reservoir. Its permeability is provided by the fracture network and by secondary porosity of the granitic matrix resulting from vein alteration.

40|$|Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) {{are based}} on the premise that heat can be {{extracted}} from <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks</b> located at significant depths by circulating fluid through fracture networks in the system.

There is much published research on flow through fractures, and many models have been developed to describe an effective permeability of a fracture or a fracture network. In these cases however, the walls of the fracture were modelled as being impermeable. In this paper, we have extended our previous work on fractures with permeable walls, and we introduce a correction factor to the equation that governs fracture permeability. The solution shows that the effective fracture permeability for fractures with permeable walls depends not only on the height of the channel, but also on the wall permeability and the wall Reynolds number of the fluid. We show that our solution reduces to the established solution when the fracture walls become impermeable. We also extend the discussion to cover the effective permeability of a system of fractures with permeable walls. R. Mohais, C. Xu, P. A. Dowd, and M. Han...|$|R
40|$|Lithuanian’s {{territory}} {{with regard}} to its geology and tectonics belongs to {{the western edge of}} the Precambrian East European platform. The sedimentary formations (from Vendian upto Quaternary) lie ontop of the Precambrian basement rocks. According to the depth of basement three large tectonic structures are determined in the territory of Lithuania: the Baltic Syneclise (Craton) and its slope, the Mosurian-Belarusian Anteclise, and the Latvian Saddle. Research of geothermal energy started in 1988. First of all (since year 1994) the shallow geothermal resources have been used in developing individual heating systems with heat pumps. The geothermal resources up to 100 meters depth are very attractive. It is very easy to use: they are spread everywhere and are renewable. The main deep-hydrothermal resources are related to aquifers of regional Cambrian and Devonian. Usage of geothermal resources from Devonian for the centralize heating started at 2000. The first geothermal demonstration plant in Lithuania was built in Klaipeda. The total capacity is 41 MW. Two production and two injection wells were drilled. The geothermal water (38 oC and salinity ~ 98 g/litre) is pumped from 1100 m depth.

40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} usually {{perceived}} to be about gushing geysers and bubbling mud pools and limited to only the small volcanically active parts of the Earth’s surface. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. Geothermal energy is in fact an incredible store of energy found in all parts of the world which is beginning to be understood and used for our sustainable future. There are two basic forms of this energy. One form (sometimes referred to as <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> <b>rocks</b> or enhanced geothermal systems), makes use of the heat (> 200 °C) in the rocks at depths of up to about 5 kms to produce electricity from extracted (but returnable) hot water. There are several locations around the world where “proof of concept” stage has been or about to be reached suggesting that within the next few years, these systems may be providing a significant proportion of our base-load electricity. The other form makes use of the heat (and the cooling potential) of the soils and rocks within the upper few tens of metres from the surface to heat and cool buildings. It involves the circulation of a fluid through pipes built into building foundations or in specifically drilled boreholes, and back to the surface where heat stored in the fluid is extracted by a heat pump, and used to heat a building. The cooled fluid is reinjected into the ground loops to heat up again to complete the cycle. In cooling mode, the system is reversed with heat taken out of the building transferred to the fluid which is injected underground to dump the extra heat to the ground. The cooled fluid then returns to the heat pump to receive more heat. There are many thousands of these systems installed around the world but many counties have been slow to pick up on their enormous potential. The paper explains how these systems work and looks at some of the issues which require attention in the near future for geothermal energy to become a truly sustainable, renewable and most importantly, continuous, energy source...|$|R
40|$|One {{proposed}} {{geothermal heat}} extraction scheme relies on water circulation {{in a large}} vertical crack created by hydraulic fracturing in a <b>hot</b> <b>dry</b> impermeable <b>rock</b> mass. Water flow, heat convection and crack opening widths are analysed by finite elements. Governing field equations of the problem are first set up rigorously and then various small terms are identified and neglected, retaining the effects of pressure gradient, buoyancy, velocity head (kinetic energy) and head loss due to viscous friction in the water flow equation, {{and the effects of}} heat convection in water and heat conduction in rock in the heat transfer equation. The finite element scheme for water flow is based on a variational principle that is typical for diffusion problems, and for heat transfer {{it is based on the}} method of least-square residuals. The system of differential equations is highly non-linear. The non-linear terms and coefficients are treated in the finite element analysis as constant; the finite element analysis of the steady-state pressures, fluxes and temperatures is then iterated, evaluating all non-linear terms and coefficients on the basis of the solution obtained in the previous iteration. Numerically calculated fields at various times after the start of cooling are presented. They indicate some features favourable for the geothermal scheme, such as formation of eddy currents, and downward flux of water toward hotter rock. However, other important questions would have to be solved to gain full understanding of this proposed geothermal scheme...|$|R
