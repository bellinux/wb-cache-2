Compared to implicit FEA codes, LS-DYNA (1) is an explicit FEA code that reliably and relatively quickly solves dynamic problems. This paper {{presents the results}} of an effort to benchmark LS-DYNA for use in the design of polyurethane foam <b>filled</b> impact <b>limiting</b> <b>devices.</b> While preparing for development of a new package that would use foam impact limiters, a benchmarking effort was undertaken comparing LS-DYNA to the results obtained from certification testing of the 125 -B Cask (2). Starting with a model of the scale 125 -B test unit, it became apparent that the various inputs required for this type of analysis are not readily obvious. The foam material model selected proved to be more difficult to understand than expected. Sets of analyses using a very simple unit volume cube were performed, varying the material-model input, and examining the results. Additionally, the effects of element formulation, mesh density, and run-time controls were evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – A force <b>limiting</b> <b>device</b> ideally {{possesses}} rigid-plastic force/shortening characteristics. When such {{a device}} is introduced in a compression member, {{and if the}} limit load of the device is set somewhat below the buckling load of the member, the member will behave in an elastic-plastic manner. The present paper outlines the non-liner behaviour of a novel multi-tubular, ductile compression member which exhibits an initial axial stiffness, followed by a steady load plateau and subsequent enhanced stiffness and strength, before the final failure. The multi-tubular member acts as an energy absorber and force redistributor. The theoretical cyclic response of the device, obtained using ABAQUS, is presented. For {{a comparison of the}} energy absorbing characteristics, two X braced frameworks have been considered, one with conventional tubular bracing, and one with the force <b>limiting</b> <b>devices</b> used for bracing. For relatively large horizontal displacements, the framework incorporating the force <b>limiting</b> <b>devices</b> exhibited greater ductility and energy absorbing characteristics than the conventionally braced framework...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} aimed at making {{comparison}} between current existing Internet- of-Things (IoT) platforms, SensibleThings (ST) and Global Sensors Networks (GSN). Project can be served as a further work of platforms’ investigation. Comparing and learning from each other aim {{to contribute to the}} improvement of future platforms development. Detailed comparison is mainly with the respect of platform feature, communication and data present-frequency performance under stress, and platform node scalability performance on one <b>limited</b> <b>device.</b> Study is conducted through developing applications on each platform, and making measuring performance under the same condition in household network environment. So far, all these respects have had results and been concluded. Qualitatively comparing, GSN performs better in the facets of node’s swift development and deployment, data management, node subscription and connection retry mechanism. Whereas, ST is superior in respects of network package encryption, platform reliability, session initializing latency, and degree of developing freedom. In quantitative comparison, nodes on GSN has better data push pressure resistence while ST nodes works with lower session latency. In terms of data present-frequency, ST node can reach higher updating frequency than GSN node. In the aspect of node sclability on one <b>limited</b> <b>device,</b> ST nodes take the advantage in averagely lower latency than GSN node when nodes number is less than 15 on <b>limited</b> <b>device.</b> But due to sharing mechanism of GSN, on one <b>limited</b> <b>device,</b> it's nodes shows more scalable if platform nodes have similar job...|$|R
