Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of channel state information (CSI), the opti-mal beamforming weights are determined so that the total transmitted power at the relays is minimized, while meeting signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirements at the destinations. Our formulation utilizes the Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR) technique to produce an efficient, tractable convex programming approximation {{of the problem in}} central-ized form.

30|$|The relay {{interference}} {{channel models}} multiple transmitter–receiver pairs communicating through <b>dedicated</b> <b>relays</b> {{using the same}} spectral resource[1 – 4], as in cellular systems with relays. On the first hop, the transmitters send data to the relays; on the second hop, after some signal processing, the relays forward data to the receivers. Each hop experiences interference, causing resource conflicts, and coupling the achievable rates for the two-hop links. In addition, the end-to-end achievable rate of a two-hop link is limited by rates achieved on each hop. Achieving high end-to-end sum-rates, therefore, requires strategies that not only mitigate interference[4, 5] but also match the rates on the two hops of the relay-aided links. Unfortunately, configuring the relays with limited information about the interference is challenging. Prior work on relay design for cellular systems often neglects interference[6] or ignores matching the rates in the two hops[7 – 9].|$|R

To maintain the original energy budget we consider the feasibility of reallocating energy from pilot signals toward the relaying service when channel conditions are stationary. Under the best-effort delivery policy, the node is not obligated to devote energy for relaying signals, nor does it provide a guarantee of signal quality to retransmissions. Instead the relay sacri�ces energy at its own discretion, prioritizing the primary communication mission.

In particular, we propose max-max pairing to maximize the network capacity and max-min pairing to minimize the outage probability. We then consider power minimization for energy-constrained networks. A joint optimization problem is formulated and solved to find the pairing which maximizes the network capacity and minimizes the transmission power, while meeting certain network performance constraint, such as in terms of the minimum average capacity per user or maximum average outage probability per user.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{consider}} both the downlink and up-link of a cellular communication system operated under strict delay constraints. We further assume that, {{except for the}} one-bit ACK/NACK signal associated with the Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) protocol, no channel state information (CSI) {{is available at the}} transmitter(s). In this setting, we establish the critical role of multi-user diversity in facilitating ARQ gain, while satisfying an upper-bound on the maximum overall delay (i. e., queuing plus transmission). In order to distinguish between the different types of gains offered by multi-user diversity, we first derive our results for a symmetric multi-user channel where {{we consider}} the down-link (broadcast) and up-link (multipleaccess) scenarios separately. This reveals the interaction between multi-user diversity and ARQ gain. Then, we extend our study to the multi-user relay channel where a number of half-duplex relays are devoted to facilitate the communication. The analysis of this scenario highlights the role of multiuser diversity in allowing a large number of users to significantly benefit from a few <b>dedicated</b> <b>relays.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Communication {{gains from}} {{relaying}} can be acquired {{even in the}} absence of altruistic or <b>dedicated</b> <b>relays.</b> To accommodate this, spectrum leasing for cooperation paradigm prescribes that the potential relaying node is rewarded for its relaying role with a fraction of source’s bandwidth. Recently, a twohop spectrum leasing scheme was proposed that enables the source to employ the relay only to an extent it finds beneficial, preserving the remaining bandwidth for its direct transmission, if necessary. Such a solution adds flexibility that can be particularly useful for implementation in networks involving more than two hops. In this paper, we extend this setup to include the relay selection problem in a two-hop network scenario with multiple potential relays. Since the potential relays are selfish nodes, their competitive attitude for accessing the spectrum needs to be taken into account. In addition to Stackelberg game framework used in the original setting with one relay, auction theory is applied to model the relay selection process. Analysis and numerical results are provided, demonstrating that the source-destination pair can achieve significant benefits emanating from the competitive nature of the relays. I...|$|R

We first study an idealistic network model where all routes have the same number of hops, the same distance per hop and their own <b>dedicated</b> <b>relays.</b> Combining tools from queueing theory and stochastic geometry, we provide a precise characterization of the mean end-to-end delay. We find that the delay is minimized if the first hop is much longer than the remaining hops and that the optimal number of hops scales sublinearly with the source-destination distance. Simulating the original network scenario reveals that the analytical results are accurate, provided that the density of the relay process is sufficiently large. We conclude that, given the considered MAC protocol, our analysis provides a delay-minimizing routing strategy for random, multihop networks involving a small number of hops...|$|R

This paper determines the capacity scaling of large cellular networks {{as a function of}} bandwidth, area, number of antennas and base station density. It is found that the network capacity has a fundamental bandwidth scaling limit, beyond which the network becomes power-limited. An infrastructure multi-hop protocol achieves the optimal network capacity scaling for all network parameters. In contrast, current protocols that use only single-hop direct transmissions can not achieve the capacity scaling in wideband regimes except in the special case when the density of base stations is taken to impractical extremes. This finding suggests that multi-hop communication will be important to fully realize the potential of next-generation cellular networks. <b>Dedicated</b> <b>relays,</b> if sufficiently dense, can also perform this task, relieving user nodes from the battery drain of cooperation.
