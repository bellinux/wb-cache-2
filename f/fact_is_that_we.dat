2500|$|Early Dublin is also {{referred}} to {{in a number of}} native sources. The Book of Invasions, a largely fabulous compilation of myths and legends, mentions Dublin when describing how two legendary kings of Ireland, Conn of the Hundred Battles and Mug Nuadat, divided the country between them. The line of demarcation, which cut the island into two symbolic halves (known as Leth Cuinn, or [...] "Conn's Half", and Leth Moga, or [...] "Mug's Half") ran along the Esker Riada from High Street in Dublin to Galway on the west coast. According to another work which draws on early sources, the Annals of the Four Masters, Fiachu Sraibtine, the king of Tara, quelled the rebellious inhabitants of Leinster in a battle fought at Dublin in 291 AD; the Annals of Dublin also record that Alphin mac Eochaid, King of Dublin, was converted to Christianity by Saint Patrick in 448 AD. But these entries were only added to the Annals, or the sources from which they were compiled, many centuries after the events they purport to record, and no reliance can be placed on them. The simple <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know for certain when the city of Dublin was founded.|$|E
2500|$|For the album, Jackson {{reunited with}} {{longtime}} collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis {{to work with}} her and Dupri. Conversations between the group began before December 2005, when they elaborated the first themes, and songwriting and recording began in earnest in February. The discussion turned to how Jackson was feeling during the recording of her third studio album Control in 1986. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on in}} her life then that I just thought her album should be called that", Dupri said. Jam agreed, saying it made sense as a concept because it meant a sense of rejuvenation for her. A sense of that excitement that people have when they are 20 years old, when their life are beginning. He finished saying Jackson had that same sense of hunger and excitement than she had when she was younger. Jackson wanted to create an R and dance album, but with an emphasis on dance. Rather than contribute to separate songs for the album, Dupri Jam and Lewis decided to collaborate. According to the group, the process caused ego and procedural conflicts, but they complimented each other. Jam said: [...] "The great thing about working with Jermaine, he came in with total respect for us, we had total respect for him. The <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were fans of each other and for Janet". The singer stated, ...|$|E

6000|$|Amabel {{thought this}} so dogged and provoking, <b>that</b> she <b>was</b> out of patience; but Guy only laughed, and said, 'Rather so, {{considering}} <b>that</b> the <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{never thought of}} it.' ...|$|R
2500|$|So did Fearchar {{appear from}} nowhere as a [...] "novus homo"? The <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{do not know}} what {{happened}} to the Mormaerdom of Ross after the death, in 1168, of the last known Mormaer, Malcolm MacHeth. We might compare Ross with other Mormaerdoms, such as Lennox and Carrick, in which these apparently new Mormaerdoms were merely de iure royal grants to native lords who already possessed kinship leadership and de facto status as provincial rulers. In this view, conferring this style was simply an act of harnessing organic Gaelic power structures to the political, terminological and ideological framework of the regnum Scottorum.|$|R

"No," [...] I said; [...] "but I {{have some}} office {{business}} {{that will take}} me to Gormanville to-morrow, and I did not know but {{you might like to}} go too, and look the ground over, and see how much we have been suffering for them unnecessarily." [...] The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had now scarcely spoken of Glendenning or the Bentleys for six months, and our minds were far too full of our own affairs to be given more than very superficially to theirs at any time. [...] "We could both go as well as not," [...] I suggested, [...] "and you could call upon the Bentleys while I looked after the company's business." ...|$|R

[...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> doctor, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very much obliged for what you have done; but, for the future, my mother thinks she can trust to such {{assistance}} as she can get here in the village." ...|$|R

60|$|We dress far too heavily. The <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{would be}} a much {{healthier}} people if we wore less clothing.

60|$|Then I pressed forward {{more quickly}} {{to prevent the}} fellow from walking so close by my side, and whether it was chance, or because Pierre so {{directed}} our steps, I cannot say; the <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> speedily {{come out on the}} river front directly opposite Gloucester Point, and here, as if he was leg-weary, little Frenchie threw himself on the ground within twenty paces of the water's edge.|$|R

The <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> failed to realize the danger, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> soon to change. Over {{the next several days}} the squadron began a routine of three scheduled patrols, lasting about an hour each, and then three or four voluntary patrols each day. On 4 June, the squadron performed seven patrols with the object of keeping enemy observation photographers from coming over. The squadron engaged in combat with the German Air Force on several patrols, and on 13 June, Lt Plyer was reported missing after being shot down in a combat with German planes, and later was reported to be a prisoner. In the days that followed, saw a continence of these same types of patrols. On 25 June, orders came to be ready to move to the Chateau Thierry Sector.|$|R

"Well," [...] {{said the}} girl, reflectively, [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do {{recognize}} the distinctions you allude to, though {{not to the}} same extent that you do; but it takes rather longer to acquire certain mannerisms and modes of expressing oneself than it does to learn the use of the axe and drill.

40|$|In {{terms of}} the {{evolution}} of the strategy, I think <b>that</b> as <b>we</b> move along, <b>we</b> have learned <b>that</b> different people have different expectations and obviously this is not a curative procedure. The disappointing <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> using this procedure for certain conditions which will not resolve and therefore the risk will remain.

But the reality <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it seems like you shift rather than eliminate the risks along the staging process. And I think it has become clear {{that if you have a}} re-versible condition that may improve, that’s a perfect scenario for this. For example, patients who had interrupted aortic arch with VSD, posterior mala-lignment type with critical sub AS, and AS with a trachea-oesophageal fistula, or duodenal atresia that needed an operation.

It is easier to speak of it now than then, but the <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> of the new generation felt it very irksome and difficult {{to carry on the}} bitter quarrels of the last. To the older emigres the clock of time seemed to have stopped in the year 1792, and they remained for ever with the loves and the hatreds of that era fixed indelibly upon their souls. They had been burned into them by the fiery furnace through which they had passed. But we, who had grown up upon a strange soil, understood that the world had moved, and that new issues had arisen. We were inclined to forget these feuds of the last generation. France to us was no longer the murderous land of the sans-culotte and the guillotine basket; it was rather the glorious queen of war, attacked by all and conquering all, but still so hard pressed that her scattered sons could hear her call to arms for ever sounding in their ears.
