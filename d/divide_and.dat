5|$|The {{empire of}} the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618 – June 1, 907), {{successor}} of the Sui Dynasty, was a cosmopolitan hegemon that ruled one of China's most expansive empires.

5|$|The {{power of}} Clan MacAulay and the fortune of the Lairds of Ardincaple diminished from the 17th century into the 18th century. Successive lairds {{were forced to}} <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> sell, piece by piece, the lands once governed by the clan. As the laird's {{resources}} dried up, their lands fell into decay, and the once expansive lands of Ardincaple shrank to only a few farms.|$|E
5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} {{epithelial cells}} {{that make up}} the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells also make up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to <b>divide,</b> <b>and</b> consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E

5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{had long}} distrusted his generals and {{frequently}} played them {{against each other}} in a <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer strategy to weaken any chance of a coup attempt. The army also contained substantial numbers of soldiers of Buddhist backgrounds, thus heightening skepticism that they would have attacked the pagodas and monks in such a violent manner. The synchronized military operations throughout the country, the speed at which banners were erected declaring the ARVN resolve to defeat communism, and doctored propaganda photos purporting to show Việt Cộng infiltration of the Buddhists suggested that the actions were long premeditated. In an attempt to maintain secrecy, special printing presses had produced propaganda materials only hours before the raids.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Taizong, {{also known}} by his {{personal}} name Li Shimin, {{was familiar with}} the culture of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horsemen, and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of steppe warfare. Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture.|$|E

Two months later, the Dutch launched a second attack, this time on the nearby city of Yogyakarta (then serving as the nation's capital). Although Rijadi and his troops launched attacks on Dutch forces approaching Solo through Klaten, ultimately the Dutch soldiers entered the city. Applying a <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer policy, Rijadi was able to drive the forces out in four days.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain. However, liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required. Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension, making the cultures easy to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> transfer, although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult. The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> conquer his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} {{might be of}} use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 10 April 1795 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars in which a squadron of French Navy frigates was intercepted by a British battle squadron under Rear-Admiral John Colpoys which formed part of the blockade of the French naval base of Brest in Brittany. The French squadron split up {{in the face of}} superior British numbers, the three vessels seeking to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> outrun the British pursuit. One frigate, Gloire was followed by the British frigate HMS Astraea and was ultimately brought to battle in a closely fought engagement. Although the ships were roughly equal in size, the British ship was easily able to defeat the French in an engagement lasting just under an hour.|$|E

Mishawaka, Indiana, is adjacent to South Bend's east side.|$|E
5|$|This superficially {{impressive}} list {{of units}} overstates the actual {{capability of the}} armed forces at the time. Apart from privileged formations such as the Presidential Division and the 31st Airborne Brigade, most units were poorly trained, divided and so badly paid that they regularly resorted to looting. What operational abilities the armed forces had were gradually destroyed by politicisation of the forces, tribalisation, and division of the forces, included purges of suspectedly disloyal groups, intended to allow Mobutu to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> rule. All this occurred against the background of increasing deterioration of state structures under the kleptocratic Mobutu regime.|$|E

5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette cutoff was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River <b>Divide</b> <b>and</b> into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette cutoff near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E
5|$|During the interwar {{period of}} the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist {{historian}} Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed {{that it was a}} subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to <b>divide</b> <b>and</b> rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States—which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism—became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.|$|E

At the time, France was in a ruinous financial state following World War II and was experiencing great difficulty in its attempts to re-establish control over its colonies. Ba Cụt had only 1,000 men in five battalions at the time, fewer than 5% of Hòa Hảo forces, whereas Trần Văn Soái had 15,000 men.
