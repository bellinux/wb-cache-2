25|$|The simple {{relationship}} between {{amino acid sequence}} and DNA recognition of the TALE binding domain allows for the efficient engineering of proteins. In this case, artificial gene synthesis is problematic because of improper annealing of the repetitive sequence found in the TALE binding domain. One solution to this {{is to use a}} publicly available software program (DNAWorks) to calculate oligonucleotides suitable for assembly in a two step PCR oligonucleotide assembly followed by whole <b>gene</b> <b>amplification.</b> A number of modular assembly schemes for generating engineered TALE constructs have also been reported. Both methods offer a systematic approach to engineering DNA binding domains that is conceptually similar to the modular assembly method for generating zinc finger DNA recognition domains.|$|E
25|$|Resistance is a {{major cause}} of {{treatment}} failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from chemotherapeutics. Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is <b>gene</b> <b>amplification,</b> a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn {{contrast}} to RNA viruses, double-stranded DNA viruses have low mutation rates yet must still adapt rapidly {{in response to}} changing host defenses. To determine mechanisms of adaptation, we subjected the model poxvirus vaccinia to serial propagation in human cells, where its antihost factor K 3 L is maladapted against the antiviral protein kinase R (PKR). Viruses rapidly acquired higher fitness via recurrent K 3 L <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications,</b> incurring up to 7 %– 10 % increases in genome size. These transient gene expansions were necessary and sufficient to counteract human PKR and facilitated the gain of an adaptive amino acid substitution in K 3 L that also defeats PKR. Subsequent reductions in <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications</b> offset {{the costs associated with}} larger genome size while retaining adaptive substitutions. Our discovery of viral “gene-accordions” explains how poxviruses can rapidly adapt to defeat different host defenses despite low mutation rates and reveals how classical Red Queen conflicts can progress through unrecognized intermediates.

5000|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>amplification</b> is the {{increase}} in copy number of a region of a chromosome. Such events occur frequently in solid tumors, and can contribute to tumor evolution through altered gene expression. Initiation of <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> occurs {{on the basis of}} genome instability. Research on Chinese hamster cells showed that amplifications in the DHFR gene (involved in DNA synthesis) began with chromosome break in distal areas to the gene, and subsequent cycles of bridge-breakage-fusion formations result in large intrachromosomal repeats. The over amplification of oncogenes can occur in response to drug administration, and this is thought to be the underlying mechanism in several classes of resistance. For example, DHFR amplification occurs in response to methotrexate, TYMS (involved in DNA synthesis) amplification occurs in response to 5-fluorouracil, and BCR-ABL amplification occurs in response to imatinib mesylate. Determining areas of <b>gene</b> <b>amplification</b> in patients using sequencing techniques has huge clinical implications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractConventional {{comparative}} genomic hybridization (CGH) profiling of neuroblastomas {{has identified}} many genomic aberrations, although the limited resolution has precluded a precise localization of sequences of interest within amplicons. To map high copy number genomic gains in clinically matched stage IV neuroblastomas, CGH analysis using a 19, 200 -feature cDNA microarray was used.

Using these methodologies, novel <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications</b> undetectable by chromosome CGH were identified, and larger MYCN amplicon sizes (in one tumor up to 6 Mb) than those previously reported in neuroblastoma were identified.

Recently, several studies have shown the utility of cDNA microarray CGH for studing gene copy changes in various types of tumors. However, no such studies on T-cell lymphomas have been performed. To date T-cell lymphomas analyzed {{by the use of}} chromosome CGH have revealed only slight copy number alterations and not <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications.</b> Results In the present study, we describe the characterization of three amplicons of the T-cell line huT 78 located at 2 q 34 -q 37, 8 q 23 -q 24 and 20 p, where new amplified and overexpressed genes are found. The use of a cDNA microarray containing 7. 657 transcripts allowed the identification of certain genes, such as BCLX, PCNA, FKBP 1 A, IGFBP 2 and cMYC, that are amplified, highly expressed, and also contained in the amplicons on 20 p and 2 q. The expresion of these genes was analyzed in 39 T-cell lymphomas and 3 other T-cell lines. Conclusion By the use of conventional CGH and CGH and expression cDNA microarrays we defined three amplicons in the T-cell line huT 78 and identified several novel <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications</b> (BCLX, PCNA, FKBP 1 A, IGFBP 2 and cMYC).

This study aimed to perform mutation analysis and copy number changes of KRAS and BRAF genes of CC in Taiwan. MethodsA total of 182 cases of biliary tact CC were studied for point mutation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of KRAS and BRAF genes. The obtained data were analyzed with clinical and histopathological variables and survival. ResultsKRAS point mutations were detected in intrahepatic CC (7. 6 %), common bile duct cancer (13. 3 %), and gallbladder carcinoma (3. 3 %). BRAF <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications</b> were demonstrated in intrahepatic CC (4. 3 %), common bile duct cancer (3. 3 %), and gallbladder cancer (5 %).

40|$|The {{capacity}} of mosquitoes to resist insecticides threatens {{the control of}} diseases such as dengue and malaria. Until alternative control tools are implemented, characterizing resistance mechanisms is crucial for managing resistance in natural populations. Insecticide biodegradation by detoxification enzymes is a common resistance mechanism; however, the genomic changes underlying this mechanism have rarely been identified, precluding individual resistance genotyping. In particular, the role of copy number variations (CNVs) and polymorphisms of detoxification enzymes have never been investigated at the genome level, although they can represent robust markers of metabolic resistance. In this context, we combined target enrichment with high-throughput sequencing for conducting the first comprehensive screening of <b>gene</b> <b>amplifications</b> and polymorphisms associated with insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. More than 760 candidate genes were captured and deep sequenced in several populations of the dengue mosquito Ae. aegypti displaying distinct genetic backgrounds and contrasted resistance levels to the insecticide deltamethrin.
