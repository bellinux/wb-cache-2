40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} canceling the parasitic capacitance of integrated common mode (CM) filter by optimizing the layout of <b>ground</b> <b>winding.</b> Firstly, the CM filter with positive or negative coupling between the <b>ground</b> and inductor <b>winding</b> is researched, respectively. Then, the two coupling polarizes are combined to form the bi-directional coupling, simulation and measured results show bi-directional coupling ground can effectively improve the high frequency (HF) filtering performance. The equivalent circuits are given to demonstrate the cancellation mechanism, and modelling is derived {{for the design of}} <b>ground</b> <b>winding.</b> To further validate the application of proposed technique, CM noise and input/output signals for PFC (Power Factor Correction) converter with bi-directional coupling ground CM filter are simulated. The noise spectrums show conductive interference at high frequencies is effectively suppressed and meets the required electromagnetic interference (EMI) standard. 1...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to direct human contributions, increasing hurricane seasons {{may also be}} {{to blame for the}} vulnerability of the Anastasia Island beach mouse. The formation of the sandy beach dunes is due largely in part to the presence of coastal grasses and other plants establishing themselves in the sand. As they emerge from the <b>ground,</b> <b>wind</b> begins to pile sand up {{at the base of the}} plants. As the plants grow and the wind continues to blow, these piles increase in size and overlap the adjacent piles and, eventually, dunes are formed. This formation process can take large amounts of time, and as hurricanes increase in frequency and severity, the length of time for dunes to recover and reform before the next storm becomes less and less adequate. While the dunes are in the process of regenerating, beach mice must take up residence in intermediate [...] "matrix" [...] habitat, which is less ideal for their food foraging and burrow establishing than their eventual dune homes. This, also, puts them more at risk of succumbing to environmental factors.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{process has}} been developed for generation of the longitudinal and lateral components of <b>ground</b> <b>wind</b> atmospheric turbulence {{as a function of}} mean wind speed, elevation, temporal frequency range and distance between locations. The distance between locations influences the spectral coherence between the simulated series at adjacent locations. Short distances reduce correlation only at high frequencies; as distances increase correlation is reduced over a wider range of frequencies. The choice of values for the constants d 1 and d 3 in the PSD model is the subject of work in progress. An improved knowledge of the values for zO as a function of wind direction at the ARES- 1 launch pads is necessary for definition of d 1. Results of other studies at other locations may be helpful as summarized in Fichtl's recent correspondence. Ideally, further research is needed based on measurements of <b>ground</b> <b>wind</b> turbulence with high resolution anemometers at a number of altitudes at a new KSC tower located closer to the ARES- 1 launch pad. The proposed research would be based on turbulence measurements that may be influenced by surface terrain roughness that may be significantly different from roughness prior to 1970 in Fichtl's measurements.

40|$|Launch {{vehicles}} {{are exposed to}} ground winds during rollout and on the launch pad that can induce static and dynamic loads. Of particular concern are the dynamic loads caused by vortex shedding from nearly-cylindrical structures. When the frequency of vortex shedding nears that of a lowly-damped structural mode, the dynamic loads can be more than {{an order of magnitude}} greater than mean drag loads. Accurately predicting vehicle response to vortex shedding during the design and analysis cycles is difficult and typically exceeds the practical capabilities of modern computational fluid dynamics codes. Therefore, mitigating the <b>ground</b> <b>wind</b> loads risk typically requires wind-tunnel tests of dynamically-scaled models that are time consuming and expensive to conduct. In recent years, NASA has developed a <b>ground</b> <b>wind</b> loads analysis tool for launch vehicles to fill this analytical capability gap in order to provide predictions for prelaunch static and dynamic loads. This paper includes a background of the <b>ground</b> <b>wind</b> loads problem and the current state-of-the-art.
