5|$|After the February Revolution, the {{condition}} of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. The ship that was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were not expected to be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The Provisional Government <b>halted</b> all work on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail <b>halted</b> on 14 December 1917.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{dynamics}} of absolute return, trading volume and bid-ask spread after the trading <b>halts</b> using high-frequency data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We deal with all three types of trading <b>halts,</b> namely intraday <b>halts,</b> one-day <b>halts</b> and inter-day <b>halts,</b> of 203 stocks in Shanghai Stock Exchange from August 2009 to August 2011. We find that absolute return, trading volume, and in case of bid-ask spread around intraday <b>halts</b> share the same pattern with a sharp peak and a power law relaxation after that. While for different types of trading <b>halts,</b> the peaks' height and the relaxation exponents are different. From the perspective of <b>halt</b> reasons or <b>halt</b> duration, the relaxation exponents of absolute return after inter-day <b>halts</b> are larger than that after intraday <b>halts</b> and one-day <b>halts,</b> which implies that inter-day <b>halts</b> are most effective. From the perspective of price trends, the relaxation exponents of excess absolute return and excess volume for positive events are larger than that for negative events in case of intraday <b>halts</b> and one-day <b>halts,</b> implying that positive events are more effective than negative events for intraday <b>halts</b> and one-day <b>halts.</b> In contrast, negative events are more effective than positive events for inter-day <b>halts.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, Physica A (2014...|$|R

5|$|A dejected Mayil confesses this to Guruvammal, {{who quickly}} plans to betroth her to someone else.

50|$|That is, {{the only}} general {{way to know}} for sure if a given program will <b>halt</b> on a {{particular}} input in all cases is simply to run it and see if it <b>halts.</b> If it does <b>halt,</b> then you know it <b>halts.</b> If it doesn't <b>halt,</b> however, you may never know if it will eventually <b>halt.</b> The language consisting of all Turing machine descriptions paired with all possible input streams on which those Turing machines will eventually <b>halt,</b> is not recursive.

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{a comprehensive}} {{evaluation of the}} efficacy of firm-specific trading <b>halts</b> in the Malaysian context. The paper examines a total of 291 trading <b>halts</b> that occurred over the five year period 2000 to 2004. In addition to examining the three variables commonly impacted by trading <b>halts,</b> stock price reaction, volatility of returns and trading volume, we also examine four additional parameters that could have material impact. These are (i) the type of <b>halt</b> whether voluntary or mandatory, (ii) type of news released, (iii) duration of <b>halt</b> and (iv) frequency. Based on our overall sample, trading <b>halts</b> result in a positive price reaction, increased volume and volatility. We find evidence of information leakage, significant difference between voluntary and mandatory <b>halts</b> {{and the type of}} news released during <b>halt</b> to have a huge impact. The duration of <b>halt</b> has isolated impact and is largely inconsequential. The frequency of <b>halts</b> does not seem to matter. While these results broadly conform with previous studies of trading <b>halts</b> in other markets, our refined analysis by subcategory showed some interesting differences. The two key differences were the significantly positive price reaction for the sample of mandatory <b>halts</b> and the lower volatility for voluntary <b>halts.</b> We attribute the positive price reaction of mandatory <b>halts</b> to the peculiarity of regulation and the resulting survivor bias.
