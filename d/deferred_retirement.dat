40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influences}} on retirement behavior among older {{workers who were}} surveyed by the Health and Retirement Study (1992 - 2004). It is found that increases in all categories of wealth (pension, housing equity and other financial wealth) raise the probability of retiring, while good earnings prospects induce continued employment. Retirement plan types have significant impacts: workers covered by defined benefit (DB) plans {{are more likely to}} retire, while the defined contribution (DC) plan coverage significantly delays retirement. Furthermore, the probability and thus timing of retirement for DC plan participants are susceptible to the influence of business cycles through income flow fluctuations that are due to investment performance and interest rate changes. Health insurance (HI), if conditional on employment, strongly <b>defers</b> <b>retirement,</b> while alternative sources of insurance such as employer-sponsored retiree HI, spouse's HI, public HI or COBRA coverage, encourages labor force exit.

40|$|According to CPS data, men 65 to 69 {{were about}} six {{percentage}} points {{less likely to}} be retired in 2004 than in 1992. CPS and Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data indicate a corresponding difference of 3 percentage points between 1998 and 2004. Simulations with a structural retirement model suggest changes in Social Security rules between 1992 and 2004 increased full time work of 65 to 67 year old married men by a little under 2 percentage points, about a 9 percent increase, and increased their labor force participation by between 1. 4 and 2. 2 percentage points, or 2 to 4 percent, depending on age. Social Security changes account for about one sixth of the increase in labor force participation between 1998 and 2004, for married men ages 65 to 67. These rule changes encourage <b>deferring</b> <b>retirement</b> from long term jobs, returning to full time work after retiring, and increasing partial retirement. Although married men in their fifties decrease their participation in the labor force over this period, this is not due to changes in Social Security, but may reflect other factors, including changes in disability. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two questions:(1) Are older persons' retirement ages {{significantly affected}} by the opportunities for income from earnings,private pensions, and Social Security and for leisure at alternative retirement ages?; and (2) How large are the estimated responses? Our approach to modeling the retirement problem is a forward-looking one, in which the explanatory variables include present discounted values of expected lifetime income from earnings, private pensions, and Social Security at all future retirement ages. Such data have been constructed using a unique archive on 390 workers covered by a large union pension plan. A previous paper (Fieldsand Mitchell, 1982) used these data to show that retirement ages are significantly associated with the present discounted value of income at age 60, and with the gain in income from <b>deferring</b> <b>retirement.</b> The current paper develops two different qualitative choice models of the retirement decision. We find: retirement ages do indeed respond significantly to future income and leisure opportunities; an ordered logit model is more suited to the data than is a multinomial logit model; and the estimated responses to changes in future income opportunities differ across model specifications, where the preferred ordered logit model exhibits larger estimated responses. ...|$|R

40|$|In September 2002, the State of Florida {{implemented}} a new retirement structure for those {{employed in the}} Florida Public School System. Teachers were given the option to maintain their existing defined benefit plan or choose the newly offered defined contribution plan. The variables that affect planning for retirement are innumerable. Identifying the most significant variables is essential to understanding how one plans for retirement. ^ This study {{examined the relationship between}} hypothesized psychosocial and demographic factors and an individual 2 ̆ 7 s level of pre-retirement planning. The criterion variable, the level of pre-retirement planning, comprised two concepts. First, the time spent thinking about retirement was determined by the score an individual received on a pre-retirement planning scale. This scale included the concepts of information gathering, goals, anticipated resources, and long-range planning. Second, implementation of retirement plan procedures was determined by the percentage an individual annually <b>deferred</b> to <b>retirement.</b> ^ The survey used for data collection contained 50 close-ended items. It was distributed to all full-time teachers in nine randomly selected elementary, middle, and senior high schools throughout Miami-Dade County Public Schools. Multiple regression and crosstabulation indicated that math anxiety, general risk, years of service, and total family income were significant predictors of the level of pre-retirement planning, as measured by the pre-retirement planning scale. In addition, the statistical analysis indicated that math anxiety, internal locus of control, years of service, and total family income were significant predictors of the level pre-retirement planning, as measured by the amount <b>deferred</b> to <b>retirement.</b> An individual 2 ̆ 7 s level of math anxiety and family income were the two factors that were the most significant predictors for both concepts on the level of pre-retirement planning. ^ Based on the findings of the study, recommendations focused on assessing an individual 2 ̆ 7 s level of math anxiety and educating teachers, particularly pre-service candidates, about the factors that affect pre-retirement planning. Further research should investigate the benefit of such educational programs. ...|$|R
