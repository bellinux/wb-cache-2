These identifications are unsatisfactory as P. allii is a species complex {{that has yet to}} be taxonomically resolved. Some of the cryptic species in this complex may represent new introductions and have potential biosecurity consequences for Australia. A combined morphological and molecular approach has been used to identify the species <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> on Allium collected in Australia. Three different species <b>of</b> <b>rust,</b> Puccinia alli sensu lato, P. allii sensu Gäumann (1959) and P. mixta, were identified based on the morphology of urediniospores and teliospores, and analyses of the internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. One of these species, P. mixta, may not be established in Australia. The taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>rusts</b> on Allium is discussed...|$|R

The second part includes the instruction for use of theme <b>of</b> the <b>rust</b> in biological practical lesson. The special part consists of {{a brief description of the}} locality Oblík, the methods of collecting, processing and preservation <b>of</b> <b>rust</b> and a list of hosts with their rusts and their descriptions. On the investigated area there were found 32 species <b>of</b> <b>rusts.</b> They presence was determined by the influence of several factors: the composition of surrounding vegetation, the local climate, the annual average temperature, the wind direction, the quantity of rainfall, ontogenetic development of the host plant. The occurrence <b>of</b> some <b>rust</b> species should be expected here in following year, especially the species overwintering as perennial mycelium. The occurrence of most species <b>of</b> <b>rusts</b> is difficult to predict in the future, because they spread diffusely. The special attention was paid to rust on spring plants: Uromyces muscari on Muscari tenuiflorum and Puccinia liliacearum on Ornithogalum kochii. These species were chosen because of their regular occurrence [...] ...|$|R
