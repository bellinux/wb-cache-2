Methods and Materials Preparation of virus. [...] The virus used was the LF strain of herpes simplex which had been maintained by mouse brain passage for a number of years. The virus is highly infectious for mice and produces characteristic pocks on the chorio-~ll~ntoic membrane of the chick embryo. Pools were prepared by grinding refrigerated, freshly removed brains with alundum in a mortar, suspending the mash in four times its weight of distilled water, physiological saline, or 0. 03 ~r phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0 - 7. 2 to give a 20 per cent suspension.

40|$|The {{meningococcus}} {{has been}} {{considered one of the}} more fastidi-ous microorganisms with respect to growth requirements. Mueller and Hinton (1941) have shown, however, that excellent growth of this organism, {{as well as of the}} gonococcus, may be obtained on an agar medium containing only "double strength" meat infusion, casein hydrolysate, and starch paste. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the essential factors in these mixtures. EXPERIMENTAL The organism used for the experiments was a type I meningo-coccus, isolated from a case of meningitis in Halifax, Nova Scotia. After approximately three transplants outside the human body, the organisms were emulsified in skimmed milk, sealed in small glass tubes, and quickly frozen in alcohol and solid carbon dioxide. The tubes were kept in a dry <b>ice</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> A fresh tube was used each day, so that the culture used for inoculation could be kept as constant as possible. Experiments were carried out with liquid rather than solid media. The volume of medium in each tube for most of the ex-periments was 5 ml. The tubes were incubated in candle jars, in a slanted position. Slanting the tubes, to expose a maximum surface, was found to be very helpful. At first the organisms grow near the surface. Shaking the tubes after a few hours ' incubation will make the growth more diffuse, and is another useful ex-pedient. Use of an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide is quite important. For estimation of the amount of growth, an inexpensive home-made photoelectric turbidimeter was used. Because of error...|$|E

Foram {{realizadas}} seis repetiÃÃes do experimento, no perÃodo de outubro de 2005 a marÃo de 2006. O camarÃo foi adquirido na feira de pescado da Praia do Mucuripe, Fortaleza-CearÃ. Em laboratÃrio, 1. 500 g de camarÃo eram lavados com Ãgua destilada e imersos em Ãgua fervente por cinco minutos para eliminar qualquer Vibrio presente na amostra. A contaminaÃÃo do camarÃo era feita mediante o contacto dos animais com a cultura de V. parahaemolyticus, por cinco minutos. A amostra era dividida em 40 fraÃÃes de 25 g sendo uma delas usada para contagem no tempo zero e as restantes divididas em trÃs lotes sendo estocadas em trÃs temperaturas: caixa isotÃrmica com gelo (- 1 a 13 ÂC), geladeira (11 ÂC) e freezer (- 21 ÂC). Por dez dias seguidos, e nos 15 o, 20 o e 25 o dias, V. parahaemolyticus eram quantificados nos camarÃes atravÃs do MÃtodo de Contagem PadrÃo em Placas, em meios de TCBS e PCA. Todas as trÃs temperaturas foram eficientes no controle da viabilidade de V. parahaemolyticus. A aÃÃo do frio gerado por gelo, geladeira e freezer inibe o crescimento dessa bactÃria em camarÃes, sendo a temperatura do freezer, a mais eficiente na reduÃÃo dessa espÃcie bacteriana em camarÃes. The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the survival of Vibrio parahaemolitycus inoculated in meat homogenate of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei at different temperatures of refrigeration (refrigerator, freezer and isothermic box with ice) during ten days and on the 15 th, 20 th and 25 th days. The experiment was repeated six times during October 2005 to March 2006. Shrimps were obtained on fish market located at Praia do Mucuripe, Fortaleza, CearÃ. In the laboratory, the shrimps were washed with distilled water and from immersed in boiling water for five minutes in order to eliminate any other Vibrio the sample. The sample inoculation happened with the contact between the shrimps and the V. parahaemolyticus culture during five minutes. Then, the sample was divided in 40 portions with 25 g each. One of the portions was used as zero time. The other 39 portions were separated in 3 batches and mantained on freezer (- 21 ÂC), refrigerator (11 ÂC) and isothermic box with ice (- 1 ÂC to 13 ÂC). The number of V. parahaemolyticus was monitored for 10 days and on 15 th, 20 th and 25 th days by the plate count method on TCBS and PCA media. All temperatures were efficient to control the viable cells of V. parahaemolyticus. The action of cold produced by <b>ice,</b> <b>refrigerator</b> and freezer inhibit the bacterial growth on shrimps.

5|$|With the {{development}} of the U.S. railroad system, natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car. The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s, and were crude constructions holding up to 3,000lbs (1,360kg) of ice, on top of which the food was placed. It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks, allowing the meat to breathe, while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car. After the Civil War, J. B Sutherland, John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars, which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool. This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods. Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an <b>iced</b> <b>refrigerator</b> car, which preserved foods even better. For much of the 19th century, the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines, which was a problem when the ice was continually melting; by the 1860s, refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process.|$|R

500|$|In {{order for}} a {{domestic}} or commercial customer to use ice, however, it was typically necessary {{to be able to}} store it for a period away from an ice house. As a result, Ice boxes and domestic refrigerators were a critical final stage in the storage process: without them, most households could not use and consume ice. By 1816, Tudor was selling Boston refrigerators called [...] "Little Ice Houses" [...] to households in Charleston; these were made of wood, lined with iron and designed to hold three pounds (1.4kg) of <b>ice.</b> Household <b>refrigerators</b> were manufactured in the 1840s on the east coast, most notably by Darius Eddy of Massachusetts and Winship of Boston; many of these were shipped west. The degree to which natural ice was adopted by local communities in the 19th century heavily depended on the availability and up-take of ice boxes.|$|R

In 1906 the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company moved from Duluth to Saint Paul, later to become 3M, a Fortune 500 company.

Grand buildings such as the Germania Bank Building (1889), the Manhattan Building (1889), the Merchants National Bank (1892), and Pioneer and Endicott Buildings (1889–1890) soared in Lowertown, where arriving businessmen and new immigrants couldn't help but be impressed by them.

Some surviving ones include the Schornstein Grocery and Saloon (1884), the Walsh Building (1888), the Rochat-Louise-Sauerwein Block (1885–1895), and the Otto W. Rohland Building (1891). With wealth and leisure time, cultural institutions emerged, such as the Shubert Theatre now Fitzgerald Theater.

After getting himself acquainted with both Jed Carson and Kay Carson, Doyle goes and wins back some business. Kay starts take a liking to Doyle, but her grandfather still hates him. When the new customer's freight is damaged, Doyle knows it is the Armstrong Trucking Company. After talking to Doyle it is revealed that {{the owner of the}} Armstrong Trucking corp, Mr. Armstrong, had Doyle appointed as the receiver, thinking it would benefit him. However, Doyle has no plans to help the Armstrong Trucking Company. Now that the railroad has won some business back, it must work on its speed, to attract more business. Doyle asks a former railroad employee to run a fast freight to beat the trucking company's schedule. When the train is mysteriously wrecked, the town blames Doyle. However, Jed Carson does research and finds that the wreck was not Doyle's fault, and reveals it {{to the people of the}} town. Before the wreck occurred, the train beat the trucking company's schedule. When the trucking company challenges the railroad to a race for a contract, the railroad starts to win, but is sabotaged by the trucking company, which has been sabotaging the railroad all along.
