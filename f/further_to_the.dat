5|$|Beginning in the 5th century AD, {{new land}} routes between Asia and Europe {{developed}} <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, in the Rus'.

5|$|A statewide {{review by}} {{emergency}} management officials recorded 249 fatalities in Alabama, 23 {{of which were}} not tornado-related. Damage and power outages in the Huntsville area were so widespread {{that at one point}} over 650,000 people were out of power in the Tennessee Valley Authority system. The EF5 tornado that struck Hackleburg and Phil Campbell eventually damaged main power lines coming from Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. These towers were the main supply of electrical power to much of North Alabama and some were without power for two weeks. The tornado just missed the Limestone Correctional Facility, which {{less than a year later}} would be struck by another tornado.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side of the jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war, 8 RAR was not replaced {{at the end of its}} tour of duty in December 1970. 1 ATF was again reduced to just two infantry battalions, albeit with significant armour, artillery and aviation support remaining. The Australian area of operations (AO) remained the same however, with the reduction in forces only adding <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> burden on the remaining battalions. Regardless, following a sustained effort by 1 ATF in Phuoc Tuy Province between September 1969 and April 1970, the bulk of communist forces had become inactive and had left the province to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|At 3:00a.m., the paramilitaries {{demolished}} the Roman Catholic {{church of}} the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voćin. They used the 550-year-old structure as an ammunition depot. In {{the wake of the}} explosion, a single wall of the structure remained standing. It is estimated that several tons of explosives were used for the purpose. At the same time, approximately 20 other Croat inhabitants of villages of Bokane, Krašković, Miokovićevo and Zvečevo, <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, were reportedly killed.|$|E

5|$|Away {{from the}} wall, Roman sculptures include the marble {{head of a}} Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at Hawkshaw, Peebleshire {{in the late eighteenth}} century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a Roman {{monument}} <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. The Cramond Lioness is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of Cramond Roman Fort near Edinburgh. A relief of the goddess Brigantia found near Birrens in Dumfriesshire, combines elements of native and classical art.|$|E
5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to have been limited. Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded <b>further</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E

Here, NY454 returns to four lanes and meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) and its frontage roads. The route enters the village of Islandia and enters a large commercial district, where the route intersects with CR100 (Old Nichols Road).
