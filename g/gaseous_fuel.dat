25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion heat engines (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas. This {{is achieved by}} combusting a solid, liquid or <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternate}} method {{under development}} is chemical looping combustion (CLC). Chemical looping uses a metal oxide as a solid oxygen carrier. Metal oxide particles react with a solid, liquid or <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> in a fluidized bed combustor, producing solid metal particles and {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide and water vapor. [...] The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide, which can then be sequestered. [...] The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor. A variant of chemical looping is calcium looping, which uses the alternating carbonation and then calcination of a calcium oxide based carrier as a means of capturing [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{technology}} for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> (H2, CH4), and power production. In these cases, the fossil fuel is partially oxidized, {{for instance in}} a gasifier. The resulting syngas (CO and H2) is [...] shifted into [...] and H2. The resulting [...] can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H2 can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture. The [...] is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option. The capture before expansion, i.e. from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial [...] capture processes, at the same scale as will be required for utility power plants.|$|E
2500|$|LNG {{offers a}} unique {{advantage}} over CNG for more demanding high-horsepower applications {{by eliminating the}} need for a turbocharger. [...] Because LNG boils at approximately -160C, by using a simple heat exchanger a small amount of LNG can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with the use of little or no mechanical energy. [...] A properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this extremely high pressure energy dense <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> source to create a higher energy density air-fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a CNG powered engine. [...] The end result when compared to CNG engines is more overall efficiency in high-horsepower engine applications when high-pressure direct injection technology is used. [...] The Westport HDMI2 fuel system {{is an example of a}} high-pressure direct injection technology that does not require a turbocharger if teamed with appropriate LNG heat exchanger technology. [...] The Volvo Trucks 13-liter LNG engine is another example of a LNG engine leveraging advanced high pressure technology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{alternative}} <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> in port fuel injection (PFI) spark ignition (SI) engines by means of Lotus Engine Simulation (LES) program. To this aim, the engine model for a commercial automotive SI engine was constructed and engine performances were determined for gasoline and alternative <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> i. e., compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The results show that brake thermal efficiency increases, while engine performance and fuel consumption decreases for methane and propane compared to gasoline at the same conditions. Engine performance improves when equivalence ratio is increased at a little quantity for <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels,</b> while the fuel consumption remains almost stable. Engine performance also increases with increasing compression ratio for methane and propane, thus closer/equal performance values are obtained to gasoline. In this case, the brake specific fuel consumption decreases notable and significant increases are gained in brake thermal efficiency.

40|$|Fluctuating {{fuel prices}} and {{associated}} pollution problems of largely exploited petroleum liquid fuel has stimulated {{the research on}} abundantly available <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> to keep the mobility industry intact. In the present work an air cooled diesel engine was modified suitably into a spark ignition engine incorporating electronic ignition and variable speed dependant spark timing to accommodate both LPG and CNG as fuels. Engine was optimized for stoichiometric operation on engine dynamometer. Materials of a few intricate engine components were replaced to suit LPG and CNG application. Ignition timing was mapped to work with <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> for different speeds. Compensation was done for recovering volumetric efficiency when operated with CNG by introducing more volume of air through resonator. Ignition timing was observed to be the pertinent parameter in achieving good performance with <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> under consideration. Performance and emission tests were carried out on engine dynamometer and chassis dynamometer. Under wide open throttle and at rated speed condition, {{it was observed that}} the peak pressure with LPG was lying between diesel fuel and CNG fuel operation due to slow burning nature of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels.</b> As compression ratio was maintained same for LPG and CNG fuel operation, low CO emissions were observed with LPG where as HC + NOx emissions were lower with CNG fuel operation.
