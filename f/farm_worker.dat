Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed, {{and the local}} chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indiantown. Across southeastern Florida, the hurricane damaged 6,465houses and destroyed another 383, causing over $3million in damage. One person, an African American <b>farm</b> <b>worker,</b> was killed when his shack blew down in Gomez, a brakeman died after sevenrailcars derailed, and a child was killed by airborne debris.|$|E
5|$|Edward Elgar {{was born}} in the small village of Lower Broadheath, outside Worcester, England. His father, William Henry Elgar (1821–1906), was raised in Dover and had been apprenticed to a London music publisher. In 1841 William moved to Worcester, where he worked as a piano tuner and set up a shop selling sheet music and musical instruments. In 1848 he married Ann Greening (1822–1902), {{daughter}} of a <b>farm</b> <b>worker.</b> Edward was the fourth of their seven children. Ann Elgar had converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before Edward's birth, and he was baptised and brought up as a Roman Catholic, to the disapproval of his father. William Elgar was a violinist of professional standard and held the post of organist of St. George's Roman Catholic Church, Worcester, from 1846 to 1885. At his instigation, masses by Cherubini and Hummel were first heard at the Three Choirs Festival by the orchestra in which he played the violin. All the Elgar children received a musical upbringing. By the age of eight, Elgar was taking piano and violin lessons, and his father, who tuned the pianos at many grand houses in Worcestershire, would sometimes take him along, giving him the chance to display his skill to important local figures.|$|E

50|$|The {{union was}} founded in {{response}} to an anti-communist purge in the <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Sweden following its March 1921 congress in Norrköping. Around the country, district conferences of the <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Sweden were held in which communists were removed from leadership positions in the union. The communists issued a call for the foundation of a new nationwide agricultural labourers' union. The invitation to the founding congress of the Forest and <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Sweden was sent to all sections of the <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Sweden. The appeal cited the rejection of the declarations of the Norrköping congress by many of its attending delegates (including the leadership of the Forest and <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Central Sweden). However, the Forest and <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Central Sweden had split shortly after the Norrköping congress. The majority of the organization (the sections in Västmanland) had rejoined the <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Sweden. The rump Forest and <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Union of Central Sweden (consisting of the Dalarna district organization and a few other section) would serve as the basis of the new nationwide union.|$|R
25|$|In August 1966, the National <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Association (NFWA) and Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), two unrecognized and {{relatively}} minor labor unions claiming organizing jurisdiction over <b>farm</b> <b>workers</b> in California, merged {{to form the}} United <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> Organizing Committee (the predecessor organization to the United <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers).</b> Adopting the philosophy of pacifism {{in the face of}} often violent reaction to its organizing efforts and engaging in strikes, hunger strikes, boycotts and secondary boycotts (including the successful Delano grape strike), marches, rallies and cutting-edge public relations campaigns, the United <b>Farm</b> <b>Workers</b> (UFW) began organizing large numbers of agricultural laborers into unions. In some cases, the UFW even won recognition and negotiated contracts.|$|R

25|$|It is {{also not}} clear whether CALRA has had a {{beneficial}} effect on the Californian economy. One study concluded that the Act actually resulted in a net economic loss: Higher prices were being charged for produce, <b>farm</b> <b>worker</b> earnings and land values had actually dropped.

Lantarbetaren was taken over by the new union as its organ in January 1909.

25|$|The Salad Bowl {{strike was}} a series of strikes, mass pickets, boycotts and {{secondary}} boycotts that began on August 23, 1970 and led to the largest <b>farm</b> <b>worker</b> strike in U.S. history.

The Salad Bowl strike was only in part a jurisdictional strike, for many of the actions taken during the event were not strikes.

40|$|Migrant <b>farm</b> <b>workers</b> {{experience}} many hardships {{during their}} time in the U. S.

This study examined the utilization and satisfaction of health services received by migrant <b>farm</b> <b>workers.</b> A total of seven Latino migrant <b>farm</b> <b>workers</b> were interviewed.

Thus, Midwestern growers argued that they could no longer compete with cheap Mexican-grown products. Velasquez contacted Mexican <b>farm</b> <b>worker</b> unions, then in the midst of their own collective bargaining negotiations. Velasquez pressured the Mexican unions to demand significantly higher wages. The strategy was successful: The higher Mexican wages and benefits closed the price differential, and Midwestern growers no longer threatened to break their pact with FLOC.|$|E
25|$|Olmec {{culture was}} unknown to historians until the mid-19th century.

This monument– the colossal head now labelled Tres Zapotes Monument A– had been discovered in the late 1850s by a <b>farm</b> <b>worker</b> clearing forested land on a hacienda in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 to see for himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture's excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.|$|E
