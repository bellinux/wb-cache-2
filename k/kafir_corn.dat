60|$|As {{soon as we}} were seated, an {{earthenware}} jar {{was passed}} round containing a fermented fluid, of by no means unpleasant taste, though apt to turn upon the stomach, made from crushed grain--not Indian corn, but a small brown grain that grows upon its stem in clusters, not unlike that which {{in the southern part}} of Africa is known by the name of <b>Kafir</b> <b>corn.</b> The vase which contained this liquor was very curious, and as it more or less resembled many hundreds of others in use among the Amahagger I may as well describe it. These vases are of a very ancient manufacture, and of all sizes. None such can have been made in the country for hundreds, or rather thousands, of years. They are found in the rock tombs, of which I shall give a description in their proper place, and my own belief is that, after the fashion of the Egyptians, with whom the former inhabitants of this country may have had some connection, they were used to receive the viscera of the dead. Leo, however, is of opinion that, as in the case of Etruscan amphoræ, they were placed there for the spiritual use of the deceased. They are mostly two-handled, and of all sizes, some being nearly three feet in height, and running from that down to as many inches. In shape they vary, but all are exceedingly beautiful and graceful, being made of a very fine black ware, not lustrous, but slightly rough. On this groundwork are inlaid figures much more graceful and lifelike than any others that I have seen on antique vases. Some of these inlaid pictures represent love-scenes with a childlike simplicity and freedom of manner which would not commend itself to the taste of the present day. Others again give pictures of maidens dancing, and yet others of hunting-scenes. For instance, the very vase from which we were then drinking had on one side a most spirited drawing of men, apparently white in colour, attacking a bull-elephant with spears, while on the reverse was a picture, not quite so well done, of a hunter shooting an arrow at a running antelope, I should say from the look of it either an eland or a koodoo.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the vitamin E content of each of the {{ingredients}} of our dairy herd ration, excepting the salt, lime, and bone meal. Female rats which were able to conceive but unable to reproduce when fed a diet deficient in vitamin E were fed the various feeds as a source of vitamin E during a second breeding period. The presence of vitamin E in a feed was thus shown by the ability of the female to cast a litter. The vitamin E content of bran, shorts, linseed oil meal, hominy feed, white corn, yellow <b>corn,</b> cottonseed meal, <b>kafir,</b> beet pulp, <b>corn</b> gluten feed, corn gluten meal, and alfalfa was examined. Twenty to twenty-five per cent of the bran, shorts, linseed oil meal, hominy feed, white corn, yellow <b>corn,</b> cottonseed meal, <b>kafir,</b> or alfalfa furnished sufficient vitamin E to allow the rats to cast litters. On the other hand, forty per cent of the corn gluten meal, the corn gluten feed, or the beet pulp furnished very little vitamin E. There {{was no significant difference in}} the vitamin E content of the white and yellow corn used...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is a cereal of {{remarkable}} genetic variability, {{which makes it}} difficult to classify. A few names of sorghum are milo, jowar, <b>kafir</b> <b>corn,</b> guinea corn, and cholam. The plant originated in equatorial Africa and is distributed throughout the tropical, semi-tropical, and arid regions of the world. The seed or caryopsis of sorghum provides a major source of calories and protein for millions of people in Africa and Asia. Grain characteristics of sorghum have been documented by Rooney and Miller (1982). Appearance and quality of sorghum are affected significantly by genetically controlled characters. Grain is marketed, according to the US grain standards (USDA 1987), as sorghum, tannin sorghum, white sorghum, and mixed sorghum. The sorghum grade does not contain more than 3 % of sorghum with a pigmented testa or undercoat. The white grade contains sorghum with a white pericarp without a pigmented testa. It cannot contain more than 2 % of sorghum with colored pericarp or testa. Mixed sorghum contains mixtures of sorghum with and without pigmented testa. Tannin sorghums contain proanthocyanidins as part of their phenolic compounds but do not contain tannic acid nor hydrolyzable tannins. Tannin sorghums have a pigmented testa on the innermost layer of the pericarp. The pigmented testa is seen as a dark layer between th...|$|E
