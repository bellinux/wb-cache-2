25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; <b>it</b> <b>literally</b> sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

However, by March 2007, Grint agreed to return for the last instalments.

They alluded to close ties between the church and the KGB ("Black robes, golden epaulettes"), criticized the subservience of many Russians to the church ("Parishioners crawl bowing") and attacked the church's traditionalist views on women ("So as not to offend His Holiness, women must bear children and love"). They used the crude epithet [...] "Sran Gospodnya", which has been used to translate [...] "holy shit" [...] in Hollywood movies, but is rarely used in idiomatic Russian; <b>it</b> <b>literally</b> translates as [...] "shit of the Lord".

500|$|The Chrysler Building uses silvery [...] "Enduro KA-2" [...] metal {{extensively}} in its design.

The Nirosta steel, whose first use in an American project was in the Chrysler Building, was was {{also referred to as}} [...] "18-8 stainless steel" [...] because it was composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel {{was an integral part of}} Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: [...] "The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until <b>it</b> <b>literally</b> dissolves into the sky...." [...] Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to experiment with the durability of stainless steel in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created a stainless steel inspection committee. Its members saw the Chrysler Building as the best location to study the effect of the environment on stainless steel, so they created a smaller subcommittee to examine the building's panels every five years. The inspections were canceled after 1960 because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.|$|E
