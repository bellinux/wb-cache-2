5|$|From 1936, NSB took {{delivery}} of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 {{as the primary}} <b>hauler</b> on the electrified commuter rail network. Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and turnable seats. NSB took {{delivery of}} 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The Østfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from OsloØ to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The Østfold Line was also the next line to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940. NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log <b>Hauler.</b> The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{competition}} forced diversification and AMT added {{new product}} lines, specifically trucks. For example, its early Dirt <b>Hauler</b> kit {{was merely a}} generic tractor-trailer with dumping trailer. Then, in 1969, AMT released the California <b>Hauler</b> 359 kit. This new kit was a revolution for model building, a realistic model of a Peterbilt 359 tractor-trailer, the design having been copied from the manufacturer's specifications. It also had an authentic 8V71 Detroit Diesel engine under the hood. The kit lacked a sleeper cab, {{but there was a}} coupon that could be sent in along with ten cents to get it. The following year, the second version was issued with a sleeper cab.|$|E

25|$|On {{the final}} restart of the Toyota Owners 400, Busch and Tony Stewart had another altercation. Busch had {{previously}} led 36 laps {{of the race}} and was in contention to win. Stewart because of slight contact lost 17 spots and Busch finished in ninth-place behind race winner Kevin Harvick. When the race was over, seconds after the checkers flew, Stewart bumped Busch, who also bumped Matt Kenseth. Their shoving match using their cars caused Busch's to be damaged. Both were summoned to the NASCAR <b>hauler.</b> During the post-race ceremonies, the fans noticed Busch and Stewart arguing near the NASCAR <b>hauler.</b> When interviewed Busch {{said he did not}} intentionally hit Stewart but was trying to cleanly race him to the finish. Stewart disagreed with this because the two drivers had had several prior incidents in 2007 and 2008 in similar fashion.|$|E
50|$|This is {{also seen}} {{in the way they}} are used. Whereas rigid <b>haulers</b> find their best usage at large surface mines and big quarries, where there is {{abundant}} space and hard level surfaces to drive on, articulated <b>haulers</b> are best used at rugged and cramped sites, such as large construction sites.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the success}} of the California <b>Hauler</b> 359, AMT {{proceeded}} to issue more truck kits through the 1970s. Examples of offerings were the Chevrolet Titan/GMC Astro, Peterbilt 352, Kenworth W925, Autocar A64B and White Road Boss. Trailer kits to accompany these trucks, such as box, flatbeds, refrigerated and tankers were introduced. These kits tended to cost about $5.|$|E

50|$|Alvin Orlando Lombard was a {{blacksmith}} building logging equipment in Waterville, Maine. He built 83 steam log <b>haulers</b> between 1901 and 1917. These log <b>haulers</b> resembled a saddle-tank steam locomotive {{with a small}} platform {{in front of the}} boiler where the cow-catcher might be expected. A steering wheel on the platform moved a large pair of skis beneath the platform. A set of tracked vehicle treads occupied the space beneath the boiler where driving wheels might be expected. The locomotive cylinders powered the treads through a gear train. The log <b>haulers</b> mechanically resembled 10- to 30-ton snowmobiles with a top speed of about 4.5 mph.|$|R
