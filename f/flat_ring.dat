2500|$|In 1655, Christiaan Huygens {{became the}} first person to suggest that Saturn was {{surrounded}} by a ring. Using a 50× power refracting telescope that he designed himself, far superior to those available to Galileo, Huygens observed Saturn and wrote that [...] "It [...] is surrounded by a thin, <b>flat,</b> <b>ring,</b> nowhere touching, inclined to the ecliptic". Robert Hooke was another early observer of the rings of Saturn, and noted the casting of shadows on the rings.|$|E

40|$|The complex-shift {{method is}} applied to the Kuzmin-Toomre family of discs to {{generate}} a family of non-axisymmetric flat distributions of matter. These are then superposed to construct non-axisymmetric <b>flat</b> <b>rings.</b> We also consider triaxial potential-density pairs obtained from these non-axisymmetric flat systems by means of suitable transformations. The use of the imaginary part of complex-shifted potential-density pairs is also discussed. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
25|$|The {{cylindrical}} {{ion trap}} mass spectrometer (CIT) is a derivative of the quadrupole ion trap where the electrodes are formed from <b>flat</b> <b>rings</b> rather than hyperbolic shaped electrodes. The architecture lends itself well to miniaturization because as {{the size of}} a trap is reduced, the shape of the electric field {{near the center of the}} trap, the region where the ions are trapped, forms a shape similar to that of a hyperbolic trap.|$|R
2500|$|The {{engraved}} gem was {{a luxury}} art with high prestige; Pompey and Julius Caesar were among later collectors.

2500|$|Furan is {{aromatic}} {{because one}} of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom is delocalized into the ring, creating a 4n+2 aromatic system (see Hückel's rule) similar to benzene. [...] Because of the aromaticity, the molecule is flat and lacks discrete double bonds. The other lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom extends in the plane of the <b>flat</b> <b>ring</b> system. The sp2 hybridization is to allow one of the lone pairs of oxygen to reside in a p orbital and thus allow it to interact within the π system.|$|E
2500|$|In 1655, Huygens {{proposed}} that Saturn {{was surrounded by}} a solid ring, [...] "a thin, <b>flat</b> <b>ring,</b> nowhere touching, and inclined to the ecliptic." [...] Using a 50 power refracting telescope that he designed himself, Huygens also discovered the first of Saturn's moons, Titan. In the same year he observed and sketched the Orion Nebula. His drawing, the first such known of the Orion nebula, was published in Systema Saturnium in 1659. Using his modern telescope he succeeded in subdividing the nebula into different stars. The brighter interior now bears the name of the Huygenian region in his honour. He also discovered several interstellar nebulae and some double stars.|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} analytical {{models are}} derived for {{the estimation of}} the temperature drop in the two deformation stages of radial-axial ring rolling process of <b>flat</b> <b>rings.</b> The temperature estimation, along with previous results regarding geometry, strain and strain rate, {{is used to calculate}} the variation of the flow stress of the material during the process and accordingly to derive the process forces, utilizing different forces estimation models already available in the literature...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a von Neumann regular ring is a ring R {{such that}} for every a in R there exists an x in R such that a = axa. To avoid the {{possible}} confusion with the regular rings and regular local rings of commutative algebra (which are unrelated notions), von Neumann regular rings are also called absolutely <b>flat</b> <b>rings,</b> because these rings are characterized {{by the fact that}} every left module is flat.|$|R

2500|$|The {{technique}} has an ancient {{tradition in the}} Near East, and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the Indus Valley civilization. The cylinder seal, whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the <b>flat</b> <b>ring</b> type developed, was the usual form in Mesopotamia, Assyria and other cultures, and spread to the Minoan world, including parts of Greece and Cyprus. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. [...] The Greek tradition emerged in Ancient Greek art under Minoan influence on mainland Helladic culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the Hellenistic period. Pre-Hellenic Ancient Egyptian seals tend to have inscriptions in hieroglyphs rather than images. The Biblical Book of Exodus describes {{the form of the}} hoshen, a ceremonial breastplate worn by the High Priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the Twelve tribes of Israel.|$|E
60|$|For instance, {{there was}} a bell found {{in one of the}} houses; but instead of being hollow, and having a clapper inside, as is the custom at the present day, it {{consisted}} simply of a large, <b>flat</b> <b>ring,</b> like a plate, with a hole through the centre of it. This ring was hung up by means of a short chain, and by the side of it there was hung a sort of hammer. To ring the bell it was necessary to strike it with this hammer. An attendant in the room did this while Mrs. Gray and Rollo were there, to let them hear how the bell sounded.|$|E
60|$|Wider and wilder he swung, now {{stretched}} out thin, like a rubber string, his quills lying hard and flat against his sides as the tree-tops separated in the wind; now jammed up against himself {{as they came}} together again, pressing him into a <b>flat</b> <b>ring</b> with spines sticking straight out, like a chestnut bur that has been stepped upon. And there he swayed for a full hour, till it grew {{too dark to see}} him, stretching, contracting, stretching, contracting, as if he were an accordion and the wind were playing him. His only note, meanwhile, was an occasional squealing grunt of satisfaction after some particularly good stretch, or when the motion changed and both trees rocked together in a wide, wild, exhilarating swing. Now and then the note was answered, farther down the ridge, by another porcupine going to sleep in his lofty cradle. A storm was coming; and Unk Wunk, {{who is one of the}} wood's best barometers to foretell the changing weather, was crying it aloud where all might hear.|$|E
40|$|Keigher {{showed that}} quasi-prime ideals in {{differential}} commutative rings are analogues of prime ideals in commutative rings. In that direction, he introduced and studied {{new types of}} differential rings using quasi-prime ideals of a differential ring. In the same sprit, we define and study two new types of differential rings which lead to the mirrors of the corresponding results on von Neumann regular <b>rings</b> and principally <b>flat</b> <b>rings</b> (PF-rings) in commutative rings, especially, for rings of positive characteristic...|$|R

50|$|The Ausco-Lambert brake has {{an unusual}} {{mechanism}} {{to expand the}} brake pads. It uses two <b>flat</b> <b>rings,</b> both with pad material {{on one side and}} conical divots on the other side. Two rings are placed together with the conical divots facing together and a ball bearing in each pair of divots. When the rings are rotated relative to each other, the balls roll up the ramp faces of the conical divots, pushing apart the two rings.|$|R

There is a <b>flat</b> <b>ring</b> to what you have said. However, of this I am sure: for some unaccountable reason you have been untrue to yourself to-day. Do not ask me, for, as I said before, I do not know where or how; yet I am none the less convinced. This I do know, you are not the Lucile I met by the wood trail across the river. That was the true Lucile, little though I saw of her. The woman who is here to-day is a strange woman. I do not know her. Sometimes it has seemed she was Lucile, but rarely. This woman has lied, lied to me, and lied to me about herself. As to what she said of the man, at the worst that is merely an opinion. It may be she has lied about him likewise. The chance is large that she has. What do you think about it?" ...|$|E

Also, the circular velocity of a test particle and its stability when performing circular orbits are presented in all these models. In general, we find that regions of non-stability appear between the rings when they become thinner. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
