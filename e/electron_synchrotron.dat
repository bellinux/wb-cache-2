5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron</b> at General Electric. This radiation was caused by the acceleration of electrons through a magnetic field as they moved near the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1945 {{he became}} Professor of Physics at the University of Melbourne vice Laby, a {{position}} he held until 1959. He built up a nuclear physics research school {{at a time when}} Australian universities were only just beginning to award PhDs, and most research students went abroad to pursue their studies. He attempted to equip it as best as his limited funds would allow. Wherever possible, equipment and parts were built by staff and students. His cosmic ray group participated in the 1947–48 Antarctic expedition of , and he designed and built a 200 kV neutron generator and a 1 MeV Van de Graaff generator. A 3 MeV betatron was converted an 18 MeV <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron</b> in 1948. A 5 to 12 MeV cyclotron was the largest machine built at the University up to that time. Design work began in 1953, and it commenced operation in 1957, running until 1976. Martin did not have the money to build it, but managed to scrounge funding and components from various sources. Although he was an experimental physicist, he created a theoretical physics group under Courtney Mohr. He also managed to persuade the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) to transfer CSIRAC, Australia's first digital electronic computer, to the School of Physics in 1955, creating the first academic computing facility in Australia, and the beginning of computer science at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

25|$|The {{school has}} been home to many {{different}} particle accelerators over the years. The first accelerator installed was a 1.25 MV Cockcroft-Walton known as HT1, this was in use from 1952 until 1967 when it was sold to the University of New South Wales. A second smaller 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton machine (HT2) was assembled in house using many spare parts acquired for HT1. In 1955 the UK government supplied a 33 MeV <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron</b> as a gift. It {{was moved to the}} University of Western Australia in 1961. During 1960–1980 a HVEC EN tandem accelerator was used by nuclear physics for light ion research. 1975 saw the school's 14UD accelerator come online, which has since been augmented with a superconducting linear accelerator.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Jentschke {{became an}} ordinarius Professor of Physics at the University of Hamburg. There, {{he found a}} {{positive}} climate, as well as funding, for his vision of building a new institute around a particle accelerator. An international particle accelerator conference at CERN in 1956 was helpful in the decision of which accelerator to build. His vision could not be supported by Hamburg alone, so negotiations took place to bring {{in support of the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the states of Germany (Länder). A financial agreement was signed on 18 December 1959, which founded the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), a 7.5 GeV <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron.</b> Jentschke was chairman of the DESY Board of Directors from 1959 to 1970, and for many years also the director of the Second Institute of Experimental Physics at the University of Hamburg.

500|$|Titterton was the Dean of the Research School of Physical Sciences from 1966 to 1968, and Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences from 1969 to 1973. He {{was also}} a member of the council of Macquarie University from 1978 to 1984. His goal was to build up the physics {{department}} at ANU into a world-class institution. When he heard that the 33 MeV <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron</b> at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern, Worcestershire, was to be closed down, he wrote to Cockcroft, now the director of the AERE, and asked if he could have it for the ANU. Cockcroft agreed, on condition that the ANU pay for it to be dismantled and shipped all the way to Australia. Titterton arranged for this to be done. The <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron</b> was installed in the basement of the Oliphant Building, where it became known as [...] "Ernie's erection".|$|E
500|$|A third accelerator, a 600 keV Cockcroft-Walton accelerator, was {{acquired}} in 1954. With Tony Brinkley, a researcher that he recruited in England, he studied photonuclear reactions with the Cockcroft-Walton accelerators, and bremsstrahlung, the radiation {{produced by the}} deceleration of a charged particle, with the <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron.</b> They {{were the first to}} observe ternary fission in Californium-252. A 5 MV terminal electrostatic nuclear (EN) tandem accelerator commenced operation in 1961. The <b>electron</b> <b>synchrotron</b> ceased operation that year, and was given to the University of Western Australia. He obtained $2.2 million in 1969 for new accelerators, with which he purchased a 26 MeV negative-ion cyclotron to inject into the EN tandem, which commenced operation in 1972, and a 14UD tandem accelerator that commenced operation in 1974. He became involved in some bruising bureaucratic battles. When the Australian and British governments jointly agreed to build the Anglo-Australian telescope in 1969, a dispute arose over whether it should be controlled by the ANU or its own management. Titterton supported the latter approach, which ultimately prevailed. But he lost a battle to prevent the [...] department of geophysics and geochemistry from becoming a new Research School of Earth Sciences.|$|E
