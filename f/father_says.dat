500|$|Soon after this, Jamie {{discovers that}} Dylan may be leaving the GQ {{position}} for another job {{before the year}} elapses on his contract, which would affect her commission. She confronts Dylan about this, which leads to another argument. Both begin to do some soul searching {{trying to come to}} terms with their feelings about their relationship. Jamie spends time with her mother, Lorna, while Dylan discusses it with Annie over the phone. His sister informs him that their father will be flying to Newark and he needs to be picked up at the airport. While at the airport, his father, in a moment of Alzheimer's-induced confusion, incorrectly recognizes a passer-by as a woman from his past. Dylan asks him about the woman. After regaining his lucidity, his <b>father</b> <b>says</b> that she was a woman he met in the Navy and [...] "the love of my life". He also states that he regrets decisions he made in his youth to let her go. Dylan's father tells him not to do the same thing, and to reconcile with Jamie if there is any chance of saving the relationship.|$|E

500|$|The New Testament {{served as}} the basis for many of the lyrics of [...] "Amazing Grace". The first verse, for example, {{can be traced to the}} story of the Prodigal Son. In the Gospel of Luke the <b>father</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found". The story of Jesus healing a blind man who tells the Pharisees that he can now see is told in the Gospel of John. Newton used the words [...] "I was blind but now I see" [...] and {{declared}} [...] "Oh to grace how great a debtor!" [...] in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752. The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation [...] "Amazing grace!", to be followed by a qualifying reply in [...] "how sweet the sound". In An Annotated Anthology of Hymns, Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called [...] "crude but effective" [...] in an overall composition that [...] "suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith". Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.|$|E
500|$|The Ozians are cheering at {{the news}} that the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba, is dead ("No One Mourns the Wicked"). Glinda arrives and an Ozian asks her if she and Elphaba were friends. She admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. She also tells them her name was Galinda before she changed it. A {{flashback}} starts with a scene in a school, Shiz, where Elphaba arrives. Elphaba was the daughter of the governor of Munchkinland - but it is heavily implied that she is the product of an affair between the governor's wife and a mysterious stranger and his bottle of [...] "green elixir." [...] Elphaba was born with green skin as a result. Her father despised her and showered his affection on her younger sister, Nessarose, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair. The two sisters both go to Shiz University, where the pretty and popular Galinda is also in their class ("Dear Old Shiz"). As their <b>father</b> <b>says</b> goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of silver slippers. The headmistress, Madame Morrible, decides to take Nessarose under her protection, despite Elphaba's objections, now without a roommate and ends up with Galinda, to the disgust of both. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister as she is wheeled away, and her frustration manifests itself physically in an explosion. Madame Morrible recognizes that she has special powers and decides to teach her sorcery - and to teach no one else, even though Galinda had her heart set on studying magic at school. She even tells Elphaba that her powers might allow her to work with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, something which Elphaba has dreamed of ("The Wizard and I").|$|E

2500|$|Cultural {{historian}} Linda Williams {{notes that}} [...] "The Jazz Singer represents the triumphs of the assimilating son over the old-world father … and present impediments to an assimilating show-biz success.... when Jakie's <b>father</b> <b>says,</b> 'Stop', {{the flow of}} [...] "jazz" [...] music (and spontaneous speech) freezes. But the Jewish mother recognizes the virtue {{of the old world}} in the new and the music flows again." [...] According to film historian Robert Carringer, even the father eventually comes to understand that his son's jazz singing is [...] "fundamentally an ancient religious impulse seeking expression in a modern, popular form." [...] Or as the film itself states in its first title card, [...] "perhaps this plaintive, wailing song of jazz is, after all, the misunderstood utterance of a prayer." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to William Gazecki {{and other}} critics, the prosecutor's office was spurred {{to lay the}} {{heaviest}} possible charges by the victim's father, an LAPD police officer; and says that if the victim {{had not been a}} police officer's son the felony murder rule would never have been applied. [...] In a CBS 60 Minutes II segment, a spokesman for the defendants' families charges that the boys were punished not for what they did, but for who was killed. [...] The spokesman says, [...] "It's about a police officer's son who died. [...] And the only way they could convict all these kids was use the felony murder rule." [...] James Farris Sr., the victim's <b>father,</b> <b>says</b> [...] "The fact that I'm a policeman {{has nothing to do with}} anything. I just happen to be a policeman whose son was murdered. That's it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inappropriately titled as {{translated}} by Georg D. Schade (in [...] "the Burning Plain and Other Stories) ,since the Spanish {{refers to a}} father's anger with his son for not having helped him hear the dogs, which were, indeed, barking." [...] The story opens with a father’s request that his son Ignacio tell him if he can’t hear anything or see any lights in the distance: “You up there, Ignacio! Don’t you hear something or see a light somewhere?” Ignacio responds that he does not, and the <b>father</b> <b>says</b> {{that they must be}} getting close" [...] about a man carrying his estranged, adult, wounded son on his back to find a doctor.

In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother Freyr, when all of the other laughing gods surprised her, Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. Njörðr (Freyja and Freyr's <b>father)</b> <b>says</b> that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or [...] "someone else" [...] beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a [...] "pervert god coming here who has borne children." ...|$|E

[...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I {{was going to have to}} try to take care of my mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time and I was going to have to box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E

At that moment, Randy finally produces a bowel movement so large it lifts him several feet off the toilet seat and is estimated to weigh more than 100 courics.

Still, he does often question his brother only to have his faith in Charlie's abilities restored. In [...] "Burn Rate", their <b>father</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "But have you ever known your brother to let his emotions trump his math?"
