5|$|The Russian {{position}} at Borodino {{consisted of a}} series of disconnected earthworks running <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> from the Moskva River on the right, along its tributary, the Kolocha (whose steep banks added to the defense), and towards the village of Utitsa on the left. Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center (on the French side of the Kolocha) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult, aiding the defenders. The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt, a massive open-backed earthwork mounting nineteen 12-pounder cannons which had a clear field of fire {{all the way to the}} banks of the Kolocha stream.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Republic of Kosovo {{was adopted}} by the Assembly of Kosovo {{immediately}} following the declaration of independence of Kosovo from Serbia on 17 February 2008. The flag is the result of an international design competition, organised by the United Nations-backed Kosovo Unity Team, which attracted almost one thousand entries. The now-used design was proposed by by Muhamer Ibrahimi. It shows six white stars <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> above a golden map of Kosovo on a blue field. The stars symbolise Kosovo's six major ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. There were {{only a small number of}} defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It was as close as the Allies ever came to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E

5|$|The school's {{residential}} {{village is}} composed of five residence halls located {{along the edges of}} the lake. There are two men's dormitories (Oak Hill and Red Hill) and three women's dormitories (Mount Vernon, Monticello, and Montpelier). The four smaller dormitories opened in 2001, while the largest residence hall, Red Hill, opened in 2003. In addition to student housing, Red Hill also contains three classrooms and an office suite on its basement level. Located in the basement of Mount Vernon is an auditorium referred to as Town Hall, where the school's daily chapel sessions and other special events are held. The residence halls are set up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> shape around the lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{population}} {{is thought to}} have once been 150,000 to 300,000, stretching <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> across the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central Baja California Peninsula in Mexico. The fur trade that began in the 1740s reduced the sea otter's numbers to an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 members in 13 colonies. In about two-thirds of its former range, the species is at varying levels of recovery, with high population densities in some areas and threatened populations in others. Sea otters currently have stable populations in parts of the Russian east coast, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California, with reports of recolonizations in Mexico and Japan. Population estimates made between 2004 and 2007 give a worldwide total of approximately 107,000 sea otters.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E

5|$|Old Business Spur I-96 (Old BS I-96) is {{the section}} of Grand River Avenue in Detroit between I-96 and the {{intersection}} with Cass Avenue and Middle Street in downtown Detroit and an unsigned state trunkline highway. It was previously a business spur of I-96. Picking up where M-5 ends at the interchange with I-96, Old BS I-96 follows Grand River Avenue southeasterly. The road itself is bounded by businesses as it passes through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's West Side. About a mile and three-quarters (2.8km) along, the highway crosses I-96 again, and I-96 from here into the downtown area parallels Grand River Avenue. Old BS I-96 here is mostly residential. It passes Bishop Park near Grand Boulevard and then crosses I-94. In the North Corktown neighborhood, Grand River Avenue crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MotorCity Casino. About a half mile (0.7km) past M-10, Old BS I-96 crosses I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and enters Downtown Detroit's Foxtown neighborhood. State maintenance ends at the five-way intersection between Grand River Avenue, Cass Avenue, and Middle Street. Grand River Avenue continues another five blocks to Woodward Avenue and another four blocks as it curves <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> around Grand Circus Park.|$|E

25|$|In hunting, Salticidae {{also use}} their silk for a tether {{to enable them}} to reach prey that {{otherwise}} would be inaccessible. For example, by advancing towards the prey to less than the jumping distance, then retreating and leaping <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> {{at the end of the}} tether line, many species can leap onto prey on vertical or even on inverted surfaces, which of course in a gravitational field would not be possible without such a tether.|$|E

In this species, the mobbing call is smoothly upsweeping, and is made when swooping down <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> beside the predator. This call was also heard during agonistic behavior interactions with conspecifics, and may serve additionally or alternatively as an alarm call to their mate.|$|E

25|$|Income {{inequality}} in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s after several decades of stability, meaning {{the share of}} the nation's income received by higher income households has increased. This trend is evident with income measured both before taxes (market income) as well as after taxes and transfer payments. Income inequality has fluctuated considerably since measurements began around 1915, moving <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>arc</b> between peaks in the 1920s and 2000s, with a 30-year period of relatively lower inequality between 1950–1980.|$|E
25|$|Analog meters {{are also}} useful where {{the trend of}} a {{measurement}} {{is more important than}} an exact value obtained at a particular moment.
