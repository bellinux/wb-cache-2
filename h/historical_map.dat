40|$|Abstract: <b>Historical</b> <b>maps</b> are {{precious}} materials, {{which show}} {{spatial distribution of}} land use, streets and so on {{at the time the}} maps were produced. However, the imprecision, in the geometrical sense, of the <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> makes the task of comparison very difficult. This drawback brings us to the idea of incorporating the <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> into GIS after rubber-sheet transformation, i. e. geometric correction, of them. It makes possible comparing and overlaying multiple maps from different time periods. Furthermore, it gives map-scales to the <b>historical</b> <b>maps,</b> and it will make possible overlaying of present contour lines on the <b>historical</b> <b>maps.</b> As a result, we can bring the viewpoints of quantitative consideration and three-dimensional visualization into analys is of <b>historical</b> <b>maps.</b> This paper shows the outline of our procedures and some applications, e. g., overlaying different maps from Edo period to present, quantitative analysis of land use in Edo, and visualization of landscape of Edo...|$|R

Korea, at the time under the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), was closely integrated into the Mongol Empire as a quda (son-in-law) state. One supporting fact is recorded in the Goryeo-sa: Na Heung-yu (羅興儒) created a <b>historical</b> <b>map</b> based on maps of China and Korea, and dedicated it to King Gongmin (r. 1352-1374).

25|$|Josip Lučić and Franjo Šanjek's 1993 Hrvatski povijesni zemljovid (Croatian <b>historical</b> <b>map)</b> {{provided}} an extended depiction of Tomislav's kingdom. Lučić was a known historical geographer from the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb who authored numerous maps in Croatian history books. Ivo Goldstein in turn argued in his 1995 book Hrvatski rani srednji vijek that Tomislav made no crucial expansion deeper into inner Bosnia {{and that he}} incorporated only parts of Pannonia to the Kingdom of Croatia, not the whole area between Drava and Sava, which was according to him Terra nullius. Neven Budak is in full agreement with Goldstein regarding {{the status of the}} Drava-Sava area, arguing that the northern Croatian border most likely passed through the wider Sisak area. Dominant modern university history textbooks in Croatia such as Tomislav Raukar's Hrvatsko srednjovjekovlje (1997) consider that during Tomislav's rule his kingdom covered between 60% to 80% of contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina. Franjo Šanjek also edited a major work by sixteen authors on the medieval Croatian state, which is also used as a university textbook also includes such a view.|$|E

40|$|<b>Historical</b> <b>maps</b> are {{precious}} materials, {{which show}} various {{spatial distribution of}} land use, streets and so on of the historical importance {{at the time the}} maps were produced. They may be a dependable source of information regarding concepts of city planning of the past. In analysis of <b>historical</b> <b>maps,</b> the most practical method is to compare them with the present ones, for instance, by overlaying them. However, the low precision, in the geometrical sense, of the <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> makes the task of comparison very difficult. It is important to point out here that research on rubber sheeting, that is, geometric correction of maps for conflation of maps from different sources has recently made much progress. Using these procedures, geometric correction of <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> should become possible. We address applied research on such an incorporation of <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> into GIS. We performed rubbersheeting of some <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> to present map coordinate system in Japan by using the piecewise geometric transformation based on TIN and planar affine transformation. We can produce the bird's-eye view of old city by relating <b>historical</b> <b>maps</b> with the digital elevation model. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce landscape in old city from any viewpoint and any direction and to explore the past concepts of city planning and urban developments. Age-old <b>historical</b> <b>maps,</b> as well as present maps and geo-information, can be important elements of GIS if they are geometrically corrected to the present coordinate system. 1...|$|R
