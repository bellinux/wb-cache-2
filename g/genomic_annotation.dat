5000|$|The main {{approach}} to manual gene annotation is to annotate transcripts aligned to the genome {{and take the}} genomic sequences as the reference rather than the cDNAs. The finished genomic sequence is analyzed using a modified Ensembl pipeline, and BLAST results of cDNAs/ESTs and proteins, along with various ab initio predictions, can be analyzed manually in the annotation browser tool Otterlace. Thus, more alternative spliced variants can be predicted compared with cDNA annotation. Moreover, <b>genomic</b> <b>annotation</b> produces a more comprehensive analysis of pseudogenes.There are several analysis groups in the GENCODE consortium that run pipelines that aid the manual annotators in producing models in unannotated regions, and to identify potential missed or incorrect manual annotation, including completely missing loci, missing alternative isoforms, incorrect splice sites and incorrect biotypes. These are fed back to the manual annotators using the AnnoTrack tracking system. Some of these pipelines use data from other ENCODE subgroups including RNASeq data, histone modification and CAGE and Ditag data. RNAseq data is an important new source of evidence, but generating complete gene models from {{it is a difficult}} problem. As part of GENCODE, a competition was run to assess the quality of predictions produced by various RNAseq prediction pipelines (Refer to RGASP below). To confirm uncertain models, GENCODE also has an experimental validation pipeline using RNA sequencing and RACE ...|$|E

40|$|Genome-­‐wide {{association}} {{studies have}} been used extensively to study hundreds of phenotypes and have determined thousands of associated SNPs whose underlying biology and causation is as yet largely unknown. Many previous studies attempted to clarify the causal biology by investigating overlaps of trait-­‐ associated variants with functional annotations, but lacked statistical rigor and examined incomplete subsets of available functional annotations. Additionally, it {{has been difficult to}} disentangle the relative contributions of different annotations that may show strong correlations with one another. In this thesis, we address these shortcomings and strengthen and extend the obtained results. Two methods, permutations and logistic regression, are applied in statistically rigorous analyses of <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> and their observed enrichment or depletion of trait-­‐associated SNPs. The <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> range from genic regions and regulatory features to measures of conservation and aspects of chromatin structure. Logistic regressions in a number of trait-­‐specific subsets identify <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> influencing SNPs associated with both normal variation (e. g., eye or hair colour) and diseases, suggesting some generalities in the biological underpinnings of phenotypes. SNPs associated with phenotypes of the immune system are investigated and the results highlight the distinct aetiology for this subset. Despite the heterogeneity of the studied cancers, SNPs associated to different cancers are particularly enriched for conserved regions, unlike all other trait-­‐subsets. Nonetheless, chromatin states are, perhaps surprisingly, among the most influential <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> in all trait-­‐ subsets. Evolutionary conserved regions are rarely within the top <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> despite their widespread use in prioritisation methods for follow-­‐ up studies. We identify a common set of enriched or depleted <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> that significantly influence all traits, but also highlight trait-­‐specific differences. These annotations may be used for the computational prioritisation of variants implicated in phenotypes of interest.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} availability of functional genomic data, incorporating <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> into genetic association analysis {{has become a}} standard procedure. However, the existing methods often lack rigor and/or computational efficiency and consequently do not maximize the utility of functional annotations. In this paper, we propose a rigorous inference procedure to perform integrative association analysis incorporating <b>genomic</b> <b>annotations</b> for both traditional GWASs and emerging molecular QTL mapping studies. In particular, we propose an algorithm, named deterministic approximation of posteriors (DAP), which enables highly efficient and accurate joint enrichment analysis and identification of multiple causal variants. We use a series of simulation studies to highlight the power and computational efficiency of our proposed approach and further demonstrate it by analyzing the cross-population eQTL data from the GEUVADIS project and the multi-tissue eQTL data from the GTEx project. In particular, we find that genetic variants predicted to disrupt transcription factor binding sites are enriched in cis-eQTLs across all tissues. Moreover, the enrichment estimates obtained across the tissues are correlated with the cell types for which the annotations are derived...|$|R
40|$|The {{completion}} of the Drosophila melanogaster genome marks another significant milestone in growth of sequence information. But it also contributes to the ever widening gap between sequence information and biological knowledge. One important approach to reducing this gap is theoretical inference through computational technologies. Multitude of computer programs {{have been designed to}} annotate genomic sequence information with biologically relevant information. Here, I suggest that all of these methods have a common structure where the sequence fragments are "coordinatized" by some description method such as Hidden Markov Models. The key to the algorithms lies in constructing the most efficient set of coordinates that allow extrapolation and interpolation from existing knowledge. Efficient extrapolation and interpolation is produced if the sequence fragments acquire a natural geometrical structure in the coordinatized description. Finding such a coordinate frame is an inductive problem with no algorithmic solution.

40|$|Background: The {{advent of}} rapid {{evolution}} on sequencing capacity of new genomes has evidenced {{the need for}} data analysis automation aiming at speeding up the <b>genomic</b> <b>annotation</b> process and reducing its cost. Given that one important step for functional <b>genomic</b> <b>annotation</b> is the promoter identification, several studies have been taken in order to propose computational approaches to predict promoters. Different classifiers and characteristics of the promoter sequences {{have been used to}} deal with this prediction problem. However, several works in literature have addressed the promoter prediction problem using datasets containing sequences of 250 nucleotides or more. As the sequence length defines the amount of dataset attributes, even considering a limited number of properties to characterize the sequences, datasets with a high number of attributes are generated for training classifiers. Once high-dimensional datasets can degrade the classifiers predictive performance or even require an infeasible processing time, predicting promoters by training classifiers from datasets with a reduced number of attributes, it is essential to obtain good predictive performance with low computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work in literature that verified in a systematic way the relation between the sequences length and the predictive performance of classifiers. Thus, in this work, we have evaluated the impact of sequence length variation and training dataset size (number of sequences) on the predictive performance of classifiers...|$|E

40|$|A {{wealth of}} {{information}} and technologies are currently available for the genome-wide investigation of many types of biological phenomena. <b>Genomic</b> <b>annotation</b> databases provide information about the DNA sequence of a particular organism and give locations {{of different types of}} genomic elements, such as the exons and introns of genes. Microarrays are a powerful type of technology that make use of DNA sequence information to investigate different types of biological phenomena on a genome-wide level. Tiling arrays are a unique type of microarray that provide unbiased, high-density coverage of a genomic region, making them well suited for many applications, such as the mapping of transcription and the profiling of epigenetic mechanisms that can occur anywhere in the genome. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, are important for understanding heritable changes in genome function that cannot be explained by a change in the DNA sequence alone. ^ In this work, statistical approaches for both gene expression and DNA methylation tiling array data are investigated. The proposed methods take advantage of the <b>genomic</b> <b>annotation</b> that are available and that to date have not been effectively utilized in current statistical methods. For gene expression data, an initial bioinformatic step, prior to differential expression analysis, is proposed for the purpose of filtering out probes that are biologically irrelevant. For DNA methylation data, a hidden Markov model, which allows for different transition probabilities between gene and intergenic regions is developed in an effort to improve the predicted locations of DNA methylation across the genome. These methods are investigated through simulation studies and real data analyses. ...|$|E
