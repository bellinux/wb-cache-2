5|$|When {{it came to}} leisure, {{the area}} {{surrounding}} Loring offered many options. Many recreation areas and campgrounds were located {{in and around the}} base region, with some being as far as two <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> The Morale Welfare and Recreation center offered equipment for these outings, including fishbait and tackle, as well as boat rentals. Loring's bowling center was twenty-two lanes, {{and one of the most}} modern in the area. Finally, the base library loaned books to both residents and students alike.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, showers {{increased}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, a swirl of clouds remained {{for a couple of}} days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

50|$|Should the {{sea levels}} rise by 60 m, Walsh is not located {{close enough to}} salt water to be {{affected}} directly by flooding. However, it would suffer indirectly from droughts due to the displacement of available fresh water resources {{and would have to}} rely on desalinated salt water piped in from <b>hundreds</b> of <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Many major cities near salt water already pipe in their water from fresh water sources <b>hundreds</b> of <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> like Los Angeles; which is located {{in the middle of a}} desert.|$|R
25|$|On July 11, Douglas {{and other}} Phelps Dodge {{corporate}} executives met with Cochise County Sheriff Harry Wheeler to conspire to seize, {{by force of}} arms, all the striking workers, forcibly transport (deport) them several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Bisbee, and abandon them in another desert town without food, clothing or funds. To this end, Sheriff Wheeler recruited and deputized 2,200 men from Bisbee and {{the nearby town of}} Douglas to act as a posse. Phelps Dodge officials also met with executives of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, who agreed to provide rail transportation for any deportees. Phelps Dodge and the other employers provided Sheriff Wheeler with {{a list of all the}} men on strike, as well as suspected IWW sympathizers.|$|E
500|$|The site {{contains}} a colonnade that Lekson, Windes, and Fournier describe as [...] "prominent, even dominating within the plaza", and [...] "possibly the defining form at Chetro Ketl or even at Chaco." [...] It {{is not only}} unique to Chaco Canyon, but also to Ancestral Puebloan architecture as a whole. The nearest similar structure is located more than five <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> at Casas Grandes, in northwestern Mexico. Constructed sometime after 1105, the plaza-facing columns were among the last additions to Chetro Ketl. The colonnade's placement and orientation to the canyon indicate that {{it was intended to}} be viewed from inside the building. It was later filled in with masonry to accommodate additional living space. It was [...] long and contained thirteen columns.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{official}} biographers also state that, {{during his}} childhood in Montana, he was befriended by [...] "Old Tom", a medicine man from the Native American Blackfeet tribe. He is also purported to have become, at six years old, [...] "one of the few whites ever admitted into Blackfoot society as a bona fide blood brother". This has been disputed by his unofficial biographers. Jon Atack notes that the Blackfoot reservation was over a <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Helena. A Los Angeles Times investigation in 1990 reported that [...] "Old Tom" [...] was not listed in a 1907 register of the Blackfeet and that the tribe did not practice blood brotherhood. Although the Church of Scientology states that Hubbard was awarded blood brotherhood [...] "in a ceremony that is still recalled by tribal elders", a Scientologist of fractional Blackfoot ancestry sought during the mid-1980s to prove that Hubbard had been a Blackfoot blood brother but was unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|Big Stink {{spotted the}} {{explosion}} from a <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> and flew over to observe. Because of the {{delays in the}} mission and the inoperative fuel transfer pump, Bockscar did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency landing field at Iwo Jima, so Sweeney and Bock flew to Okinawa. Arriving there, Sweeney circled for 20 minutes trying to contact the control tower for landing clearance, finally concluding that his radio was faulty. Critically low on fuel, Bockscar barely {{made it to the}} runway on Okinawa's Yontan Airfield. With enough fuel for only one landing attempt, Sweeney and Albury brought Bockscar in at [...] instead of the normal , firing distress flares to alert the field of the uncleared landing. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as Bockscar began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. The B-29's reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, Bockscar made a swerving 90-degree turn {{at the end of the}} runway to avoid running off it. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the plane came to a stop. The flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total remained.|$|E
500|$|The hope {{of finding}} these lost papers led Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka of the U.S. Army to organise an {{expedition}} to the island between 1878 and 1880. Traveling to Hudson Bay on the schooner Eothen, Schwatka, assembling a team that included Inuit who had assisted Hall, continued north by foot and dog sled, interviewing Inuit, visiting known or likely sites of Franklin expedition remains, and wintering on King William Island. Though Schwatka failed to find the hoped-for papers, in a speech at a dinner given in his honour by the American Geographical Society in 1880, he noted that his expedition had made [...] "the longest sledge journey ever made both in regard to time and distance" [...] of 11 months and 4 days and , {{that it was the}} first Arctic expedition on which the whites relied entirely on the same diet as the Inuit, and that it established the loss of the Franklin records [...] "beyond all reasonable doubt". The Schwatka expedition found no remnants of the expedition south of a place known as Starvation Cove on the Adelaide Peninsula. This was well north of Crozier's stated goal, the Back River, and several <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from the nearest Western outpost, on the Great Slave Lake. Woodman wrote of Inuit reports that between 1852 and 1858 Crozier and one other expedition member were seen in the Baker Lake area, about [...] to the south, where in 1948 Farley Mowat found [...] "a very ancient cairn, not of normal Eskimo construction" [...] inside which were shreds of a hardwood box with dovetail joints.|$|E
2500|$|His son by {{a sister}} of Chief Red Grizzly Bear, Tzi-Kal-Tza/Halahtookit Clark, was alive in 1866; his image was {{recorded}} in a photo taken that year. [...] "Oral history says that this man called himself 'Clark', that he was captured {{at the end of}} the Nez Perce Indian war of 1877, and that he died of malaria fifteen <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from home. There are many gaps in the story of Clark's Nez Perce son, many questions for which historians will never find answers." [...] Clark also served as a guardian to Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the son of Sacagawea and Toussaint Charbonneau.|$|E

2500|$|Several days {{following}} the incident, US Commissioner of Indian Affairs William A. Jones negotiated with Pillager leaders in a council held at the Leech Lake Reservation from October 10–5. After the council concluded, Commissioner Jones criticized local and state officials for [...] "the frequent arrests of Indians on trivial causes, often for no cause at all, taking them down to Duluth and Minneapolis for trial, two <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from their agency, and then turning them adrift without means to return home".

After three days sailing, they landed, presumably in Britain, and apparently all left the ship, walking for 28 days in a [...] "wilderness", becoming faint from hunger. [...] After Patrick prayed for sustenance, they encountered a herd of wild boar; since this was shortly after Patrick had urged them to put their faith in God, his prestige in the group was greatly increased. After various adventures, he returned home to his family, now in his early twenties. After returning home to Britain, Saint Patrick continued to study Christianity.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in 1801, McGready {{characterized}} the revivals {{of the previous}} summer and fall as “the most glorious time that our guilty eyes have ever beheld." [...] Less narrative and descriptive than McGee’s, McGready’s accounts focused on the chronological unfolding of events. [...] McGready’s Calvinist beliefs prevented him from pronouncing with certainty that a person had been converted; he believed that only God knew for sure, but he made attempts, judging by the evidence at hand, to count the conversions {{that began in the}} summer sacraments of 1800. [...] The numbers showed an accumulating and broadening effect: [...] In June at Red River, ten were converted; in July at Gasper River, 45, as well as some Tennessee youths who returned home and encouraged the experience of “real religion” among twenty of their friends and neighbors. [...] The Gasper River event hosted people from as distant as one <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> [...] Thirteen wagons were employed to transport people and supplies, and the excitement was so great that some stayed at the meeting house through the night. [...] In early August, on a Sunday church service at Red River, several black people and children were affected. [...] Later that month, twenty-two wagons arrived at the Muddy River sacrament with more than fifty converted throughout the multi-day observance.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{insisted that}} Burbank paint four portraits of him. After {{the first one}} was finished, Blue Horse's {{daughter}} Lizzie Blue Horse was very ill and Blue Horse asked Burbank to his house to see her. Burbank found the girl lying on a pile of blankets dying of consumption and did what he could to comfort her and proposed getting a doctor the next day. But in the morning Blue Horse rode in and said that his daughter had died during the night. As soon as the body was buried, Blue Horse had the house torn down. Blue Horse told Burbank that he would go to a place one hundred miles distant to visit with some other Indians and forget his troubles. Blue Horse asked Burbank to lend him seven dollars to buy calico for one of his daughter’s good friends. Burbank told him that he was too poor to buy calico for other people. “Look here, my friend,” said Blue Horse, “I want that calico to give to my daughter’s friend so that my daughter will be happier in heaven. If you will lend me the money I will pay you by posing for you." [...] Burbank agreed and handed him the seven dollars. Blue Horse said his heart was sick and that {{he wanted to go to}} Rosebud, about a <b>hundred</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> where he could see a different country and new faces that would help him to forget as much as possible his grief. Blue Horse pointed to the position of the sun at nine o’clock in the morning. “In one moon I return,” and with his thumb and forefinger Blue Horse made a circle to indicate the sun. Blue Horse returned exactly when he said he would and found Burbank painting the portrait of another subject. The old man pointed his finger at Burbank accusingly. “You lie,” he said. Burbank asked him why. “You promised to finish my picture when I came back.” Burbank explained that he could not wait but that as soon as he had finished the portrait he was working on he would resume his picture. This satisfied Blue Horse, and Burbank painted three more portraits of him.|$|E
