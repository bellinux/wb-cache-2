5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the <b>farming</b> <b>industry</b> supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster <b>farming</b> <b>industry</b> in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{flooding}} disrupted the livelihoods of about 700,000residents; most of the storm's damage affected people's jobs, including <b>farming,</b> <b>industry,</b> and commerce, totaling $557.3million in damages. About 76% of the overall {{effects of the}} flooding {{were the result of}} disruption of people's jobs. Overall damage was estimated at $874.8million, although residual losses from damaged infrastructure were estimated to cost an additional $726.9million. The overall economic impact of the storm was therefore estimated at $1.638billion, equating to roughly 6% of the country's gross domestic product. Damage was heaviest in Hadhramaut Governorate, accounting for 67.5% of the material damages, and occurred mostly along the coast; 16 of the 19districts in the governorate reported damage. Also in Hadramaut, there were 57people injured due to the storm. The government sent search and rescue teams into the flooded areas to help stranded residents, although strong winds in the region disrupted these efforts in the immediate aftermath. In Seiyun, six soldiers died while attempting to rescue trapped residents. Lightning strikes killed six people.|$|E

30|$|The wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry</b> {{has emerged}} within a {{relatively}} short period of time. The first commercial onshore wind farms were established at the beginning of the 1970 s (Madsen et al. 2012). The requirements for equipment and effective and efficient processes in the offshore wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry</b> are markedly enhanced due to the harsh environmental, wind and water conditions. A dominant design has not yet emerged. New and different challenges arise offshore compared with onshore for wind farms. Offshore wind <b>farm</b> <b>industries,</b> in general, pursue larger investments with extended risks of operation (Crown 2012). These issues put pressure on the offshore wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry</b> to collaborate for innovation to reduce LCOEs. They also put pressure on governmental bodies to create infrastructure, e.g. transmission grids, suitable harbours and roads for transportation. In the same way, universities are encouraged to develop new knowledge of new solutions, both technically and commercially.|$|R

30|$|The {{implication}} for {{the university}} is to create both more researched-based learning for abstraction in new models applicable in the offshore wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry</b> and to achieve a thorough understanding and communication of important business details specific to the SME suppliers and the wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry.</b> For the governmental bodies/EU, the implication is to provide more strategic long-term financing {{for the creation of}} knowledge spaces, which will have some immediate impact but will probably need a long-term view for utilising the full potential. Moreover, the governmental bodies have a direct impact on the cost of capital within offshore wind parks and the regulation of competition, cooperation and collaboration. For the SME suppliers in the wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry,</b> the implication is to become {{aware of the importance of}} knowledge spaces and the need to prioritise time for reflection on information and knowledge. For essential larger stakeholders in the wind <b>farm</b> <b>industry,</b> the implication is to prioritise time for providing knowledge to various SME suppliers to give them a chance to work on innovation and reduction in LCOEs in collaboration.|$|R

From this point on, attempts at large-scale drainage of Martin Mere and other marshland continued until the 19th century, since when the water has been pumped away. This left behind a legacy of fine agricultural soil and created a booming <b>farming</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

However, the nets eventually succumb to biofouling. Antifouling coatings containing cuprous oxide algaecide/biocide are the coatings technology used almost exclusively in the fish <b>farming</b> <b>industry</b> today.

25|$|Rising {{demand for}} {{biofuels}} {{is expected to}} be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the Department of Energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. <b>farming</b> <b>industry</b> to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm productivity, biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met.|$|E

Christmas trees are also vulnerable to fungal pathogens, resulting in such illnesses as root rot, and, in California, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia sudden oak death. Douglas-fir trees are especially vulnerable to infections from plant pathogens such as R. pseudotsugae and Rhabdocline weirii; R. weirii affects only Douglas-fir trees.

25|$|White {{concludes with}} a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many {{thousands}} of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east–west axis, and proved highly valuable for {{the nation as a}} whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of actual demand. The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered <b>farming,</b> <b>industry</b> and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.|$|E
25|$|Salmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal {{produced}} from catching other wild {{fish and other}} marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and farmed salmon consume more fish than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of farmed salmon, products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the salmon <b>farming</b> <b>industry</b> expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, {{at a time when}} 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.|$|E
