5000|$|Emulsion {{polymerization}} {{is a type}} {{of radical}} polymerization that usually starts with an emulsion incorporating water, monomer, and surfactant. The most common type of emulsion polymerization is an oil-in-water emulsion, in which droplets of monomer (the oil) are emulsified (with surfactants) in a continuous phase of water. Water-soluble polymers, such as certain polyvinyl alcohols or <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>celluloses,</b> {{can also be used to}} act as emulsifiers/stabilizers. The name [...] "emulsion polymerization" [...] is a misnomer that arises from a historical misconception. Rather than occurring in emulsion droplets, polymerization takes place in the latex particles that form spontaneously in the first few minutes of the process. These latex particles are typically 100 nm in size, and are made of many individual polymer chains. The particles are stopped from coagulating with each other because each particle is surrounded by the surfactant ('soap'); the charge on the surfactant repels other particles electrostatically. When water-soluble polymers are used as stabilizers instead of soap, the repulsion between particles arises because these water-soluble polymers form a 'hairy layer' around a particle that repels other particles, because pushing particles together would involve compressing these chains.|$|R

The hydroxyl groups of HEC-AAO composite membrane were further modified with 1, 4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether to link arginine as an affinity ligand. The contents of HEC and arginine of arginine-immobilized HEC-AAO membrane were 52. 1 and 19. 7 mg/g membrane, respectively. As biomedical adsorbents, the arginine-immobilized HEC-AAO membranes were tested for bilirubin removal. The non-specific bilirubin adsorption on the unmodified HEC-AAO composite membranes was 0. 8 mg/g membrane. Higher bilirubin adsorption values, up to 52. 6 mg/g membrane, were obtained with the arginine-immobilized HEC-AAO membranes. Elution of bilirubin showed desorption ratio was up to 85 % using 0. 3 M NaSCN solution as the desorption agent. Comparisons equilibrium and dynamic capacities showed that dynamic capacities were lower than the equilibrium capacities. In addition, the adsorption mechanism of bilirubin {{and the effects of}} temperature, initial concentration of bilirubin, albumin concentration and ionic strength on adsorption were also investigated.

The adsorbed amount of LM- 200 is found to be considerably larger than adsorbed amounts of other polymers. The rate of adsorption for the LM- 200 is also lower than that for the Polymer JR series under comparable conditions. Electrostatic interaction is found to be the major driving force for the adsorption. The effect of SDS on adsorption was studied under two different conditions: adsorption of polymer/SDS complexes from premixed solutions and additions of SDS to the preadsorbed polymer layers. In all cases, associative binding of the surfactant to the polymer seems to control interfacial behavior, which depends on the surfactant concentration. Maximum adsorption was obtained at the surfactant concentration below the phase separation region, and the complex desorbed from the surface at a high SDS concentration above the critical micelle concentration. The reversibility of the polymer/SDS complexes adsorption upon rinsing with NaCl solutions was also investigated. When the premixed polymer/SDS solutions at high SDS concentrations (> 5 mM) were diluted by salt solutions, the adsorbed amount increased sharply with precipitation of the complex. A larger amount of the JR- 400 /SDS complex precipitated during the rinsing process seemed to adsorb to a larger extent to silica than the corresponding LM- 200 /SDS complex...|$|R
40|$|Rheology {{modifiers}} {{are used}} in paints and coatings to ease their application to a surface, prevent sagging once applied, and allow the leveling of brushstrokes, among other benefits. The early rheology modifiers were <b>hydroxyethyl</b> <b>celluloses</b> (HECs), a type of non-associative thickener that is relatively inexpensive and synthesized from cellulose, which is abundant. However, coatings that are modified with HECs tend to suffer from poor leveling and syneresis (phase separation). HECs have since been replaced with associative thickeners (ATs). These thickeners, when properly formulated, produce stable dispersions that have improved rheological properties, yet, unlike HECs, are sensitive to changes to the coating formulation. This drawback has encouraged research that attempts to predict the phase behavior and rheology of systems that are modified with ATs. This work {{is concerned with the}} phase behavior and rheology of waterborne latex / hydrophobically-modified ethoxylated urethane (HEUR) AT systems. When latex volume fraction is held constant, the amount of HEUR (and surfactant) in the mixture determines whether the system experiences syneresis. Dispersion phase diagrams (DPDs) of such systems have been previously studied, but the rheology of the mixtures used to prepare the DPDs have not been studied in any detail. A study on the rheology of phase separated latex / HEUR mixtures that were prepared with commercial materials was done at Cal Poly and showed a correlation between syneresis and complex rheology. However, a proper analysis was limited because the compositions and chemical structures of the commercial materials were not well known. To better understand the relationships between phase behavior and rheology, waterborne latex / HEUR mixtures were prepared from latex and HEURs that were made at Cal Poly. Three series of mixtures were studied: commercial latex / commercial HEUR (I), commercial latex / Cal Poly HEUR (II), and Cal Poly latex / Cal Poly HEUR (III). The latex volume fraction was held constant at 0. 25 and the concentration of HEUR was varied from 0 – 2. 0 wt%. Mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for 7 days, syneresis was measured on day 7, and steady-state viscosities over a shear rate range of 0. 01 – 1000 s- 1 were determined on days 7 – 9 with a DHR- 2 rheometer (TA Instruments) that was outfitted with 40 mm, 2 o cone. The mixtures were also studied by microscopy and dynamic oscillatory testing. The chemical structures of the Cal Poly HEURs were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H NMR) and the molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). From this study, a correlation between syneresis and complex rheology was observed in I. Similar trends were observed in phase-separated II and dispersed (not phase-separated) III, though II with over 0. 4 wt% HEUR were ejected from the cone / plate geometry at 1 – 100 s- 1 and III did not demonstrate syneresis. Further investigation of dispersed II and phase-separated III is recommended to confirm the presence of the syneresis–rheology correlation of I in both II and III. In addition to these trends, only 2. 1 – 4. 2 wt% II were able to be analyzed by the single-mode Maxwell model. Also the transition from phase-separated to stable dispersion was observed with a polarized microscopy at 5 x magnification. In conclusion this study represents progress in the ongoing study at Cal Poly to better understanding the mechanisms behind the syneresis and rheology of these latex / HEUR AT dispersions...|$|R

50|$|The ink {{is created}} by placing an aqueous {{solution}} of silver nitrate into a flask of water combined with polyacrylic acid (PAA) and diethanolamine (DEA), the capping agent and reducing agent, respectively. After about twenty hours, the silver nitrate is dissolved, forming particles with a diameter of about 5 nanometers.

Once cooled, the solution is poured into a larger flask and the thick precipitate, an insoluble solid, that is formed is scraped out. From there, ethanol is added to coagulate the particles, or change the particles to a solid state. Most of the supernatant, the liquid lying above a layer of the precipitate, is then poured out so that the remaining liquid can be centrifuged, or separated.
