40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic urticaria-angioedema is a common, multiple-cause complaint. The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, causal and aggravating factors and evolution of urticaria-angioedema. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a descriptive prospective study carried out at the Dermatology outpatient clinic of Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, Universidade Estadual Paulista (Unesp). METHODS: A total of 125 patients with chronic urticaria-angioedema were evaluated to obtain sociodemographic <b>data,</b> <b>anamnesis,</b> dermatological and general clinical data and laboratory data, emphasizing causal and aggravating factors and complaint evolution. RESULTS: Chronic urticaria-angioedema occurred mainly in females (mean age: 35 years), but also in men (mean age: 32 years). White color and living in urban areas also predominated. There was no preferential time for symptoms to appear, and nighttime was the most commonly reported time for clinical worsening. Around half of the patients had urticaria associated with angioedema. There were no associated factors in most of the cases, and stress was the most commonly reported aggravating factor. The cause was ascertained in 37. 6 % of our cases. The mean duration of follow-up was 11. 7 months. Around 60 % of the patients evolved with the problem under control, 32 % improved, 9 % had no change in dermatological condition and only one patient worsened. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic urticaria-angioedema was more common among middle-aged women. It is a long-term disease, and its cause was explained in about one-third of the patients. Half of the patients presented disease control after treatment lasting an average of approximately one year...|$|E

40|$|The Bachelors work {{deals with}} a theme on Importance of Anamnesis within the Treatment of Children in Various Development Stages. The {{treatment}} documentation, in our case referred to as treatment anamnesis, {{is an essential part}} in order to provide a relevant treatment care. First of all, a nurse or other healthcare professional has to learn more about a patient as well as to find out detailed information in order to formulate a diagnosis and to decide on the most suitable treatment plan provided. Individual procedures and the principles followed when obtaining the information are as well very essential. There were two aims and two investigative questions established. The first aim of the Bachelors work was to focus on different ways that vary in obtaining the treatment anamnesis concerning children in various development stages. The second aim of the work was to draft a treatment documentation used for obtaining the anamnesis concerning children in particular stages of development. The first investigative question raises query if there are any distinctions in obtaining data or information about childrens patients in particular life stages. The second investigative question focuses on methods used by nurses or healthcare professionals to collect a medical history about childrens patients in particular life stages. The investigation was executed by a qualitative method using non standardized encounters, data analyses and observations. Nurses working in the childrens ward in the hospital in Strakonice and Písek were the subject to the research. The investigation was carried out during two weeks. It was ascertained during the investigation that the nurses working in the particular childrens wards in the hospital selected proceed differently when obtaining anamnesis information about particular childrens stages of life. The investigative question results in hypothesis no. 1 : `Nurses who carry out the task vary in used methods of obtaining the <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data</b> concerning children. Hypothesis no. 3 : `Supporting documents used for obtaining the <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data</b> concerning childrens patients are not equal in healthcare centres. The second investigative question result in findings that anthropometric measurements are ascertained in all children of different life stages. Some nurses do not follow the standard methods and principles of the encounters and not all nurses use correct methods when obtaining the information. Three further hypotheses result from the second investigative question: Hypothesis no. 2 : `When collecting the <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data,</b> nurses do not follow the rules of guiding the interview with a patient. Hypothesis no. 4 : When collecting the <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data</b> concerning childrens patients, nurses always ascertain their anthropometrical features according to individual stages of development. Thus shows that the first aim was fulfilled as well as the second aim assessed. Within the context of the actual findings, we would recommend to propose documentation for obtaining the <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data</b> aimed for childrens wards in hospitals which would have the same, equal layout, best within the whole Czech Republic. It would be important to make the supporting documents simple and clear to understand in order to make nurses job easier. The documentation would consequently simplify the formulations of treatment diagnoses, thus would contribute to provision of high quality of treatment {{in order to meet the}} patients needs. At the same time, it would be suitable to arrange courses and seminars focused on the stated theme aimed for individual hospitals and healthcare centres in the Czech Republic and to solve relevant problems concerning anamnesis documentation on the spot...|$|R

A relação entre o hipertireoidismo e as alterações no sistema cardiovascular está bem estabelecida, contudo o hipertireoidismo responde por menos de 5 % dos casos de dor torácica. Apresenta-se um caso de uma mulher, 47 anos, com sintomas de precordialgia típica e eletrocardiograma (ECG) sugestivo de isquemia coronariana, mas sem alteração laboratorial sugestiva de lesão miocárdica. Anamnese, exame físico e resultados laboratoriais permitiram firmar o diagnóstico de hipertireoidismo. Investigação subseqüente com o cateterismo cardíaco não demonstrou lesões obstrutivas. Após tratamento com iodo radioativo e retorno ao eutireoidismo, a paciente manteve-se assintomática e o ECG e a cintilografia miocárdica foram negativos para isquemia. Esses resultados sugerem uma interação entre hiperatividade tireoidiana e isquemia miocárdica, tendo o hipertireoidismo como provável etiologia dos achados clínicos e eletrocardiográficos.

40|$|Introduction: Abdominal pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} reported by patients admitted to the emergency room in Germany. Differences in gender should be taken into account, especially for the medical treatment of lower abdominal pain. Nevertheless, international data show that 20 % to 40 % of patients reporting abdominal pain in emergency rooms are discharged with diagnosis of undifferentiated abdominal pain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect patients treated for lower abdominal pain in the gynecological emergency room and to identify characteristics of patients, especially patients discharged with undifferentiated pain. Methods: This retrospective study identified all patients treated in 2009 for lower abdominal pain in the gynecological emergency room of the Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum in Berlin, Germany. Exclusion criteria include pain related to bleeding disorders or intrauterine pregnancy. Demographic <b>data,</b> <b>anamnesis,</b> findings, diagnoses, treatment, and recommendation were gathered from medical reports and analyzed using IBM® SPSS® Statistics. Results: A total of 1174 patients who were admitted to the emergency room at any time of the day were included in the study. Over 42 % of patients were admitted during opening hours of outpatient facilities. 35, 6 % of the patients were diagnosed with undifferentiated abdominal pain. Other common diagnoses included ovarian cyst, lower urinary tract infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease. In 28, 4 % a hospital admission was indicated. Patients diagnosed with undifferentiated abdominal pain were observed to have significantly lower frequency of strong pain or urinary complaints (Chi-squared test, p < 0, 05). The study identified no further differences between patients with undifferentiated pain and patients with a somatic diagnosis. Conclusions: Lower abdominal pain is the most common symptom reported by patients admitted to the emergency room of the Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum in 2009. Patients were frequently discharged from emergency room with a diagnosis of undifferentiated abdominal pain. A diagnosis of somatic system disorder should be taken into account, but this is not routinely conducted during emergency treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to identify further characteristics of patients diagnosed with undifferentiated abdominal pain in order to better our understanding of the illness and, improve the treatment for these patients...|$|E

The quality and the range of the movement corresponds to the rate of an awareness, what we are doing, and improvement of body perception can be very important for the elimination of undesirable elements in psychological and physical sphere of living. Objectives The aim of this research was to get the subjective feelings from each proband, who get involved the course of Feldenkrais method, and with the quality research sample evaluate the effect of the method to psychical a physical system. Methods The study provided 99 filled pre-tests and post-tests. Pre-tests showed the basic <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data</b> and the post-tests showed evaluation of prodands feelings after ATM intervention - Awareness Through Movement. The result were the reviews of probands by answering the questions, with Lickert scale. Results Results showed mostly positive response to the intervention. Regarding the physical aspects, most of the probands experienced and increase in range of motion. On the issue of the decrease of pain perception, the probands answered inconsistently. Probands mostly agreed with better psychological feelings. Another important aspect of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to map the {{interests}} of the child with Asperger syndrom then compare them with {{the interests of the}} child in the same intact age, and on comparisons to specify the common and different features of interest. Another goal is to assess whether the development of a boy with Asperger syndrome and intact boys changes their interests. I focused on the boy with Asperger syndrome whether there is the possible link of interest based on the specifics of the disability itself. The theoretical part is devoted to describing the characteristics of autism spectrum disorders more closely with ideas about Asperger syndrome. It also includes the characteristics of interests and game of intact children as compared with the specifics of the game and the interests of children with autistic spectrum disorders. Qualitative type of research and the method of observation have been chosen for purposes of empirical studies. The practical part follows the theoretical part. It is complemented by concrete examples in the form of two case studies, which were based on the observation of a boy with Asperger's syndrome and the intact boys, and also based on additional information obtained from interviews with parents due to the need to complete <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective of {{the study}} was to review the anamnesis, pheno - and {{genotype}} in patients with rare chromosome disorders such as 9 p deletion syndrome. Genetic methods of investigation (clinical and genealogical, cytogenetic, FISH- method), paraclinical and instrumental methods of examination were used. Karyotyping was performed by the G-method of differential staining of chromosomes. Only three cases of pathology were diagnosed in the Medical Genetics Center over the last 10 years. By <b>anamnesis</b> <b>data</b> nobody in the probands’ families had bad habits, was exposed to occupational hazards, took part in the elimination of the Chernobyl accident or lived in contaminated areas. Clinical signs of diseases have not been identified in probands’ parents. All probands had trigonocephaly, bilateral epicanthal folds, ocular hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, long philtrum, flat face and nasal bridge, low set ears with malformed auricles. Two patients of three ones had exophthalmos, contracture of the second and third fingers, abnormal external genitalia. In all three cases there was monosomy of chromosome 9 of critical segment p 24. Normal karyotypes were seen in all parents, so there were three cases of new mutations of 9 p deletion syndrome. Retardation of physical, psycho-spech, mental development in proband with or without congenital anomalies requires medical genetic counseling in a specialized institution. Cases of reproductive loss in anamnesis require cytogenetic investigation of fetal membranes and amniotic fluid...|$|R
40|$|Introduction - Canine epitheliotropic {{cutaneous}} lymphoma, {{also named}} mycosis fungoides, {{has been described}} as an uncommon cutaneous lymphoma of T-cell origin, which is histologically characterized by the epitheliotropism of neoplastic T-lymphocytes. Two variants have been reported in man, based upon clinical and histopathological features: classical mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The disease in dogs is clinically classified as cutaneous nodular form, exfoliative erythroderma, mucocutaneous form, and oral form. Aim of the study - The aim is to point out the most interesting clinical and histopathological findings for the diagnosis, also carrying out a comparison with the human species. Material and methods - We report the cases of 20 dogs, diagnosed with epitheliotropic cutaneous lymphoma. Medical records of these animals were reviewed for rilevant <b>data</b> on signalment, <b>anamnesis,</b> clinical examination and histopathologic diagnosis. Results - All the clinical variants described by Scott in veterinary medicine were present alone or in combination: exfoliative erythroderma (75 % dogs), mucocutaneous form (65 % dogs), cutaneous nodular form (55 % dogs), and oral form (25 % dogs). On the basis of histological features, the most represented variant was pagetoid reticulosis (14 / 20 dogs, 70 %). Sezary syndrome could not be found. Discussion - The clinical and histopathological features that were observed reflected those previously reported in the published literature, and showed interesting findings to be compared with the homologous human neoplasia...|$|R

The aim of this work was to study special features of clinical course of postnatal period in women with hypogalactia. Material and methods of the study. 60 women in childbirth have been examined who were divided into two groups: I main group - 30 women with a decreased lactational function. II - control group - 30 women in childbirth with a preserved lactational function. S. N. Gaidukov’s classification has been used to evaluate the degree of insufficiency of lactational function (1999). <b>Anamnesis</b> <b>data,</b> extragenital diseases, complications in the courseof pregnancy, labor and postnatal period were taken into account at making a diagnosis of oligogalactia function. Statistical processing of the data was performed on a personal computer IBM by means of statistical programme EXCEL making use of variational statistical methods. Authenticity of special features was established by means of Student’s t-criteria. Differences of indeces were regarded authentic at value of p 0, 05). An uncomplicated course of postnatal period was registered significantly more seldom in the main group of lying-in women - in 4 (1 3, 3 %) (p< 0, 05) than in the control group - in 16 (53, 3 %).
