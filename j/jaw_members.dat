25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the hadrosaurs are the Iguanodontidae. The most notable difference between the Hadrosauridae and the Iguanodontidae are in the bones of their <b>jaw.</b> <b>Members</b> of Iguanodontidae have a large maxilla bone in the upper jaw, while hadrosaurs have a smaller maxilla, complex teeth organization, and a large premaxilla in the upper jaw. Hadrosaurs are defined as all of {{the descendants of the}} last common ancestor of Telmatosaurus and Parasaurolophus.|$|E
50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue and groove joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output <b>jaw</b> <b>members</b> exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|E

50|$|They are {{relatively}} large for reef fish, where they reach almost 1 m in length. Bodies of trumpetfish are elongated, rigid, and pike-shaped. Their dorsal and anal fins are almost closely {{adjacent to the}} tail, where individual dorsal spines reach midway towards the head region. Similar to {{most members of the}} order Syngnathiformes, the bodies of trumpetfish are inflexible, supported by interwoven struts of bone. A distinct trait of the family is their long, tubular snouts ending with somewhat nondescript <b>jaws.</b> <b>Members</b> of the family have the capability to expand their jaws quickly into a circular, gaping hole almost to the body's diameter when feeding.|$|R

40|$|An {{articulator}} is {{a mechanical}} device {{which represents the}} temporomandibular joints and <b>jaw</b> <b>members</b> to which maxillary and mandibular cast may he attached to simulate jaw movements. Articulators have traditionally {{been used in the}} fabrication of fixed and removable dental restorations. They are also used in diagnosis of dental occlusal conditions, treatment planning, selective grinding, functional diagnostic prewax, orthodontic set-up and designing fixed restorative crowns and bridges. During the past 150 years, many types of articulators have evolved and placed in the market. This evolution began with the simple hinge mechanism and continued to the present day adjustable articulators.

50|$|Acentronura fish {{also have}} {{characteristically}} fused <b>jaws</b> like other <b>members</b> of the Syngnathidae. For those species where the feeding habits are known, the diet consists of small invertebrates such as planktonic crustacea which are snapped {{up by the}} small mouth {{at the tip of}} the snout, as they float past in the current. With a slim snout, relatively large eyes and raised rear part of the skull, the head is somewhat reminiscent of that of a seahorse, in contrast to the short, slim body. There are often projections sticking out from the body and head at intervals along the length of the fish.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{development}} of quasi-static computational models for musculoskeletal analysis, leveraging screw-theoretic techniques traditionally employed {{for the analysis of}} articulated multibody systems (MBS). The case study of analysis of bite- and muscle-forces in the articulated <b>jaws</b> of <b>members</b> of the felid (cat) family is used to highlight the critical aspects. In particular, musculoskeletal systems with multiple muscles superimposed on an underlying articulated skeleton share many features with the subclass of cable actuated parallel MBS (including redundancy in actuation and unidirectional nature of actuation forces). The screw-theoretic formulation facilitates the development of a computational model for resolving such redundancy while retaining explicit geometric meaning in terms of lines-of-action, motions and forces. The low-computational-complexity of the ensuing quasi-static models makes them well-suited both for: (a) iterative/parametric studies of the roles of geometry (muscle locations) or physiology (muscle-parameters) on skeletal loaddistributions, as well as (b) implementing online inverse-dynamics-based muscle-force planners for biomimetic physical prototypes. A MATLAB Graphical User Interface was also developed to aid lay users (non-computational scientists) in performing iterative parametric force optimization and muscle location studies...|$|R
40|$|Risso’s {{dolphins}} [Grampus griseus (Cuvier 1812) ] are a {{pelagic species}} of squid-eating odontocetes that are typically found in deep, temperate and tropical waters near continental shelf edges and submarine canyons (Leatherwood et al., 1980). Young animals have dark grey bodies while older animals appear nearly white due to accumulated scratches. Each time a Risso’s dolphin receives a scratch or a wound, the dark grey pigment does not return and the healed wound leaves a whitish mark. As a result, adult animals appear scratched and mottled. In {{contrast to the}} rounded melon of most delphinids, Risso’s dolphins have distinctive melons that are broad, squarish in profile, and creased by a characteristic longitudinal furrow or indentation extending down the melon {{to the top of}} the upper <b>jaw.</b> Unlike other <b>members</b> of the subfamily Globicephalinae, such as false killer whales, pilot whales, melon-headed whales and pygmy kille...|$|R
40|$|Dawson (1) listed 1498 teratologies of fish, {{but only}} one {{deformity}} of the <b>jaw</b> of a <b>member</b> of the genus Lepisosteus. Kroger and Guthrie (2) described a longnose gar (L. osseus) with "a crooked lower jaw which had grown slower than the upper jaw " and speculated that an angler has mutilated this fish. At 0335 on 8 May 1984, while bowfishing in shallow, well vegetated water {{at the north end}} of Lake Lawtonka 5. 5 km east and 0. 8 km south of Meers in Comanche County, southwestern Oklahoma, I shot a male spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) that had a lower mandible that was rigidly fixed at a 90 ° angle downward from the upper mandible (Fig. 1). At the time it was collected, the gar was cruising leisurely in 22 °C water about 20 cm deep that was well shaded by erect smartweeds (Polygonum sp.). Its behavior was not erratic or atypical and its appearance, other than the jaw, was normal. The fish weighed 467 g and its total length was 545 mm. These values are near the average weight (472 g) and length (508 mm) of 118 male spotted gars collected from Lake Lawtonka betwee...|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Cornwall, the son of John Pascoe and Marjorie Wills, and came to Canada around 1870. The family first settled in North Dorchester, Ontario; in 1892, his parents moved to a {{homestead}} near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan where they {{spent the rest of}} their lives. Pascoe acquired his own homestead near Regina around 1883. After four years, he moved to Michigan and then back to Ontario; during this time, he was involved in the lumber business. Pascoe married Mary Olton in 1887. In 1891, he travelled west again, settling on his own homestead near Moose Jaw. He served as chairman of the Local Improvement District surrounding Moose Jaw and then, after he moved his residence to Moose <b>Jaw,</b> as a <b>member</b> of Moose <b>Jaw</b> City Council. Pascoe was mayor of Moose Jaw from 1913 to 1915. He was defeated when he ran for reelection to the provincial assembly in 1925 as a Conservative. Pascoe served as mayor of Moose Jaw again from 1929 until his death in 1931. He {{died at the age of}} 68 of a heart attack in a Moose Jaw suburb while attempting to shovel away sand that had been blown around his car by the wind.|$|R
40|$|The {{temporomandibular}} {{joint and}} its associated musculature are described in a neonate gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) and {{serve as the basis}} for direct anatomical comparisons with the temporomandibular region in other clades of baleen whales (Mysticeti). Members of the right whale/bowhead whale clade (Balaenidae) are known to possess a synovial lower <b>jaw</b> joint, while <b>members</b> of the rorqual clade (Balaenopteridae) have a nonsynovial temporomandibular joint characterized by a highly flexible fibrocartilaginous pad and no joint capsule. In contrast, the gray whale possesses a modified temporomandibular joint (intermediate condition), with a vestigial joint cavity lacking a fibrous capsule, synovial membrane, and articular disk. In addition, the presence of a rudimentary fibrocartilaginous pad appears to be homologous to that seen in balaenopterid mysticetes. The intrinsic temporomandibular musculature in the gray whale was found to include a multibellied superficial masseter and a single‐bellied deep masseter. The digastric and internal pterygoid muscles in E. robustus are enlarged relative to the condition documented in species of Balaenoptera. A relatively complex insertion of the temporalis muscle on the dentary is documented in the gray whale and the low, knob‐like process on the gray whale dentary is determined to be homologous with the prominent coronoid process of rorquals. Comparison with the anatomy of the temporomandibular musculature in rorquals reveals an increased importance of alpha rotation of the dentary in the gray whale. This difference in muscular morphology and lines of muscle action is interpreted as representing adaptations for suction feeding.
