The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examination</b> is an objective ocular examination that includes the electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, the electrooculogram, the multifocal electroretinogram, and multifocal visual evoked potentials. Our aim is to review {{the literature of the}} use of the <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examination</b> in cases of uveitis. Methods: We performed a systematic search of the literature of published papers until October 2012 using the PubMed search engine. The key terms that were used were “uveitis,” “electrophysiological examination”, “electroretinogram”, “visual evoked potentials”, “electro-oculogram”, “multifocal electroretinogram”, and “multifocal visual evoked potentials” in multiple combinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review concerning the assessment of electrophysiology in uveitis. Results: Our search of the literature demonstrated that the <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examination,</b> mainly by means of electroretinogram, multifocal electroretinogram, and visual evoked potentials, is performed in several cases of uveitis for many purposes, including diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and treatment efficacy. The <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examination</b> is more useful in patients with multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, birdshot chorioretinopathy, Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease, Adamantiades–Behçet disease, ocular syphilis, and Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis.

Nine asymptomatic carriers of the D 178 N mutation, 10 non-carriers belonging to the same family, and 19 age-matched controls were studied over several years.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the outcome of}} specialized electrophysiology in visually impaired children. Methods: We carried out a retrospective evaluation of 340 <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examinations</b> performed in 298 children over a 3 -year period (2001 - 2003), with regard to demographic data, referral pattern, degree of compliance, and diagnostic results. Electrophysiology was performed without sedation or anaesthesia. In electroretinograms, DTL electrodes were used in combination with online selection of responses. Visual evoked potentials testing was performed with seven active occipital electrodes. Results: The {{mean age of the}} children was 7 ± 5 years; 72 (24 %) of the children were mentally as well as visually impaired. Main reasons for referral were suspected posterior segment disease, abnormal visual development, unexplained low vision, high myopia, and suspected albinism. Compliance was good in 302 / 340 (88 %), partial in 24 / 340 (7 %), and absent in 14 / 340 (4 %) of the examinations. Of the 326 successful procedures, 215 (66 %) showed abnormal results. Tapetoretinal dystrophy (22 %), opticopathy (16 %), congenital stationary night blindness (13 %), and cone dystrophy (11 %) were the most frequently established diagnoses. Albinism was confirmed in 14 of 24 suspected patients; additionally, unsuspected misrouting was found in six. In 26 (9 %) of the patients, a previously established diagnosis was changed. Conclusions: In a specialized setting, <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examinations</b> can be performed successfully in visually impaired children.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} vascularized peripheral nerve trunk autografted in spinal cord. METHODS: With modern microsurgical technique, vascularized peripheral median and ulnar nerve trunk autografted in the upper thoracic region of the spinal cord were established in 20 female adult rats. The origin and the termination of axons in the graft were studied by retrograde neuronal labeling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Cord, nerve grafts and some normal median an d ul nar nerves in the right upper limb were removed and sectioned for Bielschowsky's silver stain and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Light and electron microscopic examination and <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examination</b> were applied. RESULTS: The grafts were innervated by many new fibers. Studies with HRP indicated that new axons in graft were originated from intrinsic cent ral nervous system (CNS) neurons with their cell bodies from brain stem to s acral segments of spinal cord. Other axons arose from dorsal root ganglia {{at the level of}} graft and at least 19 distal segments to them. Together with electron microscopy, <b>electrophysiological</b> <b>examination,</b> silver and H&E stain, the results demonstrated that vascularized peripheral nerve trunk grafted in spinal cord attracted many neurons to grow into the nerve grafts.
