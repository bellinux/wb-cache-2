ExuT belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) class of transporters, more specifically to the anion:cation symporter (ACS) family [50]. This class of symporters transfers organic/inorganic anions while simultaneously co-transporting H+/Na+, respectively. ExuT has not been reported to transport other substrates than the aldohexuronic acids. Inspection of the genome of C. glutamicum WT showed only one protein with 22 % similarity to ExuT, namely putative lincomycin resistance protein LMRB (YP 226924.1). Engineering C. glutamicum for growth with other non-native carbon sources does not necessarily require heterologous expression of a gene encoding a transport system. Introduction of catabolic genes for conversion of glycerol, arabinose, and xylose was sufficient to enable utilization of these carbon sources by these recombinant C. glutamicum strains, while additional introduction of the respective uptake system accelerated carbon source utilization [27],[28],[33],[51],[52]. Transport engineering was not required for the amino sugar glucosamine, which is a substrate of the endogenous glucose-specific PTS [31], whereas the amino sugar N-acetylglucosamine could only be utilized if NagE from the related Corynebacterium glycinophilum was introduced [32]. In the latter case {{as well as in}} the present study, it was necessary to adjust the concentration of the inducer IPTG. It is often observed that too high levels of a transmembrane protein such as a transport protein results in growth perturbation [53],[54]. In addition, expression levels of several genes of a pathway may need to be tuned to avoid accumulation of potentially inhibitory intermediates as demonstrated for C. glutamicum engineered for decaprenoxanthin overproduction [23].|$|E

40|$|The soluble sugar {{concentration}} of fleshy fruit {{is a key}} determinant of fleshy fruit quality. It affects directly the sweetness of fresh fruits and indirectly the properties of processed products (e. g. alcohol content in wine). Despite considerable divergence among species, soluble sugar accumulation in a fruit results from the complex interplay of three main processes, namely sugar <b>import,</b> <b>sugar</b> metabolism, and water dilution. Therefore, inter-species comparison would help to identify common and/or species-specific modes of regulation in sugar accumulation. For this purpose, a process-based mathematical framework {{was used to compare}} soluble sugar accumulation in three fruits: grape, tomato and peach. Representative datasets covering the time course of sugar accumulation during fruit development were collected. They encompassed 104 combinations of species (3), genotypes (32), and growing conditions (19 years and 16 nutrient and environmental treatments). At maturity, grape showed the highest soluble sugar concentrations (16. 5 - 26. 3 g / 100 g FW), followed by peach (2. 2 to 20 g / 100 g FW) and tomato (1. 4 to 5 g / 100 g FW). Main processes determining soluble sugar concentration were decomposed into sugar importation, metabolism and water dilution with the process-based analysis. Different regulation modes of soluble sugar concentration were then identified, showing either import-based, dilution-based, or import and dilution dual-based. Firstly, the higher soluble sugar concentration in grape than in tomato is a result of higher sugar importation. Secondly, the higher soluble sugar concentration in grape than in peach is due to a lower water dilution. The third mode of regulation is more complicated than the first two, with differences both in sugar importation and water dilution (grape vs cherry tomato; cherry tomato vs peach; peach vs tomato). On the other hand, carbon utilization for synthesis of non-soluble sugar compounds (namely metabolism) was conserved among the three fruit species. These distinct modes appear to be quite species-specific, but the intensity of the effect may significantly vary depending on the genotype and management practices. These results provide novel insights into the drivers of differences in soluble sugar concentration among fleshy fruits...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{depletion}} of fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions, solutions are needed to replace petrol based products. As a consequence, the number of biobased products developed using agricultural feedstock is continuously increasing. This study focuses on the carbon footprint of bio-HDPE produced either from Brazilian sugar cane or Belgian sugar beet. The goal {{of this study is}} to compare the carbon footprint of bio-HDPE with the fossil one, taking into account the effect of land use change. Common boundaries of the agricultural systems comprise the cultivation step for both crops, i. e. sugar cane and sugar beet, with all associated energy and fertilizer consumptions, the transportation step from field to the industrial plant, the sugar crops transformation into hydrate bioethanol, the by-products valorisation, the dehydration and polymerization steps and the HDPE incineration as end of life issue. Fossil scenario includes the production of ethylene, its polymerization and its incineration. When comparing the entire life cycle of bio and fossil HDPE, the GHG emissions are lower for the biobased product which is the willing effect. This result is only valid if no Land Use Change (LUC) or Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) effect appears. To assess the environmental impact of the deforestation or of the transformation of a pasture into a field, the EC-Guidelines from the European Union were used in order to calculate the CO 2 emissions depending on several parameters. For sugar cane, LUC consists in the transformation of pastures into fields in the region of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Three scenarios can be developed based on different agricultural practices for pasture and field (tillage and fertilizers inputs) : the best, the worst and the average. The best case leads to a supplementary environmental gain. The worst and average achieve additional emissions. A payback time, considering the time needed to find again an environmental gain compared to the fossil counterpart, was calculated for the average scenario which is equal to 12 years. The ILUC effect for sugar cane is assumed to be deforestation due to the transformation of forest into pasture induced by the previous LUC effect. The rate of deforestation can vary between 16 % or 100 % depending on used statistics and leads to a payback time of respectively 26 and 101 years. For sugar beet, no LUC is considered. Indeed, no land expansion is available in Belgium due to small available areas. In the case of an increase of bioplastics production, Belgium should <b>import</b> <b>sugar</b> beet from neighboring countries which can induce ILUC. In this study, sugar beet is assumed to be provided by the Netherlands on pastures previously transformed into fields. The average scenario implies a payback time of 8 years. This study permits to highlight the importance of LUC and ILUC especially for energetic crops dedicated to replace fossil products. This effect can reverse expected results and induce long payback times. Peer reviewe...|$|E
