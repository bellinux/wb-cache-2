25|$|Barruel’s Memoirs is {{considered}} one of the founding documents of the right-wing interpretation of the French Revolution. It became popular immediately after it was published and was read and commented on by most of the important literary and political journals of the day. The four volumes of the text were published in a number of languages and created a debate about the role of the philosophes, their ideas, and the Enlightenment in the French Revolution. They remained in print well into the 20th century and contributed to the historical interpretation of the late 18th century in France. The success of Barruels work is testimony to the anti-philosophical <b>discourse</b> <b>that</b> spread in the aftermath of the revolution. Barruel left behind a construction of the Enlightenment that was destined to influence subsequent interpretations. He wound accusations tightly around his foes and tied them into positions from which they could not escape. The text created a link between the Enlightenment and the Revolution and this connection remains a topic of historical debate.|$|E
25|$|Colonialism was a {{capitalist}} venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands. It {{was supported by}} military force and a <b>discourse</b> <b>that</b> legitimized its violence {{in the name of}} progress and a universal civilizing mission. This discourse is complex and multi-faceted. It was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as Joseph-Ernest Renan and Arthur de Gobineau, but its roots reach far back in history. In Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literature and the Legacy of Classical Writers, Amar Acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient Greece, including Europe’s claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-Europeans harboured by Renan and other 19th century colonial ideologues. He argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as “inferior”, “stagnant” and “degenerate” were borrowed from Greek and Latin authors like Lysias (440-380 BC), Isocrates (436-338 BC), Plato (427-327 BC), Aristotle (384—322 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC), and Sallust (86-34 BC), who all considered their racial others – the Persians, Scythians, Egyptians as “backward”, “inferior”, and “effeminate”. Among these ancient writers Aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions, which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists. In The Politics, he established a racial classification and ranked the Greeks superior to the rest. He considered them as an ideal race to rule over Asian and other ‘barbarian’ peoples, for they knew how to blend the spirit of the European “war-like races” with Asiatic “intelligence” and “competence”.|$|E

40|$|The problematisation of the {{professional}} standards for teachers in the UK lifelong learning sector tends {{to focus on the}} <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> the standards embody: <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> are posited as being based on a restricted or technicist model of professionalism, that fail sufficiently to recognise the lived experiences of teachers within the sector both in terms of professional knowledge and competence, and professional development. This paper takes a different approach, drawing on social practice theories of literacy in order to shift the locus of problematisation away from what the standards might mean, to how the standards are physically assembled or instantiated in documentary form. The paper concludes by suggesting that a first point of problematisation rests not in the <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> the standards embody, but in the inherent fragilities of any text-based material artefact that has the intention of carrying meaning across spatial, institutional or temporal boundaries...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor Thesis, {{conducted}} {{in the field of}} Religious Studies, concerns the different <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> have formed around HIV/AIDS, as formulated by religious leaders, and the stigmatising effects these discourses can have. This study was inspired by a statement made by Gillian Patterson, claiming <b>that</b> the <b>discourse</b> of compassion is often deeply stigmatising. The research question therefore asks: What did Patterson mean when she wrote <b>that</b> the <b>discourse</b> of compassion, as formulated by the Roman Catholic and Anglican communities in sub Saharan Africa, is merely another (unintended) way to stigmatize the people infected with HIV/AIDS? This thesis compares the discourse of compassionate hope to the concept of stigma and the <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> have been known for their stigmatising effects. The <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> have been singled out for this purpose are the discourse of morality and the discourse of war. These discourses, along with the discourse of compassionate hope, have been analysed by statements made by Roman Catholic and Anglican church leaders in sub Saharan Africa...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{insights into the}} <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> legitimate and perpetuate male undergraduate drinking cultures and considers the role of alcohol in communicating hegemonic masculinity within one British university. Taking laddishness as a template of hegemonic masculinity, the article contends that male students’ heavy alcohol use is partially motivated by <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> position drinking as a ‘normal’ part of studenthood, but also by <b>discourses</b> <b>that</b> reinforce drinking as a ‘laddish’ behaviour or a male preserve. While interviewees recognised the importance of drinking in constructing masculinity, running parallel to this were attempts to disassociate themselves from the extremities of alcohol-induced laddishness and considerations that male peers who drank too much were lesser men. However, in their resistance to these extremities, interviewees demonstrated complicity towards more general attributes of hegemonic masculinity, such as independence and the strength to say no. This highlights the complex and somewhat contradictory processes individuals go through {{in the construction of}} gender identities, yet also offers a means through which male undergraduates’ risky alcohol use might be challenged...|$|R
