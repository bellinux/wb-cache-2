500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he {{told me not to}} say anything. And I will never, ever respond to anybody—man, woman, vegetable, or mineral—who tells me to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut. Alter what I've been through, I don't think so, pal." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{rear side}} of the left wing shows the Nativity of Jesus and the Assumption of Mary. The rear of the central panel (painted in a {{different}} style and in a lesser state of preservation {{than the rest of}} the altarpiece) shows the Last Judgment as a doom. The rear of the right panel shows the Annunciation with the Unicorn (almost a carbon copy of the same scene from the Altarpiece of the Dominicans) and the Adoration of the Magi. Remarkably, both the blessed in the depiction of Paradise and the damned in the depiction of Hell in the Last Judgement are almost all clerical people: popes, bishops, monks, nuns. A nun deep in the fire is shown pointing her finger at her tongue; a text (in German) running next to her says [...] "I didn't <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut, that's why I'm deep in hell" [...] (Darum, dass ich nit han geswiegen ich tief in der Helle liegen).|$|E

Keith wanted him in {{but there was no}} way that once Steve opened his mouth Mick would have him in the band. He knew Steve would never stay in the background. They were the one band in the world that Steve would have loved to have been in. He just wanted to work with Keith." [...] – Pam Marriott ...|$|E

5000|$|After Ailes was {{the subject}} of a sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit filed by former Fox News coworker Gretchen Carlson, O'Reilly said in July 2016 that Ailes was a [...] "target" [...] as a [...] "famous, powerful or wealthy person" [...] and called him the [...] "best boss I ever had." [...] After Ailes was fired and the network settled the lawsuit with Carlson, O'Reilly declined to comment further, saying that [...] "for once in my life, I'm going to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> big <b>mouth</b> shut." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lechmere {{wrote that}} she first met Wyndham Lewis in 1912, though {{according}} to Paul O'Keeffe {{it was late}} 1910 or early 1911. They went to dinner during which Lewis barely spoke, which was not unusual, Rebecca West had the same treatment. Afterwards, Lewis revealed that he had received troubling news. His lover Olive Johnson (19 or 20 years old) had become pregnant by him. By December 1912, Lewis and Lechmere were romantically involved and he wrote to her [...] "I have as many kisses as the envelope will hold. The rest I <b>keep</b> in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> for you." [...] He called her [...] "Jacques" [...] because she was reading Jean Jacques Rousseau when they met and she called him [...] "Golliwog" [...] because of his long black hair.|$|R
2500|$|The {{instrumental}} backing {{was effectively}} recorded {{live in the}} studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet's approach, [...] " [...] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It {{seemed to me that}} {{if he was going to}} create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack would take me to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E
2500|$|Heirens took full {{responsibility}} for the three murders on August 7, 1946. The prosecution had him reenact the crime in the Degnan home in public {{and in front of}} the press. On September 4, with Heirens's parents and the victims' families attending and Chief Justice Harold G. Ward presiding, Heirens admitted his guilt on the burglary and murder charges. That night, Heirens tried to hang himself in his cell, timed to coincide during a shift change of the prison guards. He was discovered before he died. He said later that despair drove him to attempt suicide:Everyone believed I was guilty...If I weren't alive, I felt I could avoid being adjudged guilty by the law and thereby gain some victory. But I wasn't successful even at that. ...Before I walked into the courtroom my counsel told me to just enter a plea of guilty and <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> shut afterward. I didn't even have a trial...|$|E

60|$|I {{was almost}} choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked {{it out of}} <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> with a small needle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief. Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> bed a fortnight. The king, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness. The monkey was killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the palace.|$|R

60|$|Amb.--In {{confirmation}} of this opinion of Onuphrio, I can mention many instances. I once dreamt that my door had been forced, {{that there were}} robbers in my room, {{and that one of}} them was actually putting his hand before <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to ascertain if I was sleeping naturally. I awoke at this moment, and was some minutes before I could be sure whether it was a dream or a reality. I felt the pressure of the bedclothes on my lips, and still in the fear of being murdered continued to <b>keep</b> <b>my</b> eyes closed and to breathe slowly, till, hearing nothing and finding no motion, I ventured to open my eyes; but even then, when I saw nothing, I was not sure that my impression was a dream till I had risen from my bed and ascertained that the door was still locked.|$|R
