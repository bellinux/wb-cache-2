5|$|Vincent Crabbe is a recurring, minor {{character}} who appears in <b>every</b> <b>book</b> and dies in a pivotal scene in Deathly Hallows. Jamie Waylett portrays the {{character in the}} first six films. During production of the seventh film, Waylett pleaded guilty to charges of growing marijuana. Joshua Herdman, who plays Crabbe's best friend Gregory Goyle, said in August 2009 that Waylett would not be reprising his role and Herdman's character would die instead.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1899, Warner was {{appointed}} the school's athletic director and his salary more than doubled. A track-and-field program was started that year. Warner knew little about the sport; to prepare as coach he bought <b>every</b> <b>book</b> available and consulted Jack Moakley and Mike Murphy, two of the era's leading head coaches. The program was successful; running was a Native American tradition, and students from the Southwest were known for their stamina in long-distance races.|$|E

5|$|Further, {{under the}} terms of Irish {{copyright}} law (most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000), the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of <b>every</b> <b>book</b> published in Ireland, alongside the National Library of Ireland, the Trinity College Library at Dublin, the library of the University of Limerick, the library of Dublin City University and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland. The Bodleian Library, Cambridge University Library, and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland, but again must formally make requests.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, however, {{doubt the}} {{veracity}} of this theory. For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the Deseret News and <b>every</b> <b>book</b> published in the alphabet prominently feature {{the key to the}} alphabet, and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City, or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one. Contemporary scholars Richard F. Burton and Jules Remy also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The bill imposed fines {{on anyone}} who {{imported}} or traded in unlicensed or foreign books, required <b>every</b> <b>book</b> for which copyright protection was sought to be {{entered into the}} Stationers' Register, provided a legal deposit system centred around the King's Library, the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, but said nothing about limiting the term of copyright. It also specified that books were property; {{an emphasis on the}} idea that authors deserved copyright simply due to their efforts. The Stationers were enthusiastic, urging Parliament to pass the bill, and it received its second reading on 9 February. A Committee of the Whole met to amend it on 21 February, with further alterations made when it was passed back to the House of Commons on 25 February. Alterations during this period included minor changes, such as extending the legal deposit system to cover Sion College and the Faculty of Advocates, but also major ones, including the introduction of a limit on the length of time for which copyright would be granted.|$|E

5|$|The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in {{his third}} year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the {{knowledge}} that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in <b>every</b> <b>book</b> there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of <b>every</b> <b>book</b> and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In <b>every</b> <b>book</b> of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E

25|$|Blake {{could also}} colour the plates {{themselves}} in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing.

25|$|The first {{surviving}} {{document that}} definitely uses these dots {{is also the}} first surviving Arabic papyrus (PERF 558), dated April, 643. The dots did not become obligatory until much later.
