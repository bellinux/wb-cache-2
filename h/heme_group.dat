5|$|The {{electron}} {{transport chain}} carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, {{and these are}} transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> in its structure. Cytochrome c {{is also found in}} some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the <b>heme</b> <b>group,</b> and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide is a {{poisonous}} gas that interferes with cellular respiration. Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by binding {{to one of}} the proteins involved in the electron transport chain. This protein, cytochrome c oxidase, contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups. The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups, heme a3, forming a more stabilized compound through metal-to-ligand pi bonding. As a result of the formation of this new iron-cyanide complex, the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so. Instead, these electrons destabilize the compound; thus, the <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> no longer accept them. Consequently, electron transport is halted, and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP. In a human weighing , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70mg of hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heme</b> <b>groups</b> {{are part}} of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells that serves to {{transport}} oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. <b>Heme</b> <b>groups</b> are also present in myoglobin to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.|$|R
50|$|Cytochrome b/b6 is an {{integral}} membrane protein of approximately 400 amino acid residues that probably has 8 transmembrane segments. In plants and cyanobacteria, cytochrome b6 consists of two subunits encoded by the petB and petD genes. Cytochrome b/b6 non-covalently binds two <b>heme</b> <b>groups,</b> known as b562 and b566. Four conserved histidine residues are postulated to be the ligands of the iron atoms of these two <b>heme</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Like hemoglobin, {{myoglobin}} is a {{cytoplasmic protein}} that binds oxygen on a <b>heme</b> <b>group.</b> It harbors only one <b>heme</b> <b>group,</b> whereas hemoglobin has four. Although its <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> {{is identical to}} those in Hb, Mb has a higher affinity for oxygen than does hemoglobin. This difference is related to its different role: whereas hemoglobin transports oxygen, myoglobin's function is to store oxygen.|$|E

25|$|The name {{hemoglobin}} {{is derived}} from the words heme and globin, reflecting the fact that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded <b>heme</b> <b>group.</b> Each <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> contains one iron atom, that can bind one oxygen molecule through ion-induced dipole forces. The most common type of hemoglobin in mammals contains four such subunits.|$|E
25|$|In most vertebrates, the {{hemoglobin}} molecule is an assembly of four globular protein subunits. Each subunit {{is composed of}} a protein chain tightly associated with a non-protein prosthetic <b>heme</b> <b>group.</b> Each protein chain arranges into a set of alpha-helix structural segments connected together in a globin fold arrangement. Such a name is given because this arrangement is the same folding motif used in other heme/globin proteins such as myoglobin. This folding pattern contains a pocket that strongly binds the <b>heme</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} verify the “radiation protection” effect of {{prosthetic}} groups in irradiated conjugated proteins {{and the influence of}} their electronic structure on intramolecular excitation transfer, two series of substances were examined. The first was composed of ferrihemoglobin and its constituents and the second was composed of similar hemoproteins with <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> with major differences in electronic structure. The results point to a strong radiation protection effect of the <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> and a dependence of radical yield of hemoproteins on the electronic structure of the heme. A possible interpretation of this latter effect is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{reaction}} of N-bromosuccinimide with the <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> of hemoglobin {{has been studied}} spectrophotometrically. The reaction brings about the disappearance of characteristic absorption peaks of hemoglobin and is accompanied by the release of inorganic iron from the <b>heme</b> <b>groups.</b> Urea is obligatory for the reaction to take place at pH 4. 0, while it can occur {{in the absence of}} urea at pH 7. 0. The spectrum of hemoglobin which does not show any peak in the Soret region at pH 4. 0 is “normalized” in the presence of urea or sucrose at the same pH. The effect of “normalization” in 8 M urea is apparent over the pH range 3. 0 – 4. 5. From the obligatory requirement of urea and sucrose for “normalization” of spectrum and the dependence of the release of inorganic iron on the concentration of urea, it is suggested that <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> are “buried” within the globin at pH 4. 0 and not dissociated from globin as supposed before...|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} of the alpha and beta <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> to the absorbance change that accompanies the aggregation of hemoglobin subunits were measured by comparing the extinction changes produced by n-butyl isocyanide binding to deoxyhemoglobin A with those produced by binding of n-butyl isocyanide to the isolated chains. Almost the entire aggregation absorbance change {{is associated with the}} unliganded alpha subunits, which exhibit a 30 % increase in molar extinction at 428 nm during tetramer formation. This marked spectral change indicates a substantial perturbation of the electronic properties of the alpha <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> in going from the high-affinity, isolated chain state to the low-affinity, tetrameric state. The lack of a significant absorbance change as sociated with the beta <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> implies that the change in reactivity of unliganded beta subunits produced by aggregation is not the result of a change in spin or coordination geometry of the iron atom, but rather involves primarily an alteration in the protein structure near the sixth coordination position...|$|R
25|$|The {{human body}} needs iron for oxygen transport. Oxygen (O2) is {{required}} for the functioning and survival of nearly all cell types. Oxygen is transported from the lungs {{to the rest of the}} body bound to the <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. In muscles cells, iron binds myoglobin, which regulates its release.|$|E
25|$|After {{being carried}} in blood to a body tissue {{in need of}} oxygen, O2 is handed-off from the <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> to monooxygenase, an enzyme that also has an active site with an atom of iron. Monooxygenase uses oxygen to {{catalyze}} many oxidation reactions in the body. Carbon dioxide, a waste product, is released from the cell and into the blood, where it combines with bicarbonate and hemoglobin for transport to the lungs. Blood circulates back to the lungs and the process repeats.|$|E
25|$|Normally, methemoglobin {{levels are}} <1%, as {{measured}} by the co-oximetry test. Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against oxidative stress within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying ferrous ion (Fe2+) of the <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> of the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized to the ferric state (Fe3+). This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{electron}} transfer (eT) between redox-active cofactors {{is thought to}} occur by quantum-mechanical tunneling. However, {{in many cases the}} observed rate is limited by other reactions coupled to eT, such as proton transfer, conformational changes, or catalytic chemistry at an active site. A prominent example of this phenomenon is the eT between the <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, which has been reported to take place in several different time domains. The question of whether pure eT tunneling in the nanosecond regime between the <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> can be observed {{has been the subject of}} some experimental controversy. Here, we report direct observations of eT between the <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> of the quinol oxidase cytochrome bo 3 from Escherichia coli, where the reaction is initiated by photolysis of carbon monoxide from heme o 3. eT from CO-dissociated ferrous heme o 3 to the low-spin ferric heme b takes place at a rate of (1. 2 ns) − 1 at 20 °C as determined by optical spectroscopy. These results establish heme–heme electron tunneling in the bo 3 enzyme, a bacterial relative to the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. The properties of eT between the closely lying <b>heme</b> <b>groups</b> in the heme–copper oxidases are discussed in terms of the reorganization energy for the process, and two methods for assessing the rate of electron tunneling are presented...|$|R

PCC 6803. E. coli’s maturation system with at least eight different proteins accepted all these cytochromes for heme ligation.

25|$|For comparison, {{another group}} of azoles is the triazoles, which {{includes}} fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the <b>heme</b> <b>group.</b> The triazoles {{have been shown to}} have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.|$|E
25|$|In the {{vascular}} endothelium, NO is synthesized by eNOS from L-arginine {{and molecular}} oxygen, which binds to the <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> of eNOS, is reduced and finally incorporated into L- arginine to form NO and L-citrulline. The binding of the cofactor BH4 {{is essential for}} eNOS to efficiently generate NO. In the absence of this cofactor, eNOS shifts from a dimeric to a monomeric form, thus becoming uncoupled. In this conformation, instead of synthesizing NO, eNOS produces superoxide anion, a highly reactive free radical with deleterious consequences to the cardiovascular system.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} {{red blood cells}} {{is due to the}} <b>heme</b> <b>group</b> of hemoglobin.

However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Oxidation and {{reduction}} reactions are not common in organic chemistry as few organic molecules {{can act as}} oxidizing or reducing agents. Iron(II), on the other hand, can easily be oxidized to iron(III). This functionality is used in cytochromes, which function as electron-transfer vectors. The presence of the metal ion allows metalloenzymes to perform functions such as redox reactions that cannot easily be performed by the limited set of functional groups found in amino acids. The iron atom in most cytochromes is contained in a <b>heme</b> <b>group.</b> The differences between those cytochromes lies in the different side-chains.
