50|$|The extreme Serbian historiography proclaimed all typical Vlach {{elements}} {{and those of}} Dinaric/Shtokavian culture as being Serbian, tried {{to prove that the}} Military Frontier in what is today Croatia lost its own Croatian population and got an ethnically new and prevalent Serb population, and exaggerated the importance of the Serbs {{in the history of the}} Military Frontier. Serbian historiography strongly considered that the term Vlach indicated status and not ethnos, and that they didn't exist in later centuries as an ethnic group, yet were true Serbs. Sima Ćirković noted that the name was maintained due to different crafts, way of life and distinct form of social organization, until the differences lost their meaning, with Slavicization process lasting for centuries; he considered that Serbs absorbed many Vlachs and other ethnic groups. Many Serbian scholars, including <b>foreign,</b> <b>claim</b> that the Orthodox settlers in the Military Frontier were Serbs or mainly Serbs.|$|E

In particular, we distinguish between local claims, extended by international banks through their affiliates in a host (or claim recipient) country, and cross-border claims, booked from outside the host country, typically from banks ’ headquarters in their home countries. Using data on U. S., Spanish, and Italian banks ’ foreign claims across countries, {{we find that the}} share of local foreign claims is primarily driven by the degree of “freedom ” in the host banking sector and by business opportunities in the local market. Entry requirements, startup and informational costs associated with international banking also play a role, but their influence is less robust. Finally, we find that the mix of international bank claims has implications for financial stability, since <b>foreign</b> <b>claim</b> volatility is lower in countries that receive a larger share of local claims...|$|E

Batik (Malaysia), decorative motifs of metalic handicraft (Cina), and carving furniture design from Jepara (England) were the examples.

40|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis, European banks sharply contracted <b>foreign</b> <b>claims</b> on recipient economies. This paper examines the impact of that deleveraging on credit supply in recipient economies, with a particular focus on Asia. Identification is achieved by exploiting heterogeneity in the ex-ante patterns of funding reliance on different European banking systems, and in variation in the ratio of local claims in local currency to total <b>foreign</b> <b>claims</b> in recipient economies. These sources of variation are used to create instruments for the deleveraging shock. We find that the contraction of <b>foreign</b> <b>claims</b> in European bank {{was associated with a}} substantial reduction in domestic credit supply in a broad sample of countries. However, the credit supply response in Asia was only about half the size of the response in non-Asian countries, possibly due to stronger policy response and healthier local bank balance sheets in th...|$|R

This paper develops an empirical methodology to test the contagion effect at the country level using bilateral data on bank claims between countries.

The paper measures these exposures to the crisis-affected countries by using bilateral <b>foreign</b> <b>claims</b> sourced from Bank for International Settlements (i) consolidated banking statistics <b>foreign</b> <b>claims</b> on immediate counterparty and ultimate risk bases and (ii) locational banking statistics cross-border total claims.
