The <b>kitchen,</b> <b>linen</b> room, palliative care unit and link corridors were all demolished {{and a new}} two-storey entrance built on the ground which includes the reception {{on the ground floor}} and the children's outpatient department on the first floor. While the redevelopment was going on, the GP practices, outpatients and minor injuries department stayed open at Adamson while many of the community clinics moved to Stratheden Hospital in Springfield, Fife and x-ray services were moved to Glenrothes hospital and St Andrews Community Hospital. The redevelopment was opened on 29 October 2012 by Alex Neil, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing.|$|E

30|$|All {{textiles}} {{provide a}} growing environment for these micro-organisms. Natural fibres, such as cotton and wool, are especially susceptible to microbial growth and even dust mites because they retain oxygen, water and nutrients. Micro-organisms can embed themselves in {{clothes in a}} closet, curtains, carpets, bed, bath and <b>kitchen</b> <b>linens,</b> even pillows and mattresses. Many bacteria also grow on the skin while dust mites live on shed, human skin cells that have been deposited on items such as sheets, towels, and clothing.

30|$|Karur {{is a major}} textile {{center and}} has five major product groups, namely bed <b>linens,</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>linens,</b> toilet linens, table linens, and wall hangings. An earlier survey in 2011 says that {{the total number of}} {{factories}} located {{on the banks of the}} Amaravathi River is about 515. The dyeing industry consumes totally 3225  L of water per day for dyeing process. About 14, 600  m 3 of coloured effluent with TDS 5000 – 10, 000  mg/L is let into the Amaravathi River daily. Big factories had even dug tube wells to a depth of 275 m and discharged effluents into these wells lead to contamination of groundwater in the area. Soil turned infertile, the yield of the crops came down, slowly the farmlands became barren, and 250 open wells get contaminated. Kidney disorders, cancer, and abortion are high in the affected villages, revealed by local natives. Owing to zero discharge of effluents, in 2011, 459 dyeing units were closed and only 54 factories were given permission after they installed ETP (Suchitra 2014).|$|R

Sister Maria Ludovica was later made the supervisor and head administrator of the children's hospital. She focused on expanding services for the children, securing funds to build additional patient and operating rooms, acquire medical equipment, and construct a convalescent center. She also was instrumental in the building of a chapel and creation of a farm to provide fresh produce for the children of the hospital. She was also instrumental in securing a grant from the Municipality of La Plata to maintain the hospital, which guaranteed its longevity. After her death, the city took over the administration of the facility.|$|R

50|$|Tamil Nadu is {{the largest}} textile hub of India. The textile {{industry}} {{plays a significant role}} in the Indian economy by providing direct employment to an estimated 35 million people, and thereby contributing 4% of GDP and 35% of gross export earnings. The textile sector contributes to 14% of the manufacturing sector. From Spinning to garment manufacturing, entire textile production chain facilities are in Tamil Nadu. About half of India's total spinning mill capacity is in Tamil Nadu. The western part of Tamil Nadu comprising Coimbatore, Tirupur, Erode, Dindigul and Karur has the majority of spinning mills manufacturing cotton/polyester/blended yarn, open end yarn and silk yarn used by garment units in Tamil Nadu, Maharastra etc. Yarn is also exported to China, Bangladesh etc. Tirupur city knitted garment units have been exporting garments for about 3 decades with 2015-16 exports in the range of USD 3 Billion. Erode and Karur are home textile (Curtain cloth, bed <b>linens,</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>linens,</b> toilet linens, table linens, wall hangings etc.) manufacturing hubs. Madras (Chennai) has a large presence of woven garments (shirts/pants) manufacturing units. Madurai and Kanchipuram are famous for handloom sarees exported / sold all over India. LMW, one of the three major textile machinery manufacturing companies in the world is located in Coimbatore. Savio also has a factory in Coimbatore. Many textile component manufacturers are in Coimbatore and some export to the Europe etc.|$|R

This suggests Smedley was Mansfield's successor as the bank's design architect in Sydney, and Eyre was the local supervising architect with Stanley his senior partner.The new premises included the banking chamber, manager and accountant's offices, strong rooms and ablution facilities.

Like a house, a hospital contains an immense amount of textiles with the added threat of high volumes of traffic. Because of the constant flow of people, especially those with infectious diseases, many researchers have focused on creating finishes specifically for hospital use. Both patients and employees {{are at risk for}} cross transmission of diseases and other health issues. The majority of these microorganisms are passed from person to person by various textiles. The increasing rate of drug-resistant bacteria only heightens the importance of finding safe and durable antimicrobial finishes. Several elements and natural compounds have inherent antimicrobial properties. Heavy metals and metallic compounds hold {{a large portion of the}} market for antimicrobial textiles. Cadmium, silver, copper, and mercury are all effective antimicrobial agents. Metal based finishes are fairly durable to repeated laundering making them appropriate for use as a reusable finish. Several natural, non-metallic, antimicrobial finishes exist. One of these natural antimicrobial finishes, Chitosan, is the deacetylated form of Chitin which is a main component in crustacean shells. Chitosan has been shown to be effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [117, 118, 119]. Researchers have responded to problems like this by experimenting with the currently available finishes available. Many antimicrobial textiles are treated with combinations of bioactive substances to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of the finishes and counter act the negative aspects of the treatments. By combining finishes, the occurrence of drug resistant strains forming from the finish is decreased. Another trend in experimentation with antimicrobial finishes consists of adding antimicrobial agents to synthetic fibres during the spinning process.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Bangladesh is {{now well}} renowned for spinning, {{fabricating}} and garmenting capabilities.

50|$|Household linens {{are stored}} near {{the area where}} they are used, when possible, for convenience. Otherwise, bed and <b>kitchen</b> and dining <b>linens</b> may be stored {{together}} in a linen closet or cupboard. There are many methods of folding linens for storage. For formal occasions, table linens may be ironed before use. Traditionally, table linens could be starched while ironing, to decrease wrinkling and retain a smooth, pristine appearance. Seasonal storage of linens {{led to the development}} of natural pest control methods in Europe to prevent moth larvae and other insects or rodents from eating the cloth. Sachets made of dried Margosa (neem), cloves, lavender, and other herbs are traditional, as are cedar wood chips.|$|R
50|$|The body {{is finally}} {{moved to the}} office, where Major Gowen stumbles across it and assumes that Leeman was shot dead as he slept. Meanwhile, Dr. Price is still waiting for his sausages, and gets into a brief quarrel with Manuel about breakfast time until Basil clears the {{misunderstanding}} up, notably by poking Manuel in the eye. Miss Tibbs, now recovered, goes to the office to confront Basil but, sees the dead body once more and faints. Mr. Leeman is then moved to the <b>kitchen</b> in the <b>linen</b> basket, until Dr. Price insists he be moved, and ends up in reception. When some people (who were shown earlier to be business associates) arrive at reception asking about Mr. Leeman, Basil thinks they are the undertakers. While he is talking to them, the linen basket with Leeman inside is taken away by the laundry men. Acting fast, the staff get him back and again try to hide him in several places, but Manuel loses his strength and gives up, instead hiding himself in the basket until Polly gets him out. Leeman's colleagues are informed of his death by Sybil and prepare to leave, while Basil hides the body behind the hat rack. A commotion occurs, and all the guests who were neglected, including Miss Tibbs (still in shock), Dr. Price (who had to cook his own sausages before realising that they were off), Mr. and Mrs. White (whose room was once again intruded upon), and Mrs. Chase (whose dog is ill from the tabasco sauce and the vet she requested hasn't been called), begin complaining.|$|R
