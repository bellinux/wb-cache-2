They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by Kurt Lewin and Carl Rogers and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became the National Training Laboratories (also known as the NTL Institute) that was created by the Office of Naval Research and the National Education Association in Bethel, Maine, in 1947.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} way of organising a secondary school in the UK uses a horizontal or Year System. Invariably, a Year 7 student joins a tutor group of about 25-30 fellow students all from the same Year. In the US this is sometimes called a home group and in the UK this system of pastoral organisation is called a tutor <b>group.</b> <b>A</b> <b>form</b> tutor, the person (usually a teacher) assigned to the tutor group, has oversight of tutees' pastoral and academic needs and usually stays with their form group throughout the students' time at the school. Tutor time (the time that the tutor and tutees actually spend together) is usually {{at the start of}} the day. Schools see this as a settling in time and an opportunity to get basic school administration done. The tutor task in the UK is to form a learning relationship with each tutee and act as a guide and mentor through the complexities of school life.|$|E

40|$|War Worlds” reads twentieth-century British and Anglophone {{literature}} {{to examine the}} social practices of marginal groups (pacifists, strangers, traitors, anticolonial rebels, queer soldiers) during the world wars. This dissertation shows that these diverse “enemies within” England and its colonies—those often deemed expendable for, but nonetheless threatening to, British state and imperial projects—provided writers with alternative visions of collective life in periods of escalated violence and social control. By focusing on {{the social and political}} activities of those who were not loyal citizens or productive laborers within the British Empire, “War Worlds” foregrounds the small <b>group,</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of collectivity frequently portrayed in the literature of the war years but typically overlooked in literary critical studies. I argue that this shift of focus from grand politics to small groups not only illuminates surprising social fissures within England and its colonies but provides a new vantage from which to view twentieth-century experiments in literary form.

40|$|Streptococci of <b>Group</b> <b>A</b> <b>form</b> long chains under {{a variety}} of conditions, the most {{interesting}} and useful of which is during growth in the presence of free homologous type-specific antibody. This phenomenon is the basis for a test for anti-streptococcal type-specific antibody, first described in 1957 (1), evaluated in 1959 (2), and improved and simplified in 1961 (3). The requirement for a metabolically active system, both for chaining and for subsequent dechaining, has been shown, but the manner by which type-specific antibody prevents dechaln]ng is uncertain. One interpretation is that the antigen-antibody reacdon somehow inhibits an enzymatic system which is otherwise continuously active in dechaining (4). Some general objections to this hypothesis {{as well as to the}} alternate one of polarized agglutination, have been given (3). The present studies are restricted to long chaining and dechaining in the presence of or after removal of, respectively, type-specific antibody. The data indicate that a form of end-to-end agglutination offers the simplest and most likely explanation for formation of long chains by Group A streptococci grown in the presence of homologous type-specific antibody...|$|E
40|$|Based on interviews, {{the purpose}} of the article is to study how Roma and Jews {{experience}} every- day violations and hate crime and how the victims deal with this exposure. The victims’ narratives are analysed using, for example, theories and research on anti-Semitism, anti-Ziganism, everyday racism and power relations. During the post-war period Jews have largely been seen by the majo- rity population as belonging to the white ”Swedishness”, while the Roma belong to one of many deeply despised minorities that often are exposed to everyday violations and hate crime. However, there is anti-Semitism in Sweden that in certain situations and circumstances is explicitly expres- sed in the form of abuse, threats or violence. The article describes and analyses how the victims of hate crime deal with this exposure and how the crimes affect them. Some Roma and Jews ”are forced” to live a kind of double life because they are afraid of being ”exposed” as a Roma or a Jew. For example, Jewish and Roma symbols are often spontaneously concealed. The damage that hate crime causes is spread beyond the individual to the victim’s entire <b>group,</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of ”message crimes”. The consequences for the individual concerned can be very serious. Roma and Jewish groups as a whole can also be affected by the restrictions imposed on their lives...|$|E
