40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} Internet identification, <b>Internet</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> use. The participants were 446 students (319 females and 127 males) from two universities in the UK and one university in Australia. Measures of <b>Internet</b> identification <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> anxiety were developed. The majority of participants were NOT anxious about using the Internet, although there were approximately 8 % who showed evidence of Internet anxiety. There was a significant and negative relationship between <b>Internet</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> use. Those who were more anxious about using the Internet used the Internet less, although the magnitude of effect was small. There was a positive and significant relationship between <b>Internet</b> use <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> identification. Those who scored high on the measure of Internet identification used the Internet more {{than those who did}} not. There was also a significant and negative relationship between <b>Internet</b> anxiety <b>and</b> <b>Internet</b> identification. Finally, males had a significantly higher Internet identification score than females. Implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
