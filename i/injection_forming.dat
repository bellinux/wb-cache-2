40|$|A {{fundamental}} question concerning {{the development of}} the extracellular matrix is what factors control the arrangement of collagen fibrils within a tissue {{and at the same time}} allow for the great diversity of geometric forms exhibited by collagen. In this report, we test the possibility that physical forces within the embryo serve to organize collagen fibers into regular patterns. In particular, we test the prediction that patterns of stress having this morphogenetic function are generated by cell traction, the contractile force exerted by cells to propel themselves. To study the effects of these mechanical forces on the extracellular matrix, type I collagen was fluorescently labeled and injected into developing chicken wing buds. When the injected limbs were allowed to develop and then examined histologically, the exogenous collagen was found incorporated within normal connective tissues of the wing. The labeled collagen became arranged according to its site of <b>injection,</b> <b>forming</b> parts of tendons, perichondria, cartilages, perineuria, and blood vessels. Since the injected collagen formed a gel within minutes of its injection, the subsequent incorporation of this performed collagen within organized structures cannot be explained in terms of molecular self-assembly or other mechanisms occurring during collagen deposition. These results demonstrate that, within developing tissues, patterns of forces exist that are capable of physically rearranging collagen and determining its long-range order...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{nuclear reactor}} {{accident}} at Fukushima NPP, the reactor core was {{damaged by the}} severe conditions such as very high temperature and sea water <b>injection,</b> <b>forming</b> {{a huge amount of}} nuclear fuel waste so called debris fuel. Since UO 2 fuel pellets are packed in the zircaloy cladding and the fuel assemblies were charged in the reactor core, the fuel debris consists of many types of the mixture of nuclear fuel and structural materials. Some of them are the mixture of metal and oxide, or mixtures after melting. Sulfurization method is one of the promising techniques for the separation and recovery of rare metals. Especially, the dry process has an advantage for the reduction of radioactive waste in nuclear engineering field. In this paper, sulfuization behavior of uranium oxides, zirconium oxide and metal as fuel and structural materials was studied by using carbon disulfide for the sulfurization treatment of fuel debris components. No reaction was observed for Uranium oxides in the presence of CS 2 at T< 773 K, while metal components, such as zirconium metal shows sulfurization at lower temperature. After the selective sulfurization treatment, separation of sulfurized materials from oxides or metals was examined by acid leaching method. Application of mechanochemical treatment was considered for the size reduction and effective sullfurization. When the mixture of simulated fuel debris was mechanochemically treated, the interaction of zirconium with UO 2 seems to occur forming the UO 2 -ZrO 2 solid solution...|$|E

40|$|We present multi-wavelength {{observations}} and modeling of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) that exhibit a simultaneous re-brightening in their X-ray and optical light curves, {{and are also}} detected at radio wavelengths. We show that the re-brightening episodes can be modeled by injection of energy into the blastwave and that in all cases the energy injection rate falls within the theoretical bounds expected for a distribution of energy with ejecta Lorentz factor. Our measured values of the circumburst density, jet opening angle, and beaming corrected kinetic energy {{are consistent with the}} distribution of these parameters for long-duration GRBs at both z~ 1 and z> 6, suggesting that the jet launching mechanism and environment of these events are similar to that of GRBs that do not have bumps in their light curves. However, events exhibiting re-brightening episodes have lower radiative efficiencies than average, suggesting {{that a majority of the}} kinetic energy of the outflow is carried by slow-moving ejecta, which is further supported by steep measured distributions of the ejecta energy as a function of Lorentz factor. We do not find evidence for reverse shocks over the energy injection period, implying that the onset of energy injection is a gentle process. We further show that GRBs exhibiting simultaneous X-ray and optical re-brightenings are likely the tail of a distribution of events with varying rates of energy <b>injection,</b> <b>forming</b> the most extreme events in their class. Future X-ray observations of GRB afterglows with Swift and its successors will thus likely discover several more such events, while radio follow-up and multi-wavelength modeling of similar events will unveil the role of energy injection in GRB afterglows.

The importance of three scenarios {{in the formation of the}} global SVC population is investigated through different approaches that include comparisons with data imaging from several spaceborne instruments and back-trajectories that document the history and behavior of air masses leading to a point in time and space where subvisible cirrus were detected. In order simplify the study of cloud formation processes, we singled out SVC with coherent temperature histories (mean variance lower than 4 K) according to back-trajectories along 5, 10 or 15 days (respectively 58, 25 and 11 % of SVC). Our results suggest that external processes, including local increases in liquid and hygroscopic aerosol concentration (either through biomass burning or volcanic <b>injection</b> <b>forming</b> sulfate-based aerosols in the troposphere or the stratosphere) have no noticeable short-term or mid-term impact on the SVC population. On the other hand, we find that ~ 60 % of air masses interacted with convective activity in the days before they led to cloud formation and detection, which correspond to 37 to 65 % of SVC. These results put forward the important influence of classical cloud formation processes compared to external influences in forming SVC. They support the view that the SVC population observed by CALIOP is an extension of the general upper tropospheric ice clouds population with its extreme thinness as its only differentiating factor...|$|E
