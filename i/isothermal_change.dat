40|$|Statistical {{considerations}} of ensembles of localized magnetic moments reveal an upper bound of the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> when only the magnetic {{degrees of freedom}} are considered. In this case, the maximum molar <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> {{is determined by the}} spin multiplicity and is equal to Rln(2 J+ 1), where J is the angular momentum of an individual atom. However, in materials with giant magnetocaloric effect, the <b>isothermal</b> field-induced entropy <b>change</b> goes beyond the spin-multiplicity limit due to field-activated elastic degrees of freedom. Recently, we investigated a model of pairs of exchange-coupled Ising spins with variable real-space positions. We showed, within a classical approximation for the elastic degree of freedom, that a vibrational entropy contribution can be activated via applied magnetic fields. Here we quantify the impact of quantum corrections in the low-temperature limit. We compare calculations that include elastic interaction with the rigid exchange model in the high-temperature limit. We find that quantum effects provide quantitative corrections in the low-temperature limit. In addition we show that the elastic contributions to the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> can be additive but, remarkably, it can also give rise to reduced <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> in certain temperature regions...|$|R

These operators act in periodic simply-connected waveguides, with either Dirichlet, or Neumann, or the third boundary condition. The main {{result is the}} absolute continuity of the spectra of such operators. The corner stone of the proof is an <b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> of variables, reducing the metric to a flat one and the waveguide to a straight strip. The main technical tool is the quasi-conformal variant of the Riemann mapping theorem. Comment: 36 page...|$|E

This change reflects {{a reduction in the}} amount of free volume which is quenched-in during manufacturing. We also measured the anelastic relaxation behaviour of thoroughly annealed samples. At 498 K it turns out that both processes are governed by a spectrum of relaxation times with the anelastic relaxation process having its main peak at a value which is slightly larger than that found for the disappearance of free volume. ...|$|E
40|$|Taking {{into account}} the phase {{fraction}} during transition for the first-order magnetocaloric materials, an improved <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> determination has been put forward based on the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) equation. It {{was found that the}} <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> value evaluated by our method is in excellent agreement with those determined from the Maxwell-relation (MR) for Ni-Mn-Sn Heusler alloys, which usually presents a weak field-induced phase transforming behavior. In comparison with MR, this method could give rise to a favorable result derived from few thermomagnetic measurements. More importantly, we can eliminate the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> overestimation derived from MR, which always exists in the cases of Ni-Co-Mn-In and MnAs systems with a prominent field-induced transition. These results confirmed that such a CC-equation-based method is quite practical and superior to the MR-based ones in eliminating the spurious spike and reducing measuring cost...|$|R
40|$|The spin- 1 / 2 Ising {{octahedron}} and dodecahedron with {{a unique}} antiferromagnetic interaction display an outstanding magnetization jump at zero magnetic field, which consequently leads to a giant magnetocaloric effect during the adiabatic demagnetization. In the present work we report temperature dependences of two basic magnetocaloric response functions: the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> and the adiabatic change of temperature. It is shown that the Ising octahedron and dodecahedron generally exhibit a large negative <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> upon increasing of the magnetic field, which serves in evidence of their cooling performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the giant magnetocaloric effect with <b>isothermal</b> field-induced entropy <b>change</b> beyond the spin-multiplicity limit gave rise to some indistinctness in the literature regarding the applicability of fundamental thermodynamics in data analysis. Those misleading interpretations concerning, for instance, the rigorousness of phenomenological thermodynamics are clarified here. Specifically, it is shown that the Maxwell relation incorporates contributions from the spin degrees of freedom and potential lattice degrees of freedom into the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change.</b> A minimalist model involving pairs of exchange-coupled, mobile Ising spins is investigated. It is explicitly shown that lattice degrees of freedom can be activated via applied magnetic fields and the integrated Maxwell relation contains this lattice contribution. A simple and intuitive analytic expression for the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> {{in the presence of}} field-activated lattice degrees of freedom is provided...|$|R
40|$|Magnetocaloric (MC) {{properties}} of GdMnO 3 single crystals are investigated using magnetic and magneto-thermal measurements. GdMnO 3 exhibits a giant MC effect (<b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> in magnetic entropy (-Delta S-M) similar to 31 J (kg K) (- 1) at 7 K and adiabatic change in temperature similar to 10 K at 19 K for magnetic field variation 0 - 80 kOe). Complex interactions between 3 d and 4 f magnetic sublattices influence MC properties. The rare-earth antiferromagnetic ordering induces an inverse MC effect (positive Delta S-M) along `a' and `c' axes whereas it's not seen along the `b' axis, revealing complex anisotropic magnetic ordering.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} susceptibility, {{specific heat}} and entropy of geometrically frustrated S = 1 / 2 XY antiferromagnet Er 2 Sn 2 O 7 are reported. It is shown, that temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility above nominally 10 K {{is governed by}} crystal field effects. Systematic study of specific heat in magnetic fields up to 7 T enabled the estimation of exchange coupling, J/k << 4. 6 K. Investigation of <b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> of magnetic entropy upon magnetization from 1 T to 7 T revealed the absence of enhanced magnetocaloric effect. The obtained results suggest that frustration parameter f ≈ 140 proposed for Er 2 Sn 2 O 7 earlier may be significantly overestimated. DOI: 10. 12693 /APhysPolA. 126. 264 PACS: 75. 10. Dg, 75. 50.

40|$|A clear {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} suctions {{is crucial for}} the study of the behaviour of plastic cement mortar and concrete, including plastic shrinkage cracking. In this paper, the expression relating the change in free energy of the pore water with an <b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> in pressure is first derived. Based upon definitions of suctions, it is then shown that total, matric, and osmotic suctions can all be expressed in the same thermodynamic form. The widely accepted, but not yet satisfactorily validated, assumption that the total suction comprises matric and osmotic components is then confirmed theoretically. The well-known Kelvin equation for matric suction, and Morse and van’t Hoff equations for osmotic suction are subsequently derived from the corresponding thermodynamic equations. The applicability of latter two equations in evaluating the osmotic suctions of cement mortar and concrete is highlighted...|$|E

The spectrum from 1 keV to 2 MeV, observed at X-ray energies by the Apollo X-ray spectrometer, is fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum with kT = 500 keV. The success of the fit implies that the source is optically thin, and it follows {{that it must be}} closer than 50 pc.

It is expected that, after exposing the samples to oxygen, the resistivity would increase monotonically as barriers become higher to finally reach a plateau at steady state. Here we present experimental results showing a nonmonotonic resistivity transient response that cannot {{be explained by}} only considering changes in the Schottky barrier heights. We provide an explanation based {{on the effects of}} intragrain oxygen diffusion that accounts for the observed main features of conduction in this polycrystalline material. Oxygen diffuses into the grains annihilating vacancies; the donor concentration is then reduced affecting the sample conductivity...|$|R

The resulting superior breakdown strength of hot-pressed PLZT enables the application of high electric field to induce a giant electrocaloric effect, in which the adiabatic change of temperature (ΔT) and the <b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> of entropy (ΔS) are around 2 times greater {{than those of the}} samples prepared by the conventional sintering approach using muffle furnace. Moreover, the addition of extra PbO to make up the loss of Pb in the high-temperature sintering leads to the further improvements in the phase composition and electrical properties of PLZT, due to inhibition of the pyrochlore phase formation. The relationship among the sintering conditions, the content of excess PbO, and the microstructure as well as the electrical characteristics of PLZT have been investigated in a systematic manner.

40|$|Kinetics of {{ordering}} in B 2 -type FeCo alloy was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Kinetic equation for B 2 -type ordering was generally {{derived from the}} two physical conditions, namely the symmetry between two sublattices in the B 2 -type structure and {{the stability of the}} equilibrium state. The general kinetic squation with third order term of the degree of order has an advantage over the others in that it is simpler in form and more general, and it is applicable to the analysis of the kinetic behavior on ordering in B 2 -type alloys. The variation of lattice constant on isothermal ordering for the equiatomic FeCo alloy was observed by X-ray diffraction, and analyzed using present kinetic equation. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>change</b> of lattice constant above 823 K was reproduced well by the equation, but not satisfactorily below 773 K, particularly about a two-step change of lattice constant obseved at an early stage of annealing.

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{mechanically}} driven magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in magneto-auxetic systems (MASs) {{in the vicinity of}} room temperature is possible and the effect can be colossal. Even at zero external magnetic field, the magnetic entropy change in this reversible process can be a few times larger in magnitude than {{in the case of the}} giant MCE discovered by Pecharsky and Gschneidner in Gd 5 (Si 2 Ge 2). MAS represent a novel class of metamaterials having magnetic insertions embedded within a non-magnetic matrix which exhibits a negative Poisson's ratio. The auxetic behaviour of the non-magnetic matrix may either enhance the magnetic ordering process or it may result in a transition to the disordered phase. In the MAS under consideration, a spin 1 / 2 system is chosen for the magnetic component and the well-known Onsager solution for the two-dimensional square lattice Ising model at zero external magnetic field is used to show that the <b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> in magnetic entropy accompanying the auxetic behaviour can take a large value at room temperature. The practical importance of our findings is that MCE materials used in present engineering applications may be further enhanced by changing their geometry such that they exhibit auxetic behaviour. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the barocaloric and magnetocaloric effects {{in a series of}} low-hysteresis Ni-Mn-In {{magnetic}} shape memory alloys. We show that the behaviour exhibited by several quantities that characterise these caloric effects (<b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change,</b> adiabatic temperature change and refrigerant capacity) can be rationalised in terms of the relative distance between the Curie point of the austenite and the martensitic transition temperature. It is found that the two caloric effects exhibit opposite trends. The behaviour of the barocaloric effect parallels that exhibited by the transition entropy change, thereby showing larger values for weakly magnetic samples. Regarding the magnetocaloric effect, the <b>isothermal</b> entropy <b>change</b> is maximum for those samples transforming martensitically close to the Curie point of the austenite. Such a maximum value does not correspond to the maximum adiabatic temperature change, and samples with martensitic transition slightly below the Curie point do have larger temperature changes {{as a result of the}} strongest sensitivity of the transition to the magnetic field.

40|$|Physical {{hardening}} is {{a phenomenon}} that takes place at low temperatures, producing time-dependent <b>isothermal</b> <b>changes</b> in the rheological properties of bituminous binders. Stiffening effects caused by physical hardening combine with those consequent to chemical ageing, thus promoting the build-up of thermally-induced stresses which may lead to premature pavement failure. The main goal {{of this paper was}} to investigate the influence of physical hardening on low tem-perature properties of bituminous binders tested in different ageing conditions. Moreover, reversibility of hardening phenomena was directly assessed by means of a dedicated testing protocol. The study, carried out by making use of the Bend-ing Beam Rheometer (BBR), considered four binders of different type and origin (two neat bitumens and two commercial SBS polymer-modified binders) and three ageing conditions (original, short-term ageing and long-term ageing). Obtained results, expressed in terms of a Physical Hardening Rate (PHR), showed a significant effect of chemical ageing on low temperature hardening of binders. In particular, rate of hardening was found to vary with temperature and to decrease with degree of ageing. Reversibility of the hardening process was also verified...|$|R

40|$|The {{magnetocaloric effect}} is the <b>isothermal</b> <b>change</b> of {{magnetic}} entropy and the adiabatic temperature change induced in a magnetic material when an {{external magnetic field}} is applied. In this work, we present an experimental setup to study this effect in metamagnetic transitions, using the differential thermal analysis technique, which consists in measuring simultaneously the temperatures of the sample of interest and a reference one while an external magnetic field ramp is applied. We have tested our system to measure the magnetocaloric effect in La 0. 305 Pr 0. 32 Ca 0. 375 MnO 3, which presents phase separation effects at low temperatures (T < 200 K). We obtain vs H curves, and analyze how the effect varies by changing {{the rate of the}} magnetic field ramp. Our results show that the intensity of the effect increases with the magnetic field change rate. We also have obtained the effective heat capacity of the system without the sample by performing calorimetric measurements using a pulse heat method, fitting the temperature change with a two tau description.
