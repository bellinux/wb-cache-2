25|$|The {{introduction}} of transistorized radios, and then microcontroller-based systems that decoded the location directly, continued to improve Loran-A systems while prices dropped. By the early 1970s such units were relatively common, although they remained relatively expensive compared to devices like a radio direction finder. But {{the improvement of}} electronics through this period was so rapid that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years before Loran-C units of similar size and cost were available. This led to the decision to open Loran-C to civilian use in 1974.|$|E

25|$|A dysplastic animal has {{probably}} {{lived with the}} condition since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months old, and has therefore grown up taking the chronic pain for granted and has {{learned to live with}} it. Dogs suffering such pain do not usually exhibit acute signs of pain. Sometimes, they will suddenly and abnormally sit down when walking, or refuse to walk or climb objects which they usually would, but this can equally be a symptom of many other things, including a thorn in the paw, or a temporary muscle pain. So pain recognition is less common a means of detection than the visible gait and other abnormalities described above.|$|E

Originally, the episode ended with Ms. Ellen being taken away by the Iraqi soldiers, leaving the impression that she was in fact an Iraqi fugitive.

500|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} by a fortification expert, Major Bock of the Festungs-Pionier-Stab 27 of the Fifteenth Army LVII Corps {{based in the}} Dieppe area. A limestone hill near the hamlet of Mimoyecques, [...] high and [...] from London, was chosen to house the gun. It had been selected with care; the hill in which the facility was built is primarily chalk with very little topsoil cover, and the chalk layer extends several hundred metres below the surface, providing a deep but easily tunnelled rock layer. The chalk is easy to excavate and strong enough to dig tunnels without using timber supports. Although the site's road links were poor, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometres west of the main railway line between Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer.|$|E

His body was laid in state for five days in a sanctuary at Rue Gassendi in Paris, where French and Vietnamese alike paid their respects. Hội's stature also allowed him to develop contacts with French President Charles de Gaulle, who favored neutralizing Vietnam in the early 1960s.

2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{years after}} the city of Siena had decided to abandon the massive {{expansion}} and redesign of their cathedral in 1355 that Florence decided to greatly expand theirs. A plan for the dome of Florence Cathedral was settled by 1357. However, in 1367 it was proposed to alter the church plan at the east end to increase {{the scale of the}} octagonal dome, widening it from 62 to 72 braccia, with the intent to further surpass the domes of Pisa and Siena, and this modified plan was ratified in 1368, under Master of Works Francesco Talenti. The construction guilds of Florence had sworn to adhere to the model of the dome created in 1367, with a [...] "quinto acuto" [...] pointed profile, but the scale of this new dome was so ambitious that experts for the Opera del Duomo, the board supervising the construction, expressed the opinion as early as 1394 that the dome could not be accomplished. The enlarged dome would span the entire [...] width of the three aisled nave, just 2 meters less than that of the Roman Pantheon, the largest dome in the world. And because the distances between the angles of the octagon were even farther apart at , the average span of the dome would be marginally wider than that of the Pantheon. At 144 braccia, the height of the dome would evoke the holy number of the Heavenly Jerusalem mentioned in the Book of Revelation. By 1413, {{with the exception of one}} of the three apses, the east end of the church had been completed up to the windowed octagonal drum but the problem of building the huge dome did not yet have a solution. In 1417, the master builder in charge of the project retired and a competition for dome designs was begun in August 1418. Brunelleschi's dome, designed in 1418, follows the height and curvature mandated in 1367.|$|E
