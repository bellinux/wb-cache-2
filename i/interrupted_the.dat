50|$|When {{a domain}} is {{discarding}} <b>interrupts,</b> <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> passes over <b>the</b> stage {{occupied by the}} domain and continues onto the other stages. When a domain terminates <b>interrupts</b> then <b>the</b> <b>interrupts</b> that are terminated by it are not propagated to latter stages. Interrupt discarding and termination is only possible when the OS in a domain recognizes Adeos.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Interrupter,</b> a melodramatic villain {{clad in a}} black cape, {{a purple}} ruffled shirt, and wearing long black hair and a {{handlebar}} mustache, <b>the</b> <b>Interrupter</b> constantly interrupts Conan by finishing his sentences for him, always knowing exactly what Conan is going to say, even when it's denigrating to <b>the</b> <b>Interrupter</b> himself. Occasionally, if the sketch runs long enough, the roles will eventually become reversed, with <b>the</b> <b>Interrupter</b> starting sentences and Conan doing <b>the</b> <b>interrupting.</b> Eventually <b>the</b> sketches evolved so that the first celebrity guest, and O'Brien himself, would replace <b>the</b> <b>Interrupter</b> as <b>the</b> one <b>interrupting.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{backstage}} segment occurred where CM Punk {{was interviewed}} regarding his title {{defense in the}} Championship Scramble later in the evening. Randy Orton <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> interview, and as he spoke with Punk, Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Manu attacked Punk. Kofi Kingston tried to help Punk. After they had attacked both Punk and Kingston, Orton used his chance to perform a running punt on Punk.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, an {{explosion}} {{on a ship}} at the Port of Texas City caused fires and destruction throughout the city's industrial complex and other ships creating one of nation's worst industrial accidents. The tragedy caused more than five hundred deaths, more than four thousand injuries, and more than $50 million in damage ($ million in today's dollars). Though the city's growth and prosperity were <b>interrupted,</b> <b>the</b> city and the business leaders were able to rebuild.|$|E

Her death inspires John to dedicate his life to hunting down Azazel, {{at the same time}} training Sam and Dean to hunt supernatural creatures.|$|E

5|$|Only two of {{the ships}} had bulges added to them through this program, Maryland (completed 1 August 1941) and Colorado (26 February 1942); the attack on Pearl Harbor <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> refits {{intended}} for West Virginia and the two Tennessees. The surprise strike did not touch Colorado, which was at Puget Sound, and did not hurt Maryland very badly; however, West Virginia was severely damaged and needed a major refit at minimum.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's former bandmates, Lennon {{initially}} {{agreed to}} take part in the concert without his wife and musical partner Yoko Ono, as Harrison had apparently stipulated. Lennon then allegedly had an argument with Ono as a result of this agreement and left New York in a rage two days before the concerts. Starr's commitment had never been in question, and he <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> filming of his movie Blindman in Almeria, Spain, in order to attend. Paul McCartney declined to take part, however, citing the bad feelings caused by the Beatles' legal problems on their break-up.|$|E

5|$|At first Furious {{made several}} trips to West Africa, but {{she began to}} ferry {{aircraft}} to Gibraltar in 1941. An unsuccessful attack on German-occupied ports on the Arctic Ocean <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> ferry missions in mid-1941. Furious was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942. She made several more ferry trips in mid-1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in Vichy French Algeria {{as part of the}} opening stages of Operation Torch in November 1942. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> ceremonies, denouncing the act in a loud voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to develop a new sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> x86 architecture, <b>interrupts</b> {{are handled}} through <b>the</b> <b>Interrupt</b> Dispatch Table (IDT). When a device {{triggers}} an <b>interrupt,</b> <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> flag (IF) in the flags register is {{set and the}} processor's hardware looks for an <b>interrupt</b> handler in <b>the</b> table entry corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> number, or IRQ. Interrupt handlers usually save the state of all or some registers before handling it and restore the registers when done.|$|R
50|$|Interrupt rate {{limiting}} {{must be carefully}} configured for optimum results. For example, an Ethernet controller with interrupt {{rate limiting}} will buffer the packets it receives from the network in between each <b>interrupt.</b> If <b>the</b> rate is set too low, the controller's buffer will overflow, and packets will be dropped. The rate {{must take into account}} how fast the buffer may fill between <b>interrupts,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> latency between <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> and <b>the</b> transfer of the buffer to the system.|$|R

5|$|Melina {{made her}} {{official}} debut in WWE as a villainess, resuming {{her role as}} the manager of MNM, on the April 14, 2005 episode of SmackDown!. The team <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> first ever Carlito's Cabana interview segment, where {{one half of the}} WWE Tag Team Champions, Rey Mysterio, was a guest. Melina insulted Mysterio and had Mercury and Nitro attack him, leading to MNM's in-ring debut the next week on SmackDown! in a title match. The team won the match against Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero, starting their first WWE Tag Team Title reign.|$|E
5|$|Rob Van Dam (RVD) and Bill Alfonso <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> promo, with RVD stating it {{had nothing}} to do with SmackDown!. RVD claimed that WWE {{deserved}} no credit, that the interview was a shoot with no scripts, and that missing One Night Stand was worse than missing WrestleMania. The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{requested}} {{help from}} British Admiral William Bowles. He wrote from Chile {{and expected to}} find him in Buenos Aires, but Bowles had embarked for Río de Janeiro. Bowles considered that San Martín was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism. San Martín did not obtain the ships and <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> correspondence with Bowles for some months. He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.|$|E

50|$|For {{reasons of}} performance, the handler will {{typically}} be initiated {{in the memory}} and execution context of the running process, to which it has no special connection (<b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> is essentially usurping the running context—process time accounting will often accrue time spent handling <b>interrupts</b> to <b>the</b> <b>interrupted</b> process). However, unlike <b>the</b> <b>interrupted</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>interrupt</b> is usually elevated by a hard-coded CPU mechanism to a privilege level high enough to access hardware resources directly.|$|R
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border had a {{substantial}} economic and social impact on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise <b>interrupted.</b> <b>The</b> tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left open. When {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E
5|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June. One was constructed at Arromanches by the British, the other at Omaha by the Americans. Severe storms on 19 June <b>interrupted</b> <b>the</b> landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The repaired Arromanches harbour was able to receive around 6,000 tons of materiel daily and was in continuous use {{for the next ten}} months, but most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} National Congress of the CPC {{was held}} on 23–31 July 1921. With only 50 members {{in the beginning of}} 1921, the CPC organization and authorities grew tremendously.

Only 12 delegates attended the congress, with neither Li nor Chen being able to attend, the latter sending a personal representative in his stead.
