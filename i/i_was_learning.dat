You {{have to learn to}} {{conserve}} your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E
25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

500|$|Arriving back in London in October 1952, David began a {{relationship}} with an old flame from India, Peter Higgins, a divorced stockbroker; {{it was the beginning}} of the happiest period of her life. She spent the following months writing the book, recreating the recipes to work out the correct measurements. She felt less emotionally connected to Italy than with Greece and southern France and found the writing [...] "uncommonly troublesome", although [...] "as recipe after recipe came out... I realized how much <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning,</b> and how enormously these dishes were enlarging my own scope and enjoyment". Italian Food was published in November 1954. At the time, many of the ingredients used in the recipes were difficult to obtain in Britain. Looking back in 1963, David wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|... "One More Chance" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of F major, with a basic sequence of Cmaj7–Bm7–Am7–Bm7 as its chord progression, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to B4. The verses start off with F major and then the chorus leans towards D minor, the bridge and the ending sections changes to D major. Louis Virtel from Idolator said on the song [...] " [...] begs for forgiveness, and her only accompaniment is stark acoustic strumming." [...] Madonna utilized her vocal lessons for Evita during the recording of [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". She said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> for the recording of Evita." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{of these}} {{paintings}} was St. Jerome in the Wilderness, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life, as evidenced in his diary: [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> to live; I was only learning to die." [...] Although {{the painting is}} barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies {{the middle of the}} picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed somewhat from above. His kneeling form takes on a trapezoid shape, with one arm stretched to {{the outer edge of the}} painting and his gaze looking in the opposite direction. J. Wasserman points out the link between this painting and Leonardo's anatomical studies. Across the foreground sprawls his symbol, a great lion whose body and tail make a double spiral across the base of the picture space. The other remarkable feature is the sketchy landscape of craggy rocks against which the figure is silhouetted.|$|E

500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for the {{extended}} remix of [...] "Video Phone" [...] {{was directed by}} Hype Williams, along with producer Cisco Newman and art director Lenny Tso. On October 15, 2009, a spokesperson for Williams confirmed to MTV, that reports of Gaga and Beyoncé working on the music video together were true. It was shot at Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, under tight security. The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video. She said, [...] "When I was doing her video with her, she called me and she said, 'What {{do you want to}} do?' [...] And I'm like, 'I don't want to show up in some frickin' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video.' I said, 'I want to do you.' [...] I want to do my version of Beyoncé. So the whole time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> the choreography they were calling me Gee-yoncé." [...] Later, during an interview with MTV News, she explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "You'll See" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of G Major, with a basic sequence of Em–D–Em as its chord progression during the first verse, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. The sequence shifts to Em–C–D–G–C–F during the chorus. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to C5. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. String synths and drums build the track further with the second verse seeing the singer harmonizing with herself. During the recording of the track, the singer used her vocal lessons for Evita; she said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> for the recording [...]" [...] Lyrically the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. When asked if the track was about revenge, the singer replied: [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself", but also adding that [...] "there's another side too which is—'Don't fuck with me, I don't need anybody. I can do what I want'".|$|E

2500|$|This apprenticeship... {{became a}} part of [...] how things were recorded. I started to learn {{microphone}} placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room... And so bit by bit <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> really how not to record.|$|E
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed {{to me as if}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> it for the first time" [...] when, {{according}} to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second section}} opens with another nostalgic soliloquy, which famously {{begins with the}} words: [...] "I wouldn't know what other people are like, but for myself, when I start {{thinking}} about my birthplace, Humulești, about the post holding the flue of the stove, round which mother used to tie a piece of string with tassels {{at the end of}} it, with which the cats played till they plopped, the earthen ledge of the stove that I used to cling to when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>learning</b> to walk with my head held high, the place on top of the stove where I used to hide when we children played at hide-and-seek, as well as other games and delights full of childlike fun and charm, I seem to feel my heart pound with joy even to this moment!" [...] The text goes on to recount his mother's superstitious beliefs, which he himself had come to share. Following Smaranda's indication, Nică believed that blond-haired boys such as himself could invoke sunny weather by playing outside on a rainy day, that various dangers could be cursed away, and that marking the human body with soot or mud meant protection against the evil eye. The narrator also mentions his regret at not having shown his mother his full appreciation, and refers to childhood as [...] "the merry age".|$|E

6000|$|At {{last she}} was moved from her silence, {{and her voice}} came dull and hard. [...] "I have learnt how little there is to choose between you," [...] she said.

60|$|I {{looked at}} my watch. It was twelve o’clock. My back was aching sorely, and I felt {{extremely}} tired and hungry.
