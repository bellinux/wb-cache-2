30|$|In {{the first}} step, {{information}} of the currently active topology is retrieved from the energy management system (EMS) and network management system (NMS). The information from both sources is mapped onto {{each other in}} order to derive physical and cyber dependencies between both subsystems. This means in particular, with respect to physical dependencies it is derived which parts of the electrical system are delivering power to which parts of the <b>ICT</b> <b>system.</b> Regarding cyber dependencies it is derived which parts of the <b>ICT</b> <b>system</b> are involved to provide necessary data communication capabilities to the corresponding grid components. In the next step, the interdependency description is subject to expert analysis. In this step, in particular certain derived interdependencies might be removed as, e.g., independent power supplies (UPS) or redundant ICT components provide protection against physical or informational dependencies.|$|R
40|$|Smart {{power grid}} enables {{intelligent}} automation {{at all levels}} of power system operation, from electricity generation at power plants to power usage at households. The key enabling factor of an efficient smart grid is its built-in information and communication technology (ICT) that monitors the real-time system operating state and makes control decisions accordingly. As an important building block of the <b>ICT</b> <b>system,</b> power system state estimation is of critical importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation. Compared to conventional arithmetic-based security analysis, the graphical characterization of state estimation security provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending and attacking the <b>ICT</b> <b>system</b> of smart grid. We also highlight several promising future research directions on graph-based security analysis and its applications in smart power grid.

40|$|Emergency {{management}} systems (EMS) {{are important and}} complex examples of Cyber-Physical-Human systems that are deployed so as to optimise the outcome of an emergency from a human perspective. They use sensor networks, networked decision nodes and communications with evacuees and first responders to optimise the overall Quality of Service to benefit primarily human beings in terms of survival, health and safety, and the the protection of nature, property and valuable infrastructures. The use of technology for emergency management also has side effects in terms of failures and malicious attacks of the <b>ICT</b> <b>system,</b> so that the outcome {{will be affected by}} how well the <b>ICT</b> <b>system</b> operates under stress. Thus this paper surveys research on wireless sensor-assisted EMS, including networking, distributed control, and knowledge discovery.
