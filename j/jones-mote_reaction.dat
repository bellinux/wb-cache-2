40|$|Jones-Mote reactivity, {{defined as}} a delayed-type skin reaction, occurs transiently early {{in the course of}} {{immunization}} with protein antigens or hapten conjugates with or without the adjuvant effect of tubercle bacilli. The skin reaction is typically a flat, well-circumscribed erythema with little induration beginning at about 6 hr, reaching a peak at 18 – 24 hr, and fading or gone at 48 hr. Immunogenic carrier requirements for hapten-specific Jones-Mote hypersitivity resemble those of antibody production rather than of classic delayed hypersensitivity. Skin test antigen requirements indicate that the <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reaction</b> involves an active stimulatory response rather than combination with preformed antibody, since ABA conjugates of nonimmunogenic D-polymers do not work. Studies with ALS and carrageenan suggest that the lymphocyte is an important contributor to the reaction, but the macrophage is not. Because the reactions studied here are operationally different from those described by Jones and Mote and because they have a characteristic histology, the term "cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity" is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -Peripheral-blood basophils were counted, {{in thick}} smears, in samples from {{patients}} with primary bronchial carcinoma, from {{patients in the}} same wards and from normal individuals. The median counts for patients with other chest conditions (15 - 5 / 4 d) and bronchial-carcinoma patients free of tumour months to years after resection (16 / 1 l) {{did not differ from}} those for normal individuals (19 / 1,u), but tumour-bearers showed higher counts (median 33 / 1 z), 24 / 41 having counts above the highest count in normal individuals (29 / 1 l) : P< 0. 002). The highest values were in patients with squamous bronchial carcinoma, apparently reflecting spontaneous challenge of an anti-tumour immune response. In those tested at the time of diagnosis, higher values in both lymphocyte and basophil counts were related to surgical resectability. BASOPHIL LEUCOCYTES are known to be involved in immediate hypersensitivity and the cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (<b>Jones-Mote)</b> <b>reaction,</b> but their overal...|$|E
40|$|The {{adjuvant}} {{activity of}} liposomes coated with mannan-cholesterol was studied in mice. Ovalbumin (OVA) was reconstituted into liposomes {{as a model}} antigen. The adjuvant activity was assessed by the following two immunological responses: delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) footpad swelling responses and in vitro release of interferon-γ and interleukin- 4 by regional lymph node cells. First, we studied dose effects on DTH responses of total lipid, mannan-cholesterol and OVA used for liposomes. The minimal doses per mouse required for the induction of optimal responses were as follows; 1 μg of OVA, 10 μg of mannan-cholesterol and 336 μg of total lipid. Second, immunological and histopathological studies showed the following two points: 1) mannan-coated liposomes induced a tuberculintype DTH response while non-coated liposomes elicited a <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reaction,</b> and 2) mannan-coated liposomes induced obvious microabscesses but non-coated liposome did not. Third, the inoculation of mannan-coated liposomes rendered the regional lymph node cells to release {{a large amount of}} interferon-γ with little IL- 4 against OVA while non-coated lipo-some released neither of the lymphokines. These results indicated that mannan-coated lipo-somes are a potent adjuvant to induce type 1 helper T cells but have a disadvantage to form microabscesses at the inoculation sites...|$|E
40|$|<b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions</b> are delayed, erythematous, and mildly {{indurated}} cutaneous reactions originally {{described in}} humans sensitized by skin injection of heterologous proteins. Similar reactions in guinea pigs contain many basophils and are called cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity. In contrast, guinea pigs immunized with mycobacterial adjuvants have classical tuberculin-type delayed hypersensitivity reactions, which contain few basophils. This {{has led to}} a new classification of delayed responses, based largely on {{the presence or absence of}} basophils. We induced sensitization for <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions</b> in 20 normal humans by intradermal injections of keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Skin tests with KLH 1 wk later showed erythematous and indurated delyaed reactions in all subjects. Rebuck skin windows showed specific accumulations of basophils with a delayed time-course in 18 of 20 subjects. In 12 normals sensitized with oxazolone-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates, skin reactions and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation showed carrier and not hapten specificity, suggesting that cutaneous responses were probably mediated by T cells. A comparative study of strongly positive PPD skin tests in patients with tuberculosis showed significant basophil accumulations in five of nine subjects. Thus, basophils occurred in human tuberculin and <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions</b> and were not a distinguishing feature of <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions.</b> We suggest that the occurrence of basophils at delayed reactions is under complex regulation and that basophil accumulations are an aspect of delayed hypersensitivity, rather than an indication of a distinctive and separate response...|$|R
40|$|Delayed-onset {{erythematous}} skin reactions elicited {{in adult}} guinea pigs sensitized with protein antigens in incomplete Freund's adjuvant {{have been called}} "Jones-Mote " reactions to differentiate them from classic tuberculin type delayed hypersensitivity (1). However, this distinction has depended on relatively minor gross and microscopic differences and {{on the fact that}} <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions,</b> in contrast to delayed hypersensitivity, may be elicited only at early intervals after sensitization (2, 3). It is not surprising, therefore, that many workers have regarded Jones-Mote reactivity as a weak expression of delayed hypersensitivity (4). We have previously presented immunochemical and biologic data which permit a further distinction between Jones-Mote and classic delayed hypersensitivity reactions (5, 6). The two categories of reaction were shown to have different carrier requirements for hapten-specific sensitization but similar requirements for the expression of skin test reactivity. It was suggested that both reactions involve sensitized lymphoid cells, and that <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions</b> d...|$|R
40|$|Dvorak and {{co-workers}} have recently drawn attention to {{an entirely new}} class of hypersensitivity reaction characterized by infiltrates of basophils (1, 2). In guinea pigs, this cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) 1 is delayed in time-course but unlike classical delayed type (tuberculin) sensitivity (DH) the basophil-containing reactions show less induration and are not associated with the production of macrophage migration inhibition factor (3). CBH has been related to <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reactions</b> (4, 5), originally described in man, and accumulations of basophils have been noted in patients with contact dermatitis (6). In guinea pigs dense infiltrates of basophils have been demonstrated in: contact reactions (7), immunity to viruses (8) and ticks (9), allograft rejection (10), and tumor immunity (11). Thus basophil hypersensitivity {{appears to be a}} widely occurring immune inflammatory response. The crucial demonstration of basophils in these reactions has until now required the elaborate tissue preparation techniques of electron microscopy. In the experiments reported here basophil hypersensitivity was demonstrated b...|$|R
40|$|Delayed {{hypersensitivity}} (DH) reaction can {{be induced}} in mice by intravenous sensitization with sheep erythrocytes (SRBC). However, as the sensitizing procedure {{is quite different}} from a usual mode of sensitization for DH using complete Freund's adjuvant (FCA), the nature of this reaction has been a matter of controversy. In an attempt to characterize this reaction, we placed special interest on two possibilities regarding the nature of this reaction; <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>reaction</b> or tuberculin type DH. From the kinetics study on the DH after challenge, the DH reaction to SRBC in mice by intravenous sensitization was clearly distinguished from the Arthus reaction. The dose-response pattern of this reaction also suggested that the contribution of Arthus reactivity to delayed reactivity was negligible. Cell reconstitution experiments revealed this DH to be quantitatively thymus cell dependent. Furthermore, this DH required macrophages at its manifestation stage, and appearance of basophil infiltration at the lesion was absent. In addition, strain difference and ageing of host mice influenced the DH reaction in exactly the same fashion in which these factors influence the tuberculin type-DH induced by subcutaneous sensitization with methylated human serum albumin (MHSA) in FCA. Taken collectively, it was concluded that this DH reaction can be categorized as the tuberculin type...|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} report of increased intensity and prolongation of contact hypersensitivity in animals pre-treated with cyclophosphamide (CY) {{has been confirmed}} using other immunosuppressive agents. Melphalan, ICRF 159 and azathioprine caused a similar increase in contact sensitivity reactions, whereas busulphan, procarbazine and chlorambucil were inactive in this respect. The increased contact hypersensitivity {{was not associated with}} increased lymph node activity. Pre-treatment with CY, ICRF 159 and melphalan also caused increased intensity and prolonged <b>Jones—Mote</b> type <b>reactions</b> so that they resembled tuberculin-type reactions. This was associated with a marked reduction in γ 1 antibody production. It is therefore suggested that Jones—Mote hypersensitivity is a further example of a T-lymphocyte reaction modulated by a B-lymphocyte response...|$|R
40|$|Guinea-pigs were inoculated {{into the}} testis with viable Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus and {{elicitation}} of skin reactions {{was carried out}} with 5 x 10 (6) syngeneic testicular cells 1 week later. Delayed-in-onset erythematous skin reactions against testicular cells were detected only when guinea-pigs were inoculated into the testis with L. monocytogenes. However, erythematous skin reactions were not detected when guinea-pigs were inoculated with E. coli, P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. Histological examination showed many infiltrating basophils in the erythematous skin reaction sites, and erythema was not accompanied by induration. Accordingly, the type of delayed skin reaction elicited with testicular cells 1 week after the inoculation of L. monocytogenes was considered as <b>Jones-Mote</b> type. These <b>reactions</b> were specific for testicular cells since the erythema or infiltrating basophils could not be detected after elicitation with sheep blood cells. Histological examination showed many infiltrating basophils at the skin reaction sites when guinea-pigs were inoculated with E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Dissociation between erythematous skin reactions and basophil infiltration was observed. Erythematous skin reactions were not detected when guinea-pigs with L. monocytogenes intravenously or subcutaneously...|$|R
