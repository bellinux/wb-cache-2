500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Carey Bryson of the About.com {{said that}} [...] "parents {{will also be}} pleased, as the episode contains no rude words or inappropriate jokes." [...] In his review for the Blogcritics, Maddy Pumilia wrote [...] "Like most SpongeBob episodes, this episode was comic genius. I especially enjoyed Mr. Krabs' love affair with his cash register, Cashy. It's hilarious. Best part of the show, in my opinion." [...] Ian Jane of DVD Talk said [...] " [...] is absolutely worth a watch thanks to the series high standard of quality, quirky animation, and multilayered humor." [...] Erich Asperschlager of DVD Verdict called the episode [...] "a fun take on beach bunny surf fare, and is backed by a decent sextet of recent SpongeBob adventures." [...] David Hinckly of the New York Daily News gave the episode 4/5 stars and said [...] "It's all <b>good</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> never forget to have fun." [...] The Daily Mirror described the vocal appearance of Johnny Depp as [...] "totally wavelicious (or something)." [...] LJ Perez of News Observer said that the character of Johnny Depp [...] "looks more like Patrick Swayze's surfing bank robber from the so-bad-it's-good movie 'Point Break' than he does any character Depp has ever portrayed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself. She devoted most of {{her attention to the}} dialogue: [...] "What Stout writes actually sounds <b>good</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> say it out loud, but the stuff that makes you laugh out loud and fall {{on the floor in the}} books doesn't work most of the time when you transpose it directly into actors' mouths. Frequently I end up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout. I see the script process as writing his second draft." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unterberger {{concluded}} that the song [...] "is about a relationship that’s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about {{to keep it going}} just the same…until the chorus, at which point he decides that it’s not worth the trouble. No, it doesn’t make sense, but it’s still stirring, beautiful in its own weird way, and undeniably unforgettable. And frankly, we wouldn’t want it any other way." [...] Kevin Richardson, member of the band, explained in an interview that, [...] "Ultimately the song really doesn't make much sense." [...] Richardson also wrote that Max Martin, who co-wrote and co-produced the song, barely spoke English. [...] "His English has gotten much better, but at the time...," [...] said Richardson. [...] "There are a lot of songs out there like that don't make sense," [...] he continues, [...] "but make you feel <b>good</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> sing along to them, and that's one of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lee Norris portrays Marvin [...] "Mouth" [...] McFadden, one of Lucas's oldest friends (they {{were both}} {{members of a}} group of {{children}} who played together at the Rivercourt, an outdoor basketball court in Tree Hill). Schwahn spoke of seeing himself in Mouth. Norris said that, during the spring break in his junior year at school, when the pilot for One Tree Hill came up, he drove alone to the casting director and Mark Schwahn. [...] " [...] was easy for me to play because I was this big college basketball fan, and I even wore my college team t-shirt to the audition," [...] said Norris, adding that [...] "at the end of the day, I think Mouth always remains a good guy in his heart and it's absolutely good to play that, because you feel <b>good</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have a character like that on TV. Even if he doesn't always do the right thing, you know it's coming from a good place." [...] Mouth is unlucky in love.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s <b>good</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
