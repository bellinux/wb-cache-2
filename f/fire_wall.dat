Heat activated sprinkling systems were required for the fly space above the stage. At this time in New York City, uniformed fire department officers became permanent attendees of every theatrical production. These 'Theatre Detail Officers' were required {{to be in the}} theatre a half-hour before the performance, test the fire alarms, inspect <b>fire</b> <b>wall</b> doors and the fire curtain, and, during performances, ensure that aisles, passageways and fire exits remain clear and accessible.|$|E
2500|$|It was a two-seat, single-engined low-winged monoplane, mounted {{originally}} on twin floats. [...] Like {{the slightly}} earlier Short Cockle, Satellite and Springbok, {{it had a}} duralumin monocoque fuselage of oval cross section. [...] There were a pair of tandem open cockpits over the wing fitted with dual controls. Contemporary commentators regarded the mounting of the upright four cylinder [...] ADC Cirrus I engine as particularly neatly done, in a U-shaped extension of the monocoque which initially left {{the top of the}} engine exposed. This engine was changed for an [...] Cirrus II in January 1928. [...] The fuel tank was immediately behind the <b>fire</b> <b>wall,</b> high enough to gravity feed the carburettor. There was a direct reading fuel gauge above the tank, {{just in front of the}} forward cockpit, enclosed a in variety of fairings over the Mussel's lifetime.|$|E

50|$|So {{long as a}} {{computer}} network runs entirely over physical hardware and cabling, it is a physical network. As such it can be protected by physical firewalls and <b>fire</b> <b>walls</b> alike; {{the first and most}} important protection for a physical computer network always was and remains a physical, locked, flame-resistant door. Since the inception of the Internet this was the case, and structural <b>fire</b> <b>walls</b> and network firewalls were for a long time both necessary and sufficient.|$|R
50|$|Openings - Other {{openings}} in <b>Fire</b> <b>walls,</b> such as doors and windows, {{must also be}} fire-rated fire door assemblies and fire window assemblies.|$|R
50|$|Penetrations - Penetrations through <b>fire</b> <b>walls,</b> such as for {{pipes and}} cables, must be {{protected}} with a listed firestop assembly designed {{to prevent the spread}} of <b>fire</b> through <b>wall</b> penetrations. Penetrations (holes) must not defeat the structural integrity of the wall, such that the wall cannot withstand the prescribed fire duration without threat of collapse.|$|R

5000|$|A {{fire barrier}} wall, or a fire partition, is a fire-rated wall {{assembly}} that provides {{lower levels of}} protection than typically provided by a <b>fire</b> <b>wall.</b> The main differences are that these fire resistant walls are not structurally self-sufficient.|$|E
50|$|A high {{challenge}} <b>fire</b> <b>wall</b> is a wall used {{to separate}} transformers, structures, or buildings or a wall subdividing a building with high fire challenge occupancies, having enhanced fire resistance ratings and enhanced appurtenance protection {{to prevent the}} spread of fire, and having structural stability.|$|E

5000|$|Fire rating - Fire {{walls are}} {{constructed}} {{in such a}} way as to achieve a code-determined fire-resistance rating, thus forming part of a fire compartment's passive fire protection.

30|$|Depending on the {{initiating}} event {{impairment of}} {{passive fire protection}} may also occur, especially when considering antagonistic attacks, e.g. <b>fire</b> <b>walls</b> may be damaged, structural fire protection may be damaged or evacuation routes may be blocked as recognized in the literature review. This is considered in the second box in Figure  3.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main classifications of fire rated walls: fire walls, fire barriers, and fire partitions.
