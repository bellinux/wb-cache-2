50|$|The ICUMSA Methods Book {{contains}} detailed {{instructions for}} analyzing raw, cane, white, beet, molasses, plantation white and specialty sugars. Among these are methods for determination of dry solids content by polarimetry, <b>densimetry</b> and refractometry, color (extinction coefficient at 420 nm), reducing sugars, {{and the presence}} of metals such as arsenic and copper. The Methods Book also contains polynomials and tables (derived from the polynomials) which relate the refractive index of solutions of pure sucrose, glucose, fructose and invert sugar to the strength of those solutions. These are to be used with the analysis methods that characterize sugars by refractometric means but find wide application outside the sugar industry as the sucrose polynomial is built into the firmware of modern refractometers and is the basis for calibration of purely optical refractometers which read in Brix. Temperature correction factors, also derived from the polynomials, are the basis for the Automatic Temperature Compensation features found in those instruments. Thus, a vintner measuring the Brix of juice from his grapes by means of a refractometer accepts a sugar content reading based on the refractive properties of sucrose {{despite the fact that the}} primary sugar in grape juice is fructose, not sucrose. This usually does not result in significant error.|$|E

The students average percent fat is 10. 61 %± 2. 8 % with values from 6 % to 19 %. For the same equation, applied to 50 subjects, the difference between the calculated value and the value, measured by <b>densimetry,</b> ranges from - 5. 9 % to + 3. 4 % at best and from - 9. 7 % to + 10. 5 % at worst. That is to say a total variation from 9. 3 % to 20. 2 %. For the same subject, the difference between the calculated value, by each of the twenty equations, and the value, measured by <b>densimetry,</b> ranges from - 4. 7 % to + 5. 8 % at best and from - 10. 9 % to + 8. 9 % at worst.

It happens that a student has a negative value of total percent fat, calculated by an anthropometric equation or a value three times higher than the value by <b>densimetry.</b> The equation content does not assure a better validity. The use of an anthropometric equation, found in the literature, to calculate the total percent fat of a subject is to avoid.

40|$|Determination of {{the volume}} content of ethanol in the alcohol {{products}} in practice is usually determined by pycnometry, electronic <b>densimetry,</b> or <b>densimetry</b> using a hydrostatic balance in accordance with Commission Regulation No 2870 / 2000. However, these methods determine directly only density of the tested liquid sample and {{does not take into}} account the effects of other volatile components such as aldehydes, esters and higher alcohols. So they are appropriate only for binary water-ethanol solutions in accordance with international table adopted by the International Legal Metrology Organization in its Recommendation No 22. Availability notable concentrations of the higher alcohols and ethers in different alcohol-based products, e. g. in whisky, cognac, brandy, wine as well as in waste alcohol and alcohol beverage production, leads to the significant contribution of these compounds in the value of the density of tested alcohol-containing sample. As a result, determination {{of the volume}} of ethanol content for such alcohol products in gives the value of the strength, which may significantly differ from the true one. Using incorrectly calculated volume content of ethyl alcohol leads to incorrect results determining the quantities of volatile compounds in the alcohol-containing products, expressed in milligrams per liter of absolute alcohol. We propose experimental results of the method of correct determination of ethanol and other volatile compounds content in waste products of alcohol and alcoholic beverage industry by gas chromatography. Calculations are based on the measured value of sample density and volatile compound concentrations expressed in mg per liter of absolute alcohol [JAFC 61 (2013) 2950].

Additionally, supercritical isotherms of excess adsorption for CO 2 and the same porous solid were measured gravimetrically using a precise magnetically coupled microbalance. Pore fluid densities and total adsorption isotherms increased monotonically with increasing density of the bulk fluid, in contrast to excess adsorption isotherms, which reached a maximum and then decreased toward zero or negative values above the critical density of the bulk fluid. The isotherms of confined fluid density and excess adsorption obtained by VTD contain additional information. For instance, the maxima of excess adsorption occur below the critical density of the bulk fluid {{at the beginning of the}} plateau region in the total adsorption, marking the end of the transition of pore fluid to a denser, liquidlike pore phase. Compression of the confined fluid significantly beyond the density of the bulk fluid at the same temperature was observed even at subcritical temperatures.

In addition, we obtain volumetric data for the transition of myelin basic protein from its initially unfolded state in water free of denaturants, to a folded, compact conformation within the water-controlled microenvironment of reverse micelles. These results disclose yet another aspect of the protein structural properties observed in membrane-mimetic molecular assemblies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSerum albumin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} protein in the circulatory system. The ability of albumins to undergo a reversible conformational transition, observed with changes in pH, is conserved in distantly related species, suggesting for it a major physiological role possibly related to the transport of small molecules including drugs. We have followed changes of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in volume by <b>densimetry</b> and in adiabatic compressibility during its conformational transition from pH 7 – 2, using ultrasound measurements. In parallel, circular dichroism was measured. The volume and adiabatic compressibility decrease from pH 4 to 2. The change in ellipticity shows a decrease over the same pH range from 70 % to 40 % of its α-helix content. Sorbitol, at concentrations from 0 to 2 M, led to the progressive restoration of BSA volume and compressibility values, {{as well as a}} substantial recovery of its original α-helix content. This finding implies that the compressibility variation observed reflects the conformational changes during the transition. The mutual interactions of the mechanical properties and structural features of BSA reported here are important in biotechnology for research in material sciences and for the design and the development of new, tailor-made drug carriers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this work, we {{performed}} a detailed thermodynamic study, including ultrasound velocimetry, <b>densimetry,</b> calorimetry, and FTIR spectroscopy, of an aggregation-prone protein (insulin) under different salt-screening conditions to gain a deeper insight into the scenario of physicochemical events during its temperature-induced unfolding and aggregation reactions. Differences in aggregation and fibrillization pathways are reflected in changes of the partial molar volume, the coefficients of thermal expansion and compressibility, and the infrared spectral properties of the protein. Combining all experimental data allows setting up a scheme for the temperature-dependent insulin aggregation reaction in the presence and absence of NaCl. As revealed by complementary atomic force microscopy studies, under charge-screening conditions, a process involving structural reorganization, ripening, and formation of more compact nuclei from amorphous oligomers {{is involved in the}} formation of mature fibrillar morphologies. In this work, our focus was to put forward a comprehensive discussion of the use of ultrasound velocimetry in disentangling different aggregation pathways. In fact, ultrasound velocimetry proved to be very sensitive to changes in aggregation pathway, highlighting the importance of density and compressibility changes in the different aggregation and fibrillization reactions of the protein...|$|E
