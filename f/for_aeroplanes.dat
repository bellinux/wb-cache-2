25|$|In the interwar years, the aerodrome had a dual {{military}} and civilian function. In these early days, it was the busiest airport in the area due to its passenger, post and railway air business. A large tract of land adjacent to the airfield was marked out for the British Industries Fair (BIF) in 1920, which was advertised nationally. In 1937, more hangars and a Squadron Headquarters were built for the Royal Air Force and in 1939, it was extended further to become a fighter station, a base for other units and a dispatch site <b>for</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> built at Castle Bromwich Aircraft Factory {{on the other side}} of the Chester Road. At its peak, the airfield would be used for testing 300 Supermarine Spitfires per month for World War II.|$|E

2500|$|... "London, 12 March—Eighty men {{and women}} were killed in Wales today in an {{aeroplane}} crash, the worst disaster in the history of aviation. Three men survived. The death toll eclipsed the previous record <b>for</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> set last 2 Nov., when a fighter plane rammed an airliner near the National Airport in Washington, causing the deaths of fifty-five persons. It also exceeded the toll of seventy-three dead in the loss of the United States Navy dirigible Akron off Barnegat, N.J., on 4 April 1933. The eighty persons lost in Wales went to their destruction in a type of aircraft – the British Avro Tudor – that had already caused fifty-four fatalities and had been banned from passenger service on Britain's publicly owned international airlines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sombra, {{one of the}} {{beautiful}} but naïve Arcadians, is troubled by reports of a place beyond the sea where [...] "monsters" [...] live in cages of brick and stone and never tell the truth – a place called London. The Arcadians beg Father Time to bring them a Londoner. He reluctantly agrees and causes the amateur aviator James Smith, an ageing London restaurateur with passions <b>for</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> and philandering, to crash land in Arcadia, where no one tells lies or grows older, where money is unknown, and employment is unnecessary. The Arcadians and Smith exchange stories, and Smith introduces the Arcadians to some new concepts: ugliness, jealousy and lying. He attempts to seduce Sombra by telling a lie. Far from impressed, the Arcadians immerse him in the Well of Truth, from which he emerges transformed into a young man, wearing the scanty costume of Arcadia, with a luxuriant head of hair but minus his mutton-chop whiskers. They christen him [...] "Simplicitas", and he will remain young until he tells a lie. His hosts dispatch him with missionary zeal, and two agelessly beautiful Arcadian nymphs, Sombra and her sister, Chrysea, to wicked London to [...] "set up the truth in England for ever more, and banish the lie." ...|$|E

Now this government official went up there an' convinced the I.W.W. that {{the best interest of}} the two were identical. An' he got the work out of them, an' the government got the lumber. He dealt with them fairly. Those who were on the level he paid high an' considered their wants. Those who were crooked he punished accordin' to their offense.
