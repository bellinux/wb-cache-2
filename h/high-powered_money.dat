5000|$|This {{is how the}} Federal Reserve's <b>high-powered</b> <b>money</b> is multiplied into {{a larger}} amount of broad money, through bank loans; as written in a {{particular}} case study, [...] "as banks increase or decrease loans, the nation's (broad) money supply increases or decreases."

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, money {{creation}} {{in a modern}} economy does not directly involve the manufacturing of new physical money, such as paper currency or metal coins.

5000|$|Werner {{proposed}} a policy he called [...] "quantitative easing" [...] in Japan in 1994 and 1995.

It is also, among others, {{in the title of}} an article he published on September 2, 1995, in the Nihon Keizai Shinbun (Nikkei). According to Werner, he used this phrase in order to propose a new form of monetary stimulation policy by the central bank that relied neither on interest rate reductions (which Werner claimed in his Nikkei article would be ineffective) nor on the conventional monetarist policy prescription of expanding the money supply (e.g. through [...] "printing money", expanding <b>high-powered</b> <b>money,</b> expanding bank reserves or boosting deposit aggregates such as M2 -all of which Werner also claimed would be ineffective). Instead, Werner argued, it was necessary and sufficient for an economic recovery to boost [...] "credit creation", through a number of measures. He also suggested direct purchases of non-performing assets from the banks by the central bank; direct lending to companies and the government by the central bank; purchases of commercial paper, other debt, and equity instruments from companies by the central bank; and stopping the issuance of government bonds to fund the public sector borrowing requirement, instead having the government borrow directly from banks through a standard loan contract.|$|E
40|$|IF BANKS {{maintain}} fractional {{reserve ratios}} and convert deposits into currency upon request, {{as in the}} U.

40|$|In recent years, {{economists have}} come to {{question}} the desirability of granting banks the privilege of borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.

Second, there are microeconomic concerns about potential abuse of the discount window (Schwartz 1 1992). Critics argue that the discount window has been misused as a transfer scheme to hail out (or postpone the failure of) troubled or insolvent financial institutions that should be closed quickly to prevent desperate acts of fraud or excess risk taking by bank management.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the need for}} financial regulations {{in the implementation of}} central bank policy. It emphasizes that a central bank serves two functions. Central banks function as monetary authorities, managing <b>high-powered</b> <b>money</b> to influence the price level and real activity; and they engage in regular and emergency lending to financial institutions. The authors term these functions monetary and banking policies, respectively. They emphasize that regulations are not essential for the execution of monetary policy because <b>high-powered</b> <b>money</b> can be managed with open market operations in government bonds. By its very nature, however, banking policy involves a swap of government securities for claims on individual banks. Just as private lenders must restrict and monitor individual borrowers, a central bank must regulate and supervise the institutions that borrow from it. Virtually all economists agree that there is an important role for monetary policy to stabilize prices and real activity. Banking policy has been rationalized as a source of funds for temporarily illiquid but solvent banks. To assess that rationale, the authors develop the distinction between illiquidity and insolvency in detail, showing the distinction to be meaningful precisely because information about the value of bank assets is incomplete and costly to obtain. Nevertheless, they explain why the cost of information per se cannot rationalize banking policy. On the basis of such considerations, they find it difficult to make a case for banking policy and the regulatory and supervisory activities that support it.
