5|$|Some reviewers {{praised the}} new laptop's {{performance}} and compact size, {{the quality of}} the screen, and sturdy unibody build, which allowed easier upgrading of <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> as compared to the original models. Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines. Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.|$|E
5|$|The {{polycarbonate}} Intel MacBook {{is easier}} for users to fix or upgrade than its predecessor. Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> such as the hard drive, users only need to remove the battery and the RAM door to replace the MacBook drive. Apple provides do-it-yourself manuals for these tasks.|$|E

40|$|The {{subgroup}} of larger myxoviruses, i. e., mumps, Newcastle disease (NDV), and parainfluenza viruses, when negatively stained, possess distinctive structural features (1, 2). Their virus particles are irregular in size, about 1000 to 3000 A in greatest diameter, and irregular in shape. These particles contain an <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> composed of ribonucleoprotein. The <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> (nucleocapsid) is an elongated structure with helical symmetry, 170 to 180 A in width, which is packed or tightly wound within an outer, lipid containing viral envelope. The latter, {{derived from the}} cytoplasmic membranes of host cells, has well defined projections on its surface, and shows hemagglutinating and neuranimidase activities. Electron microscopic studies of the intracellular development of myxoviruses has shed light on {{little more than the}} end stage of virus release. Completely assembled particles are observed leaving the cell in bud-like or villus-like projections of the cell membrane (3, 4). Assembly of the <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> and surface structure into complete virus particles has never been observed. Moreover, <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> has never been identified satisfactorily withi...|$|R

A healing abutment passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|This is a semiautomatic version {{manufactured}} for {{the civilian}} sport shooting market. Derived from the fully automatic military firearm, this version shares {{most of the}} major components of the military models {{with the exception of the}} firing mechanism and the addition of welded <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> to prevent conversion to a fully automatic mode. Notably, this version retains the ability to be belt fed, an uncommon feature in civilian firearms.|$|E
5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} the IAEA to re-evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and <b>internal</b> <b>components.</b> It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large <b>internal</b> <b>components.</b> The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|The device {{incorporates}} a 1.7GHz quad-core Snapdragon 600, an ARMv7 SoC, with 2GB of RAM. The chip provides support for LTE networks {{where they are}} available. Most HTC One models come with either 32 or 64 GB of internal, non-expandable storage—unlike the international model, the Chinese and Japanese models include a microSD slot and a removable back cover. Its <b>internal</b> <b>components</b> are arranged in a pyramid-like layout similar to the HTC Butterfly and HTC Windows Phone 8X with larger components (such as the screen and battery) positioned towards the front and smaller components (such as the motherboard) positioned towards the back. This internal layout also allows the device to have a curved backing.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her <b>internal</b> <b>components.</b> Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box with her when she was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

30|$|The process {{level is}} divided into components. The {{external}} component includes the audience for the writing task, the written text, and task materials used to draft the text such as dictionaries and peer’s notes. This is equivalent to task environment in Hayes’ 1996 model. The <b>internal</b> <b>component</b> includes four processes: the proposer, which produces pre-linguistic ideas to be expressed; the translator, which converts pre-linguistic ideas into strings of “language with appropriate word order and grammar” (p. 84); the transcriber, which translates linguistic strings into text; and the reviser, which evaluates and revises both the pre-linguistic ideas and written language. The present study will examine only the first <b>internal</b> <b>component,</b> the proposer, by measuring the idea generation processes of students while composing.|$|R
