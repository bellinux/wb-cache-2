An injection device is arranged in an interior space and injects heat transferring medium such as air, water and/or glycol. The injection device is formed as an <b>injecting</b> <b>tube,</b> which {{is attached to}} the interior space, and/or as a injection sheet metal plate (3). The <b>injecting</b> <b>tube</b> is arranged in the interior space uniformly at a distance to a wall of the shell, where the wall limits the interior space. USE - Solar tube for a solar tube collector e. g. facade collector and roof collector, to produce warm water and/or warm air, for heating and drying building, supplying process heat for e. g. bakery, galvanic operation, laundry or paint shop, and drying food, chemical product, wood and/or pellet, for processing of refrigerator i. e. sorption-supported refrigerator, and for sun protection (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The tube provides improved stagnation safety and reduces flow resistances and/or the pressure losses in the solar collector, thus ensuring miniaturization of components, which does not serve the heating of the heat transferring medium, and hence increasing efficiency of the solar collectors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{hydrogen gas}} self-ignition {{as a result}} of the release from high-pressure chamber through the tube into the ambient air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas with high energy density, small minimum ignition energy and wide flammability limits. Moreover, because of its high diffusivity in metals and small molecules it may cause leakages from storage systems. Pressurized hydrogen releases were found to ignite with no particular ignition source and it was the reason for this work. The condition for self-ignition of hydrogen gas discharge through the tube is a proper combination of the burst disk rapture, the tube length and diameter. This work consists of experimental and computational parts. Numerical simulation of hydrogen gas discharge through the tube is investigated in the first part. Calculations were performed using a commercial CFD code AVL FIRE. Investigated domain was composed of two cylindrical high-pressure (compressed hydrogen) and low-pressure (ambient air) vessels connected by the tube.

This process of raising vessels with injection and drainage from a solitary location {{is known as a}} single-point injection. In cases of poor circulation of the arterial solution, additional injection points (commonly the axillary, brachial, or femoral arteries, with the ulnar, radial, and tibial vessels if necessary) are used. The corresponding veins are commonly also raised and utilized for drainage. Cases where more than one vessel is raised are referred to as multiple-point injection, with a reference to the number of vessels raised (i.e. a six-point injection or six-pointer). As a general rule, the more points needing to be raised, the greater the difficulty of the case.
