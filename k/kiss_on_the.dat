25|$|Where cheek kissing is used, in some {{countries}} a single kiss is the custom, while in others a kiss on each cheek is the norm, or even three or four kisses on alternating cheeks.

25|$|A {{relationship}} between Colin and Barry was quickly developed and {{the residents of}} Albert Square gossiped in hushed voices about {{the true nature of}} their friendship.
