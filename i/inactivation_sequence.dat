40|$|A {{protocol}} {{was designed to}} measure the forward mutation rate over an entire gene replicated {{as part of a}} Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector. For these studies, the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene {{under the control of the}} spleen necrosis virus U 3 promoter was used as target sequence since it allows selection for either the functional or the inactivated gene. Our results indicate that after one round of retroviral replication, the tk gene is inactivated at an average rate of 0. 08 per cycle of replication. Southern blotting revealed that the majority of the mutant proviruses resulted from gross rearrangements and that deletions of spleen necrosis virus and tk sequences were the most frequent cause of the gene <b>inactivation.</b> <b>Sequence</b> analysis of the mutant proviruses suggested that homologous as well as nonhomologous recombination was involved in the observed rearrangements. Some mutations consisted of simple deletions, and others consisted of deletions combined with insertions. The frequency at which these mutations occurred during one cycle of retroviral replication provides evidence indicating that Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors may undergo genetic rearrangement at high rates. The high rate of rearrangement and its relevance for retrovirus-mediated gene transfer are discussed...|$|E

The inactivation status of the DXS 8237 E and PCTKl gene differ: the first undergoes normal inactivation and the second escapes this process. The status of the UBEl gene has been controversial, although it is widely excepted that it does escape X chromosome inactivation. Physical mapping of the region employing YACs and subsequently P ACs has been undertaken, but was restricted in scope by the high frequency of rearrangements occurring. DNA sequences between DXS 8237 E, UBE 1, PCTKl and the distal gene, UHX 1, have been investigated with regard to LINEI elements, which are thought to playa role in X-inactivation. The results obtained strongly suggest a link between LINE 1 elements and X chromosome <b>inactivation.</b> <b>Sequence</b> analysis results {{also contributed to the}} understanding of difficulties with restriction mapping of the region. Further, this work includes the first reported establishment of the UBEl exonintron boundaries.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of Mn release during NH 2 OH inactivation of {{the water}} oxidizing reaction is largely insensitive to the S-state present during addition of NH 2 OH. This appears to reflect reduction by NH 2 OH of higher S-states to a common more reduced state (S 0 or S- 1) which alone is susceptible to NH 2 OH <b>inactivation.</b> <b>Sequences</b> of saturating flashes with dark intervals in the range 0. 2 - 5 s- 1 effectively prevent NH 2 OH inactivation and the associated liberation of manganese. This light-induced protection disappears rapidly when the dark interval is longer than about 5 s. Under continuous illumination, protection against NH 2 OH inactivation is maximally effective at intensities in the range 103 - 104 erg [middle dot] cm- 2 [middle dot] s- 1. This behavior {{differs from that of}} NH 2 OH-induced Mn release, which is strongly inhibited at all intensities greater than 103 erg [middle dot] cm- 2 [middle dot] s- 1. This indicates that two distinct processes are responsible for inactivation of water oxidation at high and low intensities. Higher S-states appear to be immune to the reaction by which NH 2 OH liberates manganese, although the overall process of water oxidation is inactivated by NH 2 OH in the presence of intense light. The light-induced protection phenomenon is abolished by 50 [mu]M DCMU, but not by high concentrations of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, which accelerates inactivation reactions {{of the water}}-splitting enzyme, Y (an ADRY reagent).

Over the last 60 years, advances in protein purification, protein chemistry, donor screening, viral <b>inactivation,</b> gene <b>sequencing,</b> gene cloning, and recombinant protein production have dramatically enhanced the treatment and lives of patients with hemophilia.

We have demonstrated previously that oxidative inactivation of the proteasome is a molecular link between oxidative stress and overexpression of interleukin (IL) - 8. Here, we elucidated a novel signaling cascade that leads to up-regulation of IL- 8 in response to proteasome <b>inactivation.</b> The <b>sequence</b> of events in this cascade includes proteasome inactivation, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) 3 /MKK 6, activation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) activation and increased IL- 8 expression. Blocking any of these signaling pathways abolished the up-regulation of IL- 8 induced by proteasome inhibition. Although Akt is also activated in response to proteasome inactivation, {{we found that the}} PI 3 K-dependent up-regulation of IL- 8 is independent of 3 -phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK) 1 and Akt. Inhibition of PDK 1 and Akt with chemical inhibitors or expression of constitutive active Akt had little effects on IL- 8 expression in response to proteasome inactivation. In contrast, inhibition of interleukin 2 -inducible T cell kinase, a kinase downstream of PI 3 K, significantly reduced the expression and secretion of IL- 8 in response to proteasome inactivation.

Furthermore, transduction of mutS and mutL derivatives of S. typhi with chromosomal genes from S. typhimurium occurs efficiently.

This study has identified a previously unreported form of hemophilia B in a patient who was a somatic mosaic for a guanine-to-cytosine transversion at nucleotide 31, 170 in the factor IX gene. This point mutation changes the codon for residue 350 in the catalytic domain of factor IX from a cysteine to a serine.

Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall readily exposed to the host and, thus, an important target for the innate immune system. Characterization of the PG from L. monocytogenes demonstrated deacetylation of N-acetylglucosamine residues. We identified a PG N-deacetylase gene, pgdA, in L. monocytogenes genome <b>sequence.</b> <b>Inactivation</b> of pgdA revealed the key role of this PG modification in bacterial virulence because the mutant was extremely sensitive to the bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme, and growth was severely impaired after oral and i. v. inoculations.

Therefore it is required that methylation status on human genome is comprehensively revealed in each kind of cells.

Because of this, machine learning using already known methylation data and prediction of methylation status on other genomic regions are important. Moreover, since sequence differences between DNA regions showing different methylation status also remain unclear, those differences should be also determined. Therefore we conducted machine learning by support vector machine using our previously reported methylation data, and predicted methylation status on DNA sequences using DNA sequence features. Furthermore we explored different sequence features among four types of methylation using random forest. Consequently high methylation prediction accuracies were observed between two different methylation status pairs.

However, wild-type activity of these mutants could be restored by compensatory mutations {{of the opposite}} strand of the EBER 2 RNA sequence. A similar rescue was achieved with the 3 ′-truncated EBER 2 gene, if the heterologous terminator was adapted for complementarity to the initiator element of the construct. Yet, double-strandedness alone of the RNA ends was not sufficient for high transcriptional activity of these gene constructs. Rather, {{the use of a}} nonrefoldable spacer, separating the 5 ′- and 3 ′-stem–loop structures, demonstrated that spatial proximity of the ends of EBER 2 RNA was required. Furthermore, decay kinetics of wild-type and mutant RNA synthesized in vitro indicated that the effects observed could not be explained by altered transcript stability. Finally, single-round transcription confirmed that the reduced expression of mutant genes was not caused by decreased primary initiation reactions. In addition, differential sarcosyl concentrations demonstrated that the rate of reinitiation clearly was affected with the mutant EBER 2 genes. Together, these results indicate that the secondary structure of this viral RNA represents a major determinant for efficient transcription of the EBER 2 gene by host cell RNA polymerase III...|$|R

The basis for escape from inactivation and the potential role of the X chromosome primary DNA sequence in determining a gene’s X inactivation status is unclear. Using {{a combination of the}} X chromosome sequence and a comprehensive X inactivation profile of more than 600 genes, two independent yet complementary approaches were used to systematically investigate the relationship between X <b>inactivation</b> and DNA <b>sequence</b> features. First, statistical analyses revealed that a number of repeat features, including long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and mammalian-wide interspersed repeat repetitive elements, are significantly enriched in regions surrounding transcription start sites of genes that are subject to inactivation, while Alu repetitive elements and short motifs containing ACG/CGT are significantly enriched in those that escape inactivation. Second, linear support vector machine classifiers constructed using primary DNA sequence features were used to correctly predict the X inactivation status for. 80 % of all X-linked genes. We further identified a small set of features that are important for accurate classification, among which LINE- 1 and LINE- 2 content show the greatest individual discriminatory power. Finally, as few as 12 features can be used for accurate support vector machine classification.

40|$|Abstract Background Nasopharyngeal {{carcinoma}} associated gene 6 (NGX 6) is down-regulated in most {{colon cancer}} cell lines and tumor tissues {{when compared with}} their normal tissue samples. As a novel suppress tumor gene, it could inhibit colon cancer cell growth and cell cycle progression. However, {{little is known about}} the transcriptional mechanisms controlling NGX 6 gene expression. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In this study, we explored the role of DNA methylation in regulation of NGX 6 transcription. Methods In the present study, we cloned the NGX 6 promoter with characteristics of a CpG island by luciferase reporter assay. Then, the CpG methylation status around the NGX 6 promoter region in colon cancer cell lines and colorectal tumor tissues was examined by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite DNA sequencing. Finally, 5 -Aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine (5 -Aza-dC) treatment was used to confirm the correlation between NGX 6 promoter methylation and its gene <b>inactivation.</b> Results The <b>sequence</b> spanning positions - 157 to + 276 was identified as the NGX 6 promoter, in which no canonical TATA boxes were found, while two CAAT boxes and GC boxes were discovered. Methylation status was observed more frequently in 40 colorectal cancer samples than in 40 adjacent normal mucosa samples (18 / 40 versus 7 / 40; P Conclusions Down-regulation of NGX 6 gene is related to the promoter methylation. DNA methylation of NGX 6 promoter might be a potential molecular marker for diagnosis or prognosis, or serve as a therapeutic target. </p...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive facultative aerobe {{that can}} {{grow in the}} absence of oxygen by {{fermentation}} or by using an alternative electron acceptor. To investigate the mechanism by which S. aureus is able to adapt to changes in oxygen concentration, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of genes that encode the aerobic class Ib and anaerobic class III ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) systems that are responsible for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. The S. aureus class Ib RNR nrdIEF and class III RNR nrdDG genes and their regulatory regions were cloned and <b>sequenced.</b> <b>Inactivation</b> of the nrdDG genes showed that the class III RNR is essential for anaerobic growth. Inhibition of aerobic growth by hydroxyurea showed that the class Ib RNR is an oxygen-dependent enzyme. Northern blot analysis and primer extension analysis demonstrated that transcription of class III nrdDG genes is regulated by oxygen concentration and was at least 10 -fold higher under anaerobic than under aerobic conditions. In contrast, no significant effect of oxygen concentration was found on the transcription of class Ib nrdIEF genes. Disruption or deletion of S. aureus nrdDG genes caused up to a fivefold increase in nrdDG and nrdIEF transcription under anaerobic conditions but not under aerobic conditions. Similarly, hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of the class I RNRs, resulted in increased transcription of class Ib and class III RNR genes under aerobic conditions. These findings establish that transcription of class Ib and class III RNR genes is upregulated under conditions that cause the depletion of deoxyribonucleotide. Promoter analysis of class Ib and class III RNR operons identified several inverted-repeat elements that may account for the transcriptional response of the nrdIEF and nrdDG genes to oxygen...|$|R
40|$|Renal tumor {{heterogeneity}} {{studies have}} utilized the von Hippel-Lindau VHL gene to classify disease into molecularly defined subtypes to examine associations with etiologic {{risk factors and}} prognosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide a comprehensive analysis of VHL inactivation in clear cell renal tumors (ccRCC) and to evaluate relationships between VHL inactivation subgroups with renal cancer risk factors and VHL germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). VHL genetic and epigenetic inactivation was examined among 507 sporadic RCC/ 470 ccRCC cases using endonuclease scanning and using bisulfite treatment and Sanger sequencing across 11 CpG sites within the VHL promoter. Case-only multivariate analyses were conducted to identify associations between alteration subtypes and risk factors. VHL <b>inactivation,</b> either through <b>sequence</b> alterations or promoter methylation in tumor DNA, was observed among 86. 6 % of ccRCC cases. Germline VHL SNPs and a haplotype were associated with promoter hypermethylation in tumor tissue (OR =  6. 10; 95 % CI: 2. 28 - 16. 35, p =  3. 76 E- 4, p-global =  8 E- 5). Risk of having genetic VHL inactivation was inversely associated with smoking due to a higher proportion of wild-type ccRCC tumors [former: OR =  0. 70 (0. 20 - 1. 31) and current: OR =  0. 56 (0. 32 - 0. 99); P-trend =  0. 04]. Alteration prevalence did not differ by histopathologic characteristics or occupational exposure to trichloroethylene. ccRCC cases with particular VHL germline polymorphisms were more likely to have VHL inactivation through promoter hypermethylation than through sequence alterations in tumor DNA, suggesting that the presence of these SNPs may represent an example of facilitated epigenetic variation (an inherited propensity towards epigenetic variation) in renal tissue. A proportion of tumors from current smokers lacked VHL alterations and may represent a biologically distinct clinical entity from inactivated cases...|$|R
40|$|While 10 - 15 % of {{the human}} genome is {{composed}} of heterochromatic DNA, these regions are not included in the completed genome sequence. The short arm of chromosome 21 (HC 21 p) serves as a model for understanding the structure and function of heterochromatin. LINE- 1 (L 1) retrotransposons are underrepresented in heterochromatin, including HC 21 p, and have not been extensively studied in these regions. However, there are disproportionately more full length L 1 s on HC 21 p than in euchromatic genomic regions. Decreased DNA methylation in the promoters of these L 1 s on HC 21 p may allow them to facilitate heterochromatin formation, which would be analogous to their proposed role in X chromosome <b>inactivation.</b> Using bisulfite <b>sequencing</b> PCR on both chromosome-specific hybrid cell lines and leukocytes, I found that overall methylation of four specific L 1 s on HC 21 p was substantially lower than control L 1 loci located in euchromatic regions. This trend was also present for four critical CpG sites in the L 1 promoter that have been specifically implicated in the suppression of L 1 expression. I propose a model wherein decreased L 1 promoter methylation promotes heterochromatin formation by intrachromosomal interactions and transient bidirectional expression. Additionally, due to evidence that some L 1 s become hypomethylated in cancer cells, a limited number of HC 21 p L 1 loci were analyzed in a small number of prostate cancer cell lines to determine if changes in methylation at those loci could be relevant {{to the development of a}} cancer biomarker. I found that the L 1 s on HC 21 p were generally less methylated in cancer versus normal cell lines and differed between loci at different tumor stages. This supports the hypothesis that changes in methylation of a variety of specific L 1 loci may be sensitive biomarkers for both cancer detection and prognosis...|$|R
