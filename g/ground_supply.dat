25|$|The heater and {{protection}} thermostats were originally {{designed for the}} Command Module's 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt <b>ground</b> <b>supply,</b> in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly.

25|$|Another {{desirable}} {{property of}} all PLLs {{is that the}} phase and frequency of the generated clock be unaffected by rapid changes in the voltages of the power and <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> lines, {{as well as the}} voltage of the substrate on which the PLL circuits are fabricated. This is called substrate and supply noise rejection. The higher the noise rejection, the better.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, the Japanese {{launched}} the counter-offensive, Operation Ichi-Go, quickly overrunning Chennault's forward air bases and proving Stilwell correct. By this time, Allied supply efforts via the Hump airlift were steadily improving in tonnage supplied per month; with {{the replacement of}} Chinese war losses, Chennault now saw little need for a ground offensive in northern Burma in order to re-open a <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> route to China. This time, augmented with increased military equipment and additional troops, and concerned about defense of the approaches to India, British authorities sided with Stilwell.|$|E

50|$|Bicol Region has a {{large amount}} of rich flatland, and {{agriculture}} is the largest component of the economy, followed by commercial fishing. Coconuts, abaca, banana, coffee and jackfruit are the top five permanent crops in the region. Rice and corn are among the chief seasonal crops. Mining {{is also one of the}} contributors to the region's economy. Commercial fishing is also important with thirteen major fishing <b>grounds</b> <b>supplying</b> fish markets in places as far as Metro Manila.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{logistical}} support reaching India and China via the Hump finally reached levels permitting an Allied offensive into northern Burma. Chennault had long argued for {{expansion of the}} airlift, doubting that any <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> network through Burma could provide the tonnage needed to re-equip Chiang's divisions. However, work on the Ledo Road overland route continued throughout 1944 and was completed in January 1945. Training of the new Chinese divisions commenced; however, predictions of monthly tonnage (65,000 per month) over the road were never achieved. By the time Nationalist armies began to receive large amounts of supplies via the Ledo Road, the war had ended. Instead, the airlift continued to expand {{until the end of}} the war, after delivering 650,000 tons of supplies, gasoline, and military equipment.|$|E
25|$|On October 9, Winters {{became the}} {{battalion}} executive officer (XO), {{following the death}} of the battalion's former XO, Major Oliver Horton. Although this position was normally held by a major, Winters filled it as a captain. The 101st Airborne Division was withdrawn to France soon afterwards. On December 16, 1944, German forces launched a counter-offensive against the Western Allies in Belgium, commencing the Battle of the Bulge. The 101st Airborne Division was trucked to the Bastogne area two days later. Still serving as XO of the 2nd Battalion, Winters helped defend the line northeast of Bastogne near the town of Foy. The entire 101st Airborne and elements of the 10th Armored Division battled about 15 German divisions, supported by heavy artillery and armor, for nearly a week before General George Patton's U.S. Third Army broke through the German lines surrounding Bastogne, reopening <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> lines.|$|E
25|$|In {{coordination}} with a southern offensive by Nationalist Chinese forces under General Wei Li-huang, Allied troops under Stilwell's command launched the long-awaited invasion of northern Burma; after heavy fighting and casualties, the two forces linked up in January 1945. Stilwell's strategy remained unchanged: opening a new <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> route from India to China {{would allow the}} Allies to equip and train new Chinese army divisions for use against the Japanese. The new road network, later called the Ledo Road, would link {{the northern end of}} the Burma Road as the primary supply route to China; Stilwell's staff planners had estimated the route would supply 65,000 tons of supplies per month. Using these figures, Stilwell argued that the Ledo Road network would greatly surpass the tonnage being airlifted over the Hump. General Chennault doubted that such an extended network of trails through difficult jungle could ever match the tonnage that could be delivered with modern cargo transport aircraft then deploying in-theater. Progress on the Ledo Road was slow, and could not be completed until the linkup of forces in January 1945.|$|E

HHC mortars and medics were {{scattered}} throughout the country supporting numerous village stability sites; they were consistently praised for the actions while in contact. C Company platoons, task organized with F Company logisticians, provided <b>ground</b> <b>supplies</b> to over 40 separate remote outposts throughout Afghanistan and drove over 47,000 miles during the deployment.

25|$|It {{was formed}} on 11 September 1942, under 7th Australian Division Operational Instruction Number 10 and drew {{manpower}} from the 36th, 55th Battalion and 49th Battalions, which each provided approximately a company, plus a detachment from 2/6th Independent Company. The force was sent {{out by the}} New Guinea Force via Lalokiâ€“Goldie River to cut the enemy line of communications between Menari and Nauro. Consisting mainly of eighteen- and nineteen-year-old militiamen who were barely trained and ill-equipped, Honner Force {{found it difficult to}} traverse the muddy tracks and dense jungle, however, by 19 September they had reached the vicinity of Omaramara. The majority of the men were exhausted from the march, and the aerial re-supply that had been planned for them did not eventuate. As such they were unable to move beyond the limits of which <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> could reach them. As the strategic situation around Kokoda had stabilised by then, it was decided that the force was in no condition to conduct offensive operations and they were subsequently disbanded shortly after with the men returning to their parent units without having seen action.|$|E
500|$|During their {{telephone}} call Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar {{made it clear}} to Secretary of State Clinton that no lethal equipment would transit into Afghanistan through the Ground Lines of Communication i.e. the <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> lines except those meant for equipping the Afghan National Security Forces. Pakistan's Defense Committee of the Cabinet, which approved the deal, said the agreement was in the country's best interest and a boon to the Afghanistan peace process. Allowing NATO convoys to enter and exit Pakistani territory would speed the withdrawal of Western forces, the Pakistani government said in a statement, and [...] "enable a smooth transition in Afghanistan." [...] According to the New York Times the agreement reflected a growing realisation by Pakistani officials that they had overplayed their hand, misjudged NATO's resolve and ability to adapt to the closing by using an alternative route through Central Asia, and a recognition on both sides that the impasse risked transforming an often rocky relationship into a permanently toxic one at a critically inopportune time. Despite the resolving of the Salala incident there are frictions in both countries relations such as Pakistan's opposition to US drone strikes on Pakistan soil, and Washington's allegations that Islamabad condones, or even assists, anti-American militants.|$|E
2500|$|Chennault {{believed}} that the Fourteenth Air Force, operating out of bases in China, could attack Japanese forces in concert with Nationalist troops.

This route would provide supplies and new equipment for a greatly expanded Nationalist force of twenty to thirty modernized divisions.|$|E
