5|$|The smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber) is {{a species}} of fish in the {{pufferfish}} family Tetraodontidae. It is native to shallow coastal and <b>estuarine</b> <b>waters</b> of southeastern Australia, where it is widespread and abundant. French naturalist Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville described the species in 1813, though early records confused it with its close relative, the common toadfish (T. hamiltonii). The two are the only members of the genus Tetractenos after going through several taxonomic changes since discovery.|$|E
5|$|S. ciliata is most {{commonly}} called the 'sand whiting' {{in reference to}} its preference for sandy substrates compared to {{some members of the}} genus which prefer muddy, silty, or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the nose in fish of larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as well. This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and <b>estuarine</b> <b>waters</b> in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers.|$|E

5|$|Groups of {{settlers}} {{began building}} {{the first known}} permanent houses on what is now Scottish soil around 9500 years ago, and the first villages around 6000 years ago. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the}} oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this period and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. From the Early and Middle Bronze Age we have evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial island, usually in lakes, rivers and <b>estuarine</b> <b>waters.</b> The peoples of early Iron Age Scotland, particularly in the north and west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 BC to AD 300 with the most imposing structures having been created circa 200–100 BC. In the south and east larger earthwork hill forts survive. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period, but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure. Most are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure.|$|E

This study investigated an <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> sample and a coastal seawater sample from the subtropical waters in southeast of China. Water samples were exposed to natural sunlight and the absorption and fluorescence of CDOM as well as the DIC concentration were measured in the summer of 2009. The <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> had higher CDOM level, molecular weight and proportion of humic-like fluorescent components than the seawater that exhibited abundant tryptophan-like fluorescent component. After a 3 -day irradiation, the CDOM level decreased by 45 % in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> and 20 % in the seawater, accompanied with a decrease in the molecular weight and aromaticity of DOM which was inferred from an increase in the absorption spectral slope parameter. The photo-degradation rates of all the five fluorescent components were also notable, in particular two humic-like components (C 4 and C 5) were removed by 78 % and 69 % in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> and by 69 % and 56 % in the seawater. The <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> had a higher photo-production rate of DIC than the seawater (4. 4 vs. 2. 5 mu mol/(L. day)), in part due to its higher CDOM abundance.

Cell envelopes were prepared from cells cultured in Proteose Peptone-beef extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) medium or filtered <b>estuarine</b> <b>water.</b> Protein, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide contents varied with culture conditions. The phospholipids present in the cell envelopes were identified as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin. Phosphatidylethanolamine decreased and phosphatidylglycerol increased in cells grown in <b>estuarine</b> <b>water.</b> Profiles of proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated numerous protein species, with four to six predominant proteins ranging from 26, 000 to 120, 000 in molecular weight. The profile of V. parahaemolyticus cell envelope proteins was unique and might be useful in the identification of the organism. Alkaline phosphatase activity was slightly higher in Kanagawa-negative strains and was higher in cells grown in <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> than in cells grown in rich laboratory medium. The DNA levels in estuarine water-grown cells increased, while RNA levels and cell volume decreased. Bacteriophage sensitivity typing demonstrated a close intraspecies relationship.

None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in <b>estuarine</b> <b>water.</b> Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ 62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP 17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP 17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems.

40|$|Purpose Wastes from {{a former}} Portuguese steel plant were {{deposited}} between 1961 and 2001 on the riverbank of {{a tributary of the}} Tagus River creating a landfill connected to the river, posing a potential contamination risk to the Tagus estuary ecosystem. This study aims to assess the transfer of chemical elements from contaminated sediments to the <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> from cycles of sediment leaching so as to evaluate the ecotoxicity of the leachates, and to analyze the solid phases crystallized from those leachates. Materials and methods Landfill sediment and <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> samples were collected during low tide. Sediment samples were analyzed for pH, electric conductivity (EC), C-org, NPK, and iron oxides. Leaching assays (four replicates) were done using <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> (200 cm(3) /replicate) and 1. 5 kg of sediment per reactor. Each reactor was submitted to four leaching processes (0, 28, 49, and 77 days). The sediment was kept moist between leaching processes. Sediment (total (acid digestion) and available fraction (diluted organic acid extraction- Rhizo)) elemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-instrumental neutron activation analysis (ICP/INAA). Leachates, and estuarine and sediment pore waters were analyzed for metals/metalloids by ICP/mass spectrometry (MS) and carbonates/sulfate/chloride by standard methodologies. Ecotoxicity assays were performed in leachates and <b>estuarine</b> and pore <b>waters</b> using Artemia franciscana and Brachionus plicatillis. Aliquots of the leachates were evaporated to complete dryness (23 - 25 degrees C) and crystals analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Results and discussion Sediment with pH= 8 and high EC and Corg was contaminated with As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. The element concentrations in the available fraction of the sediment were low compared to the sediment total concentrations (< 1 % for Rhizo extraction). The concentrations of potentially hazardous elements in the <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> were relatively low, except for Cd. Concentrations of hazardous elements in the leachates were very low. Calcium, K, Mg, Na, and chloride concentrations were high but did not vary significantly among the four leaching experiments. Total concentrations of carbonate were much higher in leachates than in <b>estuarine</b> <b>water.</b> Both <b>estuarine</b> <b>water</b> and leachates showed negligible toxicity. Crystals identified in the solids obtained from the leachates by evaporation were halite, anhydrite, epsomite, dolomite, and polyhalite. Conclusions The sediment showed the capacity to retain the majority of the potentially hazardous chemical elements. Remobilization of chemical elements from sediment by leaching was essentially negligible. The variation of total concentrations of Ca, carbonate, and sulfate in leachates indicates that the sediment contained reactive sulfides. Due to its composition, the sediment seems to be a dynamic system of pollution control, which should not be disturbed...|$|R

2500|$|The {{published}} length that {{yellowstripe scad}} become sexually mature at varies between 8.8cm when {{less than a}} year old and [...] 11.4cm. In his research, Tandon noted that his estimate was much lower than previous studies had suggested, which he explained as sampling bias due to larger net mesh size in the previous work. There is a prolonged breeding season in India, with each individual spawning only once a year. The season extends from July to March with two peaks in January to April and July to October. In morphometric studies conducted in the same area, it was found some morphometric and meristic characters had a variation that was difficult to reconcile as being due to different generations or populations. Instead it was suggested that due to the two major periods of spawning occurring in different seasons, the markedly different water temperature and salinity during these peaks possibly influenced these traits. During spawning, the male to female ratio is close to parity at 1:1, but at other times of the year it varies by location, with females usually being more abundant. The reason for this is unclear however, and might suggest segregation of the sexes between spawning periods. The fecundity of yellowstripe scad is directly correlated with the size of the fish, with 6300 ova documented for an individual of 9.5cm and up to 37400 ova for a 13.1cm individual. The egg characteristics and stages of ova maturity are well documented, as are the early stages of post-egg growth. The eggs are pelagic, and are known from coastal as well as lower <b>estuarine</b> <b>waters.</b> Like the young of other carangids, the larvae and juveniles of the yellowstripe scad are known to associate with large jellyfish, using them as protection.
