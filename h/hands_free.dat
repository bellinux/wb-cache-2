5|$|Northeast of Brent Cross, at Henlys Corner, the North Circular briefly shares carriageways {{with the}} A1 which joins {{it from the}} left and leaves it {{to the right to}} head into Central London. The {{junction}} complex also serves the Finchley Road and pedestrian traffic, and consequently is a major bottleneck on the route. Transport for London have invested in the junction, including a special <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> crossing for the local Jewish community, who can then cross the road on the Sabbath. The road passes north of St Pancras and Islington Cemetery towards Friern Barnet and Muswell Hill. The road narrows to two lane single carriageway to pass under a railway bridge, and continues as Telford Road towards Bounds Green.|$|E
5|$|The {{disposition}} {{adopted in}} the battle was one which recurs in many sea-fights of the Middle Ages where a fleet had to fight on the defensive. Olaf lashed his ships side to side, with his own, the Long Serpent, {{in the middle of}} the line, where her bows projected beyond the others. The advantages of this arrangement were that it left all <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> to fight, that a barrier could be formed with the oars and yards, and that it limited the enemy's ability to make its superior numbers count. The Long Serpent was the longest ship and so also the tallest—another advantage to the defenders, who could rain down arrows, javelins and other missiles while the enemy would have to shoot upwards. Olaf, in effect, turned his eleven ships into a floating fort.|$|E

5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as <b>hands</b> <b>free,</b> and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or ad-hoc groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.|$|E
5|$|Ariadne persuades Litsas, {{a former}} Second World War {{resistance}} fighter {{and friend of}} her late father, to help them by telling him about the involvement in the plot of former Nazi, Von Richter. Trying to find M and Colonel Sun, Bond is nearly captured by the Russians, but is saved by Litsas. Finally, Bond finds Sun's headquarters, but is knocked out by one of Sun's men; Bond learns that Von Richter will use a mortar to destroy the conference venue and that Bond will be tortured by Sun, before his inevitable demise. Sun tortures him brutally, until {{one of the girls}} at the house is ordered by Sun to caress Bond fondly. In the process she cuts one of Bond's <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> and provides him with a knife. She tells Sun that Bond is dead: when examined Bond stabs Sun. He then frees other captives who help Bond stop Von Richter. However Sun survives the stab wound and kills several of the other escapees. Bond tracks down Sun and kills him in the confrontation. The Soviets thank Bond for saving their conference, offering him a medal for his work, which he politely turns down.|$|E

Tokimune Takeda regarded one of the unique characteristics of the art to be its preference for controlling a downed attacker's joints with one's knee to leave one's <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> to access weapons or {{to deal with the}} threat of other attackers.|$|E
25|$|Telephone {{headsets}} {{connect to}} a fixed-line telephone system. A telephone headset functions by replacing the handset of a telephone. Headsets for standard corded telephones are {{fitted with a}} standard 4P4C commonly called an RJ-9 connector. Headsets are also available with 2.5mm jack sockets for many DECT phones and other applications. Cordless bluetooth headsets are available, and often used with mobile telephones. Headsets are widely used for telephone-intensive jobs, in particular by call centre workers. They are also used by anyone wishing to hold telephone conversations with both <b>hands</b> <b>free.</b>|$|E

The audio player display takes the same design as the 2009 Hyundai Sonata, and the controls for the audio player have been redesigned. An auxiliary input jack and iPod integration system is now standard, though deleted {{in the case}} of the LG Navigation system on the Limited trim level. A wood-trimmed steering wheel is once again standard for the Limited, and Limited models receive special hyper-silver finished alloy wheels.|$|E

25|$|Safety {{syringes}} {{help reduce}} occurrences of accidental needlesticks. One {{of the most}} recent developments has been the auto-disable injection device. These injection devices automatically disable after a single use. This can be done by retracting the needle back into the syringe or rendering the syringe plunger inoperable. With the injection device now inoperable, it cannot be reused. Shielding the needle after the injection is another approach for safe management of sharps. These are <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> methods usually involving a hinging cap that can be pressed on a table to seal the needle. Another technology in sharps waste management relating to injections is the needle remover. Varying approaches can be taken with the main goal to separate the needle from the syringe. This allows the sharp needle to be quarantined and disposed of separate from the syringe. There is debate around the use of these devices as they involved in additional step in the handling of sharps waste.|$|E
500|$|Home {{was never}} searched {{before or after}} his séances. Science {{historian}} Sherrie Lynne Lyons wrote that the glowing or light-emitting hands in his séances could easily {{be explained by the}} rubbing of oil of phosphorus on his hands. It has been suggested that the [...] "spirit hands" [...] in the séances of Home were made of gloves stuffed with a substance. Robert Browning believed they were attached to Home's feet. Home was a sculptor and his studio in Rome contained sculpted hands. Lyons has speculated that he may have substituted the sculptor hands, leaving his real <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> to perform phenomena in the séance room.|$|E
500|$|The {{revival of}} team driving has {{prompted}} farmers {{who use the}} Trait du Nord to attend competitions and {{improve the quality of}} their horses. The qualities of the breed make it a popular horse for leaders in the areas of recreational and competition team driving, and the breed has the advantage of being able to be immediately returned to work even after a period of inactivity for several months. When being driven, a traditional [...] "Flemish collar" [...] is generally used. The horses are trained to be driven with only one rein, leaving the driver's <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> for other work. When shown in hand, Trait du Nord horses are often presented in groups, generally between four and eight to a string.|$|E

500|$|Carlisle's 1903 {{season was}} a success, {{with only two}} losses. The 12–11 defeat by Harvard is known for the [...] "hunch-back", or [...] "hidden-ball", play which Warner learned from Heisman; he had a tailor sew elastic bands into the waists of several players' jerseys before the game so the play could be executed. It was used during a Harvard kickoff; when the ball was caught, Carlisle formed {{a circle around the}} {{returner}} and pushed the ball up the back of the player's (altered) jersey. Carlisle then broke the huddle and spread out in different directions. Each player except the returner (who had the hidden ball) pretended to carry the football. The ruse confused the Harvard players, who scrambled to find the ball carrier, and the returner (ignored, with both <b>hands</b> <b>free)</b> ran untouched into the end zone. Warner's next step was a brief return to Cornell.|$|E
500|$|While {{developing}} the game, the production team sought to use elements of other games as influences {{on how to}} create a Star Trek based game that was along the same lines as the 2009 film. Digital Extremes creative director Sheldon Carter described this as [...] "It's like someone spliced Metroid Prime into my Uncharted". Miller explained that it was due {{to the success of the}} Mass Effect series of games that allowed for space-based adventure games such as Star Trek to be made, although they were not seeking to include the role-playing game elements seen in that series. Miller explained that there was a [...] "circular influence" [...] with each franchise influenced by the other. Further influences were found in The Original Series, as one level which pits Spock against Kirk was inspired by a similar scene in the episode [...] "Amok Time", originally broadcast on television just under 47years before the launch of the game. While it was intended to be a cross platform launch, the producers decided not to incorporate <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> gaming using either Kinect or the PlayStation Move.|$|E
