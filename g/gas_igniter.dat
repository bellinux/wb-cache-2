50|$|The {{molecules}} of some crystals and ceramics are permanently polarised: {{some parts of}} the molecule are positively charged, while other parts are negatively charged. These materials produce an electric charge when the material changes dimension {{as a result of an}} imposed external force. The charge produced is referred to as piezoelectricity. Many crystalline materials such as the natural crystals of quartz and rochelle salted together with manufactured polycrystalline ceramics such as lead titanate zirconate and barium titanate exhibit piezoelectric effects. Piezoelectric materials are used as buzzers inside pagers, ultrasonic cleaners and mobile phones, and in <b>gas</b> <b>igniters.</b> In addition, these piezoelectric sensors are able to convert pressure, force, vibration or shock into electrical energy. Being capable only of measuring active events, they are also used in flow meters, accelerometers and level detectors, as well as motor vehicles to sense changes in the transmission, fuel injection and coolant pressure. When a voltage or an applied electric field stresses a piezo element electrically, its dimensions change. This phenomenon is known as electrostriction, or the reverse piezoelectric effect. This effect enables the element to act as a translating device called an actuator. Piezoelectric materials are used in power actuators, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, and in acoustic transducers, converting electric fields into sound waves.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of solid}} state {{generators}} based on piezoceramic is widely known. More than 40 years ago, the first <b>gas</b> <b>igniters</b> using piezoceramic elements {{came on the}} market. Later on in the 1980 s the first idea to harvest energy from structural vibration and power a radio transmission circuit were published. Since the power requirements of {{state of the art}} electronics has significantly been reduced, this idea comes again more in focus of interest. At the moment there are more than 200 different piezoceramic materials from more than 15 different vendors are available. Most of the materials are developed for sensing, actuation and ultrasound application. The here considered question is: Are there any interesting materials for generation application? Therefore our approach is to analy ze those to find application relevant material. System analysis shows that three key parameters are of major interest. First is energy transfer rate. Typically piezoceramic materials have efficiency from 30 % up to 50 %. Here it would be always the best to choose the material with the highest energy transfer rate. But the second parameter represents voltage-current relation. This is of great importance, because choosing two materials having the same energy output but the voltage-current relation differs by a factor of 5. The final parameter is degradation, meaning mechanical load induced depolarisation. The presentation gives a survey of the obtained data set in correlation to commercial piezoceramics. The investigation showed especially, that materials with high energy transfer rate suffer under depolarization even under low mechanical load, which excludes these materials from practical applications...|$|R

The new findings about the existence of a pressure release valve at the beetle’s combustion chamber exit yield a clearer understanding of the physics of the beetle’s mass ejection mechanism. The scaled-up chamber (about 1 cm in length) is modelled by considering the chamber to be filled with liquid hexane which then undergoes vapour explosion through a pressure release valve at the exit.

50|$|The {{launch of}} ATS-2 went entirely {{according}} to plan {{up to the first}} Agena burn. When the second burn was initiated, the Agena engine failed to restart and thus the satellite could not be placed in the correct orbit. Postflight investigation found that the oxidizer isolation valve had failed to close after the first burn. This valve was supposed to prevent propellant from escaping the tanks and filling the turbopump during the coasting phase, but since it remained open, the pump developed vapor lock and thus it became impossible to pump oxidizer in. A tiny amount of ISP was generated by the <b>gas</b> generator <b>igniter</b> cartridge. The low periapsis of the orbit caused the satellite to tumble more than the stabilization system could compensate, which complicated its mission. The satellite still produced some usable data from the experiments, most notably those regarding cosmic rays and particles. It reentered the atmosphere on September 2, 1969.|$|R

It has been shown conclusively that under certain conditions of step location, step height, and port height, which govern the velocity of gases at the step by the partially ignited propellant surface or by the <b>igniter</b> <b>gas</b> Row, secondary ignition can occur far downstream of the step, This is very likely to be within the recirculating Row region. The secondary ignition gives rise to two additional flame fronts, one of which spreads backward st a relatively lower velocity, presumably as a result of low reverse velocities present in the separation zone.

An understanding of the ignition transient of a solid propellant rocket motor becomes increasingly more important as larger and more sophisticated solid propellant rocket motors are developed. Cost considerations alone require the minimal use of empirical methods in rocket development. Consideration of structural strength limitations, possible critical trajectory guidance and vehicle attitude control requirements, and the problem of ignition shock to sensitive instrumentation require that the ignition transient response be known and used as a basis for design. The ignition transient includes the entire time from initiation of the ignition signal to the attainment of design operating conditions within the rocket motor. The ignition transient can be separated into three intervals: the ignition lag interval - the delay between the initial ignition signal and the igniting of the first propellant element; the flame spreading interval - the time required for the propellant surface to become wholly ignited following first ignition; and the chamber filling interval - the time from completion of flame spreading to the attainment of design operating conditions. This research is the logical extension of the modified ignition transient prediction theory of Summerfield, Parker, and Most to small solid propellant rocket motors with practical configurations. The object was to design, develop, and test-fire small rocket motors with practical configurations using a realistic igniter and to compare the experimental results with computer predicted ignition transients. Two case bonded motors were developed, one with a circular port and the other with a star shape port. A combined total of 57 circular and star shape motors were tested using various exit nozzle areas and propellant grain lengths of 3. 5, 7. 625, and 9. 5 inches. A large discrepancy was found between the predicted and experimental results in the flame spreading interval, with a smaller difference occurring in the chamber filling interval. Three possible reasons are considered for the slow pressure rise; back flame spreading, back chamber filling, and cooling-off of the <b>igniter</b> <b>gas</b> as it flows along the motor length. Based on diagnostic firing runs, it was determined that back flame spreading did not occur and that back chamber filling was only a minor contributor to the slow pressure rise. Cooling-off of the <b>igniter</b> <b>gas</b> is considered the major probable cause for the slow pressure increase. Completion of flame spreading was determined to take place after 50 % of the equilibrium chamber pressure was reached. This indicates a need to assign equal importance to the flame spreading and chamber filling intervals when considering ways to control the ignition transient. The ignition prediction theory of Summerfield, Parker, and Most appears to be fundamentally correct. The results of this research indicate a need for refinement in the theory, particularly in the flame spreading interval in order to better predict the performance of rocket motors of practical configuration.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of solid rocket motor (SRM) need to predict the internal gas-dynamic phenomena that happen during the SRM operative life. The operative life of a SRM can be divided in a sequence of different phases: the first phase is the ignition transient during which the solid propellant is ignited; the second phase is the quasi-steady phase during which the SRM reaches the design operative conditions; finally there is the combustion-tail during which the combustion of solid propellant extinguishes. The phenomena happening during ignition transient are often more critical than those occurring in the subsequent phases; within {{a fraction of a}} second hot <b>igniter</b> <b>gases</b> flow in the combustion chamber reaching supersonic conditions; pressure jumps of tenths of atmospheres and temperature peaks of thousands of Kelvin degrees can occur. The ignition transient unsteady behaviour can cause net thrust and pressure transients, over-pressure peaks, hang-fires or misfires, propellant grain stresses, dynamic loads on the launch vehicle (and on its payload) and on the ground segment etc [...] . All the above phenomena can compromise the performances of the SRM and often the successful of the launch. The study of the SRM ignition transient is the research background of this Ph. D. dissertation. It is common and well confirmed practice in industry to analyze ignition transient using zero-dimensional, volume-filling or one-dimensional physical models, and only recently two-dimensional approaches can be found. Presently the increasing of the computational capabilities allows to a fully three-dimensional study. The reasons to develop a three-dimensional model are numerous: first of all the combustion chamber of a common SRM has often a three-dimensional geometry; second the igniter nozzles has a three-dimensional configuration with both axial and radial nozzles. Therefore the gas-dynamic phenomena generated by the igniter jets have strong three-dimensional behaviour that is impossible to study by means of a non fully three-dimensional model. The aim of this research is to present and provide suitable three-dimensional model and numerical tools able to describe the SRM ignition transient with particular interest to study the gasdynamical aspects of SRM ignition transient...|$|R
50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed <b>gas</b> storage system, <b>igniter,</b> and flame gun. The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel and into the flame gun. The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the flame gun. The flame gun had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the flame gun, thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the flame gun, valves, and ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the flame gun, whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, and the flame gun to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|R
40|$|Imaging based optical {{diagnostics}} {{have played}} an important role in combustion and fluids studies. However, most imaging techniques are two dimensional. The increasing interest in accurate whole field measurement has heightened the need for developing three dimensional methods. Furthermore, many flows are inherently 3 D in nature. One aim of this study is to develop an innovative 3 D schlieren/shadowgraph system based on conventional schlieren/shadowgraph techniques. Furthermore, several research issues related to fluid mechanics and combustion are investigated using multi optical methods, including high speed direct/schlieren imaging, stereo imaging and 3 D reconstruction and PIV techniques, etc. Firstly, a stereoscopic shadowgraph system has been developed using two sets of conventional z-type schlieren configurations. The test volume is set at the intersection of two inclined converging beams formed by two pairs of parabolic mirrors. Two synchronised high speed cameras are used to record the shadowgraph image pairs simultaneously. A precisely etched metal mesh plate is used to calibrate the stereoscopic shadowgraph system. The fully developed MATLAB code is employed to obtain calibration parameters and 3 D coordinates reconstruction. A crystal block with internal 3 D images is acted as a static model for point reconstruction. The 3 D coordinates obtained are in good agreement with the real dimensions. The technique has been subsequently applied to investigate the bursting dynamics of a bubble. The 3 D curve reconstruction is also accomplished successfully. The stereoscopic shadowgraph technique has been shown to be an effective method for both 3 D visualisation and quantitative measurement. Secondly, the spark induced hot gas jet of a <b>gas</b> turbine combustor <b>igniter</b> has been investigated using optical methods with the combination of high speed schlieren and stereo imaging. A spherical shockwave and a hot gas jet are observed after spark initiation. The 3 D velocity vectors of the flying off metal bits are calculated by a stereo imaging and reconstruction algorithm. It has been found that the amount and velocity distributions of the eroded metal bits are very different even at a fixed input voltage to the igniter, which contrasts with the quite consistent hot gas jet development. The 3 D structures of the interaction boundaries between hot gas and ambient air are reconstructed for the first time using stereoscopic shadowgraph technique. Thirdly, the vortex dynamics and structures of methane-air diffusion flames are investigated under different co-flow conditions. The schlieren and PIV images show that the visible flame flickering is dominated by the dynamics of the external toroidal vortices outside. The co-flow air is observed to push the initiation point of toroidal vortices beyond the visible flame height and suppress flame flickering completely. The velocity vectors and vorticity contours at different air flow rates are presented and analysed. The shedding frequency of the toroidal vortex is found to be consistent with the result obtained from a photomultiplier. The investigation indicates that co-flow helps to depress flame instability by changing the vortex evolution. Finally, a laminar diffusion flame is studied under external acoustic excitation at different frequencies (6 Hz- 100 Hz). The flame structures and vortex evolutions are investigated using high-speed stereo/schlieren imaging and digital imaging processing techniques. The flame frequency shows obvious nonlinear response to both the excitation frequency and amplitude. Several typical nonlinear phenomena were observed and analysed, which may serve as proof for relevant numerical simulation. ...|$|R
