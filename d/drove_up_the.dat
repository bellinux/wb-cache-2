5|$|Clayton used various {{tactics to}} pay for the needed {{infrastructure}} changes in the state. Most of the South was in desperate need of infrastructure and was behind {{the rest of the country}} in this respect. He raised taxes, tried to fix the state's bad credit by repaying and issuing bonds, and flooded the state with paper scrip. All of these tactics failed and <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> state debt.|$|E
5|$|After {{occupation}} {{duty in the}} Hollandia area, the 24th Division {{was assigned}} to X Corps of the Sixth United States Army {{in preparation for the}} invasion of the Philippines. On 20 October 1944, the division was paired with the 1st Cavalry Division within X Corps, and the two divisions made an assault landing at Leyte, initially encountering only light resistance. Following a defeat at sea on 26 October, the Japanese launched a large, uncoordinated counteroffensive against the Sixth Army. The 24th Division <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Leyte Valley, advanced to Jaro and captured Breakneck Ridge on 12 November 1944, in heavy fighting.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{market for}} {{ice in the}} U.S. was also changing. Cities like New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia saw their {{population}} boom {{in the second half}} of the century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> demand for ice considerably across the region. By 1879, householders in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per 100 pounds (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{began on}} Saturday, May 9, when the Brown Bears {{traveled}} {{to face the}} eighth-seeded Johns Hopkins Blue Jays at Homewood Field in Baltimore. The Blue Jays pulled away to three-goal leads {{in the first and}} final quarters, but the Bears equalized both times. In the final ten seconds of regulation, Brown attackman Kyle Hollingsworth batted in a loose ball to even the score, 11–11. In overtime, Hopkins won the faceoff and called a timeout, before Brian Christopher <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> right side of the field and made a game-winning top-corner shot on the run. It was the third overtime goal by Christopher in Hopkins' past four games.|$|E
5|$|Depopulation {{stemming}} from the Black Death led to increased wages, static food costs and a resulting improvement in {{the standard of living}} for the peasantry. However, under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the Great Slump. The economy was in ruins by 1450, a consequence of the loss of France, piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League. The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, which <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> price of food and damaged the wider economy. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years {{at the end of the}} 1440s, collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South-West. The Crown's debts reached £372,000, Henry's deficit was £20,000 per annum, and tax revenues were half those of his father.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, {{the quality}} of the ponies was noted to be declining, a result of poor choice of {{breeding}} stallions, and the introduction of Arab to improve the breed was recommended. The census of stock of 1875 reported just under three thousand ponies grazing the Forest, and by 1884 the number had dropped to 2,250. Profits from the sale of young ponies affected the number of mares that commoners bred in subsequent years. The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and driving work prior to the introduction of motor vehicles. Later, the Second World War <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> demand for, and thus, the market value of, young animals for horse meat.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} growth across South Wales <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> demand for new {{housing for the}} growing workforce. Bute {{was not prepared to}} sell any of his lands for housing, and did not see much profit in building and renting housing himself, but was prepared to lease land in the growing urban areas and mining communities for land development. Initially, he attempted to negotiate 63 year long leases, which would have given his successors additional, early flexibility in how they managed the land, but these proved unpopular so he reverted to offering the more typical 99-year leases. None of the contracts offered by Bute allowed the lessee to buy the freehold or automatically renew the lease {{at the end of this}} term, which ultimately resulted in substantial political difficulties for the third and fourth marquesses when there was a storm of complaints in the late 19th and early 20th century. Bute left the style of the early developments up to the lessees, but was concerned by the poor results. Bute then began to approve the designs for new buildings personally, laying out some grand streets in the centre of Cardiff and retaining open areas for eventual use as parks. Very little money was invested in the sewage and drainage systems for his new developments, however, and a damning 1850 inquiry showed that this had resulted in cholera outbreaks across the town.|$|E
5|$|Div Cav rested near Filignano and Montaquila. Two {{troops from}} C Squadron were {{positioned}} along the Venafro–Atina {{road and the}} rest of the regiment built the road between Filignano and Montaquila. On 18 April, Bonifant left for New Zealand on furlough and was replaced by his second-in-command, Major Nicholas Wilder. On 10 May, the final offensive against the Gustav Line began; the regiment was combined with the 22nd and 24th Battalions and No. 2 Company of the 27th Machine Gun Battalion to become Pleasants Force, to take over positions held by the Kimberley Rifles. On the night of 11 May, the final battle for Monte Cassino began. The French Expeditionary Corps outflanked the German defences in an advance along the Aurunci Mountains. The 78th Infantry Division advanced to Route 6 and on the right of the Eighth Army the II Polish Corps captured Monte Cassino. The Gustav Line was soon broken through and Allied troops in the Anzio beachhead conducted a breakout. By 26 May, the Axis was retreating; the regiment retrieved its vehicles and <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley to Atina, passing through during the evening before it was stopped by opposition at Vicalvi. Three days later Vicalvi was captured by the 21st Battalion and the regiment advanced through the town. Since the bridge over the Fibreno River had been destroyed, BSquadron guarded the site while two troops found their way across and provided a flank guard for the Maori Battalion. CSquadron remained in Vicalvi on 31 May and A Squadron held Posta until it was replaced by the RAF Regiment. BSquadron moved up to Sora when the bridge was completed. On 1 June, B Squadron advanced toward Isola del Liri, which was captured by the 8th Indian Infantry Division. A Squadron was transferred to the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade to advance with it in pursuit, while the rest of the regiment laagered on the Fibreno. Allied troops rapidly advanced and Rome was captured on 4 June.|$|E
5|$|Edwards passed Earnhardt {{to reclaim}} the lead on lap 195, while Earnhardt lost a further {{position}} after Kenseth got ahead of him on the same lap. Ten laps later, Biffle moved ahead of Harvick to take fifth place, while his teammate Kenseth had a 1.5-second lead over the second-place Edwards by the 211th lap. Three laps later, the seventh caution was issued when officials located debris in the turn-two groove. The leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments. One tire from Edwards' car went outside his pit box {{but he was not}} penalized because a cameraman blocked Edwards' crew from retrieving the tire. Kenseth led the field back up to speed on the lap-219 restart; Earnhardt was in second place and Edwards third. Casey Mears hit Vickers, who spun and triggered the eighth caution on lap 224; both drivers avoided contacting the wall. Kenseth maintained the lead on the lap-227 restart. Edwards <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> track in an attempt to take the lead on lap 229, but Kenseth kept the position. Four laps later, the ninth caution was needed when Dale Jarrett spun and hit the turn-two outside wall. Kenseth remained the leader at the restart on lap 236. Edwards passed teammate Kenseth for the lead two laps later, and began to pull away. Earnhardt caught up to Kenseth by lap 243 and ten laps later he passed Kenseth for second.|$|E

A pair of Thai battalions attacked its summit in a pincer movement, while a third one <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> western slope to capture landing pad Charlie Bravo overlooking the Sam Thong-Long Tieng road. An abortive armored attack on 29 March by Communist T-34s nevertheless succeeded in driving the Thais from Charlie Bravo.|$|E

25|$|Between 1989 and 2006, {{there were}} two {{separate}} FDIC funds– the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted {{to qualify for the}} BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.|$|E
25|$|At Liberty Gap, 6 {{miles to}} the west, a similar battle occurred. The leading {{elements}} of McCook's advance was the 39th Indiana, commanded by Col. Thomas J. Harrison, which was also mounted and armed with Spencer rifles. Taking a few prisoners of the Confederate pickets that opposed them, they {{found that there were}} only two Confederate regiments in the Gap. Not waiting for the main infantry support to arrive, McCook ordered the brigade of Brig. Gen. August Willich to move forward as quickly as possible. Deploying a regiment {{on each side of the}} road, Willich's men <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> slope. A frontal assault against the breastworks was not feasible, so a fierce battle of flanking maneuvers resulted against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. St. John R. Liddell and Patrick R. Cleburne. As a second Union brigade arrived in the evening to support Willich, the Union troops had pushed a half mile beyond the southern entrance to the Gap.|$|E
25|$|The team {{returned}} home to play Lewis-Clark State on November 29. They routed the Warriors 104–57, and were led by freshman Kyle Dranginis, who had a career-high 30 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Despite sitting starters Harris and Bell, the Zags forced 20 turnovers and had a 46–20 rebounding advantage. In the teams' first meeting since 1976, the Bulldogs defeated Pacific 85–67 two days later. Despite an early 18–10 Pacific lead, Gonzaga replied with a 10–0 run later {{in the first half}} to take a 49–34 halftime lead. The frontcourt accounted for 64 of the team's points, as bench player Sam Dower scored 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds. After this, the Zags faced their first true road game of the season as they travelled to play at Washington State. Down 67–69, DaVonte Lacy made a layup for the Cougars to tie the game. With the game tied at 69, Pangos <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> court to make a layup with two seconds left to secure the 71–69 victory. Olynyk made 10 of 14 shots and grabbed seven rebounds to keep Gonzaga in the game in the second half, while Harris led the team with 23 points. The victory gave the Bulldogs their best start to a season in Division I history with a 9–0 record.|$|E

500|$|To prevent hunger or famine {{for both}} colonies, Plymouth and Wessagusset colonists {{organized}} a joint trading mission with the natives with goods {{brought by the}} Wessagusset colonists. That trading mission was somewhat successful and the two colonies split the proceeds. In November, Greene died and John Sanders was made governor of the colony. By January, the colonists continued to trade with the natives for food, but at a severe disadvantage. This <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> barter-price of corn and {{they were forced to}} trade their clothes and other needed supplies. [...] Some colonists entered a form of servitude, building canoes and performing other labors for the natives, in exchange for food. Ten colonists died. After an incident where one settler was caught stealing by the natives, the colonists hanged him in their view as a show of good faith. However, sources disagree whether the man hanged was the culprit and the colonists may have hanged an older, possibly dying man, instead. The legend that the Wessagusset colonists hanged an innocent man was later popularized by a satirical depiction of this event in Samuel Butler's 1660s poem Hudibras. In February, Sanders petitioned to Plymouth for a joint attack on the natives, but this was rejected by Plymouth's governor.|$|E
