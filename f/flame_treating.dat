40|$|The {{relationship}} between surface chemistry and morphology of <b>flame</b> <b>treated</b> low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was studied by various characterization techniques across different length scales. The chemical {{composition of the}} surface was determined on the micrometer scale by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{as well as with}} time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), while surface wettability was obtained through contact angle (CA) measurements on the millimeter scale. The surface concentration of hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl groups, {{as a function of the}} “number” of the flame treatment passes (which is proportional to the treatment time) was obtained. Moreover, a correlation was found with chemical composition and polarity, emphasizing the role of oxygen-containing functional groups introduced during the treatment. Carboxyl functional groups were specifically identified by fluorescent labeling and the results were compared with the ToF-SIMS data. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to evaluate changes in surface topography and roughness on the nanometer to micrometer length scales. After flame treatment, water-soluble low molecular weight oxidized materials (LMWOM), which were generated as products of oxidation and chain scission of the LDPE surface, agglomerated into small topographical mounds that were visible in the AFM micrographs. After rinsing the <b>flame</b> <b>treated</b> samples with water and ethanol, bead-like nodular surface structures were observed.

A heat resistant coating of lacquer is then applied. This process eliminates the need to <b>flame</b> <b>treat</b> the bottles prior to labelling in order to achieve adequate adhesion. Initially, paper was used as the label substrate to which the heat reactive adhesive was applied. In more recent times plastic substrates have been employed, such as Polyart from Arjobex Synthetic Papers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The surface functionalisation of polyethylene and polypropylene by industrial and laboratory scale corona treatments and by laboratory flame treatment was studied. The surface sensitive techniques of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attenuated total reflection infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), contact angle measurement and electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) were employed. Corona and flame treatments resulted in incorporation of oxygen only into the surfaces of both polyethylene and polypropylene, resulting in improved surface wettabilities. A variety of oxygen functional groups were introduced by the two treatments. The industrial and laboratory scale treatments of both polymers {{were found to be}} similar in terms of the oxygen concentrations incorporated and surface wettabilities achieved. The presence of significant amounts of chain scission products were indicated on corona treated surfaces, while only minimal quantities were indicted on <b>flame</b> <b>treated</b> surfaces. This was attributed to their volatilisation during flame treatment. Introduction of sulfur dioxide into the flame and corona regions during treatment resulted in significant improvements in surface wettability. Incorporation of sulfur and nitrogen resulted from the presence of sulfur dioxide. A possible mechanism involving the formation of sulfonic acid groups and ammonium sulfonate groups was suggested. An oxidation depth model developed for use with variable take-off angle XPS showed that significantly deeper oxidation occurred in the presence of sulfur dioxide. Corona treatment was more effective in improving surface wettabilities than flame treatment, this being attributed to heat induced functional group reorientation during flame. treatment for polyethylene and to differences in surface chemistry resulting from the two treatments in the case of polypropylene. The surface wettability of poly ethylene was more readily improved than the surface wettability of polypropylene after all the treatments investigated. A method for estimating functional group concentrations using chemical derivatisation and contact angle measurement was developed. Functional group estimates for <b>flame</b> <b>treated</b> polyethylene were found to be in good agreement with chemical derivatisation used in conjunction with XPS measurements...|$|R

The cylindrical diffusion <b>flame</b> <b>treated</b> here has the convex curvature toward the air stream. The fuels used were propane and methane, and they were diluted with two kinds of inert gas, nitrogen and helium. The obtained results are described as follows. (1) The burner used in this study can form the cylindrical flame with good circularity. The minimum flame diameter is approximately 2. 5 mm. (2) The flame radius increases (decreases) with the increase in the fuel (air) flow velocity. (3) Flame luminosity has a maximum value when the air flow velocity is varied. On the other hand, the luminosity decreases monotonously with the increase in the fuel flow velocity. (4) Extinction stretch rate of counterflow propane 20 %/nitrogen 80 % vs. air flame is lower than that of counterflow methane 50 %/nitrogen 50 % vs. air flame. However, this extinction stretch rate relation is reversed in the case of cylindrical diffusion flame owing to the Lewis number effect caused by the flame curvature.

40|$|Building on an {{existing}} hood design, a 4 -row flame weeder {{was developed for}} flaming in row crops like corn and soybean. Flame weeding is a thermal weed control method first researched over 100 years ago. It is a non-chemical method and has potential applications {{in a wide range}} of areas from vegetable production to urban weed control. ^ The steps in developing the 4 -row unit were: scaling up the hood design, designing a compatible torch and torch mount, developing an electronic ignition system, and finally, integrating all of the components into a complete 4 -row flamer. Design challenges included developing an unobtrusive hood assembly support system that profiled the soil surface, achieving complete vaporization of the liquid fuel, balancing flame stability and housing temperatures, and selecting a sensor for flame detection that was robust enough for harsh field environments while still providing quick response time. ^ On-farm testing was conducted throughout the design iterations of the 4 -row unit, and a fully randomized field study was conducted over two years, 2010 and 2011, to test full season weed control performance. The 4 -row unit was setup for full-flaming (FF) treatments where 100 % of the crop row was <b>flame</b> <b>treated</b> and no other weed control method was used. The field study was completed in both corn and soybean, and planting, treatments, and harvest timings matched the production timeline of an average Midwest farm. Weed control and dry matter levels, crop injury, and crop yield were the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the 4 -row unit. Weed control and crop yield in 2010 were excellent. Corn plots treated with full-flaming twice (FF 2) yielded almost 11 % higher than the weed-free control (WFC). Results in 2011 were not as good as 2010. Weed control levels for the FF treatments dropped significantly due to heavy weed pressure, and as a result, crop yields dropped. The FF 2 treatment yield in corn was 20 % lower than the WFC in 2011. Treatment results in soybean exhibited similar trends to corn. Overall, the 4 -row unit showed potential to be an excellent addition to any farmer’s current weed control methods. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of premixed flames in two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence using a Navier-Stokes/front-capturing methodology {{within the context of}} hydrodynamic theory. The <b>flame</b> is <b>treated</b> as a thin layer separating burnt and unburnt gases, of vanishingly small thickness, smaller than the smallest fluid scales. The method is thus suitable to investigate the flame propagation in the wrinkled flamelet regime of turbulent combustion. A flow-control system regulates the mean position of the flame and the incident turbulence intensity. In this context we study the individual effects of turbulence intensity, turbulence scale, thermal expansion, hydrodynamic strain and hydrodynamic instability on the propagation characteristics of the flame. Results are obtained assuming positive Markstein length, corresponding to lean hydrocarbon-air or rich hydrogen-air mixtures. For stable planar flames we find a quadratic dependence of turbulent speed on turbulence intensity. Upon onset of hydrodynamic instability, corrugated structures replace the planar conformation and we observe a greater resilience to turbulence, the quadratic scaling being replaced by scaling exponents less than one. Such resilience is also confirmed by the observation of a threshold turbulence intensity below which the propagation speed of corrugated flames is indistinguishable from the laminar speed. Turbulent speed is found to increase and later plateau with increasing thermal expansion, this affecting the average flame displacement but not the mean flame curvature. In addition, turbulence integral scale is also observed to affect {{the propagation of}} the flame with the existence of an intermediate scale maximizing the turbulent speed. This maximizing scale is smaller for corrugated flames than it is for planar flames, implying that small eddies that will be unable to significantly perturb a planar front could be rather effective in perturbing a corrugated flame. Turbulent planar flames, and more so corrugated flames, were observed to experience a positive mean hydrodynamic strain, which was explained in terms of the overwhelming mean contribution of the normal component of strain. The positive straining causes a decrease in the mean laminar propagation speed which in turn can decrease the turbulent speed. The effect of the flame on the incident turbulent field was examined in terms of loss of isotropy and vorticity destruction by thermal expansion. The latter can be mitigated by a baroclinic vorticity generation which is enhanced for corrugated flames...|$|R

Only for high surface coverage of HNO 3 the formation of HONO was suppressed in the initial phase of the reaction, probably caused by the blocking of active sites by adsorbed HNO 3. Under the assumption that the experimental findings for the used model flame soot can be extrapolated to atmospheric soot particles, the results show that the reactions of HNO 3 and HNO 3 +NO on soot surfaces are unimportant for a "renoxification" of the atmosphere and do not represent an atmospheric HONO source.

The test {{case is the}} ORACLES combustor, with a turbulent premixed flame a metre long: it exhibits limit cycle oscillations at ∼ 50 Hz and normalised velocity amplitude ahead of the flame of ∼ 0. 29. The approach obtains the flame response to acoustic excitation using Large Eddy Simulations (LES), and couples this with a low-order wave-based network representation for the acoustic waves within the combustor. The <b>flame</b> cannot be <b>treated</b> as acoustically compact; the spatial distribution of both its response and the subsequent effect on the acoustics must be accounted for. The long flame is uniformly segmented axially, each segment being much shorter than the flow wavelengths at play. A series of “local” flame describing functions, one for the heat release rate response within each segment to velocity forcing at a fixed reference location, are extracted from the LES. These use the Computational Fluid Dynamics toolbox, OpenFOAM, with an incompressible approximation for the flow-field and combustion modelled using the Partially Stirred Reactor model with a global onestep reaction mechanism. For coupling with the low-order acoustic network modelling, compact acoustic jump conditions are derived and applied across each flame segment, while between flame segments, wave propagation occurs. Limit cycle predictions from the proposed coupled method agree well with those predicted using the continuous 1 -D linearised Euler equations, validating the flame segmentation implementation. Limit cycle predictions (frequency 51. 6 Hz and amplitude 0. 38) also agree well with experimental measurements, validating the low-order coupled method as a prediction tool for combustors with long flames. A sensitivity analysis shows that the predicted limit cycle amplitude decreases rapidly when acoustic losses at boundaries are accounted for, and increases if combustor heat losses downstream of the flame are accounted for. This motivates more accurate determination of combustor boundary and temperature behaviour for thermoacoustic predictions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, the {{heterogeneous}} conversion of nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) was studied at atmospheric humidity levels on <b>flame</b> soot surfaces <b>treated</b> with gaseous nitric acid (HNO 3). In addition, the heterogeneous reaction of HNO 3 on soot was investigated at atmospheric humidity. For {{the treatment of}} soot by pure HNO 3 only reversible uptake with a surface coverage of ∼ 1 – 2 × 10 14 HNO 3 cm − 2 was observed for HNO 3 mixing ratios in the range 250 – 800 ppbv. Only for higher HNO 3 mixing ratios of> 800 ppbv the formation of NO and NO 2 was observed. The results were not affected {{by the addition of}} NO. In none of the experiments with HNO 3 the formation of nitrous acid (HONO) was observed. For HNO 3 mixing ratios < 600 ppbv the upper limit yields for HONO, NO 2 and NO were found to be < 0. 2 %, < 0. 5 % and < 1 %, respectively. Compared to untreated soot, the product formation of the reaction of NO 2 with soot was not significantly affected when the soot surface was treated with gaseous HNO 3 prior to the experiment. Only for high surface coverage of HNO 3 the formation of HONO was suppressed in the initial phase of the reaction, probably caused by the blocking of active sites by adsorbed HNO 3. Under the assumption that the experimental findings for the used model flame soot can be extrapolated to atmospheric soot particles, the results show that the reactions of HNO 3 and HNO 3 +NO on soot surfaces are unimportant for a “renoxification ” of the atmosphere and do not represent an atmospheric HONO source. In addition, the integrated HONO yield of ca. 10 14 cm − 2 in the reaction of NO 2 with soot is not significantly influenced by simulated atmospheric processing of the soot surface by HNO 3, and is still too small to explain HONO formation in the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|The {{burning of}} a candle, as typical non-propagating {{diffusion}} flame, {{has been used}} by a number of researchers to study the effects of electric fields on flame, spontaneous flame oscillation and flickering phenomena, and flame extinction. In normal gravity, the heat released from combustion creates buoyant convection that draws oxygen into the flame. The strength of the buoyant flow depends on the gravitational level and it is expected that the flame shape, size and candle burning rate will vary with gravity. Experimentally, there exist studies of candle burning in enhanced gravity (i. e. higher than normal earth gravity, g(sub e)), and in microgravity in drop towers and space-based facilities. There are, however, no reported experimental data on candle burning in partial gravity (g < g(sub e)). In a previous numerical model of the candle flame, buoyant forces were neglected. The treatment of momentum equation was simplified using a potential flow approximation. Although the predicted flame characteristics agreed well with the experimental results, the model cannot be extended to cases with buoyant flows. In addition, because of the use of potential flow, no-slip boundary condition is not satisfied on the wick surface. So there is some uncertainty on the accuracy of the predicted flow field. In the present modeling effort, the full Navier-Stokes momentum equations with body force term is included. This enables us to study the effect of gravity on candle flames (with zero gravity as the limiting case). In addition, we consider radiation effects in more detail by solving the radiation transfer equation. In the previous study, <b>flame</b> radiation is <b>treated</b> as a simple loss term in the energy equation. Emphasis of the present model is on the gas-phase processes. Therefore, the detailed heat and mass transfer phenomena inside the porous wick are not treated. Instead, it is assumed that a thin layer of liquid fuel coated the entire wick surface during the burning process. This is the limiting case that the mass transfer process in the wick is much faster than the evaporation process at the wick surface...|$|R
