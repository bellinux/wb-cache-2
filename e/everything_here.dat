500|$|Uncharacteristically, Rosas {{remained}} passive {{throughout the}} conflict. The Argentine ruler lost heart once {{he realized that}} he had fallen into a trap. Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: [...] "There is no other way; we have to play for the high stakes and go for <b>everything.</b> <b>Here</b> we are, and from here there is no retreat." [...] After an unsuccessful battle against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires. Once there, he disguised himself and boarded a ship that took him to Britain to live in exile. Embittered, he remarked: [...] "It is not the people who have overthrown me. It is the monkeys, the Brazilians." ...|$|E
500|$|The Nightfly was {{met with}} almost universally {{positive}} reviews. Billboard labeled it their top album pick {{in the first month}} of its release, calling it a [...] "stunning debut" [...] and praising its [...] "typically blue chip crew of crack players and crisp digital production." [...] David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone that [...] "Donald Fagen conjures a world where all things are possible, even to a kid locked in his bedroom." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for The Village Voice, gave the album an A and commented, [...] "these songs are among Fagen's finest [...] his acutely shaded lyrics puts the jazziest music he's ever committed to vinyl into a context that like <b>everything</b> <b>here</b> is loving but very clear-eyed." [...] Robert Palmer of The New York Times called The Nightfly a [...] "vivid and frequently ingenious look back at a world that is gone forever. Its sound is glossy and contemporary, but references to both the spirit and the music of the years when Mr. Fagen was growing up can be found in almost every song." ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff was positive, but {{noted that}} [...] "there was stuff that didn't work here", citing the long scene with Jack and Kenneth in Nancy's home, {{reasoning}} it was [...] "weirdly boring". VanDerWerff was complimentary towards James Franco's appearance, and {{commented that the}} idea that Franco {{was in love with}} a Japanese body pillow was [...] "just comic gold and a half." [...] Not being a fan of Jane Krakowski's Jenna, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "Klaus and Greta" [...] gave the character [...] "one of her best storylines in ages... <b>everything</b> <b>here</b> about how she slowly grew more and more oblivious was well-done." [...] Sean Gandert for Paste reported that it featured [...] "all sorts of funny" [...] but felt that the main plot fell [...] "pretty flat." [...] Gandert was favorable to the other stories featured here. Time contributor James Poniewozik opined Franco threw himself into the role [...] "willing to appear ridiculous and a little crazy". Poniewozik said it was a [...] "pleasure" [...] to see a [...] "desperate-Jenna plot" [...] that seemed [...] "fresh." [...] Nick Catucci, a contributor of New York magazine, deemed this episode of 30 Rock [...] "terrific".|$|E

2500|$|A European visitor said of {{the lower}} reaches of the river in 1896: [...] "The banks of the Mungo are magnificently covered with forests ... and <b>everything</b> <b>here</b> teems with life. One can see sea eagles, herons, smakes and monkeys, as well as multicolored parrots on the trees, while {{on the surface of}} the water there dance {{butterflies}} and dragonflies the size of sparrows. Now and then one hears the trumpeting of elephants, the cry of predators, and the melancholy and monotonous honking of the iguana." [...] He noted that about [...] from the mouth of the river the forest began to be cleared for cultivation of plantains, cocoyams, corn and sugar cane.|$|E

2500|$|As the war {{wound down}} in spring 1945, the Germans disbanded the Muldorf camp {{and sent the}} inmate {{population}} on yet another death march, chasing them {{from place to place}} without food or rest. Sometimes they were loaded aboard rail cars and driven to and fro. On Friday, April 27, the train suddenly stopped in a small town and SS officers jumped aboard, declaring, [...] "You are free!" [...] and ripping the insignia from their uniforms. Many prisoners believed them and jumped off the train. But Halberstam told the people around him, [...] "Today is the eve of Shabbat. Where will we go?" [...] Then he added, [...] "My heart tells me that not <b>everything</b> <b>here</b> is as it should be." [...] Suddenly, SS soldiers rode in on bicycles from all directions, firing machine guns and killing hundreds of people. At the same time, American bombers dove in, strafing the field. Only Halberstam and those who stayed with him on the train escaped injury. Two days later, their real liberation came when the train stopped near a village and the Nazi guards deserted them. American soldiers boarded the train with smiles, candy and chocolates.|$|E

[...] The American steps forward. [...] "Alright, you've got three hours to prepare yourself." [...] The American puts on a full-body Kevlar outfit, gets into a tank, drives it into a concrete bunker, the bunker is covered with 15 feet of dirt and inch-thick titanium plates. The angel unravels his whip. SNAP! The titanium and the dirt are gone. SNAP! The bunker and tank are gone. SNAP! The American howls in pain, the ground opens up under his feet and he drops straight to Hell. [...] "Next!", says the angel. The Hindu steps forward. [...] "You've got three hours to prepare yourself." [...] / [...] "I need only five minutes. I have studied Yoga all my life and can make myself immune to all pain."
