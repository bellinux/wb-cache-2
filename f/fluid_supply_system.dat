The pilot plant has been specifically designed to use the medium-temperature geothermal water so common throughout the West. EG and G Idaho, Inc., the Department of Energy Raft River Rural Electric Co-op, the US Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of Idaho have worked together to develop a facility that will use an organic liquid as the working fluid. Four wells have been drilled in the Raft River Valley, about ten miles South of Malta, in southern Idaho. The completed well system will consist of seven wells: two conventional injection wells, three production wells, and a standby reserve well of each type. The additional three wells are to be drilled in FY- 1978, in order to complete a coordinated test program before the First Pilot Power Plant is ready for operation. The system {{has been designed to}} meet the test-loop pilot plant's basic requirement: a 2450 gpm supply of geothermal fluid, at a nominal temperature of 290 F and with salinity of less than 5000 ppm. Injection of cooled geothermal fluid into the Raft River reservoir will also require a network of monitor wells. The Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR), USGS, EG and G Idaho, and the Department of Energy will jointly select sites for two 1500 -foot and five 500 -foot monitoring wells.

40|$|International audienceLong ducts (or pipes) {{composed}} of transpiring (e. g. porous) walls {{are at the}} root of numerous industrial devices for species separation, as tangential filtration or membrane desalination. Similar configurations can also be involved in <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems,</b> as irrigation or biological fluids in capillaries. A transverse leakage (or permeate flux), the strength of which is assumed to depend linearly on local pressure (as in Starling's law for capillary), takes place through permeable walls. All other dependences, as osmotic pressure or partial fouling due to polarization of species concentration, are neglected. To analyse this open problem we consider the simplest situation: the steady laminar flow in a two-dimensional channel {{composed of}} two symmetrical porous walls. First, dimensional analysis helps us to determine the relevant parameters. We then revisit the Berman problem that considers a uniform crossflow (i. e. pressure-independent leakage). We expand the solution in a series of Rt, the transverse Reynolds number. We note this series has a rapid convergence in the considered range of Rt (i. e. Rt ≤ O(1)). A particular method of variable separation then allows us to derive from the Navier-Stokes equations two new ordinary differential equations (ODE), which correspond to first and second orders in the development in Rt, whereas the zero order recovers the Regirer linear theory. Finally, both new ODEs are used to study the occurrence of two undesirable events in the filtration process: axial flow exhaustion (AFE) and crossflow reversal (CFR).

40|$|CIVINSThe {{outboard}} bearings {{that support}} shafts in naval ships and submarines present unique challenges to designers, shipbuilders, and operators. Such bearing must operate continuously and reliably in demanding environments at speeds that vary from below 1 rpm to well over 100 rpm. Water-lubricated bearings typically used for these applications operate hydrodynamically and {{are prone to}} adverse effects at lower speeds such as increased abrasive and adhesive wear as well as stick-slip shaft motion. This project focuses on developing a hybrid journal bearing capable of operating with hydrostatic pump pressure at lower rpm, while still maintaining the capability for hydrodynamic operation at higher rpm. Benefits of such a system include extending the periodicity between outboard bearing replacements, less abrasion and scoring damage to the propulsion shaft and preventing stick-slip shaft motion. To enable the in-water replacement of bearings without removal of the propulsion shaft, a partial arc (< 180 degree wrap) configuration is required. This partial arc constraint introduces several unique manufacturing difficulties. To address this, a novel manufacturing process has been developed that enables the rapid fabrication of high precision bearings with diameter and roundness errors of less that 0. 001 " (25. 4 microns) on a normal diameter of 3. 24 " as measured with a Coordinate Measuring Machine - greatly exceeding the published tolerances of conventional methods. A unique experimental test rig was designed and built {{in order to measure}} the performance of 15 different prototype bearing designs. The rig is capable of submerged bearing testing in both hydrostatic and hydrodynamic modes of operation, with funddamental parameters such as speed, torque, loads, pressures, flow rates, and shaft position recorded. The operating characteristics of the bearing were then analyzed to identify key features and variables affecting bearing performance. Certain bearing designs were found to be inherently stable for side loading conditions, without the use of compensation typically used in hydrostatic bearings. This finding led to bearing designed with simplified hydrostatic features and <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> <b>systems.</b> Such designs wre found to have minimal degradation in hydrodynamic performance, making them particularly suitable for use as hybrid bearings. The key design drivers identified in this work are combined with ancillary factors to discuss the feasiblity of hybrid bearings for use in marine applications...|$|R

The bearing consists of a 150 mm ball bearing and a centrifugally actuated, conical, fluid film bearing fitting an envelope with an outer radius of 86. 4 mm (3. 4 in.) and inner radius of 71 mm (2. 8 in.). Tests were conducted up to 16, 500 rpm, at which speed an axial load of 15, 568 N (3500 lb) was safely supported by the hybrid bearing system. Through the employment of the series hybrid bearing principle, {{it was possible to}} reduce the effective ball bearing speed to approximately one-half of the shaft speed. A reduction of this magnitude should result in a tenfold increase in the ball bearing fatigue life.

40|$|UltraForm Finishing (UFF) is a production-level optical {{polishing}} process {{consisting of}} a moving belt that is pressed into an optical surface by a carrier wheel. The current configuration is comprised of a cylindrical carrier wheel attached to cylindrical roller bearings. As the optics market is moving towards aspheric geometry with smaller radii of curvature, geometric limitations associated with roller bearings requires {{the development of a}} modified approach to the UFF process. This thesis explores the feasibility of incorporating spherical fluid bearing elements in the UFF process as a replacement for roller bearings. Self-acting (or wedge film) and externally pressurized hydrostatic spherical fluid-film bearings were investigated for the UFF process. The self-acting bearing was modeled and analyzed using a previously developed hydrodynamic finite element computer program. The hydrostatic bearing was modeled using an analytical formulation of the Reynolds equation coupled with empirical data to account for entrance flow effects at the feed hole and to account for pressure drops in the bearing <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system.</b> Both bearing configurations predicted adequate fluid film thickness under steady load and speed. Performance tests on the UFF were completed with both bearing configurations under steady load and speed. Ball to cup seizure was observed with the self-acting configuration nearly immediately after initial load and speed application, with seizure presumably due to inadequate squeeze film resistance during the transient startup period. The hydrostatic bearing operated successfully over a wide range of applied loads and speeds employed in the current UFF process with minimal cup and ball wear. The feasibility of the hydrostatic spherical bearing element in the UFF process was subsequently demonstrated through the generation of repeatable and acceptable removal function maps which were then employed in the polishing of a planar optical surface...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Central {{diabetes}} insipidus (CDI) {{is a rare}} cause of hypernatremia during the neonatal period. The diagnosis is particularly difficult in very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns. CASE REPORT: We report on a preterm newborn who presented CDI soon after birth. On {{the third day of}} life, signs of dehydration were present despite normal <b>fluid</b> <b>supply.</b> The diuresis rate was 4. 4 ml/kg/h. Although the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> was then increased, the dehydration continued, with hypernatremia, normal glycemia, diuresis of 7. 4 ml/kg/h and urine density of 1005 mOsmol/l. Thus, a diagnostic hypothesis of {{diabetes insipidus}} was raised. A test with a nasal vasopressin analogue (dDAVP) was performed and CDI was confirmed. Reduction of the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> became possible through appropriate treatment. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of CDI is rarely made during the neonatal period, especially in VLBW newborns, because of the difficulty in detecting elevated diuresis.

40|$|A {{hydrostatic}} bearing carriage (Hydrocline) that uses an open face linear motor {{to drive the}} carriage {{as well as to}} preload the {{hydrostatic bearing}}s has been developed by Professor Alexander Slocum and Gerald Rothenhöfer of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Mechanical Engineering Department. The Hydrocline is made to cope with the increasing requirements for accuracy in silicon wafer grinding machines. The prototype was built of aluminum oxide ceramic due to its high stiffness-to-weight ratio, low thermal expansion and corrosion resistance. In order to keep the cost of manufacturing as low as possible, a modular design that uses micron-level precision ceramic beams was chosen. Initial testing of the prototype carriage indicates that it has the following performance specifications: a vertical load capacity exceeding 5000 N (theoretical limit at 12000 N, max. pressure of pumps); a carriage pitch error of 0. 7 arc seconds; a yaw error of 0. 7 arc seconds; a roll error of +/- 0. 6 arcsec a vertical straightness {{at the center of the}} carriage of +/- 0. 75 microns; and a vertical stiffness of the carriage of 900 N per micron (load range from 0 to 1000 N). (cont.) A dynamic model of the hydrostatic bearing and <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> <b>system</b> has been developed and accurately predicts the performance of the Hydrocline. The model has been used to simulate a feedback control loop that adjusts the bearing supply flow such that changes in load can be compensated and theoretically infinite stiffness can be reached. In first experiments on a specially designed test setup the measured static stiffness of the single pocket test bearing could be increased by a factor 8 (load range 45 to 270 N). The dynamic stiffness of the bearing could be increased by a factor of 2. 5. by Gerald S. Rothenhöfer. Thesis (S. M.)
