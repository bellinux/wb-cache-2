5|$|In the 2006–07 season, Wade {{missed a}} total of 31 games due to injury. He was elected to his third {{straight}} All-Star Game and received All-NBA honors. He became the first guard to earn All-NBA honors after missing at least 31 games in a season since Pete Maravich of the Utah Jazz earned Second Team honors during the 1977–78 season. Despite Wade's play, the Heat struggled {{early in the season}} with injuries and were 20–25 on February 1, 2007. But with Shaquille O'Neal healthy and Pat Riley returning to the bench after undergoing hip and knee surgeries respectively, the Heat seemed poised to surge into {{the second half of the}} season. However, during a game against the Houston Rockets on February 21, 2007, while attempting to steal the ball from Shane Battier, Wade dislocated his left shoulder and was assisted off the court in a wheelchair. After the injury, he was left with the decision to either rehabilitate the shoulder or undergo season-ending surgery. Wade later announced that he would put off the surgery and rehabilitate his shoulder with the intention of rejoining the team in time for the playoffs. After missing 23 games to recover from the injury, Wade returned to the active roster in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. Sporting a black sleeve to help protect his dislocated left shoulder, Wade played 27minutes and recorded 12 points and 8 assists, in an 111–103 overtime loss. For the season, Wade averaged 27.4 points, 7.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game shooting 50% from the field, and finished the season as the NBA's leader <b>in</b> <b>PER</b> (Player efficiency rating).|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Some {{anterior}} open bites close spontaneously, {{others do}} not. It would be advan-tageous if the orthodontist had some means of predicting the spontaneous outcome in open bite patients. One-hundred-and-twenty-seven patients having open bite were recorded longitudinally {{for a minimum}} period of 3 years using cephalometric radiographs. The open bite closed spontaneously <b>in</b> 50 <b>per</b> cent of a prepuberal group aged between 7 and 10 years, <b>in</b> 49 <b>per</b> cent of a puberal group aged 11 - 14 years, and <b>in</b> 44 <b>per</b> cent of a post-puberal group aged between 14 and 21 years when first seen. Data from cephalometric analysis of the first film in each case was analysed using discriminant function analysis. The analysis correctly predicted the outcome <b>in</b> 88 <b>per</b> cent of the prepuberal group, <b>in</b> 74 <b>per</b> cent of the puberal group, and <b>in</b> 94 <b>per</b> cent of the post-puberal group. The accuracy of the prediction equation was checked in a new sample of 35 subjects with open bite observed over at least 2 years so that the spontaneous outcome was known. The equation correctly predicted the outcome <b>in</b> 79 <b>per</b> cent of prepuberal, <b>in</b> 80 <b>per</b> cent of puberal, and <b>in</b> 100 <b>per</b> cent of post-puberal patients in the second sample...|$|R

5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 <b>in)</b> <b>per</b> year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E

The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E
