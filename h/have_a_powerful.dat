5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans.

5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and they also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful,</b> venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|The serial {{continues}} the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures. Workmen excavating {{a site in}} Knightsbridge, London, discover a strange skull and what at first {{appears to be an}} unexploded bomb. Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an alien spacecraft. The ship and its contents <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> and malign influence over many of those who come in contact with it, including Quatermass. It becomes obvious to him that the aliens, probably from Mars, had been abducting pre-humans and modifying them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world.|$|E

5|$|Slow lorises <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{grasp with}} both {{their hands and}} feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp {{branches}} with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180Â° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

25|$|When {{confronted by}} humans, coral snakes will almost always attempt to flee, and bite {{only as a}} last resort. In addition, coral snakes have short fangs (proteroglyph dentition) that cannot {{penetrate}} thick leather clothing. Any skin penetration, however, is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. Coral snakes <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> neurotoxin that paralyzes the breathing muscles; mechanical or artificial respiration, along with large doses of antivenom, are often required to save a victim's life. There is usually only mild pain associated with a bite, but respiratory failure can occur within hours.|$|E
25|$|When a Mafia boss retires from {{leadership}} (or is killed), his clan's {{reputation as}} effective protectors and enforcers often goes with him. If his replacement has a weaker reputation, clients may lose {{confidence in the}} clan and defect to its neighbours, causing {{a shift in the}} balance of power and possible conflict. Ideally, the successor to the boss will have built a strong reputation of his own as he worked his way up the ranks, giving the clan a reputable new leader. In this way, established Mafia clans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> edge over newcomers who start from scratch; joining a clan as a soldier offers an aspiring mafioso a chance to build up his own reputation under the guidance and protection of senior mafiosi.|$|E
25|$|After {{working in}} the emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his {{handwriting}} earned him the attention of George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, mentor of Thomas Jefferson, and a judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery. Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and amanuensis, a role in which Clay would remain for four years. The chancellor took an active interest in Clay's future, lending books and discussing philosophy with his young employee. Wythe would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's view that {{the example of the}} United States could help spread human freedom around the world. Clay also adopted Wythe's negative views on slavery (Wythe freed all of his slaves and hired some of them as free workers), though Clay continued to own slaves throughout his life. Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, Robert Brooke, with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies. Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar to practice law in 1797. However, the Virginia legal field was competitive, with much depending on family ties, so Clay decided to move West to be closer to his family in Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of NjegoÅ¡' reign {{was marked by}} a revival of Montenegro's traditional alliance with Russia. The {{relationship between the two}} countries was motivated by the Montenegrins' need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> ally who could provide political and financial support to their fledgling nation and Russia's desire to exploit Montenegro's strategic location in its ongoing geopolitical battle with Austria. Traditionally, the Serbian Orthodox monastery in Cetinje and the institution of vladika had survived through the centuries because of Russian support, but Petar I's final years witnessed a cooling of RussoâMontenegrin relations. With the RadonjiÄes expelled, NjegoÅ¡ abolished the office of guvernadur in 1832. This move did not bring him any new powers, as Russia insisted on the establishment of the Governing Senate (PraviteljstvujuÅ¡Äiji senat) of Montenegro and the Highlands, whose purpose was to limit and regulate the powers of the vladika. Much like the Governing Soviet (PraviteljstvujuÅ¡Äi sovjet) in Serbia, most of the senate's members were hand-picked by the Russians because of their political leanings, which were often more favourable to Saint Petersburg than they were to Vienna. Created to replace the kuluk formed by Petar I in 1798, the senate was established by Ivan VukotiÄ, a Montenegrin-born diplomat in Russian service. He had been sent to Cetinje by the Russian government in 1831, alongside his nephew Matija VuÄiÄeviÄ. The two hailed from the Turkish-controlled Zeta Plain and had lived in Russia for much of their lives. They were tasked with establishing a strong central government which could control the country's many tribes. VukotiÄ was quite wealthy, having inherited a large sum of money from a noble family member, and had experience as a non-commissioned officer in the Russian military.|$|E
500|$|Needless to say, {{accounts}} of est are fraught with controversy and criticisms abound. Its major critics suggest that est is simply brainwashing.

Nevertheless, what follow-up studies have been done report strong evidence in favor of positive health changes among the respondents after the training (even though est claims not to be a form of therapy) Space does not allow for a thorough review of estâs principles here.

500|$|Magna Carta {{continues}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> iconic status in British society, being cited by politicians and lawyers {{in support of}} constitutional positions. Its perceived guarantee of trial by jury and other civil liberties, for example, led to Tony Benn's reference to the debate in 2008 over whether to increase the maximum time terrorism suspects could be held without charge from 28 to 42 days as [...] "the day Magna Carta was repealed". Although rarely invoked in court in the modern era, in 2012 the Occupy London protestors attempted to use Magna Carta in resisting their eviction from St. Paul's Churchyard by the City of London. In his judgment the Master of the Rolls gave this short shrift, noting somewhat drily that although clause 29 was considered by many {{the foundation of the}} rule of law in England, he did not consider it directly relevant to the case, and the two other surviving clauses actually concerned the rights of the Church and the City of London.|$|E
