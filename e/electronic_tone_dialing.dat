40|$|For Telephone, Satz focusses on the {{familiar}} {{pitch of the}} <b>electronic</b> <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> a signal of live telephonic connection which came into widespread use in 1950 s. Considering the <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> as an open field of potential communication, Satz talked with electronic music pioneers Laurie Spiegel and Pauline Oliveros on the technological and perceptual implications of composing and listening to sustained musical notes, known as drone music. Excerpts of the conversations, recorded via Skype and IPhone, are played against compositions by the two composers, probing the political, musical and conceptual implications of the drone. <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> Drone features excerpts from ‘Horse Sings From Cloud’ (1975), an accordion score by Pauline Oliveros, and ‘Expanding Universe’ (1974 - 76), a computerised composition by Laurie Spiegel. The commission is a companion piece to Satz’s work <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> Operator, on show as part of ‘Mirrorcity’ at Hayward Gallery. To coincide with {{the launch of the}} commission there was a live performance with Elaine Mitchener and Jennifer Walshe at the Hayward Gallery on the 15 th November 2015. Further exhibitions: Group exhibition at 44 th International Film Festival Rotterdam (Rotterdam, 2015); CONTEXT Art Miami, group exhibition curated by Christoph Cox (Miami, 2015); 'Where there is sea there are pirates', group exhibition at 3 137 Gallery (Athens, 2016) ...|$|R

It could be used to dial a telephone number by holding the device to the mouthpiece of a <b>tone</b> <b>dialing</b> telephone. The <b>tone</b> <b>dialing</b> feature was integrated into the Psion's Agenda, Contacts and Data applications.|$|R

50|$|An {{analogue}} {{telephone line}} may send tones {{such as a}} busy signal, reorder <b>tone</b> or <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> to indicate a call has ended.|$|R
50|$|In the UK the {{situation}} was rather different due to the difference in technology between the American and British systems, the main difference being the absence of <b>tone</b> <b>dialling</b> and signalling particularly in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Note: the <b>tone</b> signal after <b>dialing</b> [...] "8" [...] is {{compulsory}} on old analog (with pulse mode dialing) {{exchanges and}} optional on digital (<b>tone</b> mode <b>dialing)</b> exchanges.|$|R
50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> is a <b>dial</b> tone-like sound {{presented to}} the caller after a call {{has been set up}} to prompt for additional digits to be <b>dialed.</b> Secondary <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> are often used in call queuing and call forwarding systems.|$|R
5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> were usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post Office <b>dialling</b> <b>tone</b> was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz <b>dial</b> <b>tone.</b>|$|R
5000|$|ToneLoc took {{advantage}} of the extended return codes available on US Robotics modems (e.g., ATX6 [...] ) to detect <b>dial</b> <b>tones</b> upon <b>dialing</b> a number and to detect when a human answered the phone in addition to scanning for other modems. Detection of voice numbers sped up the scanning process by disconnecting upon detecting a human instead of timing out waiting for a modem carrier signal. The detection of a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> after <b>dialing</b> a number allowed for users to search for poorly secured extenders which could be used to divert calls through.|$|R
50|$|The Dialogic {{cards are}} capable of making and {{answering}} calls, identifying caller ID, playing back sounds to the caller and recording sounds from the line, and detecting Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (touch <b>tones)</b> <b>dialed</b> by the caller. They can also tear down a call and detect when the caller has hung up.|$|R
50|$|They {{soon came}} across a solo singer playing local pubs and clubs doing his own songs and a few Bowie covers. Tony Deary (later <b>Tone</b> <b>Dial)</b> joined the band {{after a couple of}} {{meetings}} and the band (now five members) was complete. After much debate the band decided to call themselves Neon Hearts.|$|R
50|$|Notice, {{that when}} using older non-digital {{extensions}} for the inter-city, international calls {{as well as}} the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, {{it may be necessary to}} wait for a continuous <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital dial phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kiev, one needs to dial 0, wait for a <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> and then <b>dial</b> 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then dial the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to dial 0, wait for the <b>dial</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>dial</b> another 0 to access international line, then dial 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number.|$|R
50|$|Other {{countries}} {{have sought to}} use technical means to prevent callback, by blocking the inbound and outbound calls made to and from DID numbers, or by disabling touch <b>tone</b> <b>dialing.</b> However, this is also overcome {{by the use of}} speed dial numbers, while others use these services by triggering callback via the Internet or SMS.|$|R

5000|$|A similar [...] "FCO" [...] service {{provided}} {{no difference in}} local calling area (the distant exchange {{is in the same}} rate centre). Historically, it was a means to obtain features not available on the local exchange (such as DTMF <b>tone</b> <b>dialling</b> when first introduced in 1963) or keep an existing business telephone number operational after a cross-town move.|$|R
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring contacts are in practice used for various things such {{as a ground for}} selective ringers, low voltage power for a dial light, or for 'anti-tinkle' circuitry to prevent pulse dialing phones from ringing the bell on other extensions. With <b>tone</b> <b>dialing,</b> anti-tinkle measures are not required.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tone</b> <b>Dialing</b> is {{an album}} {{recorded}} in 1995 by the American jazz composer and saxophonist Ornette Coleman and his Prime Time ensemble. It {{was released in}} September 1995 by Coleman's Harmolodic record label, in partnership with Verve/PolyGram. [...] It was the Harmolodic label's first release, and [...] "the first disc fully devoted to Coleman's music in eight years." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, Coleman and his son, Denardo, {{established}} the Harmolodic record label, {{which had a}} marketing and distribution arrangement with Verve/PolyGram. [...] The label released its first album, Coleman's <b>Tone</b> <b>Dialing,</b> in September 1995. Harmolodic went on to release new albums by Coleman and Jayne Cortez, and also reissued some of Coleman's previous albums. The label was based in Harlem, New York.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> is the G.I. Joe Team's {{electronics}} and communications expert. His {{real name is}} Jack S. Morelli, and his rank is that of corporal E-4. <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> was born in Eugene, Oregon.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dial</b> <b>Tone</b> is briefly {{mentioned}} in the fiction novel 6 Sick Hipsters. In the story, the character Paul Achting spent four years collecting G.I. Joe figures {{to set up a}} battle scene between the Joes and Cobra. Although <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone's</b> figure is not depicted, as Paul imagined the characters in his head he described Sgt. Slaughter [...] "speaking on a transistor radio to <b>Dial</b> <b>Tone,</b> the communications specialist, back at G.I. Joe headquarters".|$|R
5000|$|An {{outbound}} [...] "extender" [...] is {{an automated}} local number at a service bureau {{in the larger}} city. A suburban subscriber (who can call the city itself locally but is long distance to suburbs on the other side) could call the extender locally, get a city <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> and <b>dial</b> back out locally to the larger area.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music on}} the album is {{described}} as: [...] "veering uncomfortably between murky electronic experimentalism and weedy pseudo-baroque," [...] and as, [...] "thoroughly tonal, Romantic-orchestra-inspired, <b>electronic</b> <b>tone</b> poems." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{telephone}} {{was able}} to operate on both loop disconnect (pulse) and MF4 (<b>tone)</b> <b>dialing.</b> The method was chosen by a switch on the base, {{as shown in the}} photograph. It was introduced in the 1980s as a basic telephone and was the last model with a mechanical bell. The volume control was the ultimate in simplicity: a plastic disc with a hole in it which could be rotated to cover over the sounder holes by a varying amount.|$|R
50|$|This was {{a system}} whereby users could call in {{and using a}} MF4 <b>tone</b> <b>dialing</b> {{telephone}} the user could actually make bookings. This was prior to the Internet coming into common use and a first step at remote bookings. This was implemented in the USA but did require a special interface card. It was not implemented in Europe because the telephone system being different {{and the cost of}} developing another interface card. Call Registrar was superseded by Student Center.|$|R
50|$|In North America, the Precise Tone Plan {{used today}} employs two tones of 480 and 620 Hz at 60 i.p.m. (i.e. on for 0.5 s, off for 0.5 s). In the past, before the {{adoption}} of the PreciseTone system, busy signal was generally composed of the same <b>tone</b> as <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> in the central office in question, interrupted at the same rate.|$|R
50|$|A dry loop is an unconditioned leased pair of {{telephone}} {{line from a}} telephone company. The pair does not provide <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> or battery (continuous electric potential), {{as opposed to a}} wet pair, a line usually without <b>dial</b> <b>tone</b> but with battery.|$|R
50|$|Automatic exchanges {{were also}} {{commissioned}} at the East and North of the Island in 1975 {{but of the}} ITT Italian subsidiary FACE Standard Pentaconta crossbar switch type. This new equipment could accept <b>tone</b> <b>dialling</b> and allowed the introduction of telephones with keypads instead of a dial. Two further Philips PRX205 electronic exchanges were introduced in 1975 in Central as a relief exchange to the Strowger unit and 1976 at West due to a shortage of lines on the Ericsson of Beeston CB switchboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} phone {{phreaking}} trace {{back at least}} to AT&T's implementation of fully automatic switches. These switches used <b>tone</b> <b>dialing,</b> a form of in-band signaling, and included some tones which were for internal telephone company use. One internal-use tone was a tone of 2600 Hz which caused a telephone switch to think the call had ended, leaving an open carrier line, which could be exploited to provide free long-distance, and international, calls. At that time, long-distance calls were quite expensive.|$|R
