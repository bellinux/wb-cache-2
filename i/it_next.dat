5|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the premiere, Chaplin decided to have an unpublicized preview at Los Angeles' Tower Theatre. It went poorly, {{attracting}} a small and unenthusiastic crowd. Better results were seen at the gala premiere on January 30, 1931 at the Los Angeles Theater. Albert Einstein {{and his wife were}} the guests of honor, and the film received a standing ovation. <b>It</b> <b>next</b> premiered at the George M. Cohan Theater in New York where Chaplin closely supervised the release, spending the day doing interviews, and previously spending $60,000 on the advertising, as he was frustrated with what UA's publicists had come up with. Chaplin demanded half of the total gross, and considering audiences would be more attracted by the film itself than its technology, he demanded higher ticket prices compared to talkies.|$|E
5|$|The island {{seems to}} have been held, in {{association}} with the local manors of Uphill and Christon, by the Bek family, who granted it to Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Although the mechanism is unclear, <b>it</b> <b>next</b> passed to the Berkeley family with Maurice de Berkeley, the second Baron Berkeley, holding it in 1315. The site was used again by warreners in the 14th and 15th centuries. They lived in one of the ruined priory buildings which was rebuilt. By 1453 the overlordship of the island was held by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, and in 1460 the advowson was exercised by Margaret Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. In the years following, the ownership of a variety of estates, including Norton Beauchamp, to which Steep Holm was attached, was disputed. In the 16th century Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset took over, and then lost, large estates including Brean, to which Steep Holm was allied. The Seymour descendants recovered the estates, owning them into the 17th century, although the only activity on Steep Holm {{seems to have}} been the employment of gull watchers and fishermen. In 1684 the Norton Beauchamp estate was sold to Edward Ryder. It appears to have been auctioned by decree of the Court of Chancery 11years later in 1695, possibly because of difficulties in maintaining sea defenses along the Somerset coast; however, this {{seems to have been}} disputed in the light of outstanding mortgages. In 1699 the estates, including Steep Holm, were sold to Philip Freke of Bristol, whose descendants held it for the next 130 years. Freke's granddaughter married into the family of John Willes, who was Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Member of Parliament. During their ownership, probably around 1776, a new cottage was built on Steep Holm for fishermen. It was built using stones from the ruined priory. In 1830 the island was sold again, according to some sources this was to a cousin of John Freke Willes named William Willes; however, other sources suggest it was to a solicitor in Weston-super-Mare named John Baker.|$|E

25|$|In 1597, {{the queen}} {{seems to have}} promised Buck the {{reversion}} (the right to succeed to an office when <b>it</b> <b>next</b> fell vacant) {{of the office of}} Master of the Revels. The office was held at the time by Buck's relation by marriage, Edmund Tilney. The playwright John Lyly, however, believed that since about 1585 Queen Elizabeth had led him to expect appointment to the post. He was vocal in his distress, writing letters of protest and supplication. The reversion was formally conferred on Buck in 1603, on the accession to the throne of King James I. Also upon the accession of James I, Buck was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber and knighted. At the same time, he inherited his aunt's lands in Lincolnshire. In 1606, he began to license plays for publication.|$|E
25|$|Méliès' {{great success}} in 1902 {{continued}} with his three other major productions of that year. In The Coronation of Edward VII, Méliès reenacts the crowning {{of the new}} British King Edward VII. The film was shot prior to the actual event (since he was denied access to the coronation) and was commissioned by Charles Urban, head of the Warwick Trading Company and the Star Films representative in London. The film {{was ready to be}} released {{on the day of the}} coronation, however, the event was postponed for six weeks due to Edward's health. This allowed Méliès to add actual footage of the carriage procession in the film. The film was financially successful and King Edward VII was said to have enjoyed <b>it.</b> <b>Next,</b> Méliès made the féeries Gulliver's Travels Among the Lilliputians and the Giants, based on the novel by Jonathan Swift, and Robinson Crusoe, based on the novel by Daniel Defoe.|$|E

An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces <b>it.</b> <b>Next</b> to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and a crazed cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E
25|$|In 1705, Edmond Halley (1656–1742) applied Newton's {{method to}} twenty-three cometary apparitions that had {{occurred}} between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, the comets of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar orbital elements, and he was further able {{to account for the}} slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation by Jupiter and Saturn. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9. (Earlier, Robert Hooke had identified the comet of 1664 with that of 1618, while Giovanni Domenico Cassini had suspected the identity of the comets of 1577, 1665, and 1680. Both were incorrect.) Halley's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who predicted the date of the comet's 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy. When the comet returned as predicted, it became known as Halley's Comet (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). <b>It</b> <b>next</b> appears in 2061.|$|E
25|$|The Pequod is now heading {{southeast}} toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard {{from the}} mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Now Queequeg proposes that his superfluous coffin {{be used as}} a new life buoy. Starbuck orders the carpenter take care it is lidded and caulked. Next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with the Rachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. The Rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son. Ahab refuses to join the search. Twenty-four hours a day, Ahab now stands and walks the deck, while Fedallah shadows him. Suddenly, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with <b>it.</b> <b>Next,</b> the Pequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets the Delight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, but Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab shares a moment of contemplation with Starbuck. Ahab speaks about his wife and child, calls himself a fool for spending 40 years on whaling, and claims he can see his own child in Starbuck's eye. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet both their families, but Ahab simply crosses the deck and stands near Fedallah.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing <b>it</b> <b>next</b> to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|South of the {{confluence}} of Indian Pass Brook and Calamity Brook, the Hudson River flows south into Sanford Lake. South of the outlet of the lake, the Opalescent River flows into the Hudson. The Hudson then flows south, taking in Beaver Brook and the outlet of Lake Harris. After its confluence with the Indian River, the Hudson forms the boundary between Essex and Hamilton counties. In the hamlet of North River, the Hudson flows entirely in Warren County and takes in the Schroon River. Further south, the river forms the boundary between Warren and Saratoga Counties. The river then takes in the Sacandaga River from the Great Sacandaga Lake. Shortly thereafter, the river leaves the Adirondack Park, flows under Interstate 87, and through Glens Falls, just south of Lake George although receiving no streamflow from the lake. <b>It</b> <b>next</b> goes through Hudson Falls. At this point the river forms the boundary between Washington and Saratoga Counties. Here the river has an altitude of 200 feet. Just south in Fort Edward, the river reaches its confluence with the Champlain Canal, which historically provided boat traffic between New York City and Montreal {{and the rest of}} Eastern Canada via the Hudson, Lake Champlain and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Further south the Hudson takes in water from the Batten Kill River and Fish Creek near Schuylerville. The river then forms the boundary between Saratoga and Rensselaer counties. The river then enters the heart of the Capital District. It takes in water from the Hoosic River, which extends into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter the river has its confluence with the Mohawk River, the largest tributary of the Hudson River, in Waterford. The river then reaches the Federal Dam in Troy, marking an impoundment of the river. At an elevation of , the bottom of the dam marks the beginning of the tidal influence in the Hudson as well as the beginning of the lower Hudson River.|$|E
