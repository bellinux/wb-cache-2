40|$|AbstractClinicians {{usually do}} not have access to a lantern test when making an {{occupational}} assessment of the ability of a person with <b>defective</b> colour <b>vision</b> to recognise signal light colours: they must rely on the results of ordinary clinical tests. While all colour <b>vision</b> <b>defectives</b> fail the Holmes Wright TypeB lantern test and most fail the Holmes Wright TypeA lantern, 35 % of colour <b>vision</b> <b>defectives</b> pass the Farnsworth lantern. Can clinical tests predict who will pass and fail the Farnsworth lantern? We find that a pass (less than two or more diametrical crossings) at the Farnsworth Panel D 15 Dichotomous test has a sensitivity of 0. 67 and specificity of 0. 94 in predicting a pass or fail at the Farnsworth lantern test; a Nagel range of > 10 has a sensitivity of 0. 87 and a specificity of 0. 57. We conclude that neither the D 15 nor the Nagel Anomaloscope matching range are satisfactory predictors of performance on the Farnsworth Lantern...|$|R

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © [1964] Barry Leighton ColeThe so called "red-green" forms of <b>defective</b> colour <b>vision</b> are relatively common and have been actively studied {{since the end of}} the nineteenth century. Helmholtz (1909) and other German physiologists and physicists made the first precise colorimetric-investigations of human vision. Since this "German period" the study of colour vision was pursued principally by Anglo-saxon physicists and physiologists. In 1935, Pitt published his monograph Characteristics of Dichromatic Yision and W. D. Wright published his Researches on Normal and <b>Defective</b> Colour <b>Vision</b> in 1947. Both these publications continue to form a foundation for current research in <b>defective</b> colour <b>vision.</b> Whilst our knowledge of "red-green" <b>defective</b> colour <b>vision</b> became remarkably accurate and detailed the so called "Blue-yellow" defects were neglected. Wright (1947) refers briefly to tritahopia and tritanomaly commenting that "the amount of reliable information about tritanopia is meagre" (p 297) and that "no tritanomalous observers have yet been discovered who could make tests at the colorimeter" (p 320). The comparitive rarity of these blue-yellow colour vision defects was the principal reason for the neglect. Wright (1947) at the time suggested the incidences of tritanopia and tritanomaly were both one in a million but warned that these figures "are necessarily very approximate" (p 303). However Schmidt (1943) had screened 21, 000 visitors to an exhibition and found one case of tritanomaly. The rarity of these two defects is to some extent the product of the kind of screening tests employed. The Ishihara plates make no attempt to test for "blue-yellow" defects and the Nagel anomaloscope uses the Rayleigh equation. An attempt to modify the Nagel anomaloscope to provide a BG equation was not successful (Jaeger 1955). The Stilling pseudo-iso chromatic plates included some plates for the detection of blue-yellow defects, but the Ishihara suplanted this test in many countries. The identification of blue-yellow defects in mass and routine colour vision testing was made practicable by Farnsworth. Farnsworth (1943) produced his Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test and has devised single pseudoisomatic plates which have been shown to be a very effective means of identifying this class of colour vision defect (Jaeger, 1955). One of these plates was used by Wright (1952) in a mass survey which yielded 17 confirmed cases of tritanopia. On the basis of this survey Wright calculated that the incidence of tritanopia was between 1 in 13, 000 and 1 in 65, 000, the higher freauency being the more likely. This is a much higher incidence than the 1 in 1, 000, 000 that had suggested previously, but much lower than the 2 in 100 of red-green dichromats among men. Open Acces...|$|R

50|$|Divers {{was born}} in London and was of Kentish ancestry. He had one brother, who was {{connected}} with the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, and a sister. Inflammation in the eyes during infancy seriously impaired his vision, {{which could not be}} properly corrected by glasses. This deficiency was further aggravated by an explosion during an experiment in 1884 making him blind in the right eye. In 1850, Divers entered the City of London School where he became inspired by chemistry lectures given by Thomas Hall. In 1853-1854 he became an assistant in John Stenhouse's laboratory at the medical school of St Bartholomew's Hospital. Stenhouse regarded <b>defective</b> <b>vision</b> of Divers too serious a hindrance to admit of the attainment of success in a chemistry career, though he changed this opinion later. In 1854 an assistant vacancy opened with Edmund Ronalds (1819-1889) which Divers accepted and then continued in the same capacity under Thomas Henry Rowney (1817-1894). He then went to the Queen's College, Galway, Ireland, to take the university degree in medicine, one of the few scientific degrees then available, and to use the opportunities there afforded for teaching and research in chemistry. He remained in Galway for twelve years, defending his PhD in 1860, until 1866, when he left Ireland for London. After 1860, and until his Japanese appointment in 1873, Divers held various teaching appointments as lecturer in medicine (Queen's College, Birmingham, which later became Birmingham University), medical jurisprudence (Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London), physics (Charing Cross Hospital Medical School) and chemistry (Albert Veterinary College).|$|E
50|$|Eastern Michigan University Department of Special Education {{is among}} the oldest special {{education}} program in the United States. In 1923, the Michigan State Legislature passed bills that gave school districts state funds if they included and established special schools for handicapped students: those of cognitive impairment, those of the deaf, those who were crippled or those who were visually impaired. Though the receiving state funds seemed incising, the new bills also included that the educators of these new special schools must be specifically trained for their work. The {{state board of education}} came to the realization that such teachers were of no supply. They then established an official department at the Michigan State Normal College (previous name of Eastern Michigan University until 1956). This was the beginning of Eastern Michigan's Department of Education. By 1928, Michigan State Normal College provided classes for teachers training to be educators of the deaf and hard of hearing (now referred to as hearing impaired), for the crippled (now referred to as physical and other health impairments) and for the mentally retarded (now cognitively impaired). In 1929, a class for children with <b>defective</b> <b>vision</b> (now visually impaired) was established.Though the department was made official in 1923, the very first education course in the program was in the summer of 1915 when Dr. Charles Scott Berry took his work from the Feeble-minded school of Lapeer to Michigan State Normal College. Dr. Berry had taken charge of the school until the summer of 1917, where Professor Charles Elliott claimed his spot. The first laboratory class for teachers of the disabled was made possible in 1918, having Miss Blanche Towne as the training teacher. Since then, all of the work set forth by Dr. Berry has been for training teachers for children with various impairments.|$|E

METHODS: Five {{of the six}} affected individuals underwent an ophthalmological examination, electrodiagnostic testing, fundus photography, autofluorescence imaging, and detailed psychophysical testing. RESULTS: All five examined patients {{had a history of}} nystagmus from infancy, photophobia, <b>defective</b> colour <b>vision,</b> and poor visual acuity. The nystagmus in three of the individuals had lessened with time. Fundus examination revealed an abnormal foveal appearance, without frank atrophy or pigmentation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{contributions}} of genetics research {{to the science}} of normal and <b>defective</b> color <b>vision</b> over the previous few decades are reviewed emphasizing the developments in the 25 years since the last anniversary issue of Vision Research. Understanding of the biology underlying color vision has been vaulted forward {{through the application of}} the tools of molecular genetics. For all their complexity, the biological processes responsible for color vision are more accessible than for many other neural systems. This is partly because of the wealth of genetic variations that affect color perception, both within and across species, and because components of the color vision system lend themselves to genetic manipulation. Mutations and rearrangements in the genes encoding the long, middle, and short wavelength sensitive cone pigments are responsible for color vision deficiencies and mutations have been identified that affect the number of cone types, the absorption spectra of the pigments, the functionality and viability of the cones, and the topography of the cone mosaic. The addition of an opsin gene, as occurred in the evolution of primate color vision, and has been done in experimental animals can produce expanded color vision capacities and this has provided insight into the underlying neural circuitry...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} NYX, which encodes nyctalopin, {{lead to the}} retinal {{disorder}} congenital stationary night blindness which is characterized by <b>defective</b> night <b>vision</b> (nyctalopia) from birth. Nyctalopin is of unknown function but is predicted to be a secreted glycoprotein of the extracellular small leucine-rich repeat (SLRP) proteoglycan and protein family attached to the cell membrane in humans via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor but in mouse via a transmembrane domain. We investigated membrane association and attachment for human and mouse nyctalopin and show, conclusively, that human nyctalopin is a GPI anchored protein. In addition, the orthologous mouse protein, although it localizes to the cell surface, is not GPI anchored. We also confirm both mouse and human nyctalopins are glycosylated. Further sequence analysis suggests that chimp, dog and frog nyctalopins {{are likely to be}} GPI anchored but that rat nyctalopin is not. This is the first reported example of orthologous proteins which have different mechanisms of cell membrane attachment. Notably, the disease-causing mutations that have been identified to date in the human NYX gene are all distributed throughout the core LRR region and not in the C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence. We propose that the presence of nyctalopin {{on the surface of the}} cell rather than the mechanism of anchoring is crucial to its function...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{color change}} reached in two {{commercial}} disinfecting solutions for soft contact lenses using new color indicators has been analyzed, {{and its relationship}} with the temporal evolution of the hydrogen peroxide concentration, responsible for the disinfection process, has been examined. The results are compared with another commercial solution using a different color indicator. Methods. Color measurements of the disinfecting solutions were performed at 2 -minute intervals for over 2 hours using a Photo-Research PR- 704 spectroradiometer with horizontal optical axis. Samples were placed at the floor of a VeriVide CAC 120 light booth with a Munsell gray mask behind them. Two different standard light sources, representative of outdoor and indoor illumination, were used.
