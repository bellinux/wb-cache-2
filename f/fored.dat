Based on {{the terms of the}} accord, both signatories agreed to combine their forces in order to remove the Spanish from Italy. The {{agreement}} also dictated that the Duke of Mantua exchange the province of Casale Monferrato for the province of Cremona. Also, the territories of Montferrat and Milan would be united under the control of Savoy. Under the treaty, Victor Emmanuel would be restored to the throne of Lombardy. Also, Henry IV would have his daughter marry Prince Victor Amadeus I and that the King of France, the Republic of Venice, and the Pope guarantee the Duke of Savoy the title of King of Lombardy. However, this accord was never realized since Henry IV was assassinated by Ravaillac in May 1610. Marie de' Medici, just crowned queen, <b>fored</b> the treaty. Even though Henry's death ended the treaty, Charles Emmanuel seized Montferrat from the Spanish in 1613, which led to a war that lasted until 1617.|$|E

For this reason, teachers and pre-service teachers should use the {{teaching methods}} which are based on constructivism. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate pre-service teachers’ opinions about constructivism and to determine the different ideas among the pre-service teachers in different departments. This research was conducted on 312 pre-service teachers who are in Turkish Language Education (TurkEd), Foreign Language Education (<b>ForEd),</b> Elementary Mathematics Education (MathEd), Early Childhood Education (EarlyEd), Primary Education (PrimEd) and Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CompEd) departments in a university in Ankara. Data were collected by “Teachers’ Sufficiency Scale” to evaluate the opinion of the pre-service teachers. The scale contains five factors about students, setting the stage, dimension about teaching and teaching organization. Results were investigated according to the variability of sub dimensions and pre-service teacher departments. Data were analyzed with percentage. Analysis of the scale revealed that pre-service teachers think that a constructivist teacher should be aware of the students’ needs and interests, social, emotional and socio-economical differences. S/he always responds the needs of the students in her/his lesson plans and teaching style. S/he knows how to take the attention of the students, how to adopt them into their environment.

The work, in the beginning, deals with general characteristic of silages, it defines this questions and devides these in consequence [...] simplified, according to the predominant nutrient of an amount of solids in the silage material. At the close, it summarizes the conditions for the succesful silage process on the whole. The practical part applies oneself to a nutriet structure comparison and, first of all, the quality of fermentation's evaluation depending on the used types of additive. The lowest values of a fermentative acids amount they were show in a silage treated by a chemical preparation, only in these silages the present of an acetatic acid was detected at the same time. Also, the amount of a lactic acid was affected with this type of additive. The most significant differences in comparison with the control silage variety were noted on an amout of alcohol after the using and urea.

40|$|Boric acid ‘flux’ {{synthesis}} {{was developed}} by our group and assisted the preparation of new borate materials solids. In this thesis apply the methodology to the preparation of new organo-borate materials. Some background and motivation for this work is presented in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2 we describe some novel phases of organoborate phases including [(C 4 H 10 N 2) (B 6 O 10 H 2) ] with direct B-N connection. The flux approach also {{led to the formation}} of a number of organic salts of polyborate anions. In Chapter 3 metal and organic bis(salicylato) spiroborates have been synthesized with high yield, purity and crystallinity by the flux approach. Since salicylate and its derivatives are asymmetric chelates, the boron centers are chiral. Resolution of the [BS(Sal) 2] anion was effected by using quininium as chiral counter cation. In aqueous media the chiral B center was found to be labile, the rate of scrambling t 1 / 2 is about 40 mins. However. solutions of chirally resolved B(Sal) 2 ions have been found to be indefinitely stable in DMF solution at room temperature. In Chapter 4 hydrothermal boric acid ‘flux’ and solvothermal synthesis of tartratoborates affords simple monomer, cyclic oligomer or chain polymer arrangements. For L-tartrate all three types can be isolated through use of different crystallization conditions, such as solvent, temperature, reagent stoichiometry and the identity of the counter cations. For meso-tartrate two isomeric cyclic tetramers can be <b>fored</b> using K or Na counter ions, that appear to exhibit a templating effect. Nmr shows that the rings are stable in solution. Finally in Chapter 5 we looked at metal-organic framework (MOF) formation using calcium and group 13 elements. The study of calcium tartrate phases was due to the unintended preparation of these from boric acid flux reactions. In the indium system interesting phase types were formed including a porous MOF polymer...|$|E

Methods: This is a population-based cohort study. Out of 4, 069 individuals with a renal biopsy consistent with IgAN (biopsies performed in 1974 – 2011), this study reviewed patient charts of a random subset of 127 individuals. Clinical and biopsy characteristics at the time of biopsy were evaluated, and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Results: Out of 127 individuals with a renal biopsy consistent with IgAN, 121 had a likely or confirmed clinical diagnosis of IgAN, primary or secondary to Henoch–Schönlein purpura, yielding a PPV of 95 % (95 % CI = 92 %– 99 %). The median age at biopsy was 39 years (range: 4 – 79 years); seven patients (6 %) were < 16 years. The male to female ratio was 2. 8 : 1. The most common causes for consultation were macroscopic hematuria (n= 37; 29 %), screening (n= 33; 26 %), and purpura (n= 14, 11 %). In patients with available data, the median creatinine level was 104 µmol/L (range 26 – 986 µmol/L, n= 110) and glomerular filtration rate 75 mL/min/ 1. 73 m&sup 2; (range 5 – 173 mL/min/ 1. 73 m&sup 2;, n= 114). Hypertension was noted in 59 (46 %) individuals. IgA deposits were reported in 97 % of the biopsy records (n= 123), mesangial hypercellularity in 76 % (n= 96), C 3 deposits in 89 % (n= 113), and C 1 q deposits in 12 % (n= 15). Conclusion: A histologic diagnosis of IgAN has a high PPV for a diagnosis of IgAN confirmed by review of patient charts.
