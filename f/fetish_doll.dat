This is an homage to Richard Matheson, the father of Richard Christian Matheson {{and the author of}} Trilogy of Terror. The episode also has a similar plot and structure to Richard Matheson's classic 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone, [...] "The Invaders" [...] which presents a similar sort of battle between a silent protagonist and miniature attackers.|$|E
5000|$|This segment, {{about the}} Zuni <b>fetish</b> <b>doll</b> [...] "He Who Kills", is {{a sequel to}} the third segment of the {{original}} Trilogy of Terror, [...] "Amelia". After finding the double homicide of Amelia and her mother from the first movie with the Zuni Doll at the scene, the local police drop off the doll to local Dr. Simpson (Lysette Anthony). As she begins to examine the doll she learns that the doll comes to life when a gold chain is removed from his neck and that the Zuni Doll has a desire for flesh. It also seems to regenerate (the idea itself initially laughable to both Dr. Simpson and her assistant) as when she chips away the charred wood, the Zuni Doll seems to be brand new.|$|E
5000|$|Amelia {{lives alone}} in a {{high-rise}} apartment building. She returns home after shopping with a package. Inside is a Zuni <b>fetish</b> <b>doll,</b> crafted {{in the form of}} a misshapen aboriginal warrior equipped with razor sharp teeth and a spear. A scroll comes with the doll, claiming that the doll contains the actual spirit of a Zuni hunter named [...] "He Who Kills," [...] and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within. As Amelia makes a call to her mother we learn that she suffers from her mother's overbearing behavior. Amelia struggles to justify her independence and attempts to cancel their plans for the evening because she has a date. The moment Amelia leaves the room, the Zuni doll's golden chain falls off without her knowing.|$|E

6000|$|The natural basin, {{entered by}} the north-east, is upwards {{of a mile}} in length, and the narrow, ever-shifting mouth is garnished with rocks, the sea {{breaking}} right across. Gunboats have floated over during the rains, but at dead low water in the dry season we would not risk the gig. Guided by a hut upon the beach fronting French Factory and under lee of the breakers off Indian Bar, I landed near a tree-motte, in a covelet smoothed by a succession of sandpits. The land sharks flocked down to drag the boat over the breakwater of shingle. They appeared small and effeminate after the burly negroes of the Bights, and their black but not comely persons were clad in red and white raiment. It is a tribe of bumboat men, speaking {{a few words of}} English, French, and Portuguese, and dealing in mats and pumpkins, parrots, and poultry, cages, and <b>Fetish</b> <b>dolls</b> called [...] "idols." ...|$|R

He is a coward, {{frequently}} {{running away from}} anything threatening. He has some real world skills, as seen in Ch. 5. He volunteers to cut the schools security cameras and disable the locks so the Roman club can swap sofas with the faculty lounge. He also lasted the longest before being found in the Roman club's hide and seek game.|$|R
5000|$|In the Simpsons episode [...] "Treehouse of Horror III", {{the segment}} [...] "Clown Without Pity" [...] {{features}} a Krusty doll {{that tries to}} kill Homer. The segment borrows elements from the Twilight Zone episode [...] "Living Doll", the Child's Play films, Gremlins, the 1975 TV film Trilogy of Terror segment [...] "Amelia" [...] about a killer Zuni <b>fetish</b> <b>doll</b> {{as well as its}} 1996 cinematic sequel Trilogy of Terror II segment [...] "He Who Kills", which are both in turn adaptations of Richard Matheson's 1969 short story, [...] "Prey". The segment also borrows elements from Cape Fear. In a different episode, [...] "The Ziff Who Came to Dinner", a possessed killer doll named [...] "Baby Button Eyes" [...] appears in a horror film, The Re-Deadening (a parody of Dolly Dearest). The doll is most likely based on the real-life appearance of [...] "Annabelle", a possessed Raggedy Ann doll.|$|E

Literary references and iconographic links join together various “robot” section by Kleist’s vision of puppet "dancing without error" and by analizing Paris 1870 mise en scène and followings. The final images and video gallery summarizes the main reasons of contemporary interest for a Second French Empire ballet, reinvented on stage by modern choreographers fascinated by <b>doll</b> <b>fetish</b> qualities...|$|R
