50|$|The {{front-mounted}} bypass fan has two stages. The annular <b>discharge</b> <b>duct</b> for {{the bypass}} fan {{runs along the}} full length of the engine, so that both the fan air and exhaust gases can exit through the same nozzle. This arrangement allows some noise attenuation, in that the still-hot fast-moving turbine exhaust is shrouded in much-cooler and slower-moving air (from the bypass fan) before interacting with ambient air. Thus the JT8D noise levels were significantly reduced from previous non-turbofan engines, although the low bypass ratio meant that, compared to subsequently developed turbofans, high noise levels were still produced.|$|E
50|$|Control of the system's fan {{capacity}} {{is critical in}} VAV systems. Without proper and rapid flow rate control, the system's ductwork, or its sealing, can easily be damaged by overpressurization. In the cooling mode of operation, as {{the temperature in the}} space is satisfied, a VAV box closes to limit the flow of cool air into the space. As the temperature increases in the space, the box opens to bring the temperature back down. The fan maintains a constant static pressure in the <b>discharge</b> <b>duct</b> regardless of the position of the VAV box. Therefore, as the boxes closes, the fan slows down or restricts the amount of air going into the supply duct. As the boxes open, the fan speeds up and allows more air flow into the duct, maintaining a constant static pressure.|$|E

For this problem, there exists a unique solution if a Joukowski hypothesis is imposed; also, the results indicate the flow to be stable with respect to small changes in the physical parameters.

The problem is reconsidered with the assumption of turbulent mixing between the jet from the two ducts and the surrounding fluid in the common duct.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the application of}} a recently developed chart for determining the directional properties of sound emitted from the open end of a ventilation duct. When designing a duct silencer to reduce noise from a large vertical <b>discharge</b> <b>duct,</b> it is useful to note that the first 5 to 10 dBA noise reduction may result from directivity losses at 90 degrees and can be accurately predicted. In 1971 the first author conducted sound directivity tests with 300 and 600 mm diameter ducts and the results were made into a rough chart of Duct Directivity Losses that ultimately found its way into the NSW EPA Environmental Noise Control Manual (5 June 1985, page 207. 1). It is wrong in principle and rather inaccurate, but some users are unaware of its failings. Over the last 13 years further duct directivity testing has been conducted and a new duct directivity chart drawn. It is based on sound directivity testing on ducts of 305, 400, 610, 915 and 1220 mm diameter. The directivity data has been related to the sound power level of noise emitted from the duct and the spherical dispersion of sound energy. The new Duct Directivity Chart allows the directivity gain or loss to be obtained for any diameter from 100 mm to 10 metres, at angles from zero to 135 degrees without the need for complex calculations.

All patients operated on between 1975 and 2008 who presented with ND as their only symptom was analyzed. Discharge's characteristics, cytological data and galactography reports were recorded. The relationship between each individual finding and the risk of breast cancer was calculated. For each diagnostic tool, the sensitivity, specificity and complication rates were calculated and compared. Nine-hundred-fifteen patients underwent selective duct excision. Two-hundred-nineteen patients (23. 9 %) were found to be affected by carcinoma. In 100 / 330 (30. 3 %) patients with bloody discharge and in 42 / 239 (17. 6 %) patients with serous secretion cancer was detected ( =  0. 004,  =  0. 013, respectively). Patients with sero-sanguinous or coloured discharge had the same risk of cancer as the population analyzed (23. 9 %,  = NS). Galactographic finding of irregular stenosis seemed to be associated with a higher risk of cancer ( =  0. 0001). Cytological findings C 5 and C 4 were associated with cancer ( =  0. 001). Selective duct excision showed highest sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, the well established role of bloody secretion is confirmed.

As the United States enters into the next space age where new launch vehicles are being designed and propulsion systems are being improved upon, it is sometimes necessary to adopt innovative techniques for manufacturing hardware. With a heavy emphasis on cost reduction and improvements in manufacturing time, rapid manufacturing techniques such as Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) are being adopted and evaluated for their use on NASA s Space Launch System (SLS) upper stage engine, J- 2 X, with hopes of employing this technology {{on a wide variety}} of future projects.

40|$|The work {{performed}} to develop composite load spectra (CLS) for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) using probabilistic methods. The three methods were implemented {{to be the}} engine system influence model. RASCAL was chosen to be the principal method as most component load models were implemented with the method. Validation of RASCAL was performed. High accuracy comparable to the Monte Carlo method can be obtained if a large enough bin size is used. Generic probabilistic models were developed and implemented for load calculations using the probabilistic methods discussed above. Each engine mission, either a real fighter or a test, has three mission phases: the engine start transient phase, the steady state phase, and the engine cut off transient phase. Power level and engine operating inlet conditions change during a mission. The load calculation module provides the steady-state and quasi-steady state calculation procedures with duty-cycle-data option. The quasi-steady state procedure is for engine transient phase calculations. In addition, a few generic probabilistic load models were also developed for specific conditions. These include the fixed transient spike model, the poison arrival transient spike model, and the rare event model. These generic probabilistic load models provide sufficient latitude for simulating loads with specific conditions.

We analyse our experience of duct excisions for spontaneous nipple discharge to try to identify features that raise suspicion of breast cancer and to identify features indicative of benign disease that would be suitable for nonoperative management. Methods. Details of one hundred and ninety-four patients who underwent duct excision for spontaneous nipple discharge between 1995 and 2005 were analysed. Results. Malignant disease was identified in 11 (5. 7 %) patients, 4 invasive and 7 insitu, which was 10. 2 % of those presenting with bloodstained discharge.

Four different outlet shapes and 3 aperture ratios of each shape were tested. A split plot experimental design was used to evaluate the effect of outlet shape, outlet size, and distance from the fan on discharge coefficient. The relationship between duct performance characteristics and discharge coefficient was examined. A mathematical equation to predict the discharge coefficient was developed and tested. Discharge coefficient values measured ranged from 0. 19 to 1. 25 depending on the aperture ratio and distance from the fan. Outlet shape had no significant effect. The apparent effects of aperture ratio and size are due to the effects of head ratio. The equation predicting the discharge coefficient had a maximum error of 5 percent for the aperture ratios of 0. 5 and 1. 0, and 15 percent at an aperture ratio of 1. 5...|$|R
