50|$|Modern {{inventory}} control systems often rely upon barcodes and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags to provide automatic identification of inventory objects. Inventory objects could include {{any kind of}} physical asset: merchandise, consumables, fixed assets, circulating tools, library books, or capital equipment. To record an inventory transaction, the system uses a barcode scanner or RFID reader to automatically identify the <b>inventory</b> <b>object,</b> and then collects additional information from the operators via fixed terminals (workstations), or mobile computers. The new trend in inventory management is to label inventory and assets with QR Code, and use smart-phones {{to keep track of}} inventory count and movement. These new systems are especially useful for field service operations, where an employee needs to record inventory transaction or look up inventory stock in the field, away from the computers and hand-held scanners.|$|E

40|$|The manual {{begins with}} a general {{description}} of the National Inventory of the Landscape in Sweden (NILS), followed by detailed information about the field inventory. Each inventory module starts with a short explanation of the criteria {{that needs to be}} met in order to register the object, and an overview of the procedures. This is followed by a detailed description of how the different variables are to be registered. The program in the field computer has different sub-menus {{depending on the type of}} <b>inventory</b> <b>object,</b> i. e. some variables are flow directing. Because of this, the order in the manual is not always the same as that in the computer program. In order to facilitate work with the field computer, there is a flowchart for every inventory module.

50|$|The {{name of the}} Golasecca culture {{comes from}} the first {{findings}} that were discovered from excavations conducted from 1822 at several locations in the Comune of Golasecca, by the antiquarian abbot Father Giovanni Battista Giani (1788-1857), who misidentified the clearly non-Roman burials as remains of the Battle of Ticinus of 218 BC between Hannibal and Scipio Africanus. Most of the <b>inventoried</b> <b>objects</b> were from different graves located {{in the areas of}} Sesto Calende, Golasecca and Castelletto sopra Ticino.

The AIP’s are standardized objects that {{provide access to}} the <b>Inventoried</b> <b>Objects</b> (IO’s) in an archive. For an archive containing Earth science data, IO’s may be physical specimens or numerical data files. They are not just textual files that provide a corpora of keywork phrases.

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the different types of house museums and their purposes before we offer information about our own house museum. There are three basic types of house museums: Documentary, Representative, Decorative. Each type has its purpose and distinct interpretive thrust. Having very little information about the Felts family, it is impossible to present our museum as the documentary Felts House. A much more realistic interpretive goal is as a representative 1815 Log House. We have used what little bits of information we have about the Felts family, and the rest of our interpretation is taken from the letters, journals, <b>inventories,</b> <b>objects,</b> or other documents from their neighbors.

40|$|To {{my parents}} This thesis {{addresses}} {{the use of}} radio-frequency identification (RFID) for three funda-mental tasks in mobile robotics: mapping, self-localization, and trajectory estimation. These topics have widely been studied in recent years, because they are regarded as key ingredients to autonomous robots. In particular, we investigate the application of long-range passive RFID in the work at hand. This RFID standard is expected {{to play a major}} role in the automation of identification processes in industry and commerce. We make several contributions to the examined tasks and show their effectiveness in extensive ex-periments with real robots. One central guideline of our approaches is that they use only the given inexpensive transponder infrastructure as well as off-the-shelf RFID hardware. An important field of application of passive transponder mapping is the continuous in-ventory of RFID-tagged goods: Compared to classical <b>inventory,</b> <b>objects</b> can be located rather than only enregistered. For this purpose, the robot traverses the environment and continuously detects transponders, using its on-board RFID reader. Localizing the RFI...|$|R

30|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) has substantially {{replaced the}} conventional bar code system of automated identification because RFID is faster, more convenient, and contactless. The many RFID applications developed so far include <b>inventory</b> control, <b>object</b> tracking, and supply chain management. An RFID system usually contains a reader and multiple tags. Each tag {{has a unique}} identification (ID), and the reader recognizes all tags in its radio range through wireless communication. However, collisions occur when multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously because they share the same wireless channel. In this case, the reader cannot immediately recognize any tags, and the collided tags must retransmit their IDs until they are identified. This wastes bandwidth and delays identification. Therefore, an efficient anti-collision algorithm is needed to reduce tag collisions and to accelerate tag identification.|$|R
