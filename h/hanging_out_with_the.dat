25|$|Their second album, Queens of Noise was {{released}} in 1977 and the band began a world tour. The Runaways quickly became lumped in with the growing punk rock movement. The band (already fixtures on the West Coast punk scene) formed alliances with mostly male punk bands such as the Ramones and the Dead Boys (via New York City's CBGB) {{as well as the}} British punk scene by <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> likes of the Damned, Generation X and the Sex Pistols.|$|E
500|$|Following Alive or Just Breathings release, {{the album}} having been written and {{recorded}} for two guitarists, the band decided {{to expand and}} become a fivesome; Dutkiewicz moved to guitar and former Aftershock drummer Tom Gomes filled in the vacant drummer position. [...] After Leach was married on April 20, 2002 and began touring again he fell into a depression. Leach left the band {{a few days before}} the band was meant to play a show and sent the band members an e-mail telling them he had quit. D'Antonio said in an interview that [...] "after three years of <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email was a little bit harsh." ...|$|E
500|$|The intense {{collaboration}} between Dylan and The Hawks {{that produced the}} basement recordings {{came to an end}} in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album, John Wesley Harding, with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he {{received a phone call from}} Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group. In his autobiography, Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings The Hawks had made with Dylan, and remembered that he [...] "could tell that <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in: blues, rockabilly, R They had rubbed off on him a little." ...|$|E

With a combination of depression, missing his wife, and throat problems, Leach sent D'Antonio an email just a few days before the band was scheduled to play a show, announcing his departure. D'Antonio stated in an interview that [...] "after three years of <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dude, and considering him a brother, to just get an email was a little bit harsh." [...] Killswitch Engage very quickly set up auditions to fill the vocalist position in the band and eventually settled on Howard Jones, who was at the time the frontman of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones very quickly had to learn a set of songs to tour with the band. Leach and the rest of the band quickly reconciled and remained close friends.|$|E
2500|$|After Kiedis {{began working}} with Flea and Jack Irons, he was {{described}} as a [...] "manic master of ceremonies" [...] before he even began singing for the group. Irons and Hillel Slovak had begun playing together in high school while performing in a band called Chain Reaction. The group included then bassist Tom Strasman and Chilean-born vocalist and guitarist Alain Johannes. With Strasman set on becoming a lawyer, he quit the band to keep his grades up and focus on college. At this point, Flea was brought into the mix. Shortly after <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band, and attending a few shows, Kiedis was offered a position in the band by Flea.

2500|$|The album {{returned}} {{the group to}} the U.S. charts one last time, peaking at No.179. For a few shows at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, Ferguson re-joined the group. Disaster struck, however, when an inebriated Neil Young walked onto stage to join the band during the final show's encore of [...] "Like a Rolling Stone." [...] California would later claim that he didn't recognize Young, {{but at the time}} was angry with Young for upstaging what he saw as his own comeback. California moved over in front of Neil and began pushing him backwards, away from the microphone, back past the drumkit and offstage. Young, along with a host of music and film luminaries, including New Hollywood director Hal Ashby, had been <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> band backstage before they went on, and Locke (a friend of Young) had invited the guitarist to join them in their encore. When Locke saw California pushing Young offstage, he got up from his piano and said that he had had enough and didn't ever want to play with California again, walking off stage. Cassidy initially quelled the situation by leaving his kit and physically pulling both California and Young back onstage to the microphone to close out the song, asking the audience to sing along with them. The audience stood, stunned at the scene that was playing out before them. After finishing the song, the band members argued backstage over what had unfolded. The damage had been done, and the reunion ended that night.|$|E

2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
