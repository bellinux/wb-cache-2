5|$|At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated {{in the bow}} and <b>exploded</b> {{the forward}} {{ammunition}} magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge <b>exploded</b> in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|Automobile {{production}} <b>exploded</b> in the U.S. and {{in other}} nations during the 1920s. This, and {{the increasing use of}} petroleum derivatives to power factories and industrial equipment, substantially increased worldwide demand for oil.|$|E

50|$|Queen: Bomb. Can move one {{square in}} any {{direction}} or It can <b>explode</b> destroying all adjacent pieces as well as itself (9 squares of destruction). It can do both in the same move. If a bomb is coordinated, it <b>explodes.</b> If a bomb is pushed off the board, the move is completed, and it then <b>explodes</b> based on its final off board position. An immobilized bomb can still <b>explode.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nevada {{became a}} prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers {{during the second}} wave. Japanese pilots {{intended}} to sink her in the channel ostensibly to block the harbor. Tactically target selection was wrong as 14–18 dive bombers attacking her wouldn't be able to sink a battleship with 250kg bombs and the channel's width of 1200 feet made the idea of bottling up the harbor impossible. As she steamed past Ten-Ten Dock at about 09:50, Nevada was struck by five bombs. One <b>exploded</b> over the crew's galley at Frame 80. Another struck the port director platform and <b>exploded</b> {{at the base of}} the stack on the upper deck. Yet another hit near No. 1 turret inboard from the port waterway and blew large holes in the upper and main decks. Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15; one passed out through the side of the second deck before exploding, but the other <b>exploded</b> within the ship near the gasoline tank; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 1828, {{the boiler}} of {{locomotive}} No. 5 <b>exploded</b> at Simpasture Junction. One {{of the two}} firemen was killed, the other severely scalded. The driver (George Stephenson's older brother) was unharmed.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of <b>exploding</b> soliton and front {{solutions}} of the complex cubic–quintic Ginzburg–Landau (CGLE) equation. We show that <b>exploding</b> fronts occur in a region of the parameter space close to that where <b>exploding</b> solitons exist. Explosions occur when eigenvalues in the linear stability analysis for the ground-state stationary solitons have positive real parts. We also study transition from <b>exploding</b> fronts to <b>exploding</b> solitons and observed extremely asymmetric soliton explosions. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. The work of J. M.

5000|$|Several games use {{mechanics}} {{that allow}} {{one or more}} dice to be rerolled (often a die that rolls the highest possible number), with each successive roll being added to the total. Terms for this include open-ended rolling, <b>exploding</b> dice, and penetration rolls. Games that use such a system include Feng Shui, and Savage Worlds. On Anydice the function to make dice <b>explode</b> on their highest value is called quite simply <b>explode.</b> Another common notation shorthand for <b>exploding</b> dice is to use an exclamation point: AdX! or [...]|$|R

The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.|$|E
50|$|Great {{care must}} be taken when {{handling}} bromine azide as it is potentially toxic and is able to <b>explode</b> under various conditions. Concentrated solutions in organic solvents may also <b>explode.</b> The liquid <b>explodes</b> on contact with arsenic, sodium, silver foil, or phosphorus. When heated to decomposition it emits highly toxic fumes of bromine and <b>explodes.</b> The amount of compound used during experimentation should be limited to 2 mmol. It also poses a potential moderate fire hazard in the form of vapor by chemical reaction. It is also a powerful oxidant.|$|R
