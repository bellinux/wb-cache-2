5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the nape of <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on her forehead and a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake around <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> serpentine earrings. Three streams of blood spring from her neck, one entering her own mouth, while the others are drunk by her female yogini companions, who flank her.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into the tent and the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope around <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage {{to the realm of}} the dead.|$|E

5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the nape of <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
5|$|Natasha sustains a burn on <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> {{she becomes}} {{insecure}} about it. Natasha sees Andrew and Summer kissing, which leaves her devastated. To stop Andrew from {{breaking up with}} her, Natasha tells him she is pregnant. Michael, though initially angry, tells his daughter that he will support her. Andrew books Natasha in for an ultrasound scan and after {{trying to get out}} of it, Natasha buys fake ultrasound images over the internet. She convinces Andrew not to come into the doctor's office with her and she gives him the fake pictures. Summer reveals the images are fake and Natasha explains that she lied because Andrew cheated on her. Michael tells Natasha that he no longer trusts her and she becomes ostracised at school. Natasha is thrown off the Mathletes team and Lisa Devine (Sophie Tilson) takes her place as the most popular girl in the school. Chris befriends Natasha and she and Summer apologise to each other for their actions. Chris and Natasha try to get Summer and Andrew back together and Natasha successfully challenges Lisa for the Mathletes captaincy.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by General Manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy.|$|E

She hitchhikes to her house in Manson, Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a mortician, examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close to bringing about the End times, which will also destroy Manson. During their conversation, Zoe slits her wrists and Malus leaves her body to find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E

However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.|$|R
25|$|The effigy {{is dressed}} in {{different}} color garb depending on the season, with the Romero family changing the dress every first Monday of the month. Over the dress are large quantities of jewelry on <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> arms, as well as pinned to her clothing.

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} Mixer {{had not been}} {{subjected}} to a sexual assault, the fact her tights had been lowered to expose her thighs and sanitary towel suggested a sexual motive behind the murder, and although the victim had not been beaten, stabbed or mutilated, her student status, the tying of a garment around <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> the proximity of her abduction and murder led investigators to tentatively link her murder to those of Fleszar and Schell, despite lingering doubts she {{had been killed by}} the same perpetrator.|$|E

The pathologist found some defensive wounds, and that the attack targeted aspects of beauty and was intended to disfigure.|$|E
25|$|A female Asian golden cat at the Washington Park Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo) {{showed a}} {{dramatic}} increase in the frequency of scent marking during estrus. At the same time, she often rubbed <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> head on inanimate objects. She also repeatedly approached the male in the cage, rubbed on him, and adopted a receptive posture (lordosis) in front of him. The male's rate of scent marking increased during this time, as did his frequency of approaching and following the female. The male's mounting behavior included a nape bite, but in contrast to other small felids, the bite was not sustained.|$|E
25|$|The {{woman is}} dressed in Hellenistic {{clothing}} with soft folds of drapery carved naturalistically. The dress is full length with its collar lying falling just below <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> its hem mostly covering her feet. The bodice is gathered and snugly fit. Around the waist a thick, twisted band of fabric is wrapped so that it appears lightly knotted with the cloth’s end coming from under the band {{at the rear of}} the dress. This excess length of cloth is drawn up through the crook of her right arm. The dress’ sleeves appear rolled and sit just above the elbows.|$|E

25|$|The {{right arm}} {{was over the}} belly, {{the back of the}} hand and wrist had on it clotted blood. The legs were drawn up with the feet close to the wall. The body and face were warm and the hand cold. The legs were quite warm. Deceased had a silk {{handkerchief}} round <b>her</b> <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> it appeared to be slightly torn.

25|$|Ikeda drew inspirations from Kaibutsu-kun and has {{incorporated}} some references later {{into the}} first serialization of the Rosario + Vampire manga. In an interview at Lucca Comics 2012, Ikeda said he is {{a big fan of}} Tim Burton and was inspired by his works, including The Nightmare Before Christmas, and particularly Edward Scissorhands because the monster has a sensitive soul. He had also researched various monsters from encyclopedias and the Internet. He started with his passion for vampires, and the concept of a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around <b>her</b> <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> then created the school of monsters, Tsukune, and others afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements.|$|E
