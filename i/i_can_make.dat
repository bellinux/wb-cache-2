5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

500|$|Sold almost {{exclusively}} by mail order, the game received limited but positive reviews on its {{release from the}} few magazines which then covered ZX Spectrum gaming. A short review in ZX Computing {{at the time of}} its initial release, praised the [...] "excellent" [...] graphics and the strength of the computer's gameplay, a theme repeated in a brief review in Crash. The only full-length review, in ZX Computing nine months after the game's original release, also praised the AI's gameplay and said that [...] "the only major complaint <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> against the program is its limited use of sound".|$|E

I didn't have any brothers, and I thought that's {{something}} I can do, one way <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a contribution. My sisters thought it was great, but they were not interested. There was too much discipline and routine involved. I felt like it would be a challenge, to step forth and do it, to see what it was all about. It gave a sense of confidence. At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E
500|$|Energized by {{the success}} of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter {{considered}} expanding the frog tale and bought back her drawings and the publisher's printer's blocks. She wrote her editor Norman Warne, [...] "I should like to do Mr. Jeremy Fisher... I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> something of him". The tale was set aside while Potter and Warne developed other projects, but in 1905 he approved the frog tale. As Potter biographer Daphne Kutzner writes of Potter's [...] illustrations for Jeremy: [...] "When she finally did the illustrations for the book, she changed the original background from the River Tay in Scotland to Eswaithe Water in the Lakes. The illustrations are indeed lovely, showing Potter's skill both as a naturalist and a fantasist".|$|E

500|$|Hemingway greatly admired Cézanne {{and early}} in his career crafted his prose {{in a way that would}} {{resonate}} with that painter's work. He said in a 1949 interview that [...] "Cézanne is my painter after the early painters.... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit. It is about 100 pages long and nothing happens and the country is swell. I made it all up".|$|E
500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen....

I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E

500|$|The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., {{where there}} was a large advance sale. Harris's poor {{direction}} had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance. Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, [...] "She runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B." [...] Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, [...] "My dear, the only interest I have in you is the money <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> out of you." [...] Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as [...] "hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met", and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.|$|E
500|$|Laurence Olivier {{was paid}} $1 million to play General Douglas MacArthur in the film. He was {{contracted}} {{for six weeks}} of filming, and received a payment of $250,000 upon signing the contract and the remainder was given in four subsequent installments. His salary came out to $50,000 per day. In addition to this fee, Olivier also received $2,500 per week for his expenses. Olivier was interviewed during the film's production and explained why he agreed {{to be part of}} its cast: [...] "People ask me why I'm playing in this picture. The answer is simple. Money, dear boy. I'm like a vintage wine. You have to drink me quickly before I turn sour. I'm almost used up now and I can feel the end coming. That's why I'm taking money now. I've got nothing to leave my family but the money <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> from films. Nothing is beneath me if it pays well. I've earned the right to damn well grab whatever I can in the time I've got left." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of The Motion Picture, {{executive}} producer Gene Roddenberry wrote his own sequel. In his plot, {{the crew of the}} Enterprise travel back in time to set right a corrupted time line after Klingons use the Guardian of Forever to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This was rejected by Paramount executives, who blamed the poor performance and large budget ($46million) of the first movie on its plodding pace and the constant rewrites Roddenberry demanded. [...] As a consequence, Roddenberry was removed from the production and, according to Shatner, [...] "kicked upstairs" [...] to the ceremonial position of executive consultant. Harve Bennett, a new Paramount television producer, was made producer for the next Star Trek film. [...] According to Bennett, he was called in front of a group including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner and asked if he thought he could make a better film than The Motion Picture, which Bennett confessed he found [...] "really boring". When Bennett replied in the affirmative, Charles Bluhdorn asked, [...] "Can you make it for less than forty-five-fucking-million-dollars?" [...] Bennett replied that [...] "Where I come from, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> five movies for that." ...|$|E

500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, she knew she would be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
500|$|Azaria's friends {{refer to}} him as [...] "the freakish mimic" [...] due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, {{instantly}} after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later {{realized that it was}} not a common talent. Azaria can [...] "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out." [...] Azaria was glad to have found the [...] "ultimate outlet" [...] for this skill, in The Simpsons. He [...] "didn't realize it , but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices." [...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make,</b> I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E
500|$|The theme music, [...] "Whatever It Takes", was {{composed}} by Jim McGrath, with lyrics written by Jody Colero and Stephen Stohn. The song include lines such as, [...] "Whatever it takes, I know <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it through/Be the best, the best I can be", to convey what Colero calls, [...] "a sense {{of joy and}} optimism." [...] Lisa Dalbello performed the lyrics with a children's choir over an 1980s pop music style tune {{during the first three}} seasons. Dave Ogilvie and Anthony Valcic of Canadian industrial-pop group Jakalope reworked and performed the song with a heavier sound, reflecting the growing maturity of the characters in season four. For seasons six and seven, the theme—still performed by Jakalope—was remixed and stripped of vocals. A fourth version of the theme song, with lyrics sung by Damhnait Doyle, was introduced for the eighth season, and a fifth version of the theme, performed by the in-show band [...] "" [...] is used for the ninth and tenth seasons. For seasons eleven and twelve, a sixth version of the theme song is used, performed by Alexz Johnson. Seasons thirteen and fourteen featured a truncated version of the Alexz Johnson theme.|$|E
