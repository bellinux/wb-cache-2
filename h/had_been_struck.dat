50|$|The coins <b>were</b> hand <b>struck,</b> {{and exhibit}} {{a number of}} errors such as mis-striking and double-striking. There are also {{examples}} where the coin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> using mismatched obverse and reverse dies, or where two blanks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> together, resulting in one coin with a blank reverse and a matching coin with a blank obverse.|$|R
5|$|A buyback of {{preferred}} shares for $530–590million was authorised by the Olympus board. Axam subsequently negotiated a further {{increase in the}} value of the shares, for which Olympus finally paid $620million in March 2010. According to a UK corporate filing for Gyrus, the value of the securities at the time was disclosed as $177million. Bloomberg notes that executives Olympus had delayed accounting for the true cost of the 'success fees' of Gyrus until March 2011, by which time Axam Investments <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> off by the Cayman Islands registrar for nine months.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced {{that two of the}} ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> by paralysis, and after this {{he seems to}} have withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
5|$|At {{the funeral}} on 5 June at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité in Montmartre, more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who {{included}} Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played Patrie, and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from Carmen. At the burial which followed at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> down {{just as he}} was becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his final peroration. After a special performance of Carmen at the Opéra-Comique that night, the press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.|$|E

5|$|Silver half dimes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> {{from the}} early days of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be heavier than the Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel {{was heavily}} struck during its 30-year run, except during {{economic}} downturns in 1885–1886 and in 1894, when only small numbers were struck. In 1890, Congress ended {{production of the}} three-cent piece, leaving the five-cent coin as {{the only one in}} copper nickel. That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the redesign of United States coins, if the former design <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, a provision in the latter act made them eligible for immediate redesign. In 1896, pattern nickels were struck {{for the first time since}} 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested; however, no redesign took place.|$|E
5|$|The Mercury Prize, {{formerly}} {{called the}} Mercury Music Prize, is an annual music prize awarded {{for the best}} album from the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was established by the British Phonographic Industry and British Association of Record Dealers in 1992 {{as an alternative to}} the Brit Awards. The prize was originally sponsored by Mercury Communications, a brand owned by Cable & Wireless, from which the prize gets its name. It was later sponsored by Technics (1998 to 2001), Panasonic (2002 and 2003), Nationwide Building Society (2004 to 2008) and Barclaycard (2009–14). The 2015 prize was sponsored by the BBC, while in 2016 it was announced that a three-year deal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> with Hyundai to sponsor the event.|$|E

As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able {{to walk away from}} the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.|$|E
5|$|When the Buffalo nickel <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> for 25 {{years and}} could be {{replaced}} without an act of Congress, the Mint moved quickly to replace it. Although the Fraser design is popular today among numismatists, it did not enjoy that status in 1938, {{and there was no}} public outcry at the decision. In January 1938, the Mint announced an open competition for the new nickel design, with the winner to receive a prize of $1,000. Anticipating the 1943 bicentennial of Jefferson's birth, competitors were to place his portrait on the obverse, and a depiction of his house Monticello on the reverse.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> by the recoiling gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, the United States Government {{intended}} {{to present a}} set of then-current US coins to four Asian rulers the US had either made agreements with or else hoped to treat with. Neither the silver dollar nor the eagle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> since 1804, {{but they were still}} considered current coins. Putting the date of striking on the pieces would make them appear to be in violation of Jefferson's prohibition which remained in force. Mint Director Moore decided to strike 1804-dated dollars and eagles for the sets, and four 1804 eagles were struck. They differ from the pieces struck thirty years earlier, lacking a crosslet {{on the right side of}} the crossbar of the 4. Two were presented, to the Sultan of Muscat and the King of Siam, before the diplomat in charge of the expedition, Edmund Roberts, died of disease in Macao, and his mission was abandoned. The remaining two sets were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. She and her sister ships <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>struck</b> previously in 1995. She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.|$|E
