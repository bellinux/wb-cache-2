Effective management of this stochastic resource requires that the availability of water for various uses be estimated to a high degree of confidence. The availability of water is constrained by a variety of hydrologic, physical, environmental, and institutional factors. The adoption of the doctrine of prior appropriation by the state of Texas and the administration of the associated system of water rights places a significant institutional constraint upon the availability of water in the state. This thesis describes a generalized river basin simulation model (TAMUWRAP) capable of analyzing the hydrologic and institutional availability of water to specific users under a prior appropriative system of water rights. The model analyzes the availability of water to individual water rights considering system reservoir operations, return flows, hydroelectric power generation, negative incremental inflows between basin locations, and buffer zone operations. The model can also determine the availability of water to groups of water rights with multiple <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> and storage in multiple reservoirs. A case study applying TAMUWRAP to the Brazos River Basin in Texas is presented. The effects of various model options upon simulation results are demonstrated, concentrating on the system of reservoirs and water right permits owned by the Brazos River Authority. The effects of the incorporation of a system reservoir operating permit into the Texas water rights permit structure is investigated. Study results indicate that the Bmws River Authority benefits from conjunctive operation of its system of reservoir and might be able to increase its annual permitted diversion amount with a system permit...|$|R

To <b>date,</b> ethical aspects <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> setting for research funding {{have not been}} an issue of discussion in the bioethics debate. Conflicting moral obligations of beneficence and distributive justice appear to demand very different levels of funding for orphan drug research. The two types of orphan disease, rare diseases and tropical diseases, however, present very different ethical challenges to questions about allocation of research funds. The dilemma is analysed considering utilitarian and rights based theories of justice and moral obligations of non-abandonment and a professional obligation to advance medical science. The limitations of standard economic evaluation tools and other priority setting tools used to inform health policy decision makers on research funding decisions are outlined.

In this study, we searched for ‘‘hot spots’’ of amphibians in these two regions and assessed whether the priority areas established by the MMA coincided with those suitable for amphibian conservation. We determined amphibian hot spots by means of three estimates: areas of endemism, areas of high species richness, and areas with species that are threatened, rare, or have very limited distributions. We then assessed the degree of coincidence between amphibian hot spots and the <b>priority</b> areas <b>of</b> the MMA based on the current conservation units. We analyzed areas of endemism {{with the use of a}} parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) on quadrats. The Caatinga biome and semiarid region showed four and six areas of endemism, respectively, mainly associated with mountainous areas that are covered by isolated forests and positively correlated with species richness. All areas of endemism coincided with one or more priority areas defined by the MMA.

Changes in patent regulation are especially important in the pharmaceutical sector because the patent system determines, in large part, the reward that an inventor can derive from discovery of a new drug. Most pharmaceutical patents are classified as utility patents. Pharmaceutical patents may include claims for the active ingredient per se, for the formulation of the active ingredient {{for use as a}} pharmaceutical, for therapeutic indications and uses, and for methods of manufacturing the drug.

The First-to-Invent system allows for public disclosure of inventions prior to patent filing. In contrast, the First-to-File system encourages early filing of patent applications.
