5|$|On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a {{dramatic}} gesture at the Sejm, {{is said to have}} bared his chest and laid himself down in a <b>doorway,</b> <b>blocking</b> the way with his own body in {{a dramatic}} attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tape was}} [...] "leaked" [...] to the Administration of U.T. and, to the {{surprise}} of the participants, the next morning the campus was flooded with police, the windows of the Administration building were shuttered with wooden boards, and a truck was backed up to the <b>doorway</b> <b>blocking</b> entry while keeping the Administration locked inside. One of the members volunteered to brandish a toy water-pistol machine gun and parade back and forth in front of the building. Everyone else stayed out of sight. The individual was arrested and subsequently released. Nothing more happened.|$|R

60|$|Presently {{all that}} stair and the crowded hall below, black as {{the mouth of}} the pit, for such lights as still burned soon were swept away, rang with the screams and curses and stifled groans of the trodden down or dying. In the pitchy {{darkness}} brother smote brother, friend trampled out the life of friend, till the steep steps were piled high and the <b>doorways</b> <b>blocked</b> with dead. So hideous were the sounds indeed, that Hugh and Grey Dick crossed themselves, thinking that hell had come to Avignon, or Avignon sunk down to hell. But Murgh only folded his white-gloved hands upon his breast and smiled.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood before}} {{him in the}} narrow <b>doorway,</b> <b>blocking</b> his exit, {{and looked at him}} with keen, deep-set dark eyes. In spite of her {{withered}} aspect and wrinkled face, she was not an uncomely old woman and there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan. It did not occur to him to wonder why it should please him. If he had hunted that feeling down he might have been surprised to discover that it had its origin in a curious gratification over the thought that the woman who lived with Lynde had a certain refinement about her. He preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity.|$|R

40|$|Three men in uniform, jackboots and {{gas masks}} pose for the camera. They are {{standing}} in front of a wide <b>doorway</b> <b>blocked</b> by a crowd of men watching another official put on a protective suit. The doorway is flanked by two more officials. The photograph was shot in the context of two articles that appeared in Cumhuriyet in August 1939 reporting on military defence operations against air raids and chemical weapons attacks. Cumhuriyet covered the military exercise in great detail, announcing which action was to take place in which part of town and at what time. The official photographed here putting on a chemical-resistant suit is probably demonstrating its use to the spectators, while the two uniformed men at the doorway secure the location...|$|R
50|$|On the exterior, {{the south}} door and arch, west <b>doorway,</b> <b>blocked</b> north aisle window and string course are all Norman. The Romanesque arches of the nave were {{constructed}} on {{the foundation of}} the earlier Norman church, with the Transitional chancel being added {{at the end of the}} 12th century, probably being started around 1170, and the whole church being completed by the end of the century. The chancel has a quadripartite ribbed vault, with modern plaster between the ribs. The central boss is of the Lamb of God. There was a central tower,which was removed in 1659, the thrusting out of the responds between choir and nave being visible today, as are distortion in the vault ribs of the chancel.|$|R
50|$|St Beunoâ€™s Church is {{the parish}} church of Berriew, in the {{historic}} county of Montgomeryshire, now Powys. The church stands in an almost oval churchyard in {{the centre of the}} village. The original church was a single-chamber, with a wooden west bellcote and a northchancel chapel. This church was replaced in 1803-4 with a larger brick church by the architect John Hiram Haycock of Shrewsbury. It was of brick with stone dressings, and had the entry under a pinnacled west tower to a galleried nave with four round-headed windows a side. The church was largely rebuilt by his grandson, Edward Haycock, Junior in 1876. It consists of a nave, aisles, chancel, north porch, and west tower The west tower has the <b>doorway</b> <b>blocked,</b> stone facing for brick, and Gothic windows, except for the circular ones on its second stage.|$|R

For a moment the <b>doorway</b> was <b>blocked,</b> then the weight and impetus of Mike and Spiller prevailed, the enemy gave back, and Mike, stepping into the room again, slammed the door and locked it.|$|R
25|$|During {{the phase}} of {{occupation}} from 160AD, a number of turrets fell out of use, and their <b>doorways</b> were <b>blocked</b> up. In {{the latter part of}} the second century, or early part of the third century, turrets in the central section of the stone wall (between Turrets 33B and 41B, and many others) were abandoned and demolished. During this process, the turret recess was filled in, presumably to remove a possible point of structural weakness.|$|R
50|$|The Diocese of Argyll was Scotland's most impoverished diocese, and {{the fourteenth}} century Cathedral was very modest in scale. Only the choir survives, in greatly altered form, the nave and western tower having been reduced to their foundations. The chief {{surviving}} medieval features are three <b>doorways,</b> one <b>blocked,</b> another originally the entrance through the pulpitum, a piscina and the triple-arched sedilia. Several late medieval grave slabs are preserved in the church or adjoining graveyard.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2012, George Wallace, Jr. {{commented on}} his father's legacy, and {{mentioned}} {{the reference to}} the event in Bob Dylan's 1964 song [...] "The Times They Are a-Changin'": [...] "Come Senators, Congressmen, please heed the call. Don't stand in the <b>doorway,</b> don't <b>block</b> up the hall." [...] Wallace, Jr. said, when he was 14, he sang the song for his father and thought he saw the look of regret in his father's eyes.|$|R
500|$|The south porch {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "unusually long"; it measures 11feet 6inches by 8feet 9inches (3.5 by 2.7m) and {{has been used as a}} vestry since the external <b>doorway</b> was <b>blocked</b> off and converted into a window. The 14th-century doorway from the nave into the vestry has a pointed head in a square frame, and was described in the 1937 survey as having an [...] "unusual design". The porch roof may be from the late medieval period.|$|R
50|$|The tower-like {{building}} on the hill was originally a windmill and later a doocot. It {{is not to be}} confused with the structure on the opposite side of Prestwick Airport runway, the Shaw Monument, which was originally used by the then landowner to follow hunting with falcons on his land. This vaulted windmill dates from the 17th century, converted to a dovecot in the 18th century when conical slated roof slot for potence and fireclay nesting boxes added. It had two <b>doorways,</b> one <b>blocked.</b>|$|R

60|$|Though all {{his life}} he had eaten sparingly, Cynthia noticed that he {{scarcely}} touched his breakfast the next morning, and two hours later he went unexpectedly to the state capital. That day, too, Coniston was clothed in clouds, and by afternoon a wild March snowstorm was sweeping down {{the face of the}} mountain, piling against <b>doorways</b> and <b>blocking</b> the roads. Through the storm Cynthia fought her way to the harness shop, for Ephraim Prescott had taken to his bed, bound hand and foot by rheumatism.|$|R
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saint Margaret is a Norman {{building}} from {{the latter half}} of the 12th century. Surviving original Norman work includes the north and south doorways and the font. The north <b>doorway</b> is now <b>blocked</b> and the font has been halved in height.|$|R
25|$|Cistern 5 (located {{under the}} south eastern {{corner of the}} upper platform) â€” a long and narrow chamber, with a strange {{anti-clockwise}} curved section at its north western corner, and containing within it a <b>doorway</b> currently <b>blocked</b> by earth. The cistern's position and design is such {{that there has been}} speculation it had a function connected with the altar of the Second Temple (and possibly of the earlier Temple), or with the bronze sea. Charles Warren thought that the altar of burnt offerings was located at the north western end.|$|R
2500|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} with a lead roof in Perpendicular style. [...] Its oldest part is a Norman <b>blocked</b> <b>doorway</b> {{in the north}} wall sited in {{a gap between the}} end of the aisle and the vestry, which was moved to its present position in the 19thcentury.|$|R
50|$|All Saints is {{constructed}} in flint rubble with stone dressings. The nave is rendered, and the roofs are felted.

50|$|St Michael's is {{constructed}} in limestone with limestone slate roofs. Its plan is cruciform, {{consisting of a}} nave with north and south transepts, a west tower, and a chancel with a north vestry. The north and south doorways are Norman in style (the north <b>doorway</b> is <b>blocked).</b> The chancel is in Early English style and the tower is Perpendicular. The chancel contains lancet windows and a priest's door. The tower is in three stages, separated by string courses, and has diagonal buttresses; its parapet is embattled. The top stage contains a two-light, louvered bell opening on each side.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest part of {{the church}} is {{the south end of the}} nave and the Norman clunch chancel arch. The tower was built in the 15th century and the nave was {{extended}} at that time to connect with it and the walls of the nave were heightened. The windows and porch also date from that time, as do the older pews and the font. [...] In 1814 the north <b>doorway</b> was <b>blocked</b> up and the coat of arms which now hang over the south door replaced an earlier larger one. The pulpit dates from the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} stone building, aligned east {{of north}} east, measures 13.7m by 4.8m internally, {{and the four}} walls are intact to a height of about 2.4m. The surviving stone comprises uncoursed limestone masonry, with dressed limestone quoins. There was no separation of nave and chancel. A path leads to a northern doorway (the southern <b>doorway</b> is <b>blocked),</b> {{and there is a}} fine two-section west window, the central portion of which is restoration work, while there is also a partially restored eastern two-section window. There are aumbries on each side, and a small basin at the eastern end of the southerly wall. There are also two gravestones inside.|$|R
5000|$|A National School {{was built}} in 1839 and also served as the Sunday school for the church of St Anne in the Grove opposite. The {{architecture}} employs Gothic pointed arches but Tudor-style chimneys. In {{the centre of the}} front wall are two <b>blocked</b> <b>doorways</b> with round heads. There is also a carved stone plaque, the inscription on which includes [...] "National School".|$|R
5000|$|For the {{purposes}} of archaeological and historical study, Pompeii is divided into nine regions, each of which contains numbered blocks (insulae). Within a <b>block,</b> <b>doorways</b> are numbered in clockwise or counter-clockwise order; the Centenary is numbered IX.8.3-6. It belongs to the luxurious [...] "tufa" [...] period of Pompeiian architecture, characterized {{by the use of}} fine-grained gray volcanic tufa that was quarried around Nuceria.|$|R
50|$|The south aisle has {{a single}} pitch roof, {{diagonal}} corner buttresses and also buttresses at the bay divisions. There is a <b>blocked</b> <b>doorway</b> and window {{to the west and}} a pointed window, without tracery, in the second bay from the east. The west end elevation has a pointed window reconstructed from 13th century masonry, with a hood mould. In the nave roof there are two flat-roofed dormers.|$|R

Along the north aisles are three-light windows, and the vestry contains a two-light window. Along the south aisle are four two-light windows. The east window has three lights containing Perpendicular tracery.|$|R
60|$|To {{judge from}} {{the size of}} the houses, they have been, at one time, tenanted by persons of better {{condition}} than their present occupants; but they are now let off, by the week, in floors or rooms, and every door has almost as many plates or bell-handles as there are apartments within. The windows are, for the same reason, sufficiently diversified in appearance, being ornamented with every variety of common blind and curtain that can easily be imagined; while every <b>doorway</b> is <b>blocked</b> up, and rendered nearly impassable, by a motley collection of children and porter pots of all sizes, from the baby in arms and the half-pint pot, to the full-grown girl and half-gallon can.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{original}} lancet {{windows of the}} early 13th century in the east wall of the chancel. The other windows in the church are 14th century. The south doorway is original of the early 13th century. A similar north <b>doorway</b> has been <b>blocked</b> up. The south porch and outer door are original of the 13th century, but with a 15th-century roof and 15th-century windows in the side walls.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hall was}} built with {{sandstone}} from Storeton Quarry. [...] Nothing {{remains of the}} south service wing. The north wing, the block containing the chapel, and the east wall of the great hall have survived. Farm buildings have been built against the outer side of the east wall of the great hall, making its inner side an outside face. [...] The north wing, the roof {{of which has been}} lowered, has angle buttresses, a blocked pointed window with a hood mould in the west gable end, and inserted doors and pitch holes on the north and south sides. [...] Inside, in the upper storey, are the remains of a fireplace. [...] The block containing the former chapel has a timber-framed gable containing pigeon holes, and an external staircase. [...] The outer wall of the east wing (the inner wall of the former great hall) contains, from the north, a <b>blocked</b> <b>doorway</b> that gave access to the north wing, traces of two blocked windows, and a <b>blocked</b> <b>doorway</b> with a pointed head.|$|R
50|$|The {{north and}} south aisles were added in about 1200 and the south porch in the 13th century, all in the Early English Gothic style. The west walls of the nave and two aisles each have a 13th-century lancet window. At one time the porch had two storeys. The upper storey has since been removed, but its <b>blocked</b> <b>doorway</b> and the outline of its stairs are still visible inside the south aisle.|$|R
