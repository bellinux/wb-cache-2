5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> excerpt below, Jolliffe alleged that a secret department of the Ontario Provincial Police was acting as a political police – spying on the opposition and the media.|$|E
5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for {{his refusal to}} take the oath of allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.|$|E
5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} answer two important questions in African American politics: What {{accounts for the}} new electoral success of African American candidates in non-minority majority districts, and is there some sort of specific rhetoric used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign <b>speeches</b> of these African American politicians? I seek to show that rhetoric matters {{and that there is}} a consistent post-racial language found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of successful African American elected officials. In experimental studies, I show that that this post-racial language is effective in shaping perceptions of these politicians and is a contributing factor to their success. In addition, I show that <b>the</b> language found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of successful African American elected officials is not found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> of unsuccessful African American politicians running for a similar office. I engage in this research by conducting experiments using campaign speeches from 2010 primary and general election candidates, conducting quantitative text analysis, and performing ethnographical interviewing with successful African American elected officials...|$|R

5|$|Under Patton, the Third Army {{landed in}} Normandy during July 1944 and {{would go on}} to play an {{integral}} role in the last months of the war in Europe, closing the Falaise Pocket in mid-August, and playing the key role in relieving the siege of Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December, a feat {{regarded as one of the}} most notable achievements in the war.

5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of our best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E
