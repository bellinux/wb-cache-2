Some economists show that depreciated exchange rates appear to induce higher growth, but that the effect works largely through the deepening of domestic savings and capital accumulation, rather than through import substitution or export booms as argued by the mercantilism view. Some other studies believe the recent reserve accumulation in east Asia from increasing net export could enhance economic growth.

This paper builds on previous research on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains</b> from trade by moving beyond a single country basis to examine impacts on firm-level productivity for a cross-section of countries. It also focuses on productivity gains through the import of intermediate inputs and capital goods and systematically explores the specific impacts of non-trade, or complementary, policies on firms‘ ability to realise <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains.</b> This paper shows that a range of complementary policies affects a firm‘s ability to generate productivity gains from intermediate and capital goods imports. Access to skilled labour is a particularly important policy variable with respect to the import of intermediate goods, followed by access to finance, while macroeconomic stability slightly outranks access to finance for capital goods importers. The importance of access to finance has particular policy significance given the wide-spread financial reforms being discussed or underway. trade, <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains,</b> complementary policies, intermediate inputs, capital...|$|R

Silicon-based PICs {{were able to}} perform <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt compensation by thermo-optic effect. Helium doped SOI rib waveguides were used for power monitoring and is potentially used as monolithic gain tilt compensation device with arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). <b>Dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt induced by wavelength dependent gain of EDFA leads to power penalty in wavelength division multiplexed systems. Using optical filter with known spectral response, {{it is possible to}} detect <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt and a per-band compensation scheme using electronic variable optical attenuators. This was implemented for <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt compensation (DGTC). Dynamic provisioning of bandwidth and re-configurable optical networks can potentially allow efficient and cost effective deliveries of services based on the actual bandwidth requirement. Optical add/drop multiplexers (OADM) and optical cross-connects (OXC) will be used for such networks but the dynamic provisioning of optical channels may introduce optical power transients because of the slow gain dynamics of erbium doped fiber amplifiers. In this dissertation, the potential problems on using Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFA) in future reconfigurable optical networks are studied and possible solutions are assessed. In particular, the problems of gain transient and <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> tilt were studied experimentally and theoretically. In saturated EDFA channel add/drop can produce average power fluctuations, in timescales in the microsecond range. The thesis describes how gain transients can be minimized in gain clamped EDFA by optimizing erbium concentrations of EDF. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that highly doped EDF minimize the transient in gain clamped EDFA. For unclamped EDFA, all-optical feedforward constant output power compensation has been successfully demonstrated using electronic variable optical attenuator (EVOA). Chan Po Shan. "August 2006.

40|$|The {{response}} of a neuronal population over {{a space of}} inputs depends on the intrinsic prop-erties of its constituent neurons. Two main modes of single neuron dynamics–integration and resonance–have been distinguished. While resonator cell types exist {{in a variety of}} brain areas, few models incorporate this feature and fewer have investigated its effects. To understand better how a resonator’s frequency preference emerges from its intrinsic dynamics and contributes to its local area’s population firing rate dynamics, we analyze the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> of an analytically solvable two-degree of freedom neuron model. In the Fok-ker-Planck approach, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> is intractable. The alternative Gauss-Rice approach lifts the resetting of the voltage after a spike.

Secondly, it may create more competitive conditions in national markets thereby increasing productive efficiency.

40|$|The {{question}} of how prices on patents rights should be determined in impersonal exchanges is examined in a laboratory environment. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>gains</b> from such organized trade with public prices are recorded. The experiment introduces a competitive market with impersonal exchange mechanisms and prices in the traditionally hierarchical and personal exchange of patents. A tradable linear contract (fixed fee plus royalty) is investigated with three mechanism designs for demand-side bidding and two levels of presumed legal validity of the underlying patent. A "trader" can split contracts useful for multiple "industries," creating <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains,</b> potentially increasing {{the use of technology}} in the economic system. Previous research on licensing has mostly been limited to one-dimensional auction mechanisms or static environments. The results indicate that agents appear to price the blocking value in the fixed fee and the investment value, net what is paid in fixed, in the royalty component, supporting a proposed theory of prices. Risks are thereby shifted from the invention to the consumer by means of this producer market, increasing the incentives for investment in invention, potentially resulting in a more competitive technology being developed and a more efficient economic system. The results give indications on proper integration of information and rules for mechanisms for organized market on patents with transparent prices.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{open economy}} growth {{model in which}} firm heterogeneity increases the gains from trade. Technology spillovers from incumbent firms to entrants cause the productivity threshold for firm survival to grow over time as competition becomes tougher. By raising the profits of exporters, trade increases the entry rate and generates a dynamic selection effect that leads to higher growth. The paper shows that the gains from trade can be decomposed into: static gains that equal the total gains from trade in an economy without technology spillovers, and; <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains</b> that are strictly positive. Since trade raises growth through selection, not scale effects, the positive growth effect of trade vanishes when firms are homogeneous. Thus, firm heterogeneity creates {{a new source of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>gains</b> from trade. Calibrating the model to the U.

They are, inter alia, the monetary effects of trade specialization on the balance of payments, loss of policy autonomy, deindustrialization and jobless growth. When the costs of free trade outweigh its benefits, the slowdown of industrialization and development are the likely results. To avoid this, gradual openness and government intervention are necessary.

The analysis is presented for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> and steady-state representation, but it holds for parameters related to the dynamics as well. The TS model interpolates between local linear models. The overall gain obtained by interpolating the gains of the local models {{can be interpreted as}} the local <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> of the entire fuzzy model. This locally interpreted gain is not identical to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gain</b> obtained by linearization of the fuzzy model at the considered equilibrium. We analyze the origin of this difference with regard to the applied identification method. In order to keep the analysis simple and transparent, a fuzzy model of a Hammerstein system is studied. The results show that fuzzy models obtained by local identification (weighted least squares for each rule) typically yields a poor steady-state representation and the model can only be locally interpreted. On the contrary, a fuzzy model obtained by global identification (one least-square solution for the entire model) can result in a qualitatively bad local interpretation of the gain even though approximates the real process well. Therefore, this model can only be used for prediction or local linearization through Taylor expansion. It is shown that the difference between the globally and locally interpreted gain can be reduced by using a priori knowledge in global identification. The steady-state representation of fuzzy models obtained by local identification can be improved by using inference based on the smoothed maximum operator (instead of the weighted mean) ...|$|E
