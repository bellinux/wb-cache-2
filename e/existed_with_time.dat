40|$|Abstract: Most of the {{standardized}} tests that are administered today <b>exist</b> <b>with</b> <b>time</b> constraints for completion. However, these prescribed time constraints {{are often not}} allowing test takers enough {{time to do the}} test calmly and rationally. Rooted in the phenomenon, this study was conducted. By using factorial design as the design of this study, the objective of this study was specifically to find out whether or not time constraints significantly affected on students’ writing performance. This study was conducted among EFL learners of English Education Study Program at STKIP Siliwangi Bandung. They were asked to write two equivalent types of an argumentative essay writing based on a certain topic under varied testing conditions, a standard time constraint (90 minutes) and under an extended time constraint (120 minutes). To collect the data, the instruments used in this study were a writing test and semi-structured interview. To achieve the objective of this study, the one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U test were used. The findings of the study showed that there was any difference on the students’ writing performance between students with 90 minute test taking time and 120 minute test taking time. In short, time constraints affected the students’ writing performance. Keywords: time constraints, the effects of time constraints, students’ writing performanc...|$|R

Time, {{both in terms}} of delay of mission and communications latency, and data, in terms of corruption or modification, are normalizing factors. In general, the idea is to base the metric on “what is expected” and not necessarily the actual initiator to the degradation. Considering time as a metrics basis, resilient and un-resilient systems can be observed in Fig. 2.Dependent upon the abscissa metrics chosen, Fig. 2 reflects a generalization of the resiliency of a system. Several common terms are represented on this graphic, including robustness, agility, adaptive capacity, adaptive insufficiency, resiliency and brittleness. To overview the definitions of these terms, the following explanations of each is provided below: ...|$|R
50|$|One {{can show}} that no comparison-based K-Way Merge {{algorithm}} <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> a running <b>time</b> in O(n f(k)) where f grows asymptotically slower than a logarithm.The proof is a straightforward reduction from comparison-based sorting.Suppose that such an algorithm existed, then we could construct a comparison-based sorting algorithm <b>with</b> running <b>time</b> O(n f(n)) as follows:Chop the input array into n arrays of size 1. Merge these n arrays with the K-Way Merge algorithm.The resulting array is sorted and the algorithm has a running time in O(n f(n)).This is a contradiction to the well-known result that no comparison-based sorting algorithm with a worst case running time below O(n log n) exists.|$|R
40|$|The {{dominated}} hypervolume (or S-metric) is {{a commonly}} accepted quality measure for comparing approximations of Pareto fronts generated by multi-objective optimizers. Since optimizers exist, namely evolutionary algorithms, {{that use the}} S-metric internally several times per iteration, a faster determination of the S-metric value is of essential importance. This paper describes how to consider the S-metric as a special case of a more general geometrical problem called Klee s measure problem (KMP). For KMP, an algorithm <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> run <b>time</b> O(n log n + n^(d/ 2) log n), for n points of d>= 3 dimensions. This complex algorithmis adapted to the special case of calculating the S-metric. Conceptual simplifications of the implementation are concerned that save on a factor of O(log n) and establish an upper bound of O(n log n + n^(d/ 2)) for the S-metric calculation, improving the previously known bound of O(n^(d- 1)) ...|$|R
50|$|The trivial {{solution}} is to visit each interval and test whether it intersects the given point or interval, which requires O(n) time, where n {{is the number of}} intervals in the collection. Since a query may return all intervals, for example if the query is a large interval intersecting all intervals in the collection, this is asymptotically optimal; however, we can do better by considering output-sensitive algorithms, where the runtime is expressed in terms of m, the number of intervals produced by the query. Interval trees have a query time of O(log n + m) and an initial creation time of O(n log n), while limiting memory consumption to O(n). After creation, interval trees may be dynamic, allowing efficient insertion and deletion of an interval in O(log n). If the endpoints of intervals are within a small integer range (e.g., in the range 1,...,O(n)), faster data structures <b>exist</b> <b>with</b> preprocessing <b>time</b> O(n) and query time O(1+m) for reporting m intervals containing a given query point.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that if the transformation of a neutron to a mirror neutron <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> an oscillation <b>time</b> of the order of ten seconds, it can be detected in a rather simple disappearance and/or regeneration type experiment with an intense beam of cold neutrons. In the presence of a conjectural mirror magnetic field of unknown magnitude and direction, the resonance transformation conditions can be found by scanning the magnitude of the ordinary magnetic field in the range e. g. ± 100 μT. Magnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the path of neutron beam. If the transformation effect exists within this range, the direction and possible time variation of the mirror magnetic field can be determined with additional dedicated measurements.

The author further asserts that many alternatives already <b>exist,</b> and that <b>with</b> <b>time</b> they will replace fossil fuels as an energy source. Concerning other resources, such as metals, Lomborg suggests that based on their price history {{they are not in}} short supply. Examining the challenge of collecting sufficient amounts of water, Lomborg says that wars will probably not erupt over water because fighting such wars is not cost-effective (one week of war with the Palestinians, for instance, would cost Israel more than five desalination plants, according to an Israeli officer). Lomborg emphasizes the need for better water management, as water is distributed unequally around the world.|$|R

In this case, the original problem is rewritten {{in the form of a}} {{boundary value}} problem for the system of equations in the fluxes. This work deals with studying schemes with weights for parabolic equations written in the flux coordinates. Unconditionally stable flux locally one-dimensional schemes of the first and second order of approximation in time are constructed for parabolic equations without mixed derivatives. A peculiarity of the system of equations written in flux variables for equations with mixed derivatives is that there do <b>exist</b> coupled terms <b>with</b> <b>time</b> derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Let D be a {{collection}} of string documents of n characters in total. The top-k document retrieval problem is to preprocess D into a data structure that, given a query (P, k), can return the k documents of D most relevant to pattern P. The relevance of a document d for a pattern P is given by a predefined ranking function w(P, d). Linear space and optimal query time solutions already exist for this problem. In this paper we consider a novel problem, document selection queries, which aim to report the kth document most relevant to P (instead of reporting all top-k documents). We present a data structure using O(n log n) space, for any constant > 0, answering selection queries in time O(log k / log logn), and a linear-space data structure answering queries in time O(log k), given the locus node of P in a (generalized) suffix tree of D. We also prove that {{it is unlikely that}} a succinct-space solution for this problem <b>exists</b> <b>with</b> poly-logarithmic query <b>time.</b> 1 Introduction and Related Wor...|$|R
40|$|For a given Markoff process {{characterized}} {{by a set of}} transition probability densities there <b>exists</b> another process <b>with</b> <b>time</b> reversed (the retrodictive vs predictive process in the theory of measurements) such that any one of them multiplied by a single-event density may be symmetric with respect to an interchange of the events expressed as space-time variables, yielding a joint probability density. It is shown how this time-reversed process can be constructed by means of the generating operator of the associated evolution equation, and the basic properties with explicit applications to master equations and Fokker-Planck equations. Onsager's microscopic reversibility is reformulated on this basis. Possible sym. metries concerning time-correlation functions under the Markoffian law is summarized in comparion with the Kubo formula. In the application to Fokker-Planck equations, the Onsager-Machlup most probable paths are extended to general type of diffusion processes, and it is shown that the present method corresponds to a gauge transformation in dynamics of a charged particle which leaves its paths invariant...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{initiate}} {{the study of}} optimization of bandit type problems in scenarios where the feedback of a play is not immediately known. This arises naturally in allocation problems which have been studied extensively in the literature, albeit {{in the absence of}} delays in the feedback. We study this problem in the Bayesian setting. In presence of delays, no solution with provable guarantees is known to <b>exist</b> <b>with</b> sub-exponential running <b>time.</b> We show that bandit problems with delayed feedback that arise in allocation settings can be forced to have significant structure, with a slight loss in optimality. This structure gives us the ability to reason about the relationship of single arm policies to the entangled optimum policy, and eventually leads to a O(1) approximation for a significantly general class of priors. The structural insights we develop are of key interest and carry over to the setting where the feedback of an action is available instantaneously, and we improve all previous results in this setting as well.

PB- 1 were sprayed three times (T 1 = spray at 15 DAS, T 2 = spray at 30 DAS and T 3 = spray at 45 DAS) with two concentrations (100 and 200 ppm) of Gibberellic Acid (GA 3) and Maleic Hydrazide (MH). The results of the experiment revealed that significant variations <b>exist</b> <b>with</b> the <b>time</b> of application in respect of dry matter production in root, stem, leaf and total dry matter per plant and growth attributes like Leaf Area Index (LAI), Crop Growth Rate (CGR), Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Net Assimilation Rate (NAR). CGR and NAR were increased up to 80 DAS and thereafter decreased due to maturity <b>with</b> respect of <b>time</b> of spray and concentration of growth regulators. However, LAI and RGR were maximized at 100 and 60 DAS, respectively. T 2 produced the highest root, stem, leaf and total dry matter, LAI, CGR, RGR and NAR followed by T 3 and T 1 produced the least of them. All growth regulators had positive effect in dry matter production and growth of soybean over non-sprayed control plants. GA 3 was more effective than MH. However, 100 ppm GA 3 had the most regulatory effect to enhance root, stem, leaf and total dry matter, LAI, CGR, RGR and NAR followed by 200 ppm GA 3. 200 ppm MH was least effective among the treatments.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} made on the burning characteristics of liquid methanol soaked in porous beds of glass beads. In order to {{study the effects of}} the soil properties on the burning characteristics, experiments were carried out for several bead diameters. The consumption rates of methanol and the temperature profiles in the porous beds were measured. The results showed that the total weight of the methanol consumed was only about half of the initial weight and the consumption rate decreased <b>with</b> <b>time.</b> The total weight of the consumed methanol and the consumption rate of methanol increased with decreasing bead diameter. The temperature profiles indicated that the dry region in a porous bed, in which only methanol vapor was assumed to <b>exist,</b> expanded downward <b>with</b> <b>time.</b> The discrepancy between the lower boundary of the dry region and the liquid level evaluated on the basis of methanol consumption for small beads suggested that the liquid moved upward by a capillary force. A simplified heat transfer model was proposed for large beads and the predicted results agreed qualitatively with the experimental ones. The consumption rate on large beads bed was inferred to be controlled mainly by the heat transfer in the porous bed.
