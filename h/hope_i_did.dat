It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E

2500|$|Singer {{and actress}} Bette Midler became {{recognized}} as a gay icon in the 1970s. After performing on Broadway, Midler began performing at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the city, where she became close to her piano accompanist Barry Manilow, who produced her first major album The Divine Miss M (1973).

During this time, she became close to her piano accompanist, Barry Manilow, who {{produced}} her first album in 1972, The Divine Miss M. [...] It was during her time at the Continental Baths that she built up a core following.

6000|$|... "I {{will leave}} IT here, sir," [...] replied Richard smiling, [...] "if I brought it here just now (but I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not), and will work my way {{on to my}} cousin Ada in the hopeful distance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean I didn’t know I was," [...] he replied, [...] "more than usual, I mean. <b>I</b> always <b>do</b> look fairly cheerful—at least, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> There’s {{nothing to}} make me look the opposite." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{raised a}} gloved hand. 'It has haunted me, haunted me, Mr Lawford; its--its conflict! Poor fellow; <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>hope,</b> he faced his trouble out. But I shall {{never see him}} again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not hurry you, gentlemen," [...] he said, {{with the}} faintest {{suggestion}} of a sneer at their hurried consultation, [...] "but I believe {{you wanted to see}} me at half past eleven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Chiefly from {{thinking}} it not right to accept him. I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not do wrong in telling her all about it. I thought it only fair, {{and she did}} not care enough for him to make the refusal an effort.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have fought, too," [...] said Colonel Parsons, {{looking at}} his son with troubled eyes--"I have fought, too, but never with anger in my heart, nor lust of vengeance. I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my duty, but I never forgot that my enemy was a fellow-creature. I never felt joy at killing, but pain and grief. War is inevitable, but it is horrible, horrible! It is only the righteous cause that can excuse it; and then it must be {{tempered}} with mercy and forgiveness." ...|$|E
6000|$|Polly sat down, looking both {{satisfied}} and troubled. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right," [...] {{she said to}} herself, [...] "I {{could n't bear to}} have him shirk and seem cowardly. He is n't, only he did n't think how it seemed to me, and I don't wonder he was a little afraid, Mr. Shaw is so severe with the poor fellow. Oh, dear, what should we do if Will got into such scrapes. Thank goodness, he 's poor, and can't; I 'm so glad of that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and {{run along}} with ye to the lockers, and get {{something}} better. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain's orders-- grog for the harpooneer on a whale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou hast {{chosen a}} melancholy hour for thy walk, Signore," [...] said the young Neapolitan; [...] "and a still more melancholy scene. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not intrude on an Israelite, or a Lutheran, who mourns for his friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for {{all that}} time," [...] {{answered}} Basil, smiling. [...] "I have long given up my official position, my dear Philip, and {{have been living in}} a deliberate retirement. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not come at an inopportune moment." ...|$|R

He was leanin' down an' bendin' over it, {{twisting}} that dial you see, when on {{a sudden}} I spotted him. I didn't stop to think. My Cap'n {{used to say}} 'Act first an' think afterwards,' an' that's what I did. I didn't know till now it was the school boss, but it wouldn't have made any difference. I done my duty as I saw it, an' I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it right, Mr. Colton." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>HOPE.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see Him with my bodily eyes, {{but with}} the eyes of my heart, and thus it was: One day I was very sad, I think sadder than {{at any one time}} in my life; and this sadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness of my sins.

6000|$|I hesitated at first, to promise, but on {{thinking}} {{of the state of}} her mother's health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her, and think too, of how such a story might become distorted, nay, infallibly would, in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do so. I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly. The reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Let me {{give you}} a hunch. Throw down this I.W.W. outfit. Go to Ruxton and get Anderson of 'Many Waters' ranch to give you a job. Tell him who you are and that I sent you." ...|$|R
60|$|Approaching {{towards the}} close of {{a long period of}} public service, it is natural I should be desirous to stand well (<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> stand tolerably well) with that public which, with {{whatever}} fortune, I have endeavored faithfully and zealously to serve.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>hope,</b> {{that nothing}} has {{happened}} to him," [...] mumbled Happy Jack, as he pretended to hunt for buried nuts {{while he waited for}} Tommy Tit to come back, and by [...] "him" [...] he meant Farmer Brown's boy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As for patience,' {{she would}} reply with a shrug, 'not much of that, godmother. If I had been patient, I {{should never have}} called him names. But I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it for his good. And besides, I felt my {{responsibility}} as a mother, so much. I tried reasoning, and reasoning failed. I tried coaxing, and coaxing failed. I tried scolding and scolding failed. But I was bound to try everything, you know, with such a charge upon my hands. Where would have been my duty to my poor lost boy, if I had not tried everything!' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>HOPE.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see Him with my bodily eyes, {{but with}} the eyes of my {{understanding}} (Eph. 1:18, 19); and thus it was: One day I was very sad, I think sadder than {{at any one time}} in my life, and this sadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness of my sins. And as I was then looking for nothing but hell, and the everlasting damnation of my soul, suddenly, as I thought, I saw the Lord Jesus look down from Heaven upon me, and saying, [...] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" [...] (Acts 16:31).|$|E
6000|$|Mary started, {{but she did}} {{not lose}} her {{presence}} of mind, and her next glance showed her that the apparition was not alarming, and was nearly as much amazed as herself. It was a tall slight young man, in a suit of shepherd's plaid, with a fair face and graceful agile form, recalling the word debonnaire as she had yesterday heard it applied. In instant conviction that this was the truant, she put out her hand by the same impulse that lighted his features with a smile of welcome, and the years of separation seemed annihilated as he exclaimed, 'My cousin Mary!' and grasped her hand, adding, 'I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not frighten you--' ...|$|E
6000|$|Luc. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not; For {{though there}} are {{appearances}} against me, Enough to give you <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> durst not shun you, Yet, could you see my heart, 'tis a white virgin-tablet, On which no characters of earthly love Were ever writ: And, 'twixt the prince and me, If there were any criminal affection, May heaven this minute-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, once. But I {{never told}} any of you, {{for fear of}} raising false <b>hopes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> apply, {{and it was all}} straight, but at the last moment the Department decided that I must have another witness to prove my identity, and this I could not get." ...|$|R
60|$|But we {{must not}} be atheists, as a friend said to me the other day. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not live quite as if I were. But {{it was a great}} shock from the beginning. Henrietta always seemed so strong that I never feared that way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on, I {{will listen}} to you," [...] she said, and sat {{immovable}} through the whole of my story, though her hand trembled in mine. And while I live I hope never {{to have such a}} thing to go through with again. Truth held me to the full, ludicrous tragedy of the tale, to the cheap character of my old Colonel's undertaking, to the incident of the drum, to the conversation in my room. Likewise, truth forbade me to rekindle her <b>hope.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not tell her that Nick had come with St. Gre to New Orleans, for of this my own knowledge was as yet not positive. For a long time after I had finished she was silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "But an hour. When {{they turned}} {{us away from}} the palace, thou knowest that I told thee of my necessities. There is not, in common, a more certain spot on the Lagunes than this, and yet have I long played the line in vain. The trial of hunger is hard, but, like all other trials, it must be borne. I have prayed to my patron thrice, {{and sooner or later}} he will listen to my wants. Thou art used to the manners of these masked nobles, Jacopo; dost thou think them likely to hearken to reason? I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the cause no wrong for want of breeding, but I spoke them fair and plainly as fathers and men with hearts." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS P.--Oh, how glad I am you are come, Mrs. Bonnington. Have {{you brought}} me that pretty hymn you promised me? You always keep your promises, even to poor governesses. I read dear Mr. Bonnington's sermon! It was so {{interesting}} that I really {{could not think}} of going to sleep until I had read it all through; it was delightful, but oh! it's still better when he preaches it! I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not do wrong in copying a part of it? I wish to impress it on the children. There are some worldly influences at work with them, dear madam [looking at Lady K. in the garden], which I do my feeble effort to--to modify. I wish YOU could come oftener.|$|E
6000|$|... "You say truly," [...] he cried, [...] "you say truly. But {{you do not}} reject me, Maude? You give me some ray of <b>hope?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask pledge or promise. Say {{only that}} I am not hateful to you--that on some happier day I may hear kinder words from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know I want {{self-control}} when I {{let myself}} be so engrossed {{in it as}} to neglect other things,' said Anne; 'and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> manage now not to shew more favour to the girls I like best, than to the others; but in what other way do you mean, Mamma?' ...|$|R
