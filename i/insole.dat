5|$|In {{the wake}} of his {{personal}} loss, Morris, known for his sincerity and high personal values, received many offers of work and financial assistance. With a reference from English cricketer Doug <b>Insole,</b> Morris joined British engineering company George Wimpey for a few years. He then moved back to Sydney to take up a public relations job with security group Wormald International where he worked until his retirement in the late 1980s. He was appointed to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust in 1965 and served there for 22 years, eight of them as deputy chairman. During this time, the ground was modernised and the Bradman Stand erected. In 1968, Morris met and married his second wife Judith Menmuir. He was awarded the MBE in 1974 for services to sport. In late 1989, Morris and his wife retired to the town of Cessnock in the Hunter Region, north of Sydney. He continued to play tennis into his late seventies and enjoyed watching Test cricket although he refused to watch one-day cricket, introduced after his playing days, due to his preference for tradition.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the second Test, D'Oliveira was told by Colin Cowdrey, the England captain, that he had been left out of the team and was instead twelfth man. In his place, England chose a fast bowler to {{strengthen}} their bowling attack. While the game was taking place, Doug <b>Insole,</b> the chairman of the England selectors, introduced D'Oliveira to Isaacs, who offered him warm hospitality if he toured South Africa during the English winter. Deeply upset with his omission, D'Oliveira returned to play for Worcestershire once his twelfth man duties ended. Oborne suggests that, from a cricketing viewpoint, the decision to drop D'Oliveira looks odd, and that it may have been connected to the South African presence at Lord's. The replacement for D'Oliveira, Barry Knight, performed well in the second Test; D'Oliveira, by contrast, lost all batting form. From mid-June until August, bothered by the pressure over South Africa, he struggled to score, managing just 205 runs at an average of 12.81. He maintained his form as a bowler, but critics believed his chance had gone. In July, as part of a standard procedure, the MCC wrote to 30 leading players to ask if they were available to tour South Africa; D'Oliveira was not contacted. According to Fraser-Sampson, the idea that D'Oliveira was not then one of England's best 30 players was absurd; he writes that the selectors must therefore have been aware that Vorster would not accept his selection and they had consequently decided not to choose him.|$|E

25|$|After World War II Essex fell off, {{taking their}} first wooden spoon in 1950.

Not until 1957 did Essex come back into {{the top half of the}} table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Essex matches {{were noted}} for high scores as Essex {{themselves}} scored more runs than anyone except Middlesex but also conceded the most.

Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey {{was the sole}} pace bowler of any effect but he was only available {{in the latter half}} of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug <b>Insole.</b> Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped.

25|$|Wheeling down eight-ball overs for South Africa v England at Durban in 1956–57, he bowled 119 {{balls in}} the first innings {{followed}} immediately by a further 18 in the second without conceding a run, a test and first class cricket record. He bowled over the wicket, close to the stumps, drifting the ball away from the bat {{in the air and}} then spinning it back through the gate. He did not spin the ball as much as England's Jim Laker but was unerringly accurate and could bowl all day. He set himself aggressive fields, in contrast to his steady bowling, with two silly mid ons for the snick prompted by a botched drive through the tempting hole he'd left at cover. He formed a fine partnership with Trevor Goddard and, backed by South Africa's athletic fielding, took 37 wickets at 17.18 against England in 1956–57. He took 9 for 113 in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Johannesburg, bowling unchanged on the last day, and was chaired off the field by his team mates.

Experts have different opinions about what age <b>insoles</b> should be prescribed, and if their use is beneficial.

25|$|Doug <b>Insole</b> {{used his}} {{influence}} to have Barrington join himself, Alec Bedser, Charlie Elliott and Sir Len Hutton as a selector for the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), which chose the England cricket team. He joined {{just as a}} demoralised England team returned from Australia for the premier Cricket World Cup followed by a four Test series against Australia (arranged to cover the cancelled South African tour). Mike Denness had lost confidence in Australia, but with Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson injured he had made 188 in the Sixth Test where England had won by an innings. He was kept as captain, but saw England lose to Australia in the World Cup semi-finals and lose by an innings in the First Test at Old Trafford. Denness was dropped and the combative Tony Greig was made the new captain. As a selector Barrington tended to favour experience and current form over potential and chose the unknown Northants batsman David Steele, who became an unlikely hero as England the last three Tests were hard fought draws. Against Clive Lloyd's West Indians in 1976 he called up the 45-year-old Brian Close and 39-year-old John Edrich and they were hard hit by the West Indian fast bowlers as England lost 3–0.|$|E

Oborne writes that <b>Insole</b> considered the events surrounding the selection meeting as among the worst of his life, but that [...] "he and the other selectors were victims of the decision, reached on the advice of Alec Douglas-Home early in 1968, not to press for an answer to the MCC demand there should be 'no preconditions' for the tour. Once that decision had been made, everything else followed: the bribery attempt, the secret pressure and the nobbling of the MCC.

500|$|The selectors, after {{a six-hour}} meeting, chose {{the team to}} tour South Africa on 27 August 1968. The {{official}} records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened.

Oborne suggests {{that one of those}} present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely. He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, [...] "Everyone in the room, {{with the possible exception of}} the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled."
