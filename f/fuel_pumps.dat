One month later {{launched}} the new 9-3 BioPower, the first vehicle in Australia to give drivers a choice of three fuels, E85, diesel or gasoline, and both automobiles are sold for a small premium. Australia's largest independent fuel retailer, United Petroleum, announced plans to install Australia's first commercial E85 <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> one in Sydney and one in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>pump</b> vented — if the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{diaphragm}} ruptures, {{then the}} excess fuel will be directed into the carburettor. This kind of <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{is referred to}} as a marine <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> in the <b>fuel</b> tank. Moving the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> to {{the interior of the}} tank helps prevent vapor lock, since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapor lock is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carbureted engines are retrofitted with an electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> near the <b>fuel</b> tank.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> was {{controlled}} mechanically. From 1987, an electronically controlled <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> was used, which increased the torque output by 10 Nm. The updated engine has a smaller turbocharger, which improves response.|$|R

25|$|In its Special Bulletin of 18 February 2008, the AAIB noted {{evidence}} that cavitation {{had taken place}} in both high pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> which could be indicative of a restriction in the fuel supply or excessive aeration of the fuel, although the manufacturer assessed both pumps as still being able to deliver full fuel flow. The report noted the aircraft had flown through air that was unusually cold (but not exceptionally so), and concluded that the temperature had not been low enough to freeze the fuel. Tests were continuing in an attempt to replicate the damage seen in the <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> and to match this to the data recorded on the flight. A comprehensive examination and analysis was to be conducted on the entire aircraft and engine fuel system, including modelling fuel flows, taking account of environmental and aerodynamic effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuel</b> Boost <b>Pump</b> Switch - Controls the {{operation}} of the auxiliary electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> to provide <b>fuel</b> to the engine before it starts or in case of failure of the engine powered <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b> Some large airplanes have a fuel system that allows the flight crew to jettison or dump the fuel. When operated, the boost <b>pumps</b> in the <b>fuel</b> tanks <b>pump</b> the <b>fuel</b> to the dump chutes or jettison nozzles and overboard to atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|In the APU, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{boosted the}} {{hydrazine}} pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed {{back over the}} gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

25|$|On 22 January 1965 an RCAF P2V-7 #24115 crashed {{short of}} the runway at CFB Summerside, Prince Edward Island due to running out of battery power to run the <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> to the J-34 jet engines. 24115 had lost one {{reciprocating}} engine and the generator failed on the other plus the fact that Canadian Neptunes had no generators on the jets leading {{to the loss of}} all thrust and the subsequent crash.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, {{the victory}} in Belgium {{was the high}} point for AAR as engine {{problems}} continued to plague the Eagle. Despite the antiquated engine tooling used by the Weslake factory (dating from World War I), failures rarely stemmed from the engine design itself, but more often from unreliable peripheral systems like <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> fuel injection and the oil delivery system. He led the 1967 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring when a driveshaft failed two laps from the end with a 42-second lead in hand. After a third-place finish in Canada that year, the car would finish only one more race. By {{the end of the}} 1968 season, Gurney was driving a McLaren-Ford. His last Formula One race was the 1970 British Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|A {{drawback}} of {{the design}} was the distance between pilot and observer, as they were separated by the large main fuel tank. This made communication between the crew members difficult, especially in combat with enemy fighters. There was also some controversy (especially in American service) that this placement of the fuel tank was inherently unsafe. In fact, most contemporary aircraft were prone to catching fire in the air. The fire hazard was reduced, however, when the pressurised fuel system was replaced by one using wind-driven <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> late in 1917, although this was not initially adopted by American-built aircraft. The otherwise inferior DH.9 brought the pilot and observer closer together by placing the fuel tank in the usual place, between the pilot and the engine.|$|E

25|$|The federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) {{effectively}} requires refiners and blenders {{to blend}} renewable biofuels (mostly ethanol) with gasoline, sufficient {{to meet a}} growing annual target of total gallons blended. Although the mandate {{does not require a}} specific percentage of ethanol, annual increases in the target combined with declining gasoline consumption has caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10%. Most <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10% ethanol, an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage. Until late 2010, fuels retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol (E10), and most vehicle warranties (except for flexible fuel vehicles) authorize fuels that contain no more than 10 percent ethanol. In parts of the United States, ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component.|$|E
25|$|The report {{summarised}} {{the extensive}} testing performed {{in an effort}} to replicate the problem suffered by G-YMMM. This included creating a mock-up of G-YMMM's fuel delivery system, to which water was added to study its freezing properties. After a battery of tests, the AAIB had not yet succeeded in reproducing the suspected icing behaviour, and was undertaking further investigation. Nevertheless, the AAIB believed its testing showed that fuel flow was restricted on G-YMMM and that frozen water in the jet fuel could have caused the restriction, ruling out alternative hypotheses such as a failure of the aircraft's FADEC (computerised engine control system). The hypothesis favoured in the report was that ice had accreted somewhere downstream of the boost pumps in the wing fuel tanks and upstream of the engine-mounted <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> Either enough ice had accumulated to cause a blockage at a single point, or ice throughout the fuel lines had become dislodged as fuel flow increased during the landing approach, and the dislodged ice had then formed a blockage somewhere downstream.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} work described {{the effect of}} flow control valve type {{on the performance of}} wobble plate type <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> for the stable DME fuel supply. In order to study this, different four types of flow control valves (ITV, SCV, IMV and MPROP) were installed on the wobble plate <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> and <b>fuel</b> flow rate, torque, and temperature variation of pump were investigated under various operating conditions by using pump performance test system. It was revealed that wobble plate type <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> worked well with ITV and SCV control valve, and the flow rate and torque of <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> was in proportion to the value of valve open duty. The maximum flow rate and torque of <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> were achieved around the 50 % duty of control valve.

25|$|As {{the ship}} turned slowly to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell {{on either side}} of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was clean out of the water. Cascades of spray and bomb {{splinters}} lashed the deck, she fell back with a crash. Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room lights went out, plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces.|$|E

The new 2013 Shelby GT500 also has no grill, due to the massive amount of cooling required for the vehicle. Performance changes include twin <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> (a Mustang GT’s single supply pump, twice over), larger fuel injectors, a grippier and larger-diameter clutch, a larger fan, a three-row intercooler (the previous car used a double-row unit), a beefed-up Tremec 6060 six-speed with an internal oil pump, and a single-piece carbon-fiber driveshaft.

25|$|In December 2010, several groups, {{including}} the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, {{filed suit against}} the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The plaintiffs argued the EPA {{does not have the}} authority to issue a “partial waiver” that covers some cars and not others. Among other arguments, the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars, but also for <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> and underground tanks not designed for the E15 mixture. It was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years. In August 2012, the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA. The case was thrown out on a technical reason, as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.|$|E
