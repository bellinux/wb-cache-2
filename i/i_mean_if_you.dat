500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were going to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, {{it would have been}} nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott has {{developed}} a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: [...] "I like working, always, {{with a minimum of}} three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [...] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on." ...|$|E
2500|$|From April to August 2011, RT ran {{a half-hour}} primetime show Adam vs. the Man, hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and {{high-profile}} anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's [...] "propaganda" [...] function, saying [...] "We're {{putting out the}} truth {{that no one else}} wants to say. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want {{to put it in the}} worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit." [...] The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.|$|E
6000|$|... “The {{information}} I need {{is quite}} private,” he repeated. “You understand what <b>I</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{could give me}} a notion where he’s gone to?” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "However we start, we end {{by talking}} about the same thing--about poetry, <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> realize, William, that I've never read even Shakespeare? It's rather {{wonderful}} how I've kept it up all these years." ...|$|R
2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Buffett {{described}} {{the health care}} reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to spend a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 Beat the Blizzard webzine's article, {{the writer}} Jan Lindsø states that [...] "any metal fans {{are of the}} opinion that Christians should 'not be allowed' to use the black metal {{aesthetics}} musically since they do not inherit this evil and perhaps misantropic [...] trait that many people say is necessary in order to be convincing as black metal musicians". Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to be a Christian, be it with all you've got, {{and if you want to}} be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't be serious I shall {{think there is}} no {{seriousness}} in you. I {{want you to tell me}} how it can be done." ...|$|R
5000|$|... algazzar: I {{understand}} that but what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> say <b>I</b> am {{an enemy combatant}} {{and you say you}} have evidence, I don’t get to see it. Then I will stay here….|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Beaumont {{considered}} it. “How do {{you know}} she isn’t dying if you haven’t felt her pulse? <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven’t asked her?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Patella, [...] "amputation is {{your only}} resource, Mr. Surgeon of the Fleet; that is, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are fully persuaded of its necessity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Hetty eagerly. [...] "That is {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> saw they wanted anarchy, Larry, you {{would come back to}} us? We should be glad to have you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mean!" [...] said Davie, [...] "why, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{touch me}} I'll resign office; and if I do that, you'll {{have to go}} out, for {{everyone}} knows you can't get on without me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘O!’ she cried, ‘I have abominably used him—I know that; it is {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> admire my husband, I insist that you shall {{understand}} me: I can look him in the face without a blush.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't never {{contradict}} you; nor <b>I</b> don't <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{tells me}} so as often again. And <b>I</b> don't <b>mean</b> {{to be that}} impident as to tell my master as I ain't the only fool about the place. It wouldn't be no wise becoming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you come}} to that," [...] said the soldier, [...] "the world lives by illusions. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at history, you'll see that the {{creation}} of illusions has always been her business, don't you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{the very}} point I was working round to. There, as you say, is the snag. Why not chuck {{the whole idea}} of {{hitching}} up with me? Wash it out altogether. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> love old Gussie----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] said Henchard, [...] "you {{would do}} me a service, Jopp, now--to-night, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae's for her. I {{should take it}} myself, of course, but I don't wish to be seen there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, 'what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't show up won't it {{be rather}} a jar for old friend Maginnis? Won't he be apt to foam {{at the mouth}} a bit and stop giving you parts in his companies?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O!" [...] she cried, [...] "I have abominably used him--I know that; it is {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> admire my husband, I insist that you shall {{understand}} me: I can look him in the face without a blush." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's what I mean," [...] Charlotte {{instantly}} said. [...] "She's not selfish enough. There's nothing, absolutely, {{that one}} NEED do for her. She's so modest," [...] she developed--"she doesn't miss things. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> love her--or, rather, I should say, if she loves you. She lets it go." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{promptly}} {{showed how}} this was almost {{all she wanted}} of him. [...] "That's all <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> understand it of such a court as never was: one of the courts of heaven, the court of a reigning seraph, {{a sort of a}} vice-queen of an angel. That will do perfectly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean to say, it's {{obvious that}} she must have spotted you in those bushes and was simply talking to score off you. There you were, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> follow the psychology, and she saw you, and in that {{impulsive}} way girls have, she seized the opportunity of ribbing you a bit--just told you a few home truths, I mean to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} you don't see my point," [...] he said gently. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> is: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> love me, {{how does it}} happen that you love me now {{so much more than}} you did when your love was weak enough to deny me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said old Timothy, [...] "'tis {{a strange}} thing about doctors that the worse they be the better they be. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hear {{anything}} of this sort about 'em, ten to one they can cure ye as nobody else can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Cecil, hesitating; [...] "may be all this-—your getting right, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> is {{the coming}} round of prayers—-my mother's, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> take this turn, {{it will be}} much easier for me! Poor mother! it's not for want of her caring and teaching." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{can afford}} it. I {{like a man}} to like pleasure. But I despise a man who makes a {{business}} of his pleasures. When I hear that this man is the best whist-player in London, and that man the best billiard-player, I always {{know that they can}} do nothing else, and then I despise them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove! O'Hara, I {{think there}} is a great deal in you; but you must not become proud and you must not talk. You must go back to Lucknow and be a good little boy and mind your book, as the English say, and perhaps, next {{holidays}} if you care, you can come back to me!' Kim's face fell. 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like. I know where you want to go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it does. But it is {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> knew how this would,--would,--would break his heart." [...] Then there came a tear into the young man's eye,--and there was {{something}} almost like a tear {{in the eye of the}} old man too. [...] "Of course it was my fault. I got him to come.

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> don't <b>mean</b> anything, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't. <b>I</b> {{thought from}} your {{beginning}} to defend {{yourself that you}} felt yourself {{to be in the}} wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; not so much, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had {{everything}} to buy. Besides, I look upon Mason {{as a sort}} of Croesus. What on earth has he got to do with his money? And then as to time;--upon my word I don't understand what a man means when he says he has not got time for hunting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} him nothing. He knows that I {{do not wish to}} go. He cannot but know that. But he knows that <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> require it." ...|$|R
