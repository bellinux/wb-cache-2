50|$|After {{the talks}} were indefinitely postponed, President Abbas {{focused on a}} bid for UN {{recognition}} for Palestinian statehood in September 2011 instead of forming a unity government. The decision was triggered by the break down of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks after Netanyahu's refusal to renew a partial <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> <b>settlement</b> construction in September 2010, and also by Israel's opposition to the Fatah-Hamas deal itself.|$|R
5000|$|Phase I (finished {{as early}} as May 2003): Mutual recognition; an {{immediate}} and unconditional ceasefire to end armed activity and all acts of violence against Israelis anywhere; Palestinian political-institutional reform; Palestinian elections; Israeli withdrawal to the positions of 28 September 2000 (begin of Second Intifada; the plan does not speak of any further withdrawal). Israeli refrain from deportations, attacks on civilians, demolition and destruction, etc.; reopen Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem; improve humanitarian situation, full implementation Bertini report, easing movement; <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> <b>settlement</b> expansion and dismantling of settlement outposts built since 2001.|$|R
25|$|In November 2010, Israel was {{reportedly}} offered an additional 20 F-35s {{in exchange for}} a continued <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> Israeli <b>settlements</b> in the West Bank, however State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley has refused to confirm these reports, and the offer was rejected.|$|R
5000|$|As the Israeli 10-month <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> <b>settlement</b> {{construction}} was nearing its expiration date on September 26, Mahmoud Abbas {{stated that he}} would abandon the negotiations if settlement {{construction was}} renewed. He said [...] "Israel has a moratorium for 10 months {{and it should be}} extended for three to four months more to give peace a chance." [...] In the view of the Palestinian Authority leadership, Israeli construction of settlements constitutes Israel's imposition of [...] "facts on the ground" [...] in the West Bank, and is a violation of international law. See generally, International law and Israeli settlements ...|$|R
50|$|Israeli-US {{relations}} {{came under}} increased strain during Prime Minister Netanyahu's second {{administration and the}} new Obama administration. After he took office, Barack Obama made achieving a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians a major goal, and pressured Netanyahu into accepting a Palestinian state and entering negotiations. Netanyahu eventually conceded on 14 July 2009. In accordance with US wishes, Israel imposed a ten-month <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> <b>settlement</b> construction in the West Bank. As the freeze did not include East Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its sovereign territory, or 3,000 pre-approved housing units already under construction, {{as well as the}} failure to dismantle already-built Israeli outposts, the Palestinians rejected the freeze as inadequate, and refused to enter negotiations for nine months.|$|R
5000|$|US President Barack Obama {{demands a}} {{complete}} <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> <b>settlement</b> {{construction in the}} West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The Israeli government agrees to a freeze in the West Bank. Peace Now argues that Israel is attempting to fool the United States. [...] On 25 August 2009 Netanyahu says that he will attempt to gain {{an agreement with the}} U.S. to continue building settlements before attempting to talk with the Palestinians. On 28 August 2009 US officials said they would not impose conditions on the parties, but that it would be up to the parties themselves to determine if the threshold for talks had been met. [...] Education Minister Gideon Sa'ar defended the freeze as an attempt to [...] "protect the vital interests - Jerusalem and the relationship with the United States - and to avoid national isolation, because we won't {{be able to do the}} things close to our hearts while under international isolation." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} March, Haaretz {{reported}} that the United States, Israel and the Palestinian Authority were negotiating a [...] "grand bargain" [...] to [...] "salvage peace talks". Kerry and Netanyahu discussed a possible deal to extend them {{until the end of}} 2014 and to ensure the Palestinians didn't make unilateral moves at the United Nations. The Israeli proposal conditioned the release of the fourth tranche of 26 Palestinian prisoners on an extension of the negotiations beyond the current deadline of 29 April and included the release about 400 low-profile Palestinian prisoners, as well as the 26 high-profile prisoners, including 14 Israeli Arabs. It excluded the high-profile prisoners Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat who Israel categorically refused to release. Israel also offered to put an unofficial <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> most <b>settlement</b> construction outside of East Jerusalem for the next eight months. Israel said it would resolve the status of family reunification requests submitted by some 5,000 families in the West Bank and Gaza. According to Israeli officials, the United States would release Jonathan Pollard as a concession to Israel. On 23 April 2014, The Jerusalem Post {{reported that}} Abbas listed 3 conditions for extending peace talks beyond the 29 April deadline; that the borders of a future Palestinian state be dealt with during {{the first three months of}} the extended talks, a complete <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> all <b>settlement</b> construction, and the release without deportation of the fourth batch of Palestinian prisoners, including Israeli-Arabs.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2010, the U.S. {{government}} offered Israel {{a package}} of incentives in exchange for an agreement by the Israeli government to a 90-day <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> <b>settlement</b> construction in the West Bank excluding East Jerusalem. The centerpiece of the deal was a military aid package worth $3 billion, including delivery of 20 additional F-35s,various missile and layered defense systems, and an explicit acceptance of the legitimacy of existing security needs and a commitment not to redefine them. In addition to security provisions, the proposed incentive package also included a U.S. promise to veto any U.N. Security Council resolution relating {{to the peace process}} during the agreed upon negotiating period and a guarantee that the U.S. would not ask Israel to extend the 90-day moratorium when it expired. The Security Cabinet of Israel considered the offer. Former Ambassador Dan Kurtzer, commenting on the deal said: [...] "But now, the administration says it is prepared to pay off Israel to freeze only some of its settlement activity, and only temporarily. For the first time in memory, the United States is poised to reward Israel for its bad behavior." [...] Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the U.S. freeze proposal, as it did not include East Jerusalem, while Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat reiterated demands for unconditional recognition of the 1967 borders, and for withdrawal from all of East Jerusalem.|$|R
40|$|In August 2009, the United States {{called for}} a <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> Israeli <b>{{settlement}}s</b> {{in order to promote}} peace talks between Israel and Palestine. Israel agreed to the settlement freeze yet less than three weeks later approved a plan by the Israel Land Administration and the Jerusalem Planning Committee to build an additional 900 houses in the town of Gilo. While much of the international community understands Gilo to be an illegal <b>settlement</b> built <b>on</b> occupied territory, Israel disputes this claim and views Gilo as a legal suburb of Jerusalem. Though many states, international organizations, and human rights groups protested Gilo’s expansion at the time of announcement, development continued nonetheless. A great deal of media and other forms of propaganda projects were issued from a multiplicity of perspectives in an attempt to sway the world towards certain political positions on Gilo’s expansion. In order to do this, various parties worked to influence the way that the public imagined or perceived settlement expansion as legal or illegal, humane or inhumane. The Israeli growth coalition and Palestinian groups manipulated the geographic imagination to legitimize or delegitimize claims for land. This idea will be explored through the case study of Gilo to demonstrate how competing actors employ history, race, nationalism, and rhetoric to stake claims to land...|$|R
40|$|From one {{perspective}} the Middle East {{lends itself}} as a macabre mise-en-scene where the triumph of realpolitik over the legitimacies of international law can be continually re-staged. To be sure, at least two sovereign states seem to go their own way, {{even in the face}} of rampant and valid international criticism—the end of a construction <b>freeze</b> <b>on</b> illegal <b>settlements</b> and failures to condemn clearly illustrate this point. However, two can play at that game. The US veto of the October 2003 draft Security Council resolution declaring as illegal Israel’s construction of its security fence, beyond the 1949 Green Line and into the Occupied Territories, illustrated raw power and military strength in action—the very definition of hegemony. However, even giants always have weaknesses. Cyclops springs to mind. A 360 degree perspective would have taken into account that there were other powerful institutions in the metaphorical UN room besides the Security Council. The power and protection of a permanent member’s veto could not deter the UN General Assembly’s request for an Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the legality of the wall. Of course, even the ICJ’s eventual condemnation in 2004 did not actually halt the wall’s construction but what it did was make clear the illegality of Israel’s action. Further, the court made clear that there was no doubting the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination...|$|R
