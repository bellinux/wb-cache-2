5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, <b>electromyogram</b> or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to decomposition of multichannel surface <b>electromyograms</b> recorded during low-level isometric muscle contractions. The approach is based on special time-frequency matrices of measured signals, enables separation of contributions of different motor units in time-frequency plane and is not sensitive to the superimpositions of motor unit action potentials. The results on both synthetic and real surface <b>electromyograms</b> prove the proposed approach is robust to noise and has potential clinical applications for the non-invasive analysis of single motor unit properties...|$|R

Common misconception about EOG is that measured potential is the <b>electromyogram</b> of extraocular muscles.

25|$|Studies {{have been}} done with {{electromyography}} to trace skeletal muscle activity in some hyperkinetic disorders. The <b>electromyogram</b> (EMG) of dystonia sometimes shows rapid rhythmic bursts, but these patterns can almost always be produced intentionally. In the myoclonus EMG, there are typically brief, and sometimes rhythmic, bursts or pauses in the recording pattern. When the bursts last for 50 milliseconds or less they are indicative of cortical myoclonus, but when they last up to 200 milliseconds, they are indicative of spinal or brainstem myoclonus. Such bursts can occur in multiple muscles simultaneously quite quickly, but high time resolution must {{be used in the}} EMG trace to clearly record them. The bursts recorded for tremor tend to be longer in duration than those of myoclonus, although some types can last for durations within the range for those of myoclonus. Future studies would have to examine the EMGs for tics, athetosis, stereotypies and chorea as there are minimal recordings done for those movements. However, it may be predicted that the EMG for chorea would include bursts varying in duration, timing, and amplitude, while that for tics and stereotypies would take on patterns of voluntary movements.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effects of}} REM sleep {{deprivation}} (RSD) on neurotrophic [...] factors, specifically nerve growth factor (NGF) and {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF), were assessed in 2000 by Sie et el. [...] Neurotrophins are proteins found {{in the brain and}} periphery that aid in the survival, functioning and generation of neurons; this is an important element in the synaptic plasticity process, the underlying neurochemical foundation in forming memories. Sei et al., inserted electrodes into the skulls of seven pairs of rats to measure Electroencephalogram (EEG), and inserted wire into the neck muscles of the rats to measure <b>Electromyogram</b> (EMG), a technique used to measure the amount of muscle activity. [...] Half the rats experienced a six-hour REM sleep deprivation period, while the other half experienced a six-hour sleep period, containing all sleep cycles. [...] Results showed that in the rats in the REM sleep deprivation group showed decreased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the cerebellum (coordination, motor learning) and brainstem (sensory and motor ascending pathway), conversely the hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial navigation), showed decreases in nerve growth factor levels. [...] BDNF protein {{has been shown to be}} necessary for procedural learning (form of non-declarative memory). [...] Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD. [...] In regards to NGF, the basal forebrain (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends cholinergic (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAinergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells. [...] These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions. [...] It has been noted that REM sleep increases the secretion of NGF, therefore it has been proposed that during RSD cholinergic activity decreases leading to a decrease in NGF and impairment in procedural learning.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{synchronized}} intermittent mandatory ventilation, it {{is generally}} accepted {{that the work of}} the inspiratory muscles is decreased by the ventilator so that their activity can be modulated by the frequency of assisted breaths. We examined the validity of this concept, which recently has been questioned. METHODS: We studied five patients receiving synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation because of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The level of machine assistance, defined as the percentage of total ventilation delivered by the ventilator, was varied from a high (> 60 %) to a medium (20 - 50 %) and to the lowest tolerated value (0 % in four patients). Esophageal pressure, air flow, and the <b>electromyograms</b> of the diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid muscles were recorded. At each level of machine assistance, distinguishing assisted from spontaneous breaths, the duration of electrical activation, the integrated <b>electromyograms,</b> and the work of breathing were computed. RESULTS: The durations of electrical activation and the integrated <b>electromyograms</b> of the diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid were similar in successive spontaneous and assisted breaths. At > 60 % of machine assistance, the cumulative values per minute of the integrated <b>electromyograms</b> of the diaphragm and sternocleidomastoid and the work of breathing were reduced only by 38, 32, and 44 %, respectively, compared with the lowest tolerated level of machine assistance. The durations of electrical activation did not change with increasing level of machine assistance. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of inspiratory muscle rest achieved by synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation is not proportional to the level of machine assistance; furthermore, the inspiratory motor output is not regulated breath by breath but rather is constant for a given level of machine assistance...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} whether shortened dental arches (SDAs) cause functional overloading of the teeth and the temporomandibular joints, {{which has been}} implicated in periodontal diseases and temporomandibular disorders, we investigated the influences of SDA on occlusal and joint loads. Bite force and masticatory muscle <b>electromyograms</b> were recorded in five dentate subjects who clenched maximally on intra-oral appliances, creating symmetrical SDAs experimentally. Muscular forces estimated from the recorded <b>electromyograms</b> were fed into a finite element jaw model for calculating bite forces and joint loads. Comparison between the measured and the calculated bite forces ensured that the joint loads were representative. The bite force on each tooth increased with missing molar occlusions, while joint loads decreased. The bite force per root surface area was always greatest on the most posterior tooth, and these values were most constant. The findings provide no evidence that SDA causes overloading of the joints and the teeth, which suggests that neuromuscular regulatory systems are controlling maximum clenching strength under various occlusal conditions.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The shape-varying {{format of}} surface <b>electromyograms</b> {{introduces}} {{errors in the}} detection of contraction events. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the accuracy and learning curves of inexperienced observers to detect the quantity of contraction events in surface <b>electromyograms.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six observers performed manual segmentation in 1200 shape-varying waveforms simulated using a phenomenological model with variable events, smooth changes in amplitude, marked on-off timing, and variable signal-to-noise ratio (0 - 39 dB). Segmentation was organized in four sessions with 15 blocks of 20 signals each. Accuracy and learning curves were modeled per block by linear and power regression models and tested for difference among sessions. Cut-off values of signal-to-noise ratio for optimal manual segmentation were also estimated. RESULTS: The accuracy curve showed no significant linear trend throughout blocks and no difference among sessions 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 (87 % [85; 89], 87 % [85; 89], 87 % [85; 89], 87 % [81; 88]; p = 0. 691). Accuracy was low for detection of 1 event (AUC = 0. 40; sensitivity = 44 %; specificity = 43 %; cut-off = 12. 9 dB) but was high and affected by the signal-to-noise ratio for detection of two events (AUC = 0. 82; sensitivity = 77 %; specificity = 76 %; cut-off = 7. 0 dB). The learning curve showed a significant power regression (p < 0. 001) with decreasing values of learning percentages (time duration to complete the task) among sessions 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 (86. 5 % [68; 94], 76 % [68; 91], 62 % [38; 77], and 57 % [52; 75]; p = 0. 002).

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach for}} the analysis of surface <b>electromyograms</b> is to use wavelets to determine the spectral distribution of the signal intensity at any time. The authors have recently proposed using non-linearly scaled wavelets to obtain intensity patterns, which reflect the spectral distribution at any given time point.

The weight with which each principal-pattern contributes to the intensity-pattern can be represented on a set of orthogonal axes that span a previously introduced pattern space. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to show how to use pattern space to discriminate and classify male and female runners based on the <b>electromyograms</b> of five muscles of the limb.
