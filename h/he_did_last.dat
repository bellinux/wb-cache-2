2500|$|Greswell's {{figures for}} the 1928 season were similar to 1927 – 71 wickets, but with the rather higher average of 27.43. There was one {{spectacular}} day of success for him at Weston-super-Mare: helped by five catches from George Hunt in the leg-side trap, Greswell took nine Hampshire wickets for 62 runs, the best innings analysis of his long career. That was, however, the last big performance. Wisden recorded in its Somerset notes in 1929: [...] "It {{is a matter for}} much regret that in future Greswell {{will not be able to}} render Somerset anything like as much assistance as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlson {{does not}} like {{standing}} still professionally. [...] His girlfriend Rachel Brown observes, [...] "He thinks what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year isn’t good enough for this year." [...] Schwa is infamous for disappearing dishes. [...] "If he’s bored with something, {{no matter how many}} people love it and demand it, he’s done with it," [...] says Brown. [...] On the other hand, Carlson has no interest in transitioning from chef to chef-restaurateur. He has rejected offers of investment and calls to move to a better location with more space. [...] "Nah, I’m happy," [...] with the way things are, he says. [...] Carlson {{is said to be a}} perfectionist when it comes to food, and has only missed one night of work in his career at Schwa.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{back and}} tell us {{as soon as you}} can," [...] {{commanded}} Mrs. Joyce. [...] "I'm crazy to know what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night, and what he really thinks of us?" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> his <b>last</b> weather {{broadcast}} on 10 August 2009.|$|R
5000|$|In 1041, Boioannes' son Exaugustus {{was named}} catapan, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>last</b> {{a year in}} that post.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> at <b>last</b> {{succeed in}} getting {{himself into the}} street, and at any rate she had not eaten him.|$|R
60|$|Bellairs went away, and Meta gave {{expression}} to her eager hope that Norman {{would go through}} it well. If he would only read it as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> Easter to her and Ethel.|$|E
6000|$|... "The ol' man rather gits {{the laugh}} on y' there, gents," [...] called Robie {{from the other}} side of the counter. [...] "I hain't seen the old skeesix play better'n <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night, in years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Tom, {{shaking his}} head; [...] "no one {{will give me}} a penny for playing; but Farmer Bowser might give me a penny to stop playing, if I went to his house. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> week, you know." ...|$|E
50|$|Back in Hollywood <b>he</b> <b>did</b> The <b>Last</b> Sunset (1961) {{then made}} a Biblical {{spectacular}} in Italy, Sodom and Gomorrah (1962) for Joseph E. Levine.|$|R
60|$|After {{long and}} feverish wanderings of the mind, and some {{talking to himself}} and walking about the room, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> at <b>last</b> get a little away from Mrs. Skelmersdale.|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} in the room nearly an hour when <b>he</b> <b>did</b> at <b>last</b> find himself {{standing}} close to Lady Dumbello: close to her, and without any other very near neighbour.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{that was}} the meaning of his looking so lank and careworn, just as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year, and he the prince of the school! I could have found it in my heart to fling the books at his head!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because he is a mean-spirited, selfish man. If he were not, {{he could}} not have talked as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night. Because you do not love him, Mildred, you cannot love such a man as that, if he were fifty times a member of the Government." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{be careful}} that your monkey don't get out again, an' go to cuttin' up as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night, for I shall get {{provoked}} with him if he hurts my ducks any more," [...] and, with this bit of advice, Aunt Olive went up-stairs to see Abner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear fellow, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it <b>last</b> {{night in}} the nicest way, and Mama is so delighted. Now what shall I be married in?" [...] And Kitty {{composed}} herself with a face full of the deepest anxiety.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the Marlins {{selected}} Hibbard {{with the}} 12th {{pick in the}} expansion draft. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>last</b> long in Florida, as they traded him that same day to the Cubs for Alex Arias and Gary Scott.|$|R
60|$|He {{insisted that}} Wilding and Grey should shake hands before the {{breaking}} up of that most astounding council, and as <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> <b>last</b> night, <b>he</b> now again imposed upon them his commands {{that they must}} not allow this matter to go further.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{back and}} tell Wilson to issue just {{the same amount of}} flour this week that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last,</b> and that Red Wolf wants a new mowing-machine for his people. You need not return till morning." [...] Then, turning to Red Wolf, he said: [...] "Go on with the dance; my friends are much pleased." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps he's {{gone up to}} Varley as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> time," [...] Mrs. Mulready said. [...] "I am sure I hope he has, else he will be {{wandering}} {{about all}} night, and {{he had such a}} strange lock in his face that there's no saying where he might go to, or what he might do." ...|$|E
6000|$|MITCHENER. How can I? You {{know that}} the people are devoted heart and soul to Sandstone. He is only {{bringing}} you [...] "on the knee," [...] as we say in the army. Could any other living man have persuaded the British nation to accept universal compulsory military service as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> year? Why, even the Church refused exemption. He is supreme--omnipotent.|$|E
60|$|It took Ashe {{some little}} {{time to get a}} {{thorough}} grasp of the tangled situation; but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it at <b>last.</b>|$|R
50|$|Now <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> his <b>last</b> year {{at school}} {{and trying not to}} spin out. Trying to be cool. Trying to pick up a few skills for {{surviving}} in the adult world. Problem is, he falls for Naomi, and things become much, much more confusing.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{being able}} to hold his wheat; which <b>he</b> couldn't <b>do</b> <b>last</b> year, is a pretty strong count against the man. You gave him his chance for {{explaining}} {{and he made a}} mighty bad show. Looks as if he'd got some money he couldn't account for since last fall." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another year, and--hist! What craft is it Duhl designs? [...] He alights not at {{the door}} of the tent as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> time, [...] 50 [...] But, {{creeping}} behind, he gropes his stealthy way by the trench [...] Half-round till he finds the flap in the folding, for night combines [...] With the robber--and such is he: Duhl, covetous up to crime, [...] Must wring from Hóseyn's grasp the Pearl, by whatever the wrench.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And doubtless {{with the}} same motives which brought him here yesterday,' replied the other. 'You will see that he will again enter the church, listen to the service, retire to his little chapel near the Pincian Mount, and there, before his ragged mob of adherents, attack the doctrines which our brethren have preached, as we know <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night, and as we suspect he will {{continue}} to do until the authorities think proper to give the signal for his imprisonment.' ...|$|E
60|$|SMITH (lighting lantern). All right, old mumble-peg. Don't you {{get carried}} away by the fire of old Rome. That's your motto. Here are the tools, a perfect picter of the sublime and beautiful; and all I hope is that our friend and pitcher, the Deakin, will make {{a better job of}} it than <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night. If he don't, I shall retire from the business--that's all; and it'll be George and his little wife and a black footman till death do us part.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear brother,' {{said the}} other, seizing Tim's {{disengaged}} fist, 'Tim Linkinwater looks {{ten years younger}} than <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on his <b>last</b> birthday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{longer than}} I can help," [...] rejoined Heriot. [...] "I want my revenge against Bompard, remember. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> fleece me <b>last</b> night." ...|$|R
50|$|Gaye didn't {{appear in}} any more movies {{until the late}} 1970s. He {{appeared}} {{in a couple of}} television movies before, at age 79, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> his <b>last</b> movie which was the science fiction movie Meteor where he had a small role as the Soviet Premier in 1979.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is evident, Roger, {{that the}} king is marching, at present, in the {{direction}} of Plinlimmon. No doubt he hopes that Glendower will come down and give him battle, but methinks he will not be foolish enough to do so. The weather, and the hills, will fight far better for him than the Welsh, themselves, can do; and he has but to leave the army to wander about through the mountains and forests, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> time, to ensure that they must, ere long, fall back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean unbending, strong, {{not to be}} {{overcome}} by outside circumstances. If Mr. Annesley had not spoken to me as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night,--could never have so spoken to me,--I {{should have been a}} miserable girl, but my love for him would have been just as stern. I should have remained and thought of it, and have been unhappy through my whole life. But he has spoken, and I am exultant. That is what I mean by stern. All that is most important, at any rate to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Time will try,' {{answered}} the fisherman; 'and hark thee, Joshua, before we part I will put thee {{in the way}} of doing one good deed, which, credit me, is better than twenty moral speeches. Here is a stranger youth, whom Heaven has so scantily gifted with brains, that he will bewilder himself in the Sands, as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>last</b> night, unless thou wilt kindly show him the way to Shepherd's Bush; for I have been in vain endeavouring to make him comprehend the road thither. Hast thou so much charity under thy simplicity, Quaker, as to do this good turn?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Upon this, {{the servant}} looked {{up with a}} good-natured grin, but the master started as from a venomous bite. It was {{a moment or two}} before the Spaniard {{sufficiently}} recovered himself to reply; which <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> at <b>last,</b> with cold constraint:--"Yes, Señor, I have trust in Babo." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>did</b> at <b>last</b> {{consent to}} take the papers in his hands, and to read them through with care. He took them away with that promise, and with an {{assurance}} that he would bring them back on the day but one following--should Mr. Scarborough then be alive.|$|R
60|$|A {{longer time}} than usual elapsed before any further news of Lord Harry {{and his wife}} was {{received}} by Mountjoy. When <b>he</b> <b>did</b> at <b>last</b> hear again from Mrs. Vimpany, she forwarded a letter from Iris dated from a new address, in the suburb of Paris called Passy.|$|R
