50|$|The Albert Dock is {{a complex}} of <b>dock</b> {{buildings}} and <b>warehouses</b> located {{to the south of}} the Pier Head. Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick and opened in 1846, the Albert <b>Dock</b> <b>warehouses</b> were the first in the world to be entirely fireproof, due to their construction from only iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. The dock was home to many advances in docking technology including being the first to have hydraulic cranes. During World War II the buildings suffered significant damage and <b>general</b> <b>docking</b> decline in the city {{after the end of the}} war saw them fall rapidly into disrepair. In the 1980s the area underwent massive regeneration after the creation of the Merseyside Development Corporation and the complex was reopened to the public in 1984, as part of the tall ships festival. Today they form a focal point for tourism in the city, being home to Tate Liverpool, Merseyside Maritime Museum and The Beatles Story. They also constitute the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK.|$|R

50|$|Seattle in {{the early}} 1900s, with its long {{waterfront}} of wooden <b>docks,</b> <b>warehouses</b> and merchant vessels, was an enormous responsibility for Seattle's fire department.

25|$|The {{area where}} Hart Plaza stands today is {{believed}} to be where Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac landed in 1701. The waterfront area became the main source of communication and transportation to the outside world until the inventions of the railroad and telegraph. By the mid 19th century this area was covered by <b>docks,</b> <b>warehouses,</b> and other industry, as was most of Detroit's waterfront of the time.|$|R
5000|$|On April of {{that same}} year a {{permission}} was granted {{by the government to}} start the construction of a <b>dock,</b> <b>warehouses</b> and commerce related buildings. On December 1857, it was determined that a town needed to be built so 25 blocks, that used to belong to the Conchali Hacienda, were designed and sold by Hernán Jequier as a public utility. The town was located around the small pre-existing settlement.|$|R
50|$|The docks {{are central}} to Liverpool's history, with the best-known being Albert Dock. Designed by Jesse Hartley and {{constructed}} in cast iron, brick and stone, it provides the first enclosed, non-combustible <b>dock</b> <b>warehouse</b> system in the world. Restored in the 1980s, the Albert Dock has the largest collection of Grade I listed buildings in Britain. Part of the old dock complex is now the home to the Merseyside Maritime Museum (an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage), the International Slavery Museum and the Tate Liverpool. Other relics of the dock system include the Stanley <b>Dock</b> Tobacco <b>Warehouse,</b> {{which at the time}} of its construction in 1901, was the world's largest building in terms of area, and is still the world's largest brick-work building.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, Trumansburg had a port at Frontenac Point, at {{the mouth}} of the Trumansburg Creek on Cayuga Lake. The lake is {{connected}} at its north end to the Erie Canal via the Cayuga-Seneca Canal. The <b>docks,</b> <b>warehouses</b> and hotels that made up the port have long since been torn down or have burned. Only scattered pilings remain, and the site is now a camp owned by the local Boy Scout council.|$|R

50|$|In {{locations}} {{with moderate}} humidity {{there are many}} cost-effective uses for evaporative cooling, {{in addition to their}} widespread use in dry climates. For example, industrial plants, commercial kitchens, laundries, dry cleaners, greenhouses, spot cooling (loading <b>docks,</b> <b>warehouses,</b> factories, construction sites, athletic events, workshops, garages, and kennels) and confinement farming (poultry ranches, hog, and dairy) often employ evaporative cooling. In highly humid climates, evaporative cooling may have little thermal comfort benefit beyond the increased ventilation and air movement it provides.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this project {{is to use a}} genetic {{algorithm}} to allocate different product to a cross <b>dock</b> and <b>warehouse</b> of a distribution center. In spite of the enormous quantity of researches on product allocation to distribution center, allocating different products to cross <b>dock</b> and <b>warehouse</b> is less investigated. In order to fill this gap, this research was conducted analytically using a genetic algorithm to allocate different products to a distribution center. Particularly, one distribution center (located in the South East of Asia) along with 19 products were used as the case of this study. Based on the available literature, the existing constraints were evaluated and used for the aim of ranking different products based on their importance level. Finally, a genetic algorithm were used to allocate the different product to both cross dock and ware house considering the processing cost, demand, capacity and related constraints and determine the best combination of cross <b>docking</b> and <b>warehouse</b> to minimize processing cost as much as possible. The results showed that processing cost of products allocation to cross <b>docking</b> and <b>warehouse</b> can be improved through using genetic algorithm by $ 215 compared to Li et al. (2008) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} have a point of supply from the Gulf of Mexico, Victoria took control of the Boquilla de Piedras, a port located between Tuxpan and the port of Veracruz. This port was fitted with <b>docks,</b> <b>warehouses</b> and {{batteries}} for its defense and remained under the control of Victoria until November 1816, when it was recovered by the royalist army. Shortly after, Naolinco became the headquarters of the insurgents, and from there they controlled the area of Misantla, Puente Nacional and Huatusco.|$|R

50|$|In 1964 Hughes {{published}} Seaport: Architecture & Townscape in Liverpool, {{in which}} he stressed {{the significance of the}} Victorian and Edwardian architectural inheritance of the city. Much of the city centre was saved because of his activities, which in particular helped preserve the Albert <b>Dock</b> <b>Warehouses</b> and the Oriel Chambers. The book was highly influential in starting a national trend opposing the architectural Brutalism of the 1960s. In 1967 he also wrote a detailed policy for the conservation of Liverpool's architecture which was adopted by the City Council.|$|R

Atlantic Wharf grew to include housing, new businesses, hotels and the conversion of three large derelict <b>dock</b> <b>warehouses</b> in the close vicinity of Bute East Dock. In 1988 the County Council built a new council headquarters building at Atlantic Wharf to reinforce the regeneration initiatives.

Large horse-drawn wagons carried freight, but along with environmental risks and delays, there were additional significant charges for carriage within the city and for unloading by stevedores, so cartage was also not ideal to get finished cloth to the <b>dock</b> <b>warehouses</b> [...] therein the canal boats had the edge, for they delivered directly without extra charges. These sufficed for some time, but as Lowell grew and more industrialists built mills there, problems with both modes soon motivated them to learn more of the newfangled railways {{that had been in}} the European news increasingly since 1820.|$|R
