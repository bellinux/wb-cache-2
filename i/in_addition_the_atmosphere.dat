In this article, we {{investigate}} the combined effects of viscosity and Ohmic elec-trical conductivity on upward and downward propagation oblique Alfvén waves in an isothermal atmosphere. It is {{shown that the}} presence {{and direction of the}} magnetic field {{play an important role in}} the structure and the heating mechanism of solar atmosphere. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> can be divided into two distinct regions connected by a tran-sition region. In the lower region, the solution can be written as a linear combination of an upward and a downward propagation wave with unequal wavelengths. In the upper region, the solution decays exponentially with the altitude. Moreover, the magnetic field creates a reflecting and a non-absorbing transition region. On the contrary, the viscosity and Ohmic electrical conductivity produce a reflecting and an absorbing transition region. The nature of the transition region depends on the relative strength of the viscous diffusivity with respect to the resistive diffusivity and on the direction of the magnetic field. A unique solution is determined. The reflection coefficient and damping factors are derived and the conclusions are discussed in connection with the nature of the heating mechanism of the solar atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|In Finland, polytechnics {{were formed}} during the 1990 s by merging {{educational}} institutes of college level and higher vocational level. Currently, over 100 000 undergraduate students study in polytechnics. The main responsibilities of polytechnics are {{in education and}} developing working life. The agreed aim of the polytechnics is to instruct and operate {{in ways that are}} more practice-oriented those of universities. The basic idea underlying the framework of the present study is to examine the factors leading to success from a perspective of innovations in the educational field of technology and transport. The characteristics of a learning community are examined from the perspective of an individual degree program, as well as the regional effects of an individual polytechnic, and on a more general level {{from the point of view}} of all learning communities providing engineering education. In this study material was obtained from the Ministry of Education consisting of the license applications of the polytechnics and their agreements on objectives and results. Thematic interviews and written questionnaires were used to collect the views of different interest groups from the polytechnics. The Delphi method was used to gather opinions from the co-operation partners outside the learning community. The results of the present study show that the obvious aim of the license applications was to ensure meeting the approval criteria of the evaluation committee, and to obtain a license for permanent operation as quickly as possible. The innovative nature of a learning community was not notably emphasized in this process. Innovation-oriented thinking can be seen emerging closer to the end of the 1990 s. It is clearly identifiable in the latest agreements on objectives and results (1999), in which it has been presented by several polytechnics. For instance, the polytechnics have committed themselves to instructing in an innovative way and to developing their management policies towards the models of expert organizations, clear vision, and rapid decision making. According to the engineering educators of the learning communities, the factors most significantly facilitating innovations are good atmosphere and high working motivation. Other important factors include open, flexible, and swift actions and the courage to experiment. Special emphasis was placed also on the ability to co-operate with business life and other partners. An innovative community was perceived as having a clear mission and vision, as well as continuous interactive co-operation with business life. According to co-operation partners, an innovative community reacts rapidly, is adaptable and able to yield its know-how and latest information for the use of its partners at the right moment. The customers are heard and the policy of functions is open and straightforward. Innovations and entrepreneurship are appreciated and studied. As a simplified model of a learning community that implements its service innovations I will yet present the MCRO –model. The four main characteristics of an innovative learning community are the following: Management (M), Customer orientation (C), Rapidity (R), and Organization (O). Management should be organized in a postmodern manner; Customers should be heard and taken into partnership; Actions should be rapid and flexible; Hypertext organizational principles should be applied. Meta concept over all four would be general skills and knowledge. To summarize, the profile of an innovative learning community comprises a clear vision, a realistic and well-communicated strategy, and goal-oriented operations. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the community is not bureaucratic but allows free actions; the policy of functions is open, flexible, brave, unprejudiced, and all the members are respected. The organization and the management culture are postmodern.

40|$|Changes in {{the annual}} {{variation}} of the Earth's polar motion {{are found to be}} largely caused by the variation of the atmospheric angular momentum (AAM). Recent simulation results of oceanic general circulation models further suggest global oceanic effects on the annual polar motion <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>In</b> comparison with previous model studies of global oceanic effects, this research particularly singles out a large-scale ocean anomaly and investigates its effect on the annual polar motion, determined from satellite observations of the movement of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP). Although the scale of the warm pool is much smaller than that of the solid Earth, analysis of the non-atmospheric polar motion excitation has shown that the WPWP contributes non-negligibly to the annual polar motion. The analysis consists of over 30 years of WPWP data (1970 - 2000) and shows values of polar motion excitation for the x-component of (2. 5 mas, - 79 °) and for the y-component of (0. 6 mas, 173 °). Comparison of this result with the total geodetic non-atmosphèric polar motion excitation of (10. 3 mas, 59 °) for the x-component and (10. 6 mas, 62 °) for the y-component shows the significance of the WPWP.

Remote cloud observations also provide data sets useful for testing and improving cloud model physics, and for assimilation into numerical weather prediction models.

An evaluation of the dust aerosol scheme of CNRM-RCSM 5 has been performed against in-situ and satellite measurements. This scheme shows its ability to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region in summer 2012. Observations from the TRAQA/ChArMEx campaign also show that the model correctly represents dust vertical and size distributions. Thus CNRM-RCSM 5 can be used for aerosol–climate studies over the Mediterranean. Here we focus on the effects of dust particles on surface temperature and radiation daily variability. Surface shortwave aerosol radiative forcing variability is found to be more than twice higher over regions affected by dust aerosols, when using a prognostic aerosol scheme instead of a monthly climatology. In this case downward surface solar radiation is also found to be better reproduced according to a comparison with several stations across the Mediterranean. Moreover, the radiative forcing due to the dust outbreaks also causes an extra cooling in land and sea surface temperatures. A composite study has been carried out for 14 stations across the Mediterranean to identify more precisely the differences between dusty days and the set of all the days. Observations show that dusty days receive less radiation at the surface and are warmer than average because of southwesterly fluxes often generating dust outbreaks. Only the simulation using the prognostic aerosol scheme is found to reproduce the observed intensity of the dimming and warming on dusty days. Otherwise, the dimming is underestimated and the warming overestimated. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{radiative}} effects of dust aerosols in the Mediterranean region during summer 2012 using a coupled regional aerosol-atmosphere-ocean model (CNRM-RCSM 5). A prognostic aerosol scheme, including desert dust, sea salt, organic, black-carbon and sulphate particles, has been integrated to CNRM-RCSM 5 <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> land surface and ocean components. An evaluation of this aerosol scheme of CNRM-RCSM 5, and {{especially of the}} dust aerosols, has been performed against in situ and satellite measurements, showing its ability to reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Mediterranean region in summer 2012. The dust vertical and size distributions have also been evaluated against observations from the TRAQA/ChArMEx campaign. Three simulations {{have been carried out}} for summer 2012 with CNRM-RCSM 5, including the full prognostic aerosol scheme, only monthly-averaged AOD means from the aerosol scheme or no aerosols at all, in order to focus on the radiative effects of dust particles {{and the role of the}} prognostic scheme. Surface short-wave aerosol radiative forcing variability is found to be more than twice as high over regions affected by dust aerosols, when using a prognostic aerosol scheme instead of monthly AOD means. In this case downward surface solar radiation is also found to be better reproduced according to a comparison with several stations across the Mediterranean. A composite study over 14 stations across the Mediterranean, designed to identify days with high dust AOD, also reveals the improvement of the representation of surface temperature brought by the use of the prognostic aerosol scheme. Indeed the surface receives less radiation during dusty days, but only the simulation using the prognostic aerosol scheme is found to reproduce the observed intensity of the dimming and warming on dusty days. Moreover, the radiation and temperature averages over summer 2012 are also modified by the use of prognostic aerosols, mainly because of the differences brought in short-wave aerosol radiative forcing variability. Therefore this first comparison over summer 2012 highlights the importance of the choice of the representation of aerosols in climate models. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of PEM Tropics B was {{to study the}} processes responsible for the production and loss of tropospheric ozone over the tropical Pacific. This region of the globe contains very clean air as well as aged, polluted air that was advected from both the Asian and American continents. Understanding ozone requires understanding of HO(x) (HO(x) = OH + HO 2) chemistry, since the reaction between H 02 and NO leads to ozone production {{and the production of}} OH often requires ozone loss. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> OH is <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere's</b> primary oxidant. Since most atmospheric oxidation is thought to occur in the tropical lower troposphere, measurements during PEM Tropics B should provide an important test of the OH abundances and distributions. Thus, understanding and thoroughly testing HO(x) processes was an important objective of PEM Tropics B. Several issues need to be tested, One is HO, production rates and sources, since HO,, production directly affects ozone production and loss. Another is HO(x) behavior in and around clouds, since HO(x) is lost to cloud particles, but convection may bring HO(x) precursors from near the surface to the upper troposphere. A third is {{the rise and fall of}} HO(x) at sunrise and sunset, since these variations give strong indications of the important sources and sinks of HO(x). Making and interpreting high-quality OH and H 02 measurements from the NASA DC- 8 during PEM Tropics B is the objective of this research effort...|$|R

The water in <b>the</b> current martian <b>atmosphere</b> contains [ [...] . ] 5 times more deuterium (D) than water on Earth (corresponding to a [ [...] . ] value of [ [...] . ] + 4000) resulting from preferential loss of hydrogen relative to deuterium from <b>the</b> martian <b>atmosphere.</b> This thesis places {{constraints on the}} D/H of other martian water reservoirs by measuring the D/H of water in hydrous phases within the SNC meteorites, thought to be samples of martian igneous rocks. Results from vacuum extractions of volatiles from bulk SNC samples by stepwise heating show the water yields to decrease and [ [...] . ] values to increase to well above terrestrial values with increasing temperature, indicative of mixing between terrestrial water (contamination) released at low temperatures and martian water released at high temperatures. The high temperature [ [...] . ] values reach [ [...] . ] + 2000 for Shergotty, the most Denriched sample. However, even the highest [ [...] . ] values measured may represent lower limits on the true values due to partial exchange with lighter terrestrial water. D/H and water contents of individual amphibole, biotite and apatite grains in several SNC meteorites were measured using an ion microprobe. The amphiboles contain {{an order of magnitude}} less water than previously assumed, suggesting that SNC parent magmas may have been less hydrous than previously proposed. The [ [...] . ] values of the phases range from [ [...] . ]. The variability and D-enriched nature of these values imply that the primary igneous phases have not retained a martian magmatic water signature. Rather, the high and variable D/H of the water in these phases, like that released at high temperatures from bulk SNC samples, is concluded to result from the interaction of the samples with D-enriched martian crustal fluids after crystallization, probably in an environment similar to terrestrial magmatic hydrothermal systems. The data presented in this thesis represent the first direct evidence for ubiquitous crustal water-igneous rock interaction on another planet. Moreover, the results imply that a large amount of water must have been lost from the martian system since water in <b>the</b> martian crust, <b>in</b> <b>addition</b> to <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> appears to reflect D-enrichment processes. ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that <b>the</b> lower <b>atmosphere</b> has been warming at an unprecedented rate during the last 50 years, and {{it is expected to}} further increase at least for the next 100 years. Warmer air mass implies a higher capacity to hold water vapor and an increased likelihood of an acceleration of the global water cycle. This acceleration is not validated and considerable new research has gone into understanding aspects of the water cycle (e. g. Miller et al. 2003). Several significant findings on the hydrologic response to climate change can be reported. It is well understood that the observed and expected warming is related to sea level rise. In a recent seminar at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, James Hansen (Director of the Institute for Space Studies, National Aeronautics and Space Administration) stressed that a 1. 25 Wm{sup - 2 } increase in radiative forcing will lead to an increase in the near surface air temperature by 1 C. This small increase in temperature from 2000 levels is enough to cause very significant impacts to coasts. Maury Roos (Chief Hydrologist, California Department of Water Resources) has shown that a 0. 3 m rise in sea level shifts the San Francisco Bay 100 -year storm surge flood event to a 10 -year event. Related coastal protection costs for California based on sea level rise are shown. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> to rising sea level, snowmelt-related streamflow represents a particular problem in California. Model studies have indicated that there will be approximately a 50 % decrease in snow pack by 2100. This potential deficit must be fully recognized and plans need to be put in place well <b>in</b> advance. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> warmer <b>atmosphere</b> can hold more water vapor and result in more intense warm winter-time precipitation events that result in flooding. During anticipated high flow, reservoirs need to release water to maintain their structural integrity. California is at risk of water shortages, floods, and related ecosystem stresses. More research {{needs to be done to}} further improve our ability to forecast weather events at longer time scales. Seasonal predictions have been statistical and only recently have studies begun to use ensemble simulations and historical observations to constrain such predictions. Understanding the mechanisms of large-scale atmospheric dynamics and its local impacts remain topics of intensive research. The ability to predict extreme events and provide policy makers with this information, along with climate change and hydrologic response information, will help to guide planning to form a more resilient infrastructure in the future...|$|R
40|$|Z wyborów organizowanych w czasach PRL na uwagę zasługują przede wszystkim te z 1957 roku. Przeprowadzono je w okresie popaździernikowej odwilży, a władze nie miały specjalnych powodów, by je fałszować. Liberalna atmosfera sprzyjała wyborczej konkurencji, a oficjalne wyniki wyborów uwidoczniły znaczące zróżnicowanie polskiego społeczeństwa w ujęciu przestrzennym. When {{comparing}} the spatial differentiation of results of elections from the inter-war period (1918 – 1939) and the post-communist period (1989 – 2015), one sees {{a very clear}} similarity between the two (Kowalski, 2014). In the north-western {{part of the country}} the electoral preferences are with the left or the liberals, while in the south-eastern part – with the right. Given the persistence of this spatial setting, a supposition arises that the spatial differentiation of the political attitudes existed also during the times of the socialist People’s Poland. Lack of political freedom and electoral falsifications, performed by the communists, make the verification of this proposition quite difficult. Of the elections, organised in the socialist period, it is the ones, carried out in 1957, that deserve consideration, first of all. These elections were carried out in the short period of liberalisation after 1956, in conditions of an enthusiastic support for the new governing administration. The organisers of the elections could be fairly certain as to the outcome. That is why, {{side by side with the}} candidates, who were closely connected with the ruling establishment, also more independent persons, frequently enjoying high popularity in the society, were allowed to stand as candidates in these elections. In order to guarantee the victorious outcome, the authorities allowed for the formation of just a single list of candidates. The authorities lanced the appeal to vote for the candidates from the first places on the list, since it was on these places that the persons most convenient from the point of view of the establishment were listed. The few independent candidates were located at far-off positions. There was also an appeal for the possibly highest turnout at the elections, since this would constitute a signal of support for the new administration. These appeals were also shared by the Catholic Church in Poland. Despite the limitations and constraints mentioned, <b>the</b> relatively liberal <b>atmosphere</b> was conducive to the electoral competition within the framework of the candidate lists approved. This was yet enhanced by the fact that candidates represented, formally at least, various political organisms (communists, peasant activists, democratic party, non-aligned candidates) and communities, and, as indicated, the lists also included, even though on far-off places, persons of independent orientations. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> liberal <b>atmosphere</b> and <b>the</b> conviction of the ruling group that they must win, limited, it appears, the electoral falsifications to the minimum. Owing to <b>the</b> advantageous social <b>atmosphere</b> and <b>the</b> appropriate construction of the lists of candidates, the communists could not lose these elections. Yet, in spite of this, the official results of the elections made visible the significant differentiation of the Polish society, both in global terms, and in space. The latter aspect represented a clear similarity to the spatial differentiation of the results of elections, taking place in other time periods, both the earlier ones (the interwar period) and those carried out later (after 1989) ...|$|R
