40|$|Voro++ {{is a free}} {{software}} library for the computation of three dimensional Voronoi cells. It is primarily designed for applications in physics and materials science, where the Voronoi tessellation can be a useful tool {{in the analysis of}} densely-packed particle systems, such as granular materials or glasses. The software comprises of several C++ classes that can be modified and incorporated <b>into</b> other programs. <b>A</b> <b>command-line</b> utility is also provided that can use most features of the code. Voro++ makes use of a direct cell-by-cell construction, which is particularly suited to handling special boundary conditions and walls. It employs algorithms which are tolerant for numerical precision errors, and it has been successfully employed on very large particle systems...|$|R
40|$|The Literate Programming Extraction Engine is a Practical Extraction and Reporting Language- (PERL-) based {{computer}} program that facilitates and simplifies {{the implementation of}} a concept of self-documented literate programming in a fashion tailored to the typical needs of scientists. The advantage for the programmer is that documentation and source code are written side-by-side in the same file, reducing the likelihood that the documentation will be inconsistent with the code and improving the verification that the code performs its intended functions. The advantage for the user is the knowledge that the documentation matches the software because they come from the same file. This program unifies the documentation process for a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, and several versions of FORTRAN. This program can process the documentation in any markup language, and incorporates the LaTeX typesetting software. The program includes sample Makefile scripts for automating both the code-compilation (when appropriate) and documentation-generation processes <b>into</b> <b>a</b> single <b>command-line</b> statement. Also included are macro instructions for the Emacs display-editor software, making it easy for a programmer to toggle between editing in a code or a documentation mode...|$|R
5000|$|Slackware {{aims for}} design {{stability}} and simplicity {{and to be}} the most [...] "Unix-like" [...] Linux distribution. It makes as few modifications as possible to software packages from upstream and tries not to anticipate use cases or preclude user decisions. In contrast to most modern Linux distributions, Slackware provides no graphical installation procedure and no automatic dependency resolution of software packages. It uses plain text files and only a small set of shell scripts for configuration and administration. Without further modification it boots <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>command-line</b> interface environment. Because of its many conservative and simplistic features, Slackware is often considered to be most suitable for advanced and technically inclined Linux users.|$|E
