30|$|Recently, Hohng and Ha {{reported}} a blinking suppression in solutions of quantum dots [73]. When the individual streptavidin-coated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots were exposed in solution to β-mercaptoethanol, their blinking essentially disappeared and constant radiative emission was observed. The authors determined that only thiol-containing species with short chain lengths {{were able to}} suppress <b>the</b> quantum dot <b>blinking.</b> Since thiols are effective electron donors, the authors argued that these ligands donate electrons to fill surface traps. This deactivates <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> mechanism, and leads to a more constant emission. Tinnefeld and co-workers soon after reported similar blinking suppression using mercaptoethylamine but interpreted their observations as a dramatic increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> kinetics [77]. <b>In</b> other words, <b>the</b> presence of the ligands perturbed {{the dynamics of the}} exciton.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Investigate <b>the</b> average <b>blinking</b> time <b>in</b> {{conversation}} and in Video Display Terminal use {{of young adults}} and adults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presbyopic age group. METHODS: A transversal analytical study in a readily accessible sample consisting of Volkswagen do Brasil - Curitiba, Paraná employees was performed. The cohort group consisted of 108 subjects divided into two age groups: Group 1, the young adult group (age range 20 - 39) : 77 employees, mean age of 30. 09 ± 5. 09; Group 2, the presbyopic adult group, (age range 40 - 53) : 31 employees, mean age of 44. 17 ± 3. Subjects under 18 years of age, {{with a history of}} ocular disorders, contact lens wearers and computer non-users were excluded. The subjects had their faces filmed for 10 minutes in {{conversation and}} VDT reading. Student's t-test was used and the statistical significance level was 95 %. RESULTS: The average time between blinks in Group 1 for conversation and VDT reading was 5. 16 ± 1. 83 and 10. 42 ± 7. 78 seconds, respectively; in Group 2. 4, 9 ± 1. 49 and 10. 46 ± 5. 54 seconds. In both age groups, <b>the</b> time between <b>blinks</b> <b>in</b> VDT reading situations was higher (p 0. 05). CONCLUSION: There was an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> time between young adults and <b>the</b> presbyopic group <b>in</b> VDT use situations when compared with reading situations. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blinking</b> frequency between young adults and <b>the</b> presbyopic group <b>in</b> VDT use and reading situations was not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|ON-OFF intermittency or {{blinking}} is {{a phenomenon}} observed in single quantum emitters, which reduces their overall light emission.

If the braid is pA, then the homeomorphism must have an infinitely many number of pe-riodic orbits of distinct periods. This kind of complexity induced by the pA braid is called “topological chaos”, which was introduced by Boyland et. al [4] recently.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used HFS conditioning of the supraorbital nerve to study homeostatic metaplasticity of <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> reflex circuit <b>in</b> healthy subjects and dystonic patients. On separate days, we tested the conditioning effects on the R 2 response and paired-pulse R 2 inhibition after (i) HFS(LTP), (ii) HFS(LTP) followed by HFS(LTP), and (iii) HFS(LTP) followed by HFS(LTD). Controls also received (iv) HFS(LTD) alone and (v) a non-intervention protocol. In BEB patients, HFS(LTP) followed by HFS(LTD) was given before and after BTX treatment. We were not able to replicate the bidirectional timing-dependent effects of HFS(LTP) and HFS(LTD) alone. All HFS protocols produced a non-specific reduction of the R 2 response and a relative decrease in paired-pulse inhibition. These R 2 changes also occurred in controls when no HFS was applied. There was also no trace of a homeostatic response pattern in BEB patients before or after BTX treatment. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data challenge the efficacy of associative HFS to produce bidirectional plasticity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human <b>blink</b> reflex circuit. <b>The</b> non-specific decrease of the R 2 response might indicate habituation of <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> reflex following repeated electrical supraorbital stimulation.
