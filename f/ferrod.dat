50|$|Marquis <b>Ferrod</b> Jackson (born January 11, 1990) is a Canadian {{football}} {{defensive lineman}} for the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He played college football at Portland State. Jackson {{signed with the}} Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} received {{input from}} peripherals via magnetic scanners, composed of <b>ferrod</b> sensors, similar {{in principle to}} magnetic core memory except that the output was controlled by control windings analogous to the windings of a relay. Specifically, the <b>ferrod</b> was a transformer with four windings. Two small windings ran through holes {{in the center of}} a rod of ferrite. A pulse on the Interrogate winding was induced into the Readout winding, if the ferrite was not magnetically saturated. The larger control windings, if current was flowing through them, saturated the magnetic material, hence decoupling the Interrogate winding from the Readout winding which would return a Zero signal. The Interrogate windings of 16 ferrods of a row were wired in series to a driver, and the Readout windings of 64 ferrods of a column were wired to a sense amp. Check circuits ensured that an Interrogate current was indeed flowing.|$|E
50|$|In modern radios, a ferrite {{loop antenna}} is used, {{consisting}} of fine wire wound on a ferrite rod. Litz wire {{is often used}} to reduce skin effect losses. The ferrite rod increases the magnetic permeability, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Other names for this type of antenna are loopstick antenna, ferrite rod antenna, ferrite rod aerial, Ferroceptor, or <b>ferrod</b> antenna.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferrods</b> were {{mounted in}} pairs, usually with {{different}} control windings, so one could supervise a switchward {{side of a}} trunk and the other the distant office. Components inside the trunk pack, including diodes, determined for example, whether it performed reverse battery signaling as an incoming trunk, or detected reverse battery from a distant trunk; i.e. was an outgoing trunk.|$|R
50|$|The {{much smaller}} Remreed crosspoints, {{introduced}} {{at about the}} same time as 1AESS, were packaged as grid boxes of four principal types. Type 10A Junctor Grids and 11A Trunk Grids were a box about 16x16x5 inches (40x40x12 cm) with sixteen 8x8 switches inside. Type 12A Line Grids with 2:1 LCR were only about 5 inches (12 cm) wide, with eight 4x4 Stage 0 line switches with <b>ferrods</b> and cutoff contacts for 32 lines, connected internally to four 4x8 Stage 1 switches connecting to B-links. Type 14A Line Grids with 4:1 LCR were about 16x12x5 inches (40x30x12 cm) with 64 lines, 32 A-links and 16 B-links. The boxes were connected to the rest of the fabric and control circuitry by slide-in connectors. Thus the worker had to handle a much bigger, heavier piece of equipment, but didn't have to unwrap and rewrap dozens of wires.|$|R
5000|$|At first Mrs. Franzoni pointed {{her finger}} against {{a young couple}} of friends, whose baby {{daughter}} had recently died after a premature birth; Franzoni alleged that the woman had told her [...] "You should face the death of your son as well," [...] the evening before the murder. Later, Franzoni changed her mind and accused the neighbor that first ran to help her and Samuele {{on the morning of}} January 30, Mrs. Daniela <b>Ferrod.</b> She said that Mrs. <b>Ferrod</b> was [...] "as evil as a witch" [...] and [...] "jealous of my family and my happiness", suggesting that Mrs. <b>Ferrod</b> used to [...] "spy" [...] her and that probably she killed Samuele as an act of revenge, motivated by jealousy and envy. Later Mrs Franzoni changed version again and, during summer 2004, with her husband and her lawyer (Carlo Taormina, {{a former member of the}} Italian Chamber of Deputies) filed a lawsuit against another neighbor, a 35-year-old bachelor called Ulisse Guichardaz, who was also Mrs. Daniela Ferrod's brother-in-law. Mr. and Mrs. Franzoni-Lorenzi heavily slandered Mr. Guichardaz, describing him as a sexual maniac and arguing that Mrs. Franzoni was terrified of him. This man had an alibi. Lawyer Taormina contradicted himself several times about the identity and possible motives of the murderer. Firstly, the prominent lawyer argued that the crime was dictated by [...] "a sort of revenge against the victim's mother" [...] and that the motive was of [...] "sexual nature", but later he claimed that the murderer was a voyeur who sneaked into Mrs Franzoni's house to rape her. Lawyer Taormina stated several times that he knew the name of the murderer and he was willing to reveal it, something that never happened.|$|E
50|$|Line ferrods {{were also}} {{provided}} in pairs, {{of which the}} even numbered one had contacts brought out {{to the front of}} the package in lugs suitable for wire wrap so the windings could be strapped for loop start or ground start signaling. The original 1ESS packaging had all the ferrods of an LSF together, and separate from the line switches, while the later 1AESS had each <b>ferrod</b> at the front of the steel box containing its line switch. Odd numbered line equipment could not be made ground start, their ferrods being inaccessible.|$|E
5000|$|Other names include loopstick antenna, <b>ferrod,</b> and ferrite-rod antenna. [...] "Ferroceptor" [...] is {{an older}} {{alternative}} {{name for a}} ferrite rod aerial, particularly used by Philips where the ferrite core would be called a [...] "Ferroxcube" [...] rod (a brand name acquired by Yageo from Philips in the year 2000). The short terms ferrite rod or ‘loop-stick’ sometimes refers to the coil-plus-ferrite combination that {{takes the place of}} both an external antenna and the radio’s first tuned circuit, or just the ferrite core itself (the cylindrical rod or flat ferrite slab).|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after, {{neighbor}} psychiatrist Ada Satragni {{arrived on}} the scene. The doctor believed Franzoni that the child's skull would have [...] "exploded", stating that a cerebral aneurysm may actually increase the intracranial pressure, causing the explosion of bones. A few days later, Dr. Satragni released an interview in which she proposed that perhaps Samuele, aware of being home alone, had desperately burst in tears and that [...] "The violent crying might have caused {{the opening of the}} head." [...] At the time, Dr. Satragni devoted herself to wash the dying child and then carried him out, in front of the house, despite the cold weather and without any caution to protect his head or neck. Another neighbor, Mrs. Daniela <b>Ferrod,</b> noticed that, for the entire time, Mrs. Franzoni remained motionless and silent, without saying anything or even trying to touch her son. Upon arrival of the helicopter that would carry Samuele to the ER, neither Mrs Franzoni nor her husband (Stefano Lorenzi, surveyor, 31 years), who had been informed of the tragedy by phone, followed their child.|$|E
