Most of the above package is a progradational deltaic sequence that could be subdivided into three units, corresponding to three phases of delta evolution (Fig.  1). The dominant direction of progradation is toward the west-southwest and is expressed as sigmoid lineaments (clinoforms) in the dip section (Tigrek 1988). Unit 2, containing a conspicuous clinoform package, {{was chosen as the}} target zone for gas accumulation, and forms the delta <b>fore</b> <b>set</b> with a coarsening upward sequence. Its age is estimated as Early Pliocene. The coarse sediments are attributed to a regression caused by the Neogene uplift of Scandinavia in the Pliocene (Gregersen 1997).|$|R

5000|$|Reviewing the work's North American {{premiere in}} Chicago, Michael Cameron of the Michael Cameron praised Dialogues, writing, [...] "A {{conflict}} was established between the percussive piano and the winds and strings, with {{their ability to}} emerge imperceptibly from silence. Indeed, silence versus sound, and its variant, long versus short, seemed {{to be one of}} Carter's many constructed dualities." [...] He added, [...] "The composer has remained true to his atonal language over the years, but here, and in other recent works, an added clarity of purpose has come to the <b>fore,</b> <b>setting</b> his multiple dialogues in a more transparent light." [...] Anne Midgette of The New York Times compared the piece favorably to Carter's Three Illusions for Orchestra, writing, [...] "Dialogues for piano and orchestra, from 2003, is a tougher piece of episodic exchanges between soloist and orchestra in which, as in a real dialogue, communication is imperfect and sometimes one-sided." [...] K. Smith of Gramophone also lauded the piece, remarking: At first glance, Dialogues (2003) would seem to be in the old Carter model, where different musical lines unfold with such clearly delineated personalities that they’re often compared to characters in a play. Carter describes the piece as a conversation between piano and orchestra, but the lively discourse continues with little of his former abrasiveness. This is civilised cocktail chatter rather than a raucous town meeting, with musical points respecting each other’s space rather than yelling each other down.|$|R
