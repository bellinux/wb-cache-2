5|$|Fleming {{was married}} to Ann Charteris, who was {{divorced}} from the second Viscount Rothermere because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar.

Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. Fleming's creation has appeared in film twenty-six times, portrayed by seven actors.|$|E

5|$|Studies suggest {{antiparasitic}} treatment {{leads to}} parasitological cure {{in more than}} 90% of infants but only about 60–85% of adults treated {{in the first year}} of acute phase Chagas disease. Children aged six to 12 years with chronic disease have a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole.

5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery.

5|$|John S. Clark {{was born}} on 21 March 1885 in Glasgow, Scotland, to parents James Souttar Clark, a coach-painter, and Maggie Clark (née Scott). At an early age, Clark had an {{interest}} in entomology throughout his years in Glasgow and adult life in Australia. Clark migrated to Australia in 1905 with little formal education but found himself working for the state railways in Queensland. There, he found an interest in ants and made his first collection of specimens in North Queensland. In May 1908, Clark married his first wife, Maggie Forbes, at the Cairns Presbyterian Church. After their marriage, they moved to Geraldton in Western Australia, where Clark worked for the railways as a wheelwright. He had one son and three daughters with Forbes; Forbes would later die from <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> 1935.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{consumption}} of hot chocolate can be positive to one's health. A study conducted by Cornell University {{has shown that}} hot chocolate contains more antioxidants than wine and tea, therefore reducing the risk of <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>In</b> a single serving of cocoa, the researchers found 611 milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and 564 milligrams of epicatechin equivalents (ECE), compared with 340 milligrams of GAE and 163 milligrams of ECE in red wine, and 165 milligrams of GAE and 47 milligrams of ECE in green tea. Chang Yong Lee, the professor and researcher at Cornell who conducted the study, revealed that larger amounts of antioxidants are released when the beverage is heated.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{married his}} first wife Marjorie Beattie in 1946. The {{constant}} travel, interstate and overseas, took a toll on his marriage and the pair divorced in 1950. In 1954, he married Lynda Kirchner from his native Bundaberg, {{with whom he had}} two daughters. In retirement, Tallon helped his younger brother Mat in running a corner store in Bundaberg. His nephew Ross played one match for Queensland Colts in 196768. The Tallon bridge, built in 1995 in Bundaberg was named after the famous Bundabergian which links west & north Bundaberg.

5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
5|$|After {{breaking}} from Gardner's Bricket Wood coven, Valiente formed her own coven with Grove as High Priest, {{still following}} {{the tradition of}} Gardnerian Wicca, albeit without the Wiccan laws, which she believed to be entirely an invention of Gardner's. This coven however failed to last, breaking up amid arguments between its founders. In 1956, Valiente, {{along with her husband}} and her mother, moved into a basement flat in Lewes Crescent, Kemptown, in the southern coastal town of Brighton, although in 1968 they moved into a flat nearer to the town centre. She befriended another Kemptown resident, the journalist Leslie Roberts, who shared her interest in the supernatural. He attracted much attention to himself in the local press through his claims that practitioners of black magic were also operating in the area. Valiente remained a good friend to Roberts until his death from <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> 1966. She also got back in touch with Gardner, and mended their friendship, remaining on good terms until his death in 1964, when he left her £200 in his will. During the early 1960s she also developed a correspondence with two Gardnerian initiates in Sheffield, Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther, finally meeting them when the latter couple visited Brighton in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} Women's Rights in the United States during the 1980s {{focused attention on}} the fact that many drugs being prescribed for women had never actually been tested in women of child-bearing potential, and that there was a relative paucity of basic research into women's health. In response to this the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) in 1990 to address these inequities. In 1993 the National Institutes of Health Revitalisation Act officially reversed US policy by requiring NIH funded phase III clinical trials to include women. This resulted in an increase in women recruited into research studies. The next phase was the specific funding of large scale epidemiology studies and clinical trials focussing on women's health such as the Women's Health Initiative (1991), the largest disease prevention study conducted in the US. Its role was to study the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women. Despite this apparent progress, women remain underepresented. In 2006 women accounted for less than 25% of clinical trials published in 2004, A follow up study by the same authors five years later found little evidence of improvement. Another study found between 10–47% of women in heart disease clinical trials, despite the prevalence of <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> <b>in</b> women. Lung cancer {{is the leading cause of}} cancer death amongst women, but while the number of women enrolled in lung cancer studies is increasing, they are still far less likely to be enrolled than men.|$|E
