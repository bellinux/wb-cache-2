5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
25|$|Many {{locomotives}} manufactured {{during the}} 1990s {{made use of}} pushbutton controls. In addition, several North American locomotives incorporated a sequencer pedal built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> floor beneath the operators position; that when depressed, sounded the grade crossing sequence.|$|E
25|$|In September 1951 Clapp {{resigned}} {{for health}} reasons but continued {{to act as a}} consultant to the Department of Shipping and Transport. On 14 July 1952 the first of the B class diesel electric locomotives, which were to revolutionise train operations in Victoria, was delivered to the VR and travelled from NSW to Melbourne's Spencer Street Station under its own power. The elderly Harold Clapp climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> of locomotive B 60 and sat at the controls, and was honoured by having the new locomotive named after him.|$|E

50|$|The {{reconfigurable}} {{analog signal}} processor (RASP {{and a second}} version were introduced in 2002 by Hall et al. Their design incorporated high-level elements such as second order bandpass filters and 4 by 4 vector matrix multipliers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>CABs.</b> Because of its architecture, it is limited to around 100 kHz and the chip itself {{is not able to}} support independent reconfiguration.|$|R
50|$|The body sides {{take the}} form of louvres to allow {{ventilation}} around the batteries, although most locomotives had four solid body panels on one side only. All body panels are hinged to allow the batteries to be removed. Following the withdrawal of steam engines, the vehicles often worked on open sections of line, rather than in tunnels, and the need to heat <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> in winter became apparent. Draught excluders have been added to all cab doors, and additional heaters have been fitted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cabs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The next day, {{early in}} the morning of July 30, a taxi brought from Tel Aviv, {{so as not to be}} recognized, arrived at the plant. Meanwhile Meller was looking for a route to move the bodies without risking arrest. After several hours such a route was found, and at 9:00 the order was given to move the bodies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The Irgun group {{concealed}} the bodies in bags and moved them out of the plant in broad daylight. They were seen doing this by workers at the neighboring plants.|$|E
25|$|It was Tur's live {{reports that}} led to Denny being rescued by local black civilian, Bobby Green Jr. of South Central Los Angeles. Green watched Denny's assault live on {{television}} and rushed to the scene. Upon arriving, he found Denny had climbed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> of his truck and was attempting to drive away, {{but was unable to}} go far because he was drifting in and out of consciousness. Green moved Denny out of the driver's seat and drove him to Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. Upon arriving at the hospital Denny went into a seizure.|$|E
500|$|On September 22, 1851, Minot was in {{a parked}} {{passenger}} train at Turner Station. He glanced {{out the window of}} the train and saw the new telegraph wires. Departing the train, Minot ran into the station, got on the new telegraph, and wired the next station along the line, Monroe, to see if the eastbound train to Piermont-on-Hudson had gone past. The station agent said no. At that point, Minot ordered the engineer of the train to proceed on their way to Goshen. The engineer refused to take Minot's order, and instead, Minot got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> car himself and drove the train himself to Port Jervis, hours ahead of the planned scheduled time of arrival. This was the second of the several [...] "firsts" [...] the Erie Railroad created in its time, along with the shipment of milk by rail at Chester station in 1842. The use of the telegraph and Minot's system remained until 1888, when a new system of block signaling, developed by the competitor Pennsylvania Railroad, helped expand Minot's use of telecommunications to control rail traffic.|$|E

500|$|McVeigh {{then added}} a dual-fuse {{ignition}} system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled twoholes {{in the cab}} of the truck under the seat, while twoholes were also drilled {{in the body of}} the truck. Onegreen cannon fuse was run through each hole <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around [...] of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the [...] of Tovex Blastrite Gel [...] "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about [...] of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the twomen separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh with the truck to Junction City.|$|E

A three-man IRA unit attacked the lorry with a grenade and fired over 30 shots <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, AMC was {{planning}} a compact coup√© utility (pickup) {{based on the}} Hornet {{to compete with the}} increasing sales of Japanese compact pickup models. A prototype called the Cowboy was developed under the leadership of Jim Alexander. The prototype vehicle featured a modified AMC Gremlin front design and a cargo box with a Jeep logo on the tailgate. The standard I6 engine would be more powerful than the 4-cylinders found in the imported pickups. The only surviving prototype was built using a 1971 Hornet SC360 with the 360 V8 and 4-speed manual transmission. It was used by AMC on their proving grounds for several years before being sold to an employee, who later installed a 1973 Hornet updated front end. However, with the increasing sales of the Hornet models, and the 1970 acquisition of Jeep and no 4WD option ready for the Cowboy (at the time ALL Jeeps were 4WD), AMC's product planners shelved the Cowboy truck program. A 4WD system was developed and later used on the 1980 AMC Eagle, and the [...] "uniframe" [...] construction ("frame" [...] rails under the truck bed made of folded sheet metal and incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> structure as one piece) resurfaced for the 1985 Jeep Comanche pickup, based on the unit body XJ Cherokee.|$|E
500|$|For ease of maintenance, the boiler, firebox and smokebox were {{encased in}} steel sheeting, {{which meant that}} the engine's shape resembled that of a modern diesel locomotive. That was a major {{departure}} from traditional steam locomotive design, allowing the engine to be cleaned using a carriage-washing plant. The locomotive was designed to carry 4 tons (4.06 tonnes) of coal and [...] of water, and the coal bunker was covered by a tarpaulin to prevent water ingress <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fireman's <b>cab.</b> Entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> locomotive was by way of ladders leading up to sliding doors, although, due to the bogie design, <b>the</b> climb <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fireman's <b>cab</b> necessitated clambering over the oilbath casing.|$|R
60|$|He {{had gone}} out in another moment, and, in a few more, climbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{locomotive}} <b>cab,</b> while somebody coupled on a calaboose in the rear. Then, he showed the engineer several bills and the agent's receipt together.|$|R

2500|$|The 1960 Stock trains ran {{mainly on}} the Hainault loop. Following limited trials on the District line {{of a system of}} Automatic Train Operation (ATO) in 1963, the lightly used Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line was used as a testing ground for full ATO in {{preparation}} for its use on the Victoria line. Five of the six 1960-stock trains were adapted at Acton Works. The side doors to the driver's cab were sealed, so that access was normally through the passenger saloon. Since the trains were to be operated by one person, the door controls were moved from the rear end of the motor car <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The train control equipment was fitted beneath the centre seats, and consisted of a [...] "black box", which interpreted signals received from the running rails. These were picked up by sensing coils mounted on the leading bogie. One rail supplied safety information, which was received continuously. Any failure to obtain this data resulted in a trip-valve operating, which stopped the train. The second rail supplied signal commands, which included speed signals and instructions to start and stop the train. This information was only provided when it was needed. The driver was renamed a train operator, and was responsible for opening and closing the doors at stations, and initiating a start from the stations, by pressing two buttons simultaneously. All other operation, including stopping at signals and restarting when safe to proceed was automatic. The first automatic train entered service on 5 April 1964. The automatic control equipment was temporarily mounted in the passenger saloon, between the cab and the first set of doors, to enable engineers to monitor and adjust it as experience was gained.|$|E
2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda‚Äôs Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a rear garnish that shields the rear glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. [...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E

50|$|Cab {{signalling}} is {{a system}} that communicates signalling information <b>into</b> <b>the</b> train <b>cab</b> (driving position). <b>The</b> simplest systems 'repeat' the trackside signal aspect, while more sophisticated systems also display the maximum permitted speed and dynamic information for the route ahead, based on the distance in front which is clear and the braking characteristics of the train. In modern systems, a train protection system is usually overlaid on top of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> signalling system and will automatically apply the brakes and bring the train to a stand if the driver fails to control the speed of the train in accordance with <b>the</b> system demands. <b>Cab</b> signalling systems range from simple coded track circuits, to transponders that communicate with <b>the</b> <b>cab,</b> and communication-based train control systems.|$|R
