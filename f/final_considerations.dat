50|$|After {{the appeal}} {{proceedings}} were closed, {{but before the}} judges delivered their verdict, the Public Prosecution Service received, via the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI), a report from a forensic laboratory in Strasbourg on the evidence for digoxin poisoning. The report subsequently lay in a drawer of the NFI for two years, but it did turn up {{in time for the}} final evaluation of the case before the Supreme Court. According to the Public Prosecution, the report contained no new facts, but according to De Berk's defence the report proved that there was not a lethal concentration of digoxin in the first case. The Supreme Court accepts the facts reported by the judges at the appeal court, and is concerned only with jurisprudence and correctness of the sentence, given those facts. The report therefore was not admitted into the <b>final</b> <b>considerations</b> of the sentence given to De Berk.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, Velden auditioned in Mexico City {{for a role}} in {{producer}} Pedro Damián's latest telenovela remake, Muchacha italiana viene a casarse.

In July of that same year, she was announced as one of the actors in the <b>final</b> <b>considerations</b> for a role in the telenovela. In August, Velden's participation in Muchacha italiana viene a casarse was officially confirmed. This is her debut role in a telenovela. Prior to production, she studied Italian for six months in order to more accurately portray her character. Filming began on August 25, 2014 where she and some of the cast traveled to Maratea, Italy and filmed scenes and promotional material for two weeks. Scenes for the finale were filmed in Maratea and Naples, Italy, where production was completed in mid-May 2015. The telenovela aired weekdays on Canal de las Estrellas, following its premiere on October 20, 2014. Its final episode aired on June 21, 2015 in Mexico.|$|E

50|$|Meetings {{were held}} between the 11-13 April, with {{the absence of}} Cardinal Gracias, for health reasons. Apart from the Wednesday morning session, which {{took place during the}} {{customary}} General Audience, Pope Francis himself participated in all of the meetings of the Council.In a press briefing on the meetings, Father Federico Lombardi, SJ, the Director of the Holy See Press Office, said Cardinals’ discussion focused largely on <b>final</b> <b>considerations</b> concerning the various Dicasteries of the Roman Curia, in view of a new Apostolic Constitution. In particular, the Cardinals re-read, and entrusted to the Holy Father, several texts relating to the proposal to create to new Dicasteries, dedicated to “Laity, Family, and Life” and to “Justice, Peace, and Migration.” Father Lombardi said the Cardinals also took up several other topics in particular, the Council considered criteria for gathering information for the nomination of new bishops, in light of their identity and pastoral mission. They also discussed the significance and role of Nuncios. Additionally, the Council heard from two of their own members. Cardinal George Pell updated his colleagues on the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, while Cardinal Sean O’Malley discussed the activities of the Pontifical Council for the Protection of Minors. The final day of the Council’s work, Father Lombardi said, was dedicated to organizing the results of the foregoing discussion, in order to craft a comprehensive proposal from the Council to the Pope, in view of a new Constitution for the Roman Curia.|$|E
5000|$|Two <b>final</b> <b>considerations</b> {{that are}} {{important}} to understanding the formative outcomes of al-Shabaab recruits include education level and age at the time of recruitment. Education provides a variety of tangible and intangible mitigating factors to one’s proclivity to radicalize. Botha writes, “in the first instance, a better-educated individual tends to participate more in conventional politics for the following reasons: Individuals that have been better educated feel that they can influence the political process more than a less educated person, especially considering that an educated person is also able to articulate opinions better. Secondly, the person is more aware of the impact of government on the individual. Having more information, this person is expected to have opinions on a wider range of political topics. Furthermore, the person is {{more likely to engage in}} political discussions with a wider range of people, while those with less education are more likely to report that there are many people with whom they avoid such discussions. Lastly, the more educated individual is also more likely to express confidence in the political process and is more likely to be an active member of a legitimate political organization.” According to Botha, among al-Shabaab respondents, 47 percent attended primary school, 45 percent secondary school and only 8 percent of respondents reported any education beyond secondary school. Furthermore, 56 percent of respondents left school between “15 and 19 years of age, followed by 33 percent who left school between 20-24 years of age.” Ultimately, Botha concludes that “it could then be argued that the defense against radicalization is not education per se, but rather the quality and type of education. While education is essential in ensuring a better future, students also need to learn from other disciplines, such as social sciences, history, and philosophy to equip them to be open to other opinions, to argue intellectually and to understand domestic and international realities.” ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>final</b> <b>consideration</b> in {{selecting}} a menstrual cup is firmness or flexibility. Some companies offer {{a range of}} firmness levels in their cups. A firmer cup pops open more easily after insertion and may hold a more consistent seal against the vaginal wall (preventing leaks), but many women find softer cups more comfortable.|$|R

5|$|The <b>final</b> <b>consideration</b> is cost: {{how much}} will a {{particular}} defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection outweigh the costs, specifically in situations where there is high herbivore pressure.|$|R
30|$|One <b>final</b> <b>consideration</b> is in {{relation}} to climate change. This {{is one of the}} greatest modern challenges which also directly affects our historical buildings and archaeological heritage [26 – 30]. Studies of the impacts of climate change on heritage are limited—those impacting a sheltered site are even less known. Studies should commence without delay to understand the possible long-term implications both exposed and covered sites, if their long-term preservation is a desideratum.|$|R

Democratic supporters of the measure accused Republicans of spreading misinformation about it.|$|R
50|$|A <b>final</b> <b>consideration</b> for CPS {{is that of}} {{removal of}} the cable should a failure occur. Some designs require diver {{intervention}} to recover the cable with the CPS.

The costs associated with CPS replacement during the operational lifetime of an offshore wind farm are not insignificant, as the cable will most likely require repair/replacement as part of the process.|$|R
