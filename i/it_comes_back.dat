25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases. He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, [...] "Now it's time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution." [...] In 2011, however, Huntsman said, [...] "Cap-and-trade ideas aren't working; it hasn't worked, and our economy's in a different place than five years ago. Much of this discussion happened before the bottom fell out of the economy, and until <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> this isn't the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond is sent by M to {{investigate}} a drug-smuggling operation based in Italy that is sending narcotics to England. M instructs Bond {{to get in touch}} with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo, he is captured and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation, and that Kristatos is backed by the Russians. Colombo agrees to help Bond by providing information about things [...] "as long as none of <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to Italy"; Bond agrees to help Colombo eliminate Kristatos.

[...] They attack Kristatos's operation and Bond discovers Kristatos lurking behind the warehouse, preparing to detonate a bomb to kill Colombo. Kristatos tries to escape, but Bond kills him.|$|E

2500|$|According to Yorke, [...] "Creep" [...] {{tells the}} tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the {{attention}} of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it." [...] Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about [...] "recognizing what you are".|$|E
