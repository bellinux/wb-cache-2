25|$|A typical {{water slide}} uses a pump system to pump {{water to the}} top which is then allowed to freely flow down its surface. The water reduces {{friction}} so sliders travel down the slide very quickly. Water slides run into a swimming pool (often called a plunge pool) or a long run-out chute. A lifeguard is usually stationed {{at the top and}} the bottom of the slide, so that if a rider <b>gets</b> <b>hurt</b> they will be treated immediately.|$|E
25|$|Kobayashi's English tutor {{and friend}} Naru <b>gets</b> <b>hurt</b> in an accident, so she {{arranges}} for {{her older brother}} to take her place in exchange for Kobayashi making him lunches. Their initial sessions are very antagonistic, with Toyo complaining about Kobayashi's lack of English skills, and Kobayashi complaining about Toyo's pickiness about food. Eventually they become friendlier, but then Naru confesses her feelings to Kobayashi, though she knows he is gay. He gently rejects her, and despite Kobayashi's worries, Toyo does not get mad at him. Their friendship continues deepening, and Toyo realizes that Kobayashi is always watching him. After confirming with Naru that Kobayashi is gay, Toyo confronts him and Kobayashi confirms {{that he is in}} love with him. Due to an incident in his past, Toyo initially rejects his feelings, but one night during a storm Kobayashi is hurt protecting Toyo and they go back to Kobayashi's house to treat the wound. Toyo tells him about a man he was in love with, but rejected publicly out of fear of his friend's reactions and because the man was moving away. Toyo finally accepts Kobayashi's feelings. They initially keep their relationship secret from Naru, afraid of hurting her, but she quickly realizes what is going on. She yells at Kobayashi for lying because {{they are supposed to be}} friends, then tells him she is okay with their relationship. After they part ways, she walks along crying and runs into Ida, who comforts her.|$|E

500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson <b>gets</b> <b>hurt,</b> {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four games last year) <b>gets</b> <b>hurt</b> ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down."

His goal in life is to just be great at his job. So he has a large chip on his shoulder, which gives him an attitude." [...] Butters stated that [...] "The problem with Thompson is, he’s such an opportunist, and he so wants to succeed above all other things, that he sometimes makes bad choices.

500|$|Randy Miller III, in {{his review}} of the Blu-ray release of the second season for DVD Talk, said that the memory of this season was worse than it {{actually}} was.

He added {{that at the time of}} the DVD release, he did not feel so positively towards the season and agreed with Holly Ordway's opinion at the time. Ordway had said that the second season sought to be more realistic, but that it feels childish as no one <b>gets</b> <b>hurt</b> or killed - even in the episode [...] "" [...] which saw a group of colonists defend themselves from renegade Klingons. She called the finale a [...] "giant reset button" [...] on the series, adding that it seemed that the show was about to become a sequel to Voyager but squandering the premise it had been given.|$|E
500|$|In the DVD audio {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson {{stated that}} trilogy episodes, like the Treehouse of Horror episodes, are [...] "much harder" [...] to direct than normal ones because the animators {{have to make}} as many designs for each act as they would for one normal episode. In the scene in which Joan gets torched by the English, Jean specifically ordered Anderson to [...] "make sure she doesn't get burned", {{even though she was}} surrounded by flames. Jean explained in the commentary that, when Mike Scully was show runner for The Simpsons, Jean learned that [...] "people do not wanna see changes in [...] basic design" [...] when the character <b>gets</b> <b>hurt.</b> He added that, because the viewer is [...] "so attached to the characters, [...] don't wanna see... especially Lisa, get hurt in any way." [...] In order to make Homer's ghost in the third segment transparent, the animators had to [...] "double expose" [...] him; Homer's cels were first shot normally and then with a diminished opacity. In the first segment, clouds can be seen moving behind Zeus. The clouds were animated by airbrushing the cels and then moving them slowly {{in order to make it}} [...] "look heavenly".|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} Da Capo II {{release was}} positively reviewed at visual-novels.net, commenting: [...] "I {{know a lot}} of gamers may not enjoy Da Capo, but whilst I think the story on some arcs was weaker than on others they were still amazing paths to play. On the stronger paths you really start to feel a lot of emotion for these girls, and because they're so closely tied together, someone always <b>gets</b> <b>hurt.</b> That for me bought some realism to the game." [...] In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the fifty best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Da Capo II ranked seventh with forty-seven votes.

50|$|Fallon {{began writing}} songs {{for what would}} become Painkillers before The Gaslight Anthem's 2014 release, <b>Get</b> <b>Hurt,</b> {{thinking}} {{there would be more}} time off before <b>Get</b> <b>Hurt.</b> He wrote new material and had some from another band of his, Molly and the Zombies, to use for Painkillers already. When the <b>Get</b> <b>Hurt</b> project started, Fallon put the new songs aside to focus on The Gaslight Anthem, realizing that the new songs he initially thought could be The Gaslight Anthem songs would not fit well with the direction the band was going with for <b>Get</b> <b>Hurt.</b> The band knew there would be a hiatus before it was made public so Fallon began writing more songs and put together a plan for the solo release. Following the announced hiatus of The Gaslight Anthem in July 2015, Fallon entered a Nashville studio to record Painkillers with producer Butch Walker, who also plays guitar on the album. Catherine Popper plays bass and Mark Stepro plays drums on the album.|$|R

2500|$|Fellow Penguin {{teammate}} Bill Guerin also analyzed Cooke's hit on Savard to Pittsburgh reporters. [...] "If a guy <b>gets</b> <b>hurt</b> {{like that}} with a shot to the head, there's got to be something," [...] said Guerin, adding that he expected Cooke to be suspended. [...] "I understand he (Cooke) is on my team but, hey, he's in a tough spot." [...] In a ruling, which has received wide criticism, Cooke was not given a suspension for the hit on Savard. On March 24, {{in response to the}} outcry over Cooke not being suspended, the league implemented a new rule aimed at prohibiting blindside hits to the head like the one Cooke delivered to Savard. In announcing the rule, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said, [...] "The elimination of these types of hits should significantly reduce the number of injuries, including concussions, without adversely affecting the level of physicality in the game." [...] Earlier, Bettman appeared on Leafs Lunch on Mojo 640 in Toronto to discuss the Cooke hit on Savard. [...] "I was very unhappy and upset with that hit," [...] said Bettman.

2500|$|In {{his role}} as a college {{professor}} of archaeology, Jones is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations. At the opportunity to recover important artifacts, Dr. Jones transforms into [...] "Indiana," [...] a [...] "non-superhero superhero" [...] image he has concocted for himself. Producer Frank Marshall said, [...] "Indy [...] a fallible character. He makes mistakes and <b>gets</b> <b>hurt.</b> ... That's the other thing people like: He's a real character, not a character with superpowers." [...] Spielberg said there [...] "was the willingness to allow our leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be the butt of his own jokes. I mean, Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero, and his imperfections, I think, make the audience feel that, with a little more exercise and a little more courage, they could be just like him." [...] According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode, Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school. Both of Indiana's personas reject one another in philosophy, creating a duality. Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was because Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic, while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf; a man on a quest; a noble treasure hunter; a hardboiled detective; a human superhero; and an American patriot.|$|E

As for Belle, she uses a street map to find out where Emma is keeping Gold, then hears a noise from the elevator, prompting her to take a weapon. She opens it and it's Gold, who warns Belle that Merida's after her by using Gold to turn him into a hero but in order to do that Emma has made Belle a target, and the two race back to the pawn shop to find magic.|$|E
