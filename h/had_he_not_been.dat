5|$|Then when J.R. is murdered, Sue Ellen becomes heart {{broken and}} relapses after his {{memorial}} service. She reads {{a letter he}} wrote to her and spends the night alone in his room. At his funeral, she reads the letter aloud in which J.R. declares his undying love to Sue Ellen and asks her for another chance. Heartbroken, Sue Ellen reveals her own unresolved feelings for J.R. and declares that <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> murdered she would have happily reunited with him. She then collapses at his casket and says he was {{the love of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|He {{originally}} {{joined the}} army as an ensign in the 52nd Foot in 1800, and saw active service the same year in Spain. He later acquired a captaincy in the 28th Foot in 1803; he saw service in Germany and at the Battle of Copenhagen with the 28th, and then served on the staff under Sir John Moore until the Battle of Corunna. He was later an aide to General Alexander Mackenzie-Fraser, then to General Thomas Picton, and a divisional adjutant through the later stages of the Peninsular War. In 1814–15 {{he served in the}} War of 1812, as a staff officer with the expedition sent to New Orleans, and <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> detained by prosecuting at a court-martial, he would have served at the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot visited with Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, {{he spent a lot of}} time with Hale and might possibly have become involved with her <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in close correspondence with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does not serve as an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E

5|$|During {{his second}} NHL season, Eberle {{sustained}} a sprained knee after colliding with Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn {{during a game}} on January 7, 2012. At {{the time of the}} injury, Eberle was among the league's top scorers and six points behind the league's leader. Despite his success, he was left off the 2012 NHL All-Star Game roster, which was selected while he was sidelined. Several members within the Oilers organization were outspoken regarding the omission, including captain Shawn Horcoff and Head Coach Tom Renney, to which the League replied that Eberle would have been selected <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> injured. By January 19, Eberle returned to the Oilers line-up after missing four games. Five days later, he was nonetheless named as an All-Star replacement for the injured Mikko Koivu. Eberle was selected to Team Chara as part of the All-Star Fantasy Draft and went on to record an assist in the squad's 12–9 win against Team Alfredsson. The following month, Eberle recorded his 100th career NHL point on February 21, 2012, with a goal and two assists in a 6–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished his second NHL season leading with a team-leading 34 goals, 42 assists and 76 points. Among league scorers, he ranked 16th in goals and points. The Oilers continued to struggle as a team, however, and finished 14th in the Western Conference with 32 wins and 74 points.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. He passed out and would probably have drowned <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> picked up and brought aboard the Hero {{by one of his}} naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
5|$|The sultan besieged him and {{discovered}} {{him in a}} certain mountain where the Wallachian {{was supported by the}} natural strength of the place. There Vlad had hidden himself along with 24,000 of his men who had willingly followed him. When Vlad realized that he would either perish from hunger or {{fall into the hands of}} the very cruel enemy, and considering both eventualities unworthy of brave men, he dared commit an act worthy of being remembered: calling his men together and explaining the situation to them, he easily persuaded them to enter the enemy camp. He divided the men so that either they should die bravely in battle with glory and honor or else, should destiny prove favorable to them, they should avenge themselves against the enemy in an exceptional matter. So, making use of some Turkish prisoners, who had been caught at twilight when they were wandering about imprudently, at nightfall Vlad penetrated into the Turkish camp with part of his troops, all the way up the fortifications. And during the entire night he sped like lightning in every direction and caused great slaughter, so much so that, had the other commander to whom he had entrusted his remaining forces been equally brave, or had the Turks not fully obeyed the repeated orders from the sultan not to abandon their garrisons, the Wallachian undoubtedly would have gained the greatest and most brilliant victory. But the other commander (a boyar named Galeş) did not dare attack the camp from the other side as had been agreed upon....Vlad carried out an incredible massacre without losing many men in such a major encounter, though many were wounded. He abandoned the enemy camp before daybreak and returned to the same mountain from which he had come. No one dared pursue him, since he had caused such terror and turmoil. I learned by questioning those who had participated in this battle that the sultan lost all confidence in the situation. During that night the sultan abandoned the camp and fled in a shameful manner. And he would have continued to this way, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> reprimanded by his friends and brought back, almost against his will.|$|E

25|$|Byrne played {{four more}} {{first-class}} matches in his career, two apiece in 1914 and 1921, but these appearances were for Worcestershire.

His only wicket for Worcestershire came on his debut for the county, against Leicestershire in July 1914, when he dismissed Arthur Mounteney.|$|E
25|$|During the altercations between Emperor Basil I and his heir Leo VI, Photios {{took the}} side of the Byzantine emperor.

In 886, Basil discovered and punished a conspiracy by the domestic of the Hikanatoi John Kourkouas the Elder and many other officials. In this conspiracy, Leo was not implicated, but Photios was possibly one of the conspirators against Basil's authority.|$|E
