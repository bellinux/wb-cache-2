5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline <b>generative</b> hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some <b>generative</b> hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the <b>generative</b> hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|Spores of Hydnellum {{are almost}} spherical to oblong and tuberculate, and are brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are {{narrowly}} club-shaped and usually four-spored; {{there are no}} cystidia in Hydnellum. Three types of hyphae {{are found in the}} flesh of Hydnellum: <b>generative</b> hyphae (thin-walled, not inflated); skeletal hyphae (thick-walled and narrow); and thin-walled gloeoplerous-like hyphae, which stain with methyl blue.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the <b>generative</b> {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} of humanities, arts, and social sciences, MIT economists have been awarded five Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals. Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle {{authored}} seminal texts on <b>generative</b> grammar and phonology. The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research, has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first type is {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is <b>generative</b> hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E
5|$|The hyphal {{system is}} monomitic, {{containing}} only <b>generative</b> hyphae. These hyphae are {{not less than}} 6μm in diameter. All European species lack clamp connections, but they {{are present in the}} North American species P.fibulatus and P.mississippiensis. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. Cystidia are either absent, or present infrequently as incompletely differentiated cystidioles (sterile cells about the size of an immature basidium). In mass, the spores are white. Spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, and echinulose (covered with small spines). They are also hyaline and inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all <b>generative</b> hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of <b>generative</b> hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white; spores are {{cylindrical}}, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning {{that there are}} three types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are thick walled, measuring 3–7μm in diameter; <b>generative</b> hyphae, responsible for new growth, can be either thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2–6μm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2–5μm.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} white spore print. Spores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and measure 3.5–5 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped and four-spored, with dimensions of 18–22 by 5–5.6μm. H.nidulans has a monomitic hyphal system, containing only <b>generative</b> hyphae with clamp connections. In the flesh, these hyphae are thick-walled and highly branched, measuring up to 10μm in diameter; hyphae comprising the pores and the subhymenium are thinner (up to 6μm wide) and less branched. A chemical test {{can be used}} to help identify H.nidulans: all parts of the fruit body will instantly stain bright violet if a drop of an alkaline solution is applied. Dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH), is often used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled <b>generative</b> hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and measure 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of <b>generative</b> hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, {{frequently}} branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the <b>generative</b> school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} <b>generative</b> hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often {{enabling}} it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's <b>generative</b> view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E
25|$|Ray S. Jackendoff's model {{deviates}} {{from the}} traditional <b>generative</b> grammar in {{that it does not}} treat syntax as the main <b>generative</b> component from which meaning and phonology is developed unlike Chomsky. According to him, a <b>generative</b> grammar consists of five major components: the lexicon, the base component, the transformational component, the phonological component and the semantic component.|$|E
25|$|Initially Eno {{began to}} {{experiment}} with tape loops {{in the creation of}} these music systems. Later he created systems that incorporated the use of several CDs with material he had specifically created for random playback, in order to make music of indeterminate duration. Then in 1995 he began working with the company Intermorphic to create <b>generative</b> music with programmed algorithms. The cooperation with Intermorphic led Eno to release <b>Generative</b> Music 1 (requires the Intermorphic's Koan Player software for PC), so as to make it possible to offer his <b>generative</b> explorations to the public as intended - enabling <b>generative</b> playback. Eventually Eno also explored the Adobe Flash format to release 77 Million Paintings in 2006. For PC and Mac, again, this enabled Eno to offer his <b>generative</b> explorations to the public as intended. Essentially 77 Million Paintings returns to the methodology of random playback utilized in his earlier work with tape loops and CD (as in it does not incorporate programmed algorithms). More recent;y, sparked by possibilities presented to Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers while working together on the <b>generative</b> soundtrack for the video game Spore (2008) the two began to release <b>generative</b> music in the Apple App format starting with the release of Bloom (2008) on up to their last release: Reflection (Apple App <b>generative</b> version: 2016).|$|E
25|$|In 1996 Eno collaborated in {{developing}} the SSEYO Koan <b>generative</b> music system (by Pete Cole and Tim Cole of Intermorphic) that he used in composing the hybrid music in the album <b>Generative</b> Music 1 – only playable on the Koan <b>generative</b> music system. Later more Koan music was released, including Wander (2001) and Dark Symphony (2007) – both include works by Brian, assembled in with works by other artists (including SSEYO's Tim Cole).|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{competence}} {{is treated as}} more comprehensive term for lexicalists, such as Jackendoff and Pustejovsky, within the <b>generative</b> school of thought. They assume a modular lexicon, a set of lexical entries containing semantic, syntactic and phonological information deemed necessary to parse a sentence. In the <b>generative</b> lexicalist view this information is intimately tied up with linguistic competence. Nevertheless, their models are still {{in line with the}} mainstream <b>generative</b> research in adhering to strong innateness, modularity and autonomy of syntax.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s Eno became {{increasingly}} interested in self-generating musical systems, {{the results of}} which he called <b>generative</b> music. The basic premise of <b>generative</b> music is the blending of several independent musical tracks, of varying sounds, length, and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again mixing with the other tracks allowing the listener to hear an almost infinite combination. In one instance of <b>generative</b> music, Eno calculated {{that it would take}} almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. He has presented this music in his own, and other artists', art and sound installations, most notably I Dormienti (The Sleepers), , Music for Civic Recovery Centre, The Quiet Room and Music for Prague.|$|E
25|$|<b>Generative</b> art is {{art that}} has been generated, composed, or {{constructed}} in an algorithmic manner {{through the use of}} systems defined by computer software algorithms, or similar mathematical or mechanical or randomised autonomous processes. Sonia Landy Sheridan established <b>Generative</b> Systems as a program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution. The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific—technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, <b>Generative</b> Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. <b>Generative</b> Systems artists attempted {{to bridge the gap between}} elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur.|$|E
