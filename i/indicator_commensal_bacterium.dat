While the majority of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{are found in the}} intestinal lumen, many species have also adapted to colonize different anatomical locations in the intestine including the surface of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the interior of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. Distinct tissue localization of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> permits unique interactions between these microbes and the mammalian immune system and collectively influences intestinal immune cell homeostasis. Conversely, dysregulated localization of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> can lead to inappropriate activation of the immune system and is associated with numerous chronic infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms that control proper anatomical containment of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> are essential to maintain tissue homeostasis and limit pathology. Although the roles of luminal and epithelial-associated <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> on immune cell homeostasis have been extensively studied, how lymphoid tissue-resident commensals (LRC) modulate host immune responses is not well understood. Data in Chapter 2 will describe interactions between a genetically related family of LRCs that can colonize dendritic cells and induces lymphoid tissue-specific immune responses. Further, Chapter 3 will provide evidence that LRC-induced immune responses are mutually beneficial for itself and the host. Specifically, LRC-induced interleukin (IL) - 22 enhances its own microbial colonization and LRC-induced IL- 10 limits tissue inflammation during intestinal injury. ^ Dysregulated anatomical localization of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> during chronic inflammatory conditions is typically associated with extra-intestinal complications including anemia or dysregulated iron homeostasis.

In the present study, we observed commensal bacteria-mediated {{activation of the}} noninflammatory extracellular signal-regulated kinase[ERK]/mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling pathways in gut epithelial cells and delineated a mechanism for this bacterially activated signaling. All tested strains of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> induced ERK phosphorylation without stimulating pro-inflammatory phospho-IκB or pro-apoptotic phospho-c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase, with Lactobacillus species being most potent. This pattern of signaling activation was recapitulated using the peptide N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, a bacterial product known to stimulate signaling events in mammalian phagocytes. Sensing of N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe by gut epithelial cells occurs via recently characterized formyl peptide receptors located in the plasma membrane. Both <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe application to the apical surface of polarized gut epithelial cells resulted in specific formyl peptide receptor activation. In addition, pretreatment of model epithelia and murine colon with Boc 2 (a specific peptide antagonist) or pertussis toxin (a Gi-protein inhibitor) abolished commensal-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Taken together, these data show that <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> specifically activate the ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in an formyl peptide receptor-dependent manner, delineating a mechanism by which <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> contribute to cellular signaling in gut epithelia...|$|R

These interferences can contribute to chronic stress-induced increases in systemic IL- 6 and TNF-a. Chronic stress, however, produces many physiological changes that could indirectly influence immune activity. In addition to IL- 6 and TNF-a, exposure to acute stressors upregulates a plethora of inflammatory proteins, each having unique synthesis and release mechanisms. We therefore tested the hypothesis that acute stress-induced inflammatory protein responses are dependent on the <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and more specifically, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shed from Gram-negative intestinal <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> We present evidence that both reducing <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> using antibiotics and neutralizing LPS using endotoxin inhibitor (EI) attenuates increases in some (inflammasome dependent, IL- 1 and IL- 18), but not all (inflammasome independent, IL- 6, IL- 10, and MCP- 1) inflammatory proteins in the blood of male F 344 rats exposed to an acute tail shock stressor.

40|$|Background: Sulfatases are {{emerging}} as key adaptive tools of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> to their host. Results: The first bacterial endo-O-sulfatase and three exo-O-sulfatases {{from the human}} commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, specific for glycosaminoglycans, have been discovered and characterized. Conclusion: <b>Commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> possess a unique array of highly specific sulfatases to metabolize host glycans. Significance: Bacterial sulfatases are much more diverse than anticipated. Despite {{the importance of the}} microbiota in human physiology, the molecular bases that govern the interactions between these <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and their host remain poorly understood. We recently reported that sulfatases {{play a key role in}} the adaptation of a major human <b>commensal</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, to its host (Benjdia, A., Martens, E. C., Gordon, J. I., and Berteau, O. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 25973 - 25982). We hypothesized that sulfatases are instrumental for this bacterium, and related Bacteroides species, to metabolize highly sulfated glycans (i. e. mucins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)) and to colonize the intestinal mucosal layer. Based on our previous study, we investigated 10 sulfatase genes induced in the presence of host glycans. Biochemical characterization of these potential sulfatases allowed the identification of GAG-specific sulfatases selective for the type of saccharide residue and the attachment position of the sulfate group. Although some GAG-specific bacterial sulfatase activities have been described in the literature, we report here for the first time the identity and the biochemical characterization of four GAG-specific sulfatases. Furthermore, contrary to the current paradigm, we discovered that B. thetaiotaomicron possesses an authentic GAG endosulfatase that is active at the polymer level. This type of sulfatase is the first one to be identified in a bacterium. Our study thus demonstrates that bacteria have evolved more sophisticated and diverse GAG sulfatases than anticipated and establishes how B. thetaiotaomicron, and other major human <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> can metabolize and potentially tailor complex host glycans...|$|R
40|$|The diverse human {{microbial}} ecosystem colonizes {{many different}} body sites. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially, {{is a major}} region that that harbors a complex microbial community composed of trillions of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Interactions between the <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> and the host immune system begin at birth and continue through the human lifespan. In the gut, <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> help the host to ensure the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis {{as well as the}} mucosal barrier structure through host stimulation of mucus and antimicrobial molecules. The secretion of these host factors functions to inhibit pathogenic invasion and maintain the population of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The microbial communities also secrete their own metabolites to regulate host metabolism as well as host immunity. Together, this complex crosstalk allows a series of host-microbe interactions and host responses that are necessary to manipulate the host immunity, maintenanmucosal homeostasis and regulate the composition of the microbiota. In the gastrointestinal tract, the major immune cells that actively participate in the host defense mechanism are resident intestinal macrophages. These cells are primarily responsible for the first-line host defense that protects the host from an enormous number of potentially pathogenic bacteria and/or antigenic stimuli that are present in the intestinal lumen. Normally, during steady state, these cells are very anergic and tolerant towards the <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Yet, they still retain their phagocytic and bactericidal activity. Although the mechanisms surrounding the anergy of the intestinal macrophages are not well understood, the abundance of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> present in the gut lumen may suggest that the possible function of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> is to influence the activity of gut macrophages. Little is known about the commensal bacteria’s ability to exert their function on the host intestinal macrophages through the production of commensal metabolites. It is well understood that <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> can secrete metabolites to regulate host metabolism as well as influence host immunity. We believe that the <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> might regulate intestinal macrophages in the same manner. In this study, we sought to understand the involvement of the secreted commensal bacterial factors/metabolites in response to the anergic function of intestinal macrophages. We hypothesized that the secreted bacteria factors/metabolites present in the bacterial supernatant can suppress macrophage activation upon the induction of TLR or NLRP 3 agonists on macrophages. To test our hypothesis, we will use four different strains of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> that are normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Those are Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus oralis. We will determine whether the secreted bacterial factors present in the commensal culture supernatants can actually suppress the activation of macrophages in the presence of LPS or MSU crystal stimuli in vitro. Furthermore, we will also test whether the bacterial factors present in the bacterial supernatant can suppress the recruitment of neutrophil in the peritoneal cavity in the presence of LPS stimulation in vivo. If the secreted commensal factors/metabolites can suppress the activation of macrophage or the recruitment of netrophils upon the induction of TLR or NLRP 3 agonists on macrophages, we will then seek to determine whether the secreted commensal factors can suppress macrophages activation in the transwell system, a system that mimics the gastrointestinal tract consisting of both epithelial cells and macrophages. By taking advantage of the transwell system, we will determine whether the secreted bacterial factors in the commensal supernatants can actually suppress macrophage activation during the induction of TLR or NLRP 3 agonists on macrophages in the presence of epithelial layers. Together, these studies provide insights into how <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> can regulate macrophage responses in the gastrointestinal system. We discovered that the secreted commensal factors, which have molecular weights of less than 10 Kda, can suppress macrophage activation as well as neutrophil recruiment in both in vivo and in vitro {{as well as in the}} transwell system upon MSU crystal or LPS crystal stimuli. In contrast, the secreted factors present in the commensal supernatants which have molecular weight greater than 10 KDa act as a stimulatory mediator and promote the activation of macrophages in TLR- 2 dependent manner...|$|R

Using fluorescently labeled, nonspecific SIgA or secretory component (SC), we visualized by confocal microscopy the interaction with various <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacteria, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides strains. These experiments revealed that the interaction between SIgA and <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> involves Fab- and Fc-independent structural motifs, featuring SC as a crucial partner. Removal of glycans present on free SC or bound in SIgA resulted in a drastic drop in the interaction with Gram-positive bacteria, indicating the essential role of carbohydrates in the process. In contrast, poor binding of Gram-positive bacteria by control IgG was observed. The interaction with Gram-negative bacteria was preserved whatever the molecular form of protein partner used, suggesting the involvement of different binding motifs. Purified SIgA and SC from either mouse hybridoma cells or human colostrum exhibited identical patterns of recognition for Gram-positive bacteria, emphasizing conserved plasticity between species.

Tolerogenic intestinal dendritic cells fulfil {{a crucial role in}} balancing immune responses and therefore creating homeostatic conditions and preventing from uncontrolled inflammation. Although several dendritic cell subsets have already been characterized to play a pivotal role in this process, less is known about definite molecular mechanisms of how intestinal dendritic cells are converted into tolerogenic ones. Here we review how gut <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> interact with intestinal dendritic cells and why this bacteria-host cell interaction is crucial for induction of dendritic cell tolerance in the intestine. Hereby, different <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> can have distinct effects on the phenotype of intestinal dendritic cells and these effects are mainly mediated by impacting toll-like receptor signalling in dendritic cells...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} {{is emerging}} as an important feature in bacteria. Protein glycosylation systems have been reported and studied in many pathogenic bacteria, revealing an important diversity of glycan structures and pathways within and between bacterial species. These systems play key roles in virulence and pathogenicity. More recently, {{a large number of}} bacterial proteins {{have been found to be}} glycosylated in gut <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria.</b> We present an overview of bacterial protein glycosylation systems (O- and N-glycosylation) in bacteria, with a focus on glycoproteins from gut <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> particularly Lactobacilli. These emerging studies underscore the importance of bacterial protein glycosylation in the interaction of the gut microbiota with the host...|$|R
40|$|Secretory-immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in immunological defense in the intestine. It has been known for a long time that microbial stimulation is required for the development and maintenance of intestinal IgA production. Recent advances in genomic technology have made it possible to detect uncultivable <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the intestine and identify key bacteria in the regulation of innate and acquired mucosal immune responses. In this review, we focus on the immunological function of Peyer’s patches (PPs), a major gut-associated lymphoid tissue, in the induction of intestinal IgA responses and the unique immunological interaction of PPs with <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> especially Alcaligenes, a unique indigenous bacteria habituating inside PPs...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal {{epithelial}} cells (IECs) and dendritic cells (DCs) play {{a pivotal role}} in antigen sampling and the maintenance of gut homeostasis. However, the interaction of <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> with the intestinal surface remains incompletely understood. Here we investigated immune cell responses to <b>commensal</b> and pathogenic <b>bacteria.</b> HT- 29 human IECs were incubated with Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, Lactobacillus salivarius UCC 118 or Salmonella typhimurium UK 1 for varying times, or were pretreated with a probiotic for 2 hr prior to stimulation with S. typhimurium or flagellin. Gene arrays were used to examine inflammatory gene expression. Nuclear factor (NF) -κB activation, interleukin (IL) - 8 secretion, pathogen adherence to IECs, and mucin- 3 (MUC 3) and E-cadherin gene expression were assayed by TransAM assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescence, and real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. IL- 10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α secretion by bacteria-treated peripheral blood-derived DCs were measured using ELISA. S. typhimurium increased expression of 36 of the 847 immune-related genes assayed, including NF-κB and IL- 8. The <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> did not alter expression levels of any of the 847 genes. However, B. infantis and L. salivarius attenuated both IL- 8 secretion at baseline and S. typhimurium-induced pro-inflammatory responses. B. infantis also limited flagellin-induced IL- 8 protein secretion. The <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> did not increase MUC 3 or E-cadherin expression, or interfere with pathogen binding to HT- 29 cells, but they did stimulate IL- 10 and TNF-α secretion by DCs. The data demonstrate that, although the intestinal epithelium is immunologically quiescent when it encounters B. infantis or L. salivarius, these <b>commensal</b> <b>bacteria</b> exert immunomodulatory effects on intestinal immune cells that mediate host responses to flagellin and enteric pathogens...|$|R
