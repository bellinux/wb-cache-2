5|$|The family {{learns that}} Peter has been {{diagnosed}} with Kidney failure due to the damage done and he {{is in need of}} a transplant. However, since they must wait a few months before they can get donors, Peter must undergo <b>dialysis</b> at regular intervals. Three weeks later, after undergoing constant <b>dialysis</b> procedures, Peter gets angry that the <b>dialysis</b> treatments have stolen him from the world. After being convinced by Joe and Quagmire that one skipping would not hurt him, Peter eventually decides to skip an appointment but his assumptions are false and him skipping it causes him to become jaundiced and vomit blood.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal <b>dialysis.</b> The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a <b>dialysis</b> catheter), while peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because {{of the cost of}} importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> fluids (PD fluids).|$|E
5|$|Zirconium binds urea, a {{property}} {{that has been}} utilized extensively {{to the benefit of}} patients with chronic kidney disease. For example, zirconium is a primary component of the sorbent column dependent dialysate regeneration and recirculation system known as the REDY system, which was first introduced in 1973. More than 2,000,000 <b>dialysis</b> treatments have been performed using the sorbent column in the REDY system. Although the REDY system was superseded in the 1990s by less expensive alternatives, new sorbent-based <b>dialysis</b> systems are being evaluated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Renal Solutions developed the DIALISORB technology, a portable, low water <b>dialysis</b> system. Also, developmental versions of a Wearable Artificial Kidney have incorporated sorbent-based technologies.|$|E
5|$|Hepatorenal {{syndrome}} (often abbreviated HRS) is {{a life-threatening}} medical condition {{that consists of}} rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as <b>dialysis,</b> can prevent advancement of the condition.|$|E
5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to <b>dialysis)</b> and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Mikan died in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 1, 2005, {{seventeen}} {{days before}} his 81st birthday, of complications from diabetes and other ailments. His son Terry reported {{that his father had}} undergone <b>dialysis</b> three times a week, four hours a day, for the last five years. He was interred at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 2012, Alimuddin died in Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, London. He {{suffered}} from heart and lung diseases. He also had kidney failure {{and was on}} <b>dialysis.</b> The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a press statement expressing sorrow and conveying condolences to Alimuddin's family.|$|E
5|$|Patient {{transport}} ambulance – A vehicle, {{which has}} the job of transporting patients to, from or between places of medical treatment, such as hospital or <b>dialysis</b> center, for non-urgent care. These can be vans, buses or other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{was tested}} for the {{influence}} on manic depression and depression. <b>Dialysis</b> patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium and therefore a supplementation may help during depression. In some tests the rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to 720mg per day for 60 days.|$|E
5|$|Garcia {{developed}} {{diabetes in}} his forties. As a result, {{he suffered from}} kidney disease and heart damage {{in the last years}} of his life. Faced with <b>dialysis</b> three times per week, Garcia joined his former teammates at fundraising events to defray his medical expenses. He died in Fairview Park, Ohio on January 13, 1986 at the age of 62. He died on his thirty-fifth wedding anniversary. He was buried in his hometown of Visalia, California. Garcia, whose annual salary was never greater than $35,000, died with more than $100,000 in outstanding medical bills.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as <b>dialysis</b> was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when <b>dialysis</b> was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Reversible inhibitors {{attach to}} enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors {{generally do not}} undergo chemical reactions when bound to the enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or <b>dialysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} free {{immunization}} programs for children, specifically targeted against the seven major diseases – smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, whooping cough, polio, and measles. As of 2016, {{a total of}} 31,115 children age one and below has been “fully immunized”. The Manila <b>Dialysis</b> Center that provides free services for the poor has been cited by the United Nations Committee on Innovation, Competitiveness and Public-Private Partnerships {{as a model for}} public-private partnership (PPP) projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include <b>dialysis</b> or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.|$|E
25|$|SDHHD and nocturnal <b>dialysis</b> avoid large fluid shifts {{typical in}} IHD (that can cause nausea, cramping, and 'wash-out') after <b>dialysis</b> sessions.|$|E
25|$|Nocturnal <b>dialysis</b> and SDHHD {{treatment}} regimens {{provide a}} higher <b>dialysis</b> dose; {{they have a}} higher a std Kt/V and HDP than IHD treatment regimens.|$|E
25|$|Two {{modalities}} of <b>dialysis</b> {{can be used}} in {{the treatment}} of ADPKD patients: peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> and hemodialysis. Epidemiological data shows that ADPKD affects 5-13.4% of patients undergoing hemodialysis in Europe and in the United States, and about 3% in Japan. Peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> has usually been contra-indicated in ADPKD patients with large kidney and liver volumes, due to expected physical difficulties in the procedure and possible complications; however, recent studies suggest there is no difference in long term morbidity between hemodialysis and peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> in ADPKD.|$|E
25|$|While {{these data}} {{demonstrate}} that analgesic nephropathy {{has been all}} but eliminated in some regions, in other regions the condition persists. Notably, in Belgium, the prevalence of analgesic nephropathy among people having <b>dialysis</b> was 17.9% in 1984 and 15.6% in 1990. Michielsen and de Schepper suggest that analgesic nephropathy persists among people in Belgium having <b>dialysis</b> not due to non-phenacetin analgesics, but because Belgium accepts {{a higher proportion of}} elderly people for <b>dialysis.</b> According to these authors, a greater proportion have analgesic nephropathy because a greater percentage of people in Belgium having <b>dialysis</b> have been exposed to long-term use of phenacetin.|$|E

25|$|It was {{developed}} by Frank Gotch and John Sargent {{as a way for}} measuring the dose of <b>dialysis</b> when they analyzed the data from the National Cooperative <b>Dialysis</b> Study. In hemodialysis the US National Kidney Foundation Kt/V target is ≥1.3, so that one can be sure that the delivered dose is at least 1.2. In peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> the target is ≥1.7/week.|$|E

25|$|Chloramine must {{be removed}} from the water prior to use in kidney <b>dialysis</b> machines, as it would come in contact with the {{bloodstream}} across a permeable membrane. However, since chloramine is neutralized by the digestive process, kidney <b>dialysis</b> patients can still safely drink chloramine-treated water.|$|E
25|$|Chloramines {{should be}} removed from water for <b>dialysis,</b> aquariums, hydroponic applications, and homebrewing beer. Chloramines can {{interfere}} with <b>dialysis,</b> can hurt aquatic animals, and can give homebrewed beer a medicinal taste by forming chlorophenols. In hydroponic applications, it will stunt the growth of plants.|$|E

25|$|In CKD {{numerous}} uremic toxins {{accumulate in}} the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with <b>dialysis,</b> the toxin levels {{do not go}} back to normal as <b>dialysis</b> is not that efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may {{not go back to}} normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If it does, the creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, {{and some of them are}} bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein-bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic <b>dialysis</b> procedures used today.|$|E
