40|$|OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{study the}} {{relationship}} between risk factors and stroke incidence and mortality in the Chinese elderly. METHODS: An analytic study in a cohort population of 1, 268 male retired cadres in a military setting. A health-screening program was carried out for all cadres aged 55 years or older in Xi'an in February 1987. Baseline data on smoking, cholesterol, triglyceride, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), histories of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, diabetes and family histories of cardiovascular disease were investigated. Main outcome measures were stroke incidence, stroke and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The cohort was followed up until June 30, 2001 and a total number of follow-up person-year was 15, 546. During the follow-up period, there were 113 new stroke cases identified and the adjusted incidence was 727 per 100, 000 person-year. Forty-five deaths were due to stroke and the adjusted mortality was 289 per 100, 000 person-year. Using Cox model analysis, after adjustment on age, total cholesterol, triglyceride, smoking, drinking and physical <b>exercise,</b> we <b>noticed</b> that the systolic pressure, BMI, history of CHD and hyperlipidemia were independent risk factors for stroke incidence and morality. CONCLUSION: The incidence and mortality of stroke in this cohort were lower {{than those in the}} same age group of general population. Monitoring and controlling body mass index and blood pressure level seemed to be important factors for the prevention of stroke in the elderly. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|An {{intensive}} {{decommissioning programme}} at SCK•CEN was executed {{during the period}} 1989 to 1998. This programme included the decommissioning of the BR 3 reactor and heavy equipment in the BR 2 reactor {{as well as the}} clean up of several nuclear laboratories. The management of these Dismantling and Decontamination activities (D&D) along with the evaluation of the costs and the financing of the liability fund requires the use of a data processing system. SCK•CEN designed in 1994 a decommissioning management tool (DEMATO) to perform these assignments. The tool was successfully used in 1995 for the set-up of the decommissioning plan and in 1999, to perform its revision. The comparison between these two successive evaluations allows to observe the influence of changes in strategy and the evolution of waste prices on the costs of the D&D activities and this for the period 1995 - 1998. As a result of this <b>exercise</b> one <b>notices</b> that: 1. for the back end of the HEU BR 2 spent fuel, the processing of the spent fuel without recovery of the uranium, allows to reduce the costs by 25 %; 2. the dry storage of the LEU and MOX spent fuel is, up to now, performed within the dedicated budget; 3. the costs of the other D&D activities are roughly 5 % more expensive that the estimated budget, if the increase of the waste costs is disregarded and 15 % of the inflation of the waste costs is taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to assess continuous and intermittent training load and its influences to a rock climbing performance.

The first exercise involved 30 s of climbing and 30 s of passive recovery, maximum 12 repetitions. The load and recovery time in the second exercise were doubled and in the third exercise subject climbed until exhaustion. The pace of climbing was assigned 25 movements. min- 1 at negative angle 135 ž or 120 ž, owing to their present climbing abilities.

Even those who do not give much conscious thought to what has been taking place are discouraged and blocked in their work or alienated from their normal ambitions by the paralyzing chill of a national effort directed toward a blind dead end which is all the more horrifying and haunting for being totally inconsecutive with their daily lives and inapprehensible to their imaginations. The accomplished, the intelligent, the well-informed go on in their useful professions that require high integrity and intellect, but they suffer more and more from the crowding of an often unavowed constraint which may prevent them from allowing themselves to become too intelligent and well-informed or may drive them to indulge their skills in gratuitous and futile <b>exercises.</b> One <b>notices</b> in the conversation of this professional class certain inhibitions on free expression, a tacit understanding that certain matters had better not be brought into discussion, which sometimes makes one feel in such talk a kind of fundamental frivolity.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to this brief he created the 5BX (5 Basic Exercises) plan. The plan was innovative in two respects. Firstly, it did not require access to specialised equipment.

Secondly, the plan only required 11 minutes per day to be spent on the <b>exercises.</b> Orban had <b>noticed</b> when testing oxygen intake in Illinois that long periods of exercise did not necessarily lead to significant improvement. This led him {{to the conclusion that the}} intensity of exercise was more important that the amount of time spent on it. This aspect of the plan drew a negative reaction from others in the field but the 5BX programme proved its worth. 23 million copies of the booklet were sold to the Canadian public and it was popular around the world, being translated into 13 languages. Orban, as a public servant, received no additional income from the success of the plan.|$|R

The main goals of this paper were to: (a) formulate an updated Minimum Requirements Report for pollen monitoring; (b) carry out a pilot QC exercise of staff involved in pollen counting from various national networks in order to examine between analysts reproducibility and develop a methodology that can be used in future QC exercises. A questionnaire survey was sent to coordinators of participating pollen monitoring networks. In addition, a total of 45 technicians from 15 European countries participated in the pilot QC exercise. All technicians were instructed to analyse two slides containing the following pollen types: (a) Poaceae and Betula pollen grains in the north of Europe; (b) Poaceae and Olea pollen grains in the south of Europe. Minimum Recommendations were produced based on the results of the questionnaire survey, published literature, and the outcomes of a workshop. In the QC <b>exercise,</b> it was <b>noticed</b> that technicians who followed the Minimum Recommendations and examined at least 10 % of the slide tended to have better indicators of precision and accuracy than those technicians who did not follow the Minimum Recommendations.

40|$|Extract] Section 264 {{is one of}} a raft of {{provisions}} at the disposal of the Tax Office authorising it to require persons to furnish information and evidence to it. It sits alongside s 263, which is the primary provision authorising the Tax Office to have access to buildings and documents and to make copies: see [263. 10]. Section 264 complements this power by requiring any person to whom a notice is issued to furnish information, to attend and give evidence and/or produce documents. It is, however, an independent power and not dependent on the Tax Office first seeking to exercise its powers under s 263. It further complements s 162, which authorises the Tax Office to require a person to lodge a tax return or furnish further information about their financial affairs. Section 264 can, however, be directed to persons other than the taxpayer whose affairs are at issue. This power is not without its limitations and is reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. In particular, it must be appropriately authorised, <b>exercised</b> by <b>notice</b> in writing and contain sufficient particularity: see [264. 100]. It must be exercised bona fide and solely {{for the purposes of the}} Act: see [264. 420]. Furthermore, notices issued under s 264 (1) (b) must be issued for the purposes of identifying a person's income or income-tax assessment: see [264. 620]. The exercise of the power is not subject to any privilege against incrimination, but it is subject to legal professional privilege: see [264. 820]. It should be an acknowledged that the policy of the Tax Office is to only use the power under s 264 as a last resort as requests for information will, initially at least, be typically made on a less formal basis. As it is no defence to an addressee to argue an obligation of confidentiality, persons concerned about breaching any obligation of confidentiality by supplying information to the Tax Office should request that a s 264 notice be issued to them. It should also be noted that, under s 353 - 10 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA), the Tax Office has similar powers to those contained in ss 263 and 264 of ITAA 1936. While s 353 - 10 is the primary provision utilised by the Tax Office to acquire information in relation to a goods and services tax assessment, it is also relevant to the administration of the TAA (including the collection of income tax). In fact, it is the preferred information gathering power of the Tax Office for use in debt collection work. Section 264 is considered by the Tax Office as more suitable to lodgement activities – although if the Tax Office wishes to acquire books or documents then this can also be achieved pursuant a search warrant obtained by the Australian Federal Police under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (or by the Australian Crime Commission under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002). A failure to comply with a s 264 notice would amount to an offence under either s 8 C or 8 D of TAA, with the quantum of the penalties applicable dealt with in Taxation Administration Act 1953 s 8 E: see [264. 860]...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:Nutritional {{assessment}} gives {{accurate and}} reproducible information {{as regards the}} existence of an optimal energy metabolism: resting metabolic rate (RMR), the proportion of nutritional principles (fat, carbohydrate, protein) used by the body in the basal metabolism, the intensity of effort during exercise where the maximum fat oxidation rate (MFOR) is achieved. These information are used for the individualization of physical training programs and for the calorie intake adjustment in accordance with the body needs. The aim {{of this study is to}} underline once again the importance of physical activity in the weight management and to demonstrate the importance of nutritional assessment in the prescription of physical training in obese subjects. Material and methods:We investigated 43 young obese, with a mean age of 21. 2 ± 3. 1 years old, of which 93 % were females. The subject’s evaluations consisted in: nutritional assessment (using indirect calorimetry method), maximal exercise test at baseline and the end of the study (after 6 months). After the exercise test, the subjects performed an individualized physical training with a minimum frequency of three times a week. Subject’s heart rate was monitorized during exercise by a physical therapist using a heart rate monitor (Polar F 3, Finland). The dropout rate from the physical training program as part of the study was 35 %, in the end remaining only 28 subjects. Results:After 6 months of individualized <b>exercise</b> training, we <b>noticed</b> a statistically significant increase of the following parameters: maximum fat oxidation rate (MFOR) from 16. 96 ± 7. 75 to 22. 07 ± 8. 4 g/h, p= 0. 0043; resting metabolic rate (RMR) from 2007 ± 300. 3 to 2105 ± 290. 4 kcal/day, p = 0. 0026; along with the resting oxygen uptake (VO 2 rest) from 0. 29 ± 0. 04 to 0. 3 ± 0. 04 l / min, p = 0, 0035. The only parameter that has improved, but not reaching statistical significance was heart rate average at MFOR (HR_MFOR) which increased from 127. 1 ± 18. 37 to 135 ± 25. 09 b/min. Conclusions: Physical training in young obese subjects is safe and effective; thus, this study demonstrates the increased efficiency of physical training programs regarding weight loss and higher MFOR due to a higher aerobic capacity...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Little {{research}} has explored {{the degree to}} which specific intervention components predict improved health outcomes for cancer patients and their family caregivers. The present study examined relations of intervention components (i. e., coping skills) to symptoms in a telephone symptom management (TSM) intervention delivered concurrently to symptomatic lung cancer patients and their family caregivers. Guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) frameworks, patient-caregiver dyads were taught coping skills including: a mindfulness <b>exercise</b> (i. e., <b>noticing</b> sounds and thoughts), pursed lips breathing, guided imagery, cognitive restructuring, and assertive communication. Symptom measures were administered at baseline and 2 and 6 weeks post-intervention. The measures assessed patient and caregiver depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as patient pain severity, distress related to breathlessness, and fatigue interference. Data were examined from patient-caregiver dyads enrolled in TSM (N = 51 dyads). Patients and caregivers were predominantly female (55 % and 73 %, respectively) and Caucasian (87 %). The average patient was 63 years of age (SD = 8) and the average caregiver was 56 years of age (SD = 14). Seven autoregressive panel models tested relations of coping skills to symptoms. All models had at least adequate fit to the data (χ 2 ps > 0. 05, RMSEA values < 0. 06). For patients, more assertive communication practice during the intervention was related to less pain severity, fatigue interference, and depressive and anxiety symptoms at 6 weeks post-intervention. Additionally, more guided imagery practice during the intervention was related to less fatigue interference and anxiety at 6 weeks post-intervention. In contrast, more cognitive restructuring practice during the intervention was related to more distress related to breathlessness and depressive and anxiety symptoms at 6 weeks post-intervention. Similarly, more practice of a mindfulness exercise during the intervention was related to more fatigue interference and anxiety at 6 weeks post-intervention. For caregivers, more guided imagery practice was related to more anxiety at 2 weeks post-intervention. All other pathways from coping skills to symptoms at 2 and 6 weeks post-intervention were non-significant for both patients and caregivers. Findings suggest intervention effectiveness may have been reduced by competing effects of certain coping skills. For lung cancer patients, future studies should consider focusing on assertive communication and guided imagery, as these two coping skills were most consistently associated with reduced symptoms. However, more studies are needed to better understand these findings and particular caution should be used when applying CBT-based interventions that have not been validated in lung cancer populations...|$|R
