25|$|Alan Ford is {{the central}} {{character}} of the series. He is rather tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes. He usually dresses in a black long-sleeved shirt with black shoes and dark pants. He is {{the newest member of}} the TNT. He is a shy, naive person, and very humble, {{but one of the most}} effective agents of the series. He matures during the course of the series and grows to be a tough, smart man. He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he gets. He grew up in an orphanage and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined TNT on accident. He is one of the most trusted agents of Number One.|$|E

Lombard was influential in bringing Alfred Hitchcock, whom she knew through David O. Selznick, to direct one of his most atypical films. It was a commercial success, as audiences were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> Swindell calls [...] "the belated happy news... that Carole Lombard was a screwball once more." ...|$|E
500|$|Ford {{disliked the}} new angle, telling Lucas, [...] "No way am I {{being in a}} Steven Spielberg movie like that." [...] Spielberg himself, who {{depicted}} aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, resisted it. Lucas {{came up with a}} story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994. (Stuart had previously written The Fugitive, which starred Ford.) Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow Henry Jones, Sr. to return, expressing concern over whether his son is <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he has accomplished. After he learned that Joseph Stalin was interested in psychic warfare, he decided to have Soviets as the villains and the aliens to have psychic powers. Following Stuart's next draft, Lucas hired Last Crusade writer Jeffrey Boam to write the next three versions, the last of which was completed in March 1996. Three months later, Independence Day was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film. Lucas decided to focus on the Star Wars prequels.|$|E

500|$|In February 1984, Genesis took a {{break in}} {{activity}} to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album Soundtracks, and Collins released No Jacket Required which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of No Jacket Required, Collins insisted {{that he would not}} leave the band.

500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space to block out the sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
500|$|He {{was drawn}} in the event's first heat on 19 September, {{finishing}} first {{out of three}} entered swimmers, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.72 seconds. The time established a new Equatoguinean swimming record in the discipline. Moussambani was the sole competing swimmer after the heat's two other competitors were disqualified for false starts. He used a large amount of energy in the first 50 metres, and as his legs stiffened, his pace reduced. Officials decided against retrieving him from the pool after he was observed to sink below the water shortly before finishing and he was cheered by the crowd throughout. Overall Moussambani finished 71st (and last) out of all athletes, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing one minute and 2.91 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later rounds. After completing the event, he said that it was [...] "a very special moment" [...] of which he would not forget and the crowd cheering motivated him to finish: [...] "Gold medal is not everything in the Olympics. I am really <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> happened, it was all worth it. I want to come back next time for the 2004 games in Athens." [...] Moussambani earned admiration from {{millions of people around the}} world, received a large amount of publicity for his effort, and was given the nickname [...] "Eric the Eel" [...] by the press.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{sessions}} of experimentation in Boston, Massachusetts led friends Aaron Turner (guitar/vocals; also {{the owner of}} Hydra Head Records and its subsidiary, HH Noise Industries), Jeff Caxide (bass guitar), Chris Mereschuk (electronics/vocals) and Aaron Harris (drums) to form Isis in late 1997. As Turner states, [...] "Isis formed {{as a result of}} the dissatisfaction with past bands of the founding members. None of us were <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> we were doing musically at the time, two of us lived together, we had similar tastes and similar record collections." [...] Isis released a demo and their first EP, Mosquito Control, in 1998, with this line-up. During a show at the Middle East in Boston, MA, they sold copies of Mosquito Control attached to a circular sawblade as a very limited print edition. After an East Coast tour in the summer of 1998 where they were joined by Randy Larsen of Cable on guitar, Mereschuk left the band. Jay Randall (now of Agoraphobic Nosebleed) soon replaced him, working on Red Sea (1999). However, his stay would not last long. Isis then recruited guitarist/keyboardist Bryant Clifford Meyer (formerly of The Gersch) and guitarist Michael Gallagher (formerly of Cast Iron Hike) in 1999. After releasing their full-length debut entitled Celestial and its sister EP, SGNL›05 (on Neurot Recordings), in 2000, Isis gained national underground attention in the metal/hardcore scene through tours with Cave In and Neurosis. Isis remained with this lineup until their dissolution in 2010.|$|E

40|$|Counterfactual {{reasoning}} {{about how}} events {{could have turned}} out better {{is associated with the}} feeling of regret. However, developmental studies show a discrepancy between the onset of counterfactual reasoning (at 3 years) and the feeling of regret (at 6 years). In four experiments we explored possible reasons. Experiment 1 (3 - to 6 -year-old children) and Experiment 2 (adult control) show that even when regret is assessed more directly than in previous studies (e. g., Amsel & Smalley, 2000) only adults but not children regret their decision. Experiment 3 (3 - to 14 -year-old children) suggests that double-questioning-asking children how <b>happy</b> they are <b>with</b> <b>what</b> they got before and after they had seen what they could have got-creates false positive indications of regret in the youngest children and that-when controlling for false positives-regret is not evident before 9 years. However, children before this age make a difference between attractive (three candies) and less attractive (one candy) items (Experiment 4; 6 - to 8 -year-old children). Taken together, this suggests that before 9 years of age children base their judgements solely on what they got without taking into account what they could have got...|$|R
