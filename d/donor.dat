The <b>donors</b> were selected using personal questionnaire, physical examination and testing blood before donation. Blood banks records are used as source of information. The blood <b>donors</b> samples were analyzed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by commercial available kits ELISA method, third generation (from Abbott laboratory, Germany). A sample was considered as HBsAg positive when found twice repeatedly reactive. Reactive samples were not confirmed with addition tests. Results In the evaluation data, we found out that from 79274 of the total healthy blood <b>donors,</b> 15983 were voluntary <b>donors,</b> 52876 were family replacement <b>donors</b> and 10424 commercial blood <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of HBsAg in blood <b>donors</b> was 7. 9 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the {{trends in the}} profile of blood <b>donors</b> from 1995 through 2001 at a large blood center {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Brazil, particularly following the initiation in 1998 of marketing strategies aimed at substituting replacement <b>donors</b> with altruistic repeat <b>donors.</b> METHODS: Using an information system that had been established at the Pro-Blood Foundation/Blood Center of São Paulo (Fundação Pró-Sangue/Hemocentro de São Paulo) in 1994, we collected information on sex, age, and type of donation for the years 1995 - 2001. We classified blood <b>donors</b> as either replacement blood <b>donors</b> (if they stated that the reason for donating was that they had a friend or relative in the hospital) or as altruistic <b>donors.</b> First-time blood <b>donors</b> were those who had not donated in our institution since the establishment of the information system. RESULTS: The percentage of repeat altruistic blood <b>donors</b> increased over time as first-time replacement <b>donors</b> declined for both genders. The proportion of altruistic <b>donors</b> climbed from 20 % of all blood <b>donors</b> in 1995 to 57 % in 2001. In 2001, first-time blood <b>donors</b> represented only 52 % of all <b>donors,</b> as contrasted to 88 % in 1995. Female <b>donors</b> increased from 20 % to 37 % of the <b>donors</b> over the period studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that the São Paulo population has responded well to the marketing strategies that have been introduced in our institution.

Efficacy of this technique is partially dependent upon the degree of partial neurectomy performed on the <b>donor,</b> with increasing degrees of neurectomy giving rise to increasing axon regeneration within the lesioned nerve, but with the consequence of increasing deficit to the <b>donor.</b>|$|E

30|$|This {{calculation}} puts {{very high}} {{weight on the}} treatments with large number of <b>donors.</b> In the data, the number of <b>donors</b> varies widely across treatments, {{and the number of}} other-division <b>donors</b> can be very large. The number of same-division <b>donors</b> ranges from 1 to 8, {{with a standard deviation of}} 2, while the number of non-same-division <b>donors</b> varies from 1 to 45, with a standard deviation of 18. As a result, ADRZ’s calculation is particularly sensitive to the observations on other-division <b>donors</b> from treatments with large numbers of such <b>donors.</b> Because the number of other-division <b>donors</b> can be so much higher, the ratio of the expression in equation (1) for same-division relative to other-division states tends to get blown up by this feature of ADRZ’s calculation.|$|R
40|$|Frequent blood <b>donors</b> become iron deficient. HFE {{mutations}} {{are present}} in over 30 % of <b>donors.</b> A 24 -month study of 888 first time/reactivated <b>donors</b> and 1537 frequent <b>donors</b> measured haemoglobin and iron status to assess how HFE mutations impact the development of iron deficiency erythropoiesis. <b>Donors</b> with two HFE mutations had increased baseline haemoglobin and iron stores as did those with one mutation, albeit to a lesser extent. Over multiple donations haemoglobin and iron status of <b>donors</b> with HFE mutations paralleled those lacking mutations. The prevalence of HFE mutations was not increased in higher intensity <b>donors.</b> Thus, in general, HFE mutations do not temper donation-induced changes in haemoglobin and iron status. However, in Black <b>donors</b> {{there was an increase}} of H 63 D carriers at baseline, from 3 · 7 % in first time/reactivated <b>donors</b> to 15 · 8 % in frequent <b>donors,</b> suggesting that the relative effects of HFE mutations on iron absorption may vary between racial/ethnic groups. In secondary analyses, venous haemoglobin decreased more slowly in <b>donors</b> with ferritin ≥ 12 μg/l; and haemoglobin recovery time was shorter in <b>donors</b> with reticulocyte haemoglobin (CHr) ≥ 32 · 6 pg, indicating that these biochemical measures are better indicators of a <b>donor's</b> response to phlebotomy than their HFE mutation status. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Iron {{deficiency}} anemia is {{an important}} limiting factor {{for the number of}} donations in regular <b>donors.</b> Limited data is available on the iron status in Iranian <b>donors.</b> This study was conduced to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency and its related factors in blood <b>donors</b> at Shiraz blood transfusion centre in 2005. Methods: This descriptive study was done on all blood <b>donors</b> who donated their blood at Shiraz BTO in 2005. We selected 200 first time blood <b>donors</b> (100 female & 100 male), 200 blood <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation every year for at least 3 years and 200 blood <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 to 4 times blood donation per year. Then we filled out a questionnaire and measured Hb, ferretin, MCV and MCHC. Results: The results showed that reduction in iron stores was directly related to the number of donations. (P< 0. 05). In this study, 34 % of female first time blood <b>donors</b> and 11. 9 % of male first time <b>donors</b> had decreased iron stores. 34 % of female first time blood <b>donors,</b> 47. 9 % of female blood <b>donors</b> with history of one blood donation a year and 77 % of female blood <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 time blood donations in one year had decreased levels of iron. 11. 9 % of male first time blood <b>donors,</b> 14. 5 % of male blood <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation a year and 37. 5 % of male blood <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 blood donations every year had iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: It seems that blood donation affects the iron status and if not compensated, it may cause complication in blood <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of iron deficiency in female blood <b>donors</b> is more who therefore require more attention. Iron store levels are more related to number of blood donations per year rather than the number of blood donations in a lifetime.
