40|$|CHDS State/LocalThe Coast Guard has had {{significant}} success conducting response operations during major contingencies. And yet, mission execution has been buoyed and supported {{in an ad}} hoc fashion by the logistics and financial management structure of the organization. Should ad hoc efforts fail in the future, the Coast Guard may find itself unprepared for managing the logistical and financial challenges of widespread contingencies. Shortfalls in the existing approach to contingency preparedness include: a lack of contingency-based financial and logistics policies, unprepared contingency cost accounting mechanisms, a non-resilient financial management community, a lack of geographically <b>focused</b> <b>logistics</b> plans {{for a range of}} contingencies and, operational and logistical professionals are not adequately trained for contingency resource management. Qualitative research and reviews of after action reports indicate that there are solutions to these challenges. Recommendations include establishing policy on cost tracking, pre-contracting and rapid procurement, modifying the financial systems readiness to track costs, developing an information sharing and collaborative construct with other units and agencies using a Contingency Logistics Planning Group (CLPG), building resilience in contingency procurement through Advanced Readiness Contracting, meeting the "human aspects" of business continuity planning and, reconfiguring the long-term training plan for planners, logisticians and procurement personnel.

40|$|Joint Vision 2010 {{introduces}} the emerging operational concepts of Dominant Maneuver. Precision Engagement, <b>Focused</b> <b>Logistics,</b> and Full Dimensional Protection enabled by Information Superiority. Information Superiority is gained through operational architectures that closely couple {{the capabilities of}} sensors, C 2, and shooters. This architecture of future warfare {{can be characterized as}} Network Centric Warfare. The Navy's response to adapt and develop new operational concepts in support of Network Centric Warfare is Information Technology for the Twenty First Century (IT- 21). IT- 21 is a reprioritization of existing Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C 4 I) programs of record focused on accelerating the transition to a personal computer (PC) based tactical and support warfighting network. Battle Labs exist Service wide to aid in this growth process. Battle labs are focused organizations created to explore new technology, concepts, doctrine, or tactics, techniques and procedures to improve the efficiency and combat power of the forces. The Systems Technology Battle Lab was established to inject an academic viewpoint into experiments and research sponsored by the MBC and Commander, Third Fleet (COMTHIRDFLT). Currently, the documentation on the systems installed and how they work together to provide a centralized forum for experimentation and research is inadequate. The purpose of this thesis is to provide the STBL user with a guide describing the capabilities of the STBL and an example of its utilization in an integrated form. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an insight to the {{outsourcing}} decision-making through investigating if the old evaluation/selection criteria and methods still fit with current business priorities or not and, therefore, to identify the appropriate criteria and methods to develop a new selection framework. Since the economic recession of 2008, logistics outsourcing decisions have become more prominent to avoid high fixed costs and heavy investment requirements and to achieve competitive advantages. Design/methodology/approach – This is a focused literature review prepared after analyzing 56 articles related to the logistics service provider (LSP) evaluation and selection methods and criteria during 2008 - 2013. The academic articles are analyzed based on research focus/area, evaluation and selection methodology/methods and evaluation and selection criteria. Then reviewed result is compared with previous literature studies for the periods (1991 - 2008) to identify any possible shifts. Findings – The review reveals that: several problems in current LSPs literature have been identified; the reviewed papers can be categorized into seven groups, the usage and importance of evaluation and selection criteria fluctuate during different periods; 12 crucial criteria have been identified, increasing the importance of specific selection methods and the integrated models and fuzzy logic in logistics literature. Then, a comprehensive LSPs’ evaluation and selection framework has been developed. Originality/value – To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <b>focused</b> <b>logistics</b> outsourcing study that reviews the 2008 - 2013 period in detail, comparing results with previous literature studies, identifies current LSPs literature problems/gaps, new trends and shifts in the way that LSPs are evaluated and selected, identifies crucial selection criteria and proposes a new holistic LSPs evaluation and selection framework. In addition, it identifies important issues for future research.

40|$|CIVINSThis thesis {{analyzes}} the material flows, manpower usage, administrative requirements and procedures, and technical interface needs {{employed in the}} logistics systems onboard aircraft carriers and submarines to determine where Information Technology (IT) {{could be applied to}} reduce life cycle costs and manning demands. The concepts and recommendations derived from this study support the <b>Focused</b> <b>Logistics</b> pillar of Joint Vision 2010 (JV 2010), and guidance of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA), and DoD Directive 5000. 1 (March 15, 1996) to incorporate proven commercial business practices into DoD processes. The first step was to baseline the existing logistics infrastructure for two platforms, namely the aircraft carrier and the submarine, to identify what could be done with IT to make the process more effective. In addition, a broad area search of Navy wide logistics IT insertion initiatives, and numerous discussions with logistics experts across the Navy and their supporting contractor base were made to ensure that recommendations would be pertinent to current issues. Once the data was all compiled, it was analyzed to identify any gaps which could be potentially solved through the insertion of IT. This analysis indicated that the computer migration plan under the Naval Tactical Command Support Systems (NTCSS) application programs was progressing smoothly, and that the communication connectivity issues associated with exchanging real time data were also well underway through the Information Technology 21 st Century (IT- 21) initiatives. The one glaring area which was demanding {{a great deal of time}} for shipboard supply personnel, and was not getting much attention by the Navy logistics leadership, was in the data acquisition point in the system. Thus, for logistics, material tagging technology in support of more efficient receipt and inventory actions needed to be investigated[URL]...|$|E

Accurate and timely information will enable Joint Vision 2020 key tenets: Dominant Maneuver, Precision Engagement, <b>Focused</b> <b>Logistics,</b> and Full Dimensional Protection. These networks are central warfighting platforms in the information age. As these capabilities are developed over time in an evolutionary manner, interoperability on the Net-Centric Warfare (NCW) networks is essential, and both hardware and software systems must be designed in an Open-systems Architecture (OA) fashion to accommodate the vast number of changes anticipated. Professional Program Management will be needed to successfully develop these key warfighting platforms. Materiel Developers will need to recognize the relatively immature nature of the software engineering domains and actively compensate for this immaturity. System software performance capabilities must be much more detailed than typical hardware-centric systems, as the current state of software engineering disciplines is unlikely to satisfy implied, yet critical performance requirements. Essential OA performance characteristics including Maintainability, Upgradability, Interfaces/Interoperability, Reliability, Safety and Security (MUIRSS) must be fully analyzed and clearly communicated to the software developer to ensure the DoD obtains the flexibility and longevity desired from NCW systems...|$|E
