A calibration was carried out {{with the aim of}} performing the quantitative analysis of MVOCs which are the indicators of the active growth of moulds. The calibration procedure followed the one found in the article [19]. Alcohols: 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 3 -octanol and ketones: 1 -octen- 3 -one, 3 -octanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone were used as reference compounds. The detection and quantification limits were determined for each reference compound based on standard deviation of the response and the slope of calibration curve. The highest quantification limit was found for <b>hexanone</b> which was the least abundant compound in chromatograms acquired during the calibration procedure. The quantification limit for <b>hexanone</b> was 3.0  µg m− 3. The quantification limits determined for all other compounds were between 3.0 and 0.7  µg m− 3. The detection and quantification limits were also determined for a group of terpenes and sesquiterpenes based on the calibration procedure carried out for the reference odour compounds mix ISO 17943 (Sigma-Aldrich). The limit of quantification calculated for the least abundant compound which was present in the reference odour mix, geosmin, was 0.5  µg m− 3.|$|E

40|$|Reaction rate {{constants}} of {{the reaction}} of four large ketones with hydroxyl (OH) are investigated behind reflected shock waves using OH laser absorption. The studied ketones are isomers of <b>hexanone</b> and include 2 -hexanone, 3 -hexanone, 3 -methyl- 2 -pentanone, and 4 -methl- 2 -pentanone. Rate constants are measured under pseudo-first-order kinetics at temperatures ranging from 866 K to 1375 K and pressures near 1. 5 atm. The reported high-temperature rate constant measurements are the first direct measurements for these ketones under combustion-relevant conditions. The effects {{of the position of}} the carbonyl group (CO) and methyl (CH 3) branching on the overall rate constant with OH are examined. Using previously published data, rate constant expressions covering, low-to-high temperatures, are developed for acetone, 2 -butanone, 3 -pentanone, and the <b>hexanone</b> isomers studied here. These Arrhenius expressions are used to devise rate rules for H-abstraction from various sites. Specifically, the current scheme is applied with good success to H-abstraction by OH from a series of n-ketones. Finally, general expressions for primary and secondary site-specific H-abstraction by OH from ketones are proposed as follows (the subscript numbers indicate the number of carbon atoms bonded to the next-nearest-neighbor carbon atom, the subscript CO indicates that the abstraction is from a site next to the carbonyl group (CO), and the prime is used to differentiate different neighboring environments of a methylene group) :P 1,CO = 7. 38 × 10 - 14 exp(- 274 K/T) + 9. 17 × 10 - 12 exp(- 2499 K/T) (285 - 1355 K) S 10,CO = 1. 20 × 10 - 11 exp(- 2046 K/T) + 2. 20 × 10 - 13 exp(160 K/T) (222 - 1464 K) S 11,CO = 4. 50 × 10 - 11 exp(- 3000 K/T) + 8. 50 × 10 - 15 exp(1440 K/T) (248 - 1302 K) S 11 ′,CO = 3. 80 × 10 - 11 exp(- 2500 K/T) + 8. 50 × 10 - 15 exp(1550 K/T) (263 - 1370 K) S 21,CO = 5. 00 × 10 - 11 exp(- 2500 K/T) + 4. 00 × 10 - 13 exp(775 K/T) (297 - 1376 K) © 2014 the Partner Organisations...|$|E
30|$|The {{analysis}} of the microbial volatiles {{was focused on the}} compounds with eight carbons in their chains, the so-called C 8 -complex MVOCs [31], particularly the alcohols: 1 -octen- 3 -ol, and 3 -octanol; and ketones: 1 -octen- 3 -one, 2 -octanone and 3 -octanone because they are indicators of the moulds activity, as it was mentioned in the introduction [22, 25, 30, 31]. These compounds are released in high concentrations and are adequate for detecting the metabolic activity of many species [22, 30, 43]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated in the literature that some enzymatic pathways are finished at other volatile products like heptanone and <b>hexanone</b> beside or instead of the C 8 compounds [31]. Other authors have also shown that terpenes and sesquiterpenes are useful bioindicators of the mould activity [28, 44]. Thus, it can be determined that all of the aforementioned groups of compounds are bioindicators {{that can be used for}} the detection of the vegetative mycelium because they distinguish between active and inactive fungi.|$|E

30|$|Although the moulds emit circa 150 MVOCs, in the {{literature}} it has been proposed to detect the active mycelia of moulds based on {{the identification of the}} following compounds: 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 3 -octanol, and 1 -octen- 3 -one, 2 -octanone, 3 -octanone (classified into the so-called eight-carbon compounds, C 8 complex); heptanone, <b>hexanone</b> as well as terpenes and sesquiterpenes [22, 25, 27 – 32] However, the majority of articles related to studies of these compounds concern the analysis of MVOCs emitted by moulds growing on building and construction materials or in microbiologically contaminated rooms. These analyses are mainly related to the assessment of the health risk level for people staying in spaces with the active fungi growth, {{in the context of the}} so-called sick building syndrome (SBS) [20, 24 – 27, 29, 32]. Only few authors analysed the MVOCs emitted by moulds growing on historic objects, e.g. on historic paper [21] or historical cinematographic film [22].

In this paper, we review the novel single vapor phase adsorption of homologous aliphatic ketone series from propanone to <b>hexanone</b> onto ASC. The breakthrough time of propanone was fastest among all vapors ; this behavior is attributed to its physicochemical properties. The results show that physisorption plays a primary role in ketone removal.

40|$|As {{shown by}} {{theoretical}} and experimental results in this thesis, a carefully designed UV-IMS[PID] coupling with oa-TOFMS was successfully self set up. It offers high transmission, simple spectrum, high speed {{and it is}} able to record the whole mass spectrum quasi simultaneously. These features make it attractive to identify ions, fragments or ion clusters in IMS and to conduct high-throughput molecular analysis of large libraries for compound confirmation and purity assessment. By simulation with SIMION v. 7. 0 it was proved that the configuration of the three stage differential pump system and the Einzel lens was suitable for an orthogonal design of an interface between atmospheric pressure and the TOFMS. The pinhole interface system to the UV-IMS [PID]-TOF was characterized by studying a two and a three stage interface. They are optimized and proved to be able to identify ions that has been ionized in IMS. This device has been proved to have unique benefits for volatile organic compounds analysis. The detection limits are in the range of 0. 8 µg/L for acetone, 8. 6 µg/L for ethanol and 17. 2 µg/L for benzene with direct permeation sampling. The instrument has a dynamic range of about 3 decades for all detected compounds. A wide range of applications including chemical weapon simulation substances detection as well as fungal analysis were achieved with this device. It yields simple spectra that facilitate analysis. Compared the results of TOF spectra with UV-IMS spectra, most VOCs appearing in UV-IMS are monomer or protonated monomer ions. For the selected ketones from acetone to nonanone, the most abundant ions are protonated molecular ions and beginning from <b>hexanone,</b> the fragmentation is evident and can be detected in IMS. In the case of selected alcohols, not all of them have base peak corresponding to protonated molecule ions.

40|$|The {{various groups}} {{into which the}} triterpenes are divided are defined and {{emphasis}} is placed on the structural relationships which exist between these groups. A brief description is given of the methods used in the determination of the structure of triterpenes with particular reference to β-asyrin (I), a member of the oleanane (II) group. Recent progressin the problems of biogenesis and the total synthesis of triterpenes is reviewed. All approaches, so far investigated, to the synthesis of pentacyclic triterpenes involve the fusion of two bicyclic moities representing rings A and B and rings D and E of the proposed structure. This thesis describes attempts to synthesise pentacyclic triterpenes of the oleanane (II) group, via the tetracyclic-cis-ketone (IIIa), the tetracyclic-trans-ketone (IIIc) or the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaturated-ketone (IVa). The important bicylic intermediates in these syntheses are 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decaline(Va), 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII); the preparation of the last two compounds has been reported previously by Halsall and Thomas. It was proposed originally to obtain the racemic modification of 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -tri- methyl-trans-decalin from Δ-podocarpen- 7 -one (VIII), the synthesis of which requires large amounts of 2, 2, 6 -trimethyl- cyclohexanone. A rapid technique was developed for the preparation of this compound in high yield from 2 -methylcyclo- <b>hexanone.</b> The availability of sclareol (IX), which is a suitable relay in the synthesis of (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 - exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decalin (Va) led to the abandonment of the route via Δ-podocarpen- 7 -one. Oxidation of sclareol with potassium permaganate gave the enol-ether (X). Ozonolysis of the enol-ether (X), followed by decomposition of the Oozonide (XI) with Raney nickel and reduction of the product with lithium aluminium hydride gave a mixture of 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl) - 6 -hydroxy- 1, 1, 6, 10 - tetramethyl-trans-decalin (XII) and 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl) - 6 - exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans-decalin (Vb). Treatment of either of these compounds with phosphorus oxybromide in pyridine gave (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl) - 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans- decalin (Va), from which ambreinolide (XXIII) was prepared. The crude product, obtained after decomposing the ozonide (XI) with Raney nickel, was reduced with sodium borohydride but only small yields of compounds, which could be characterised were obtained. These were 5 -(2 '-hydroxyethyl- 6 -acetoxy- 1, 1, 6, 10 -tetramethyl-trans-decalin, 5 -carboxymethyl- 6 -acetoxy- 1 - 1 - 6 - 10 -tetramethyl-trans-decalin and the lactone derived from 5 -carboxymethyl- 6 -hydroxy- 1, 1, 6,, 10 -tetramethyl- trans-decaline. The first two of these compounds were obtained also by catalytic hydrogenation of the ozonide (XI); the lactone was the only compound isolated from the product obtained by oxidising the enol-ether (X) with sodium metaperiodate/ osmium tetroxide. It has been predicted on theoretical grounds that that 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) should enolise towards C - 3. Alkylation of this compound with ethyl iodide gave 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-cis-decal- 2 -one, from which a mixture of 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-cis-octal- 2 -one and 3 -ethyl- 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained by brominating and dehydrobrominating. 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl— cis-decal- 2 -one (VI) was brominated in several ways and the crude product was dehydrobrominated to give, in all cases, a mixture of 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-cis-octal- 2 -one and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one. The implications from the results of the alkylation and bromination/dehydrobromination experiments are discussed. Alkynation of (±) - 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) with (+) - 5 -(2 -bromoethyl) — 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl- trans-decalin (Va) gave a mixture of the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaurated ketones (IVa and b). A second product was obtained from this alkylaqtion and may be a mixture of the isomeric tetracyclic-βδ-unsaturated- ketones (XIIIa and b). The tetracyclic-αβ-unstaurated- ketones (IVa and b) were reduced with lithium in liquid ammonia to give the tetracyclic-trans-ketones (IIIc and d) this mixture was resolved. The C, 30 -alcohols (XIVa and/or b) were prepared from the tetracylic-trans-ketones (IIIc and/or d) and lithium methyl, and they were treated with boron trifluoride etherate. A hydrocarbon (or mixture of hydrocarbons } was obtained and was stable to further treatment with acid. Possible products of this series of reactions are oleon- 18 -ene (IV) and 18 βH-olean- 12 —one (XVI); neither of these compounds was isolated. The tetracyclic-hydrocarbons (XVIIa and b) were obtained by treating the tetracyclic-αβ-unsaturated-ketones (IVa and b) with methyl magnesium iodide. Spectroscopic analysis of the product obtained by treating the tetracyclic- hydrocarbons (XVIIa and b) with boron trifluoride etherate, fluoroboric acid or aluminium trichloride in nitromethane indicated that the yields of olean- 11 (12), 13 (18) -diene (XVIII) (one of the expected products of this series of reactions) was greater than that obtained from the tetracyclic-allylic-alcohols (XIXa and b) by Corey and co-workers, who used acetic acid saturated with hydrogen chloride as the cyclising agent. An investigation was made into the stability of the conjugated diene system in 3 β-bezoyl-olean- 11 (12 }, 13 (18) -diene to treatment with acid. An attempt was made to prepare (+) - 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one (XX) for use in the alkynation with (+) - 5 -(2 '-bromoethyl- 6 -exomethylene- 1, 1, 10 -trimethyl-trans- decalin (Va). Only partial resolution of (±) - 7, 7, 10 -tri- methyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) was achieved using standard procedures. 10 -Carbethoxy- 7, 7,dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one (XXIa) has been resolved and in the present work the racemic modification of this compound. was converted into 7, 7, 10 -tri- methyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one by two routes. It is possible therefore, to obtoin the optical isomers of 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one (VII) by an indirect method. The carbonyl group was protected by preparing the dioxolane-derivative (XXIIa), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb). In naming dioxolane derivatives in this abstract it is assumed that the double bond is in the Δ position; no evidence was obtained to confirm this. 10 -Methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 - dioxolane (XXIIc) was prepared by treating 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb) with methane sulphonyl chloride. the two routets to 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ- octal- 2 -one diverge at this stage. In the first method 10 -methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 - dioxolane (XXIIc) was converted to the dioxolane-methanethiol (XXIId), which without purification, was desulphurised with hydrazine. The dioxolane protecting group was removed from the product and 7, 7, 10 -trimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained. In the second method 10 -methanesulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl- Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIc) was converted to 10 -iodomethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIe), which was reduced with lithium aluminium hydride. The product was hydrolysed and 7, 7, 10 -trimethly-Δ-octal- 2 -one was obtained. 10 -(+) -Camphor- 10 -sulphonyloxymethyl- 7, 7,-dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 - one- 2 -dioxolene (XXIIf) was prepared by treating 10 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 7 -dimethyl-Δ-octal- 2 -one- 2 -dioxolane (XXIIb) with (+) -camphor- 10 -sulphonyl chloride; the cli? ^tei^eoiaoi for;. ^ of tlie ? f / 4 *dinltro_ ^•^. hydrfu. orue ve,-e resolved by euaiia' tion.
