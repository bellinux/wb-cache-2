25|$|Lord Lowborough, {{a friend}} of Huntingdon's and Anabella's husband, is apathetic but devoted. Melancholic, dour and gloomy, he is in {{complete}} contrast to Huntingdon. He used to gamble and <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much alcohol and developed an addiction to opium, but after his financial ruin gradually reforms himself. Lowborough truly loves Annabella, and her infidelity brings him such suffering that only his Christian faith and strong will keep him from suicide. Later he divorces her and after some time marries a plain middle-aged woman, who makes a good wife to him and a stepmother to his children with Annabella — {{a son and a}} nominal daughter. Lord Lowborough also has some resemblances to Branwell, such as a life of debauchery, periods of remorse/religious torments, and opium, as well as moral weakness.|$|E
500|$|The twice-divorced Brett Ashley {{represented}} the liberated New Woman (in the 1920s, divorces were common {{and easy to}} be had in Paris). James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created {{one of the more}} fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: in her presence, the men <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much and fight. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes a Circe in the festival. Critics describe her variously as complicated, elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway [...] "treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy." [...] She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the other women in the book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.|$|E
500|$|By October, when {{he arrived}} in Los Angeles to prepare for the tour, a {{combination}} of Harrison's business commitments, his dedication to projects by his Dark Horse acts, and a lifestyle that Leng terms [...] "one <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> many, too frequently" [...] meant that production on Harrison's Dark Horse album was severely behind schedule. For three weeks, by day Harrison rehearsed with his tour band, which included Tom Scott, Billy Preston, Jim Horn, Robben Ford, Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark, at the A studio complex on La Brea Avenue, Hollywood. In the evenings, he added vocals and other overdubs to tracks rush-recorded at Friar Park. He had intended to finish [...] "Dark Horse" [...] in this way but decided instead to re-record the track, since the musicians were having to learn the song for inclusion in the concert setlist.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, King {{described}} [...] "Chasing Death" [...] {{as being}} about alcoholism: [...] "it's {{like people who}} <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much. They don't help themselves out so they're chasing death." [...] He explained [...] "Implode" [...] as being {{about the end of}} the world. The album could feature material written by Hanneman prior to his passing. Araya has explained that Hanneman had two songs that he submitted to the rest of the band. One song was an outtake from World Painted Blood, which Araya said that he and Hanneman had been working on melody and lyrics for. Additionally, Araya has said that he plans to go through Hanneman's personal audio files, and that some of that material could also find its way onto the new album in one form or another. One song, mentioned by King in an interview, is [...] "Piano Wire," [...] an unfinished track that Hanneman had been working on for the previous album. King also mentioned that there were two other songs that Hanneman had been holding onto for the last 15 to 20 years that will be released.|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows. Not every song we have is the best mosh song, so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for." ...|$|E
500|$|For one of {{his side}} projects, Chris Thile {{knew he wanted to}} form a string quintet {{composed}} of mandolin, violin, banjo, guitar, and bass with childhood friend and fiddler Gabe Witcher, but didn’t know which direction he wanted to take the band. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Telluride, Colorado, Thile met banjoist Noam Pikelny and later commented that “every note he played was something I wish I’d played”. It was then that Thile realized that he wanted to “put [...] stamp on the traditional bluegrass ensemble”. Thile wanted to get five musicians together for a Nashville jam session in 2005, after he found talented bluegrass musicians that could fill the positions. The bassist Thile was searching for, Greg Garrison, was recommended to Thile by Pikelny, who had performed alongside Garrison in the Cajun jam band Leftover Salmon. The guitar position was filled by Chris Eldridge, from the bluegrass band the Infamous Stringdusters. The five musicians met up in Nashville one day in 2005 and decided that they needed to “do something musical together”. A few nights later, the group met again “just to drop a ton of money, <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships”. That night, they came to an agreement and formed a bluegrass band.|$|E

2500|$|For {{those who}} have healthy kidneys, it is rather {{difficult}} to <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of water intoxication (hyperhydration), which can be fatal. The popular claim that [...] "a person should consume eight glasses of water per day" [...] {{seems to have no}} real basis in science. Studies have shown that extra water intake, especially up to 500ml at mealtime was conducive to weight loss. Adequate fluid intake is helpful in preventing constipation.|$|E

He does not conceal it well and starts to <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much. When David's aunt, Mrs. Atwater, who fancies herself a fortune-teller, tells him that his hands will bring him great fame, she is referring to his skill at the piano, but he appears to think this refers to the notoriety of being a strangler.|$|E

2500|$|..... Greenstreet {{chatters}} {{about the}} falcon {{while waiting for}} a drugged drink to knock out Bogart. Huston's strategy is crafty. Earlier, Greenstreet has set it up by making a point: [...] "I distrust a man who says 'when.' If he's {{got to be careful}} not to <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much, it's because he's not to be trusted when he does." [...] Now he offers Bogart a drink, but Bogart doesn't sip from it. Greenstreet talks on, and tops up Bogart's glass. He still doesn't drink. Greenstreet watches him narrowly. They discuss the value of the missing black bird. Finally, Bogart drinks, and passes out. The timing is everything; Huston doesn't give us closeups of the glass to underline the possibility that it's drugged. He depends on the situation to generate the suspicion in our minds.|$|E

2500|$|In US soap operas, a {{well-known}} example of forced seduction is the supercouple Luke and Laura from General Hospital. In Thai television soap opera, {{the theme is}} quite common. A Thai study from 2008 reported that among 2000 viewers aged 13 to 19, 20 percent reported that the rapes were their favorite element in soaps, and an equal number thought that [...] "rape was a normal and acceptable element in society". Sitthiwat Tappan, a director of Thai soaps, said that the depicted and suggested rapes in these shows provide a valuable lesson: they teach women not to venture out alone or dress provocatively, and teach men not to <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much. In 2014, the {{rape and murder of}} a thirteen-year-old girl on a train resulted in intense public discussion around the propagation of rape culture. A petition to [...] "stop romanticizing rape on television" [...] quickly received 30,000 signatures.|$|E
2500|$|As the country's {{economic}} position worsened in 1989, {{public opinion}} {{moved away from}} Labor, however there was no firm opinion poll lead for Howard or the Coalition. In February, Liberal Party president and prominent businessman, John Elliott, said confidentially to Andrew Peacock that he would support him in a leadership challenge against Howard, and in May a surprise leadership coup was launched, ousting Howard as Liberal leader. When asked that day whether he could become Liberal leader again, Howard likened it to [...] "Lazarus with a triple bypass". The loss of the Liberal Party leadership to Peacock deeply affected Howard, who admitted he would occasionally <b>drink</b> <b>too</b> much. Declining Peacock's offer of Shadow Education, Howard went to the backbench and a new period of party disunity ensued.
