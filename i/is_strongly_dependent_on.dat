5|$|It was {{expected}} that the change in reaction would quintuple the probability of synthesizing unbinilium, as the yield of such reactions <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> their asymmetry. Three correlated signals were observed on 18 May 2011 that matched the predicted alpha decay energies of 299Ubn and its daughter 295Og, {{as well as the}} experimentally known decay energy of its granddaughter 291Lv: the decay chain could thus be interpreted as beginning from 299Ubn and undergoing four successive alpha decays to the spontaneously fissioning 283Cn, with the final alpha from 287Fl having been missed. However, the lifetimes of these possible decays differed from theoretical expectations, and the results could not be confirmed due to lack of beam time.|$|E

The economy of southeastern British Columbia <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River would have resulted in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At {{the opposite end of the}} scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E

5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
