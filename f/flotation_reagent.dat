40|$|Cryogenic {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (cryo-SEM), image analysis (IA) of SEM micrographs and X-ray microtomography (XMT) were used to obtain new information about the morphology of iron ore green pellets in this work. Cryo-SEM and freeze fracturing was used to observe entrapped air bubbles and arrangement of particles around the bubbles and in the matrix of wet green pellets. The observations of samples prepared by plunge and unidirectional freezing indicate that unidirectional freezing facilitates the observation of entrapped bubbles with minimum formation of artifacts, whereas plunge freezing enables observation {{of the degree of}} water filling at the outer surface of wet pellets with minimum amount of artifacts. It was also observed in the wet pellets that the size of the water domains in the matrix is quite small and the finer grains are mixed with coarser grains resulting in a denser matrix, whereas no fine grains were observed {{in the vicinity of the}} air bubbles. Two types of pellets prepared with and without addition of extra <b>flotation</b> <b>reagent</b> prior to balling were studied using IA and XMT. IA of scanning electron micrographs of epoxy impregnated pellets was used to separate bubble porosity from packing porosity and to quantify the former. The individual SEM micrographs acquired by a backscattered electron detector were reconstructed to provide the entire two-dimensional (2 D) sections of the pellets. The 2 D data obtained by IA were unfolded to three-dimensional (3 D) by stereology and relatively good agreement with XMT data was observed. The size and amount of air bubbles could be quantified with both techniques. The addition of extra <b>flotation</b> <b>reagent</b> was found to increase the number of entrapped air bubbles and slightly decrease the median bubble diameter. The additional entrapped air bubbles due to the addition of extra <b>flotation</b> <b>reagent</b> was shown to be responsible for the difference in total porosity observed by mercury porosimetry between the two types of pellets. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) is shown in this work to produce inappropriate results with regard to the porosity due to bubble entrapment, it only provides values for total porosity and the throat size distribution of the porosity. In summary, this work has shown that cryo-SEM, IA of SEM micrographs and XMT are powerful and very useful methods for characterization of the morphology of iron ore green pellets.

40|$|Abstract The {{fundamental}} {{formation of}} the three phase contact in flotation is an intensively and controversially discussed phenomenon and the contact angle method is usually employed to characterise the wettability of solid surfaces. A more recent technique to explore the hydrophobicity of solid particulate phases is inverse gas chromatography (iGC) {{which is used to}} quantify the wettability of solid surfaces through thermodynamic parameters. In this article, the recently introduced net free energy of interaction between particles and bubbles immersed in water ΔGpwb is derived from the surface free energy analysis and its correlation to the flotability of solid phases is evaluated. At the same time, a more detailed analysis on the action of <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> is presented performing iGC measurements under dry and flotation experiments under aqueous conditions. In general, <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> have to satisfy required features to adsorb selectively, render the solid surface wetting property sufficiently, and comply current regulations concerning the preservation of the environment.

This study is concentrated on the investigation of aminated CNCs for the flotation of quartz in comparison to conventional reagents.

The chemical composition of this waste depends on the phase in which it was created, but typically includes: unreacted alkali hydroxide, solvent - alcohol and trithiocarbonate and oxidation product - dixanthogenate. In this paper a new laboratory procedure for the treatment of such wastes is described. The identification and separation of industrial waste components is also included. From the separated dixantogenate and xanthate a laboratory synthesis of thioncarbamates is given. In addition, a semi-industrial treatment of waste xanthate is presented. Synthesis of N-alkyl and N,N-dialkyl-O-isobutylthioncarbamates were obtained from the filtrate obtained in the first step. As a by-product, sodium thioglycolate was produced. This by-product is transformed to a thioglycolic acid by the addition of an acid. Also, the synthesis of thioncarbamates from dixanthogenates, isolated from industrial waste as a cake, is desribed. Described waste treatment is additionally interesting due to the production of sulphur as another by-product. Laboratory synthesis gave thioncarbamates in yields from 69. 7 to 87. 7 %, while the semi-industrial process for the selected batches produced thioncarbamates in yields from 74. 2 to 80. 5 %.

40|$|Abstract: The {{interaction}} of <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> with metal and mineral surfaces {{have been studied}} with electrochemistry and Raman spectroscopy. <b>Flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> are used to selectively recover valuable minerals (typically particles about 10 microns in diameter) and to suppress the froth flotation of unwanted components by altering the hydrophobicity of the mineral surface.

The predominant collectors used in the froth flotation proc-ess for sulfide minerals are alkyl dithiocarbonates (xanthates ROCS 2) and similar thio compounds. The reagents adsorb onto mineral surfaces at sub-monolayer levels and can be “tailored ” by altering the R group. Xanthate-mineral interaction occurs by an electrochemical mechanism in which the anodic oxidation of the collector is coupled with the reduction of oxygen at the mineral surface. It has been shown electrochemically [1] that anodic oxidation of xanthate can result in chemisorption of a xanthate radical, and/or dimerization to form dixanthogen.

40|$|The paper {{represents}} {{the results of}} development of a technology for obtaining oxane- 3 and its application for enrichment of carbon mineral raw materials. Studies on enrichment of a shungite rock showed that the increase of a pulp temperature to 30 °C significantly improves the characteristics and rate of the flotation process. Measured indicators of a shungite rock enrichment using Flotol B were lower in comparison with an enrichment by oxane- 3. For schungite mineral, it was established that the obtained heterocyclic compound can replace existing industrial <b>flotation</b> <b>reagents</b> in enrichment processes...|$|R
