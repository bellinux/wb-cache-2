5|$|In 1839 Buxton {{was invited}} to join the natural <b>history</b> <b>class</b> at the Manchester Mechanics' Institute where he helped compile the Flora Mancuniensis (1840) along with Leo Hartley Grindon, George Crozier and James Crowther under the editorship of John Bland Wood. He became an {{acknowledged}} expert on mosses, and William Hooker, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew was so impressed with his skills that he hoped to employ him as a herbarium assistant. Although this never came about, Hooker gave Buxton a number of botanical books and, at some point, Buxton accepted the position of President of the Manchester Working Men's Botanical Society.|$|E
5|$|To escape racial discrimination, his {{children}} passed into white society: the four surviving sons married white spouses; his unmarried daughter {{lived with a}} brother. They worked as teachers, a lawyer, and business people. Smith's unique achievements as a pioneering African-American doctor were rediscovered by 20th-century historians. They were relearned by his descendants {{in the twenty-first century}} when a three-times-great-granddaughter took a <b>history</b> <b>class</b> and found his name in her grandmother's family bible. In 2010, several Smith descendants commissioned a new tombstone for his grave in Brooklyn. They gathered to honor him and their African-American ancestry.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Farmer arrived at Kentucky, the roster had been decimated. Standout {{shooting}} guard Rex Chapman entered the 1988 NBA Draft, ending his collegiate eligibility. Sophomore Eric Manuel was held out of basketball activities pending {{the outcome of}} an investigation into his ACT scores. Signees Shawn Kemp and Sean Woods failed to qualify academically, and Chris Mills was {{under investigation by the}} NCAA for cash allegedly sent to his father by assistant coach Dwane Casey in violation of the Association's amateurism rules. A viral illness forced Farmer to miss {{about a third of the}} team's preseason practices. Once he was able to practice, Coach Eddie Sutton related that he lacked the conditioning to finish most practices. The Lexington Herald-Leaders Jerry Tipton later reported that Farmer had to leave practice half an hour early two days a week to attend his American <b>History</b> <b>class.</b> Sutton also opined that Farmer's high school competition was inferior to that of Los Angeles native Mills, but Farmer's high school coach pointed out that, during Farmer's senior season, 20 of his team's games were against teams ranked in the top 20 in their respective states.|$|E
5|$|Instead of the {{traditional}} summer camp at Fort Clinton, MacArthur had the cadets trained to use modern weapons by regular army sergeants at Fort Dix; they then marched back to West Point with full packs. He attempted to modernize the curriculum by adding liberal arts, government and economics courses, but encountered strong resistance from the Academic Board. In Military Art classes, {{the study of the}} campaigns of the American Civil War was replaced with the study of those of World War I. In <b>History</b> <b>class,</b> more emphasis was placed on the Far East. MacArthur expanded the sports program, increasing the number of intramural sports and requiring all cadets to participate. He allowed upper class cadets to leave the reservation, and sanctioned a cadet newspaper, The Brag, forerunner of today's West Pointer. He also permitted cadets to travel to watch their football team play, and gave them an allowance of $5 ($ in modern dollars) a month. Professors and alumni alike protested these radical moves. Most of MacArthur's West Point reforms were soon discarded but, in the ensuing years, his ideas became accepted and his innovations were gradually restored.|$|E
5|$|Book Nine, Nsara, {{follows the}} life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the {{aftermath}} of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates. Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave {{the life of}} captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrols in university where she studies history. The <b>history</b> <b>class</b> is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic).|$|E

While still at West Point, the <b>history</b> <b>class</b> motivated him to conduct first-person historical research, seeking out his grandfather’s surviving crew members, researched {{the story of his}} grandfather, and among others photographed approximately 30,000 documents from archives in Bern, Berlin and Washington D.C.
