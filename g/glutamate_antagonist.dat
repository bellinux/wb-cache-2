Glutamate regulates proliferation and migration of neurons during development, {{but it is}} not known whether it influences proliferation and migration of tumor cells. We demonstrate that <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonists</b> inhibit proliferation of human tumor cells. Colon adenocarcinoma, astrocytoma, and breast and lung carcinoma cells were most sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist dizocilpine, whereas breast and lung carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and neuroblastoma cells responded most favorably to the α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole-propionate antagonist GYKI 52466. The antiproliferative effect of <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonists</b> was Ca 2 + dependent and resulted from decreased cell division and increased cell death. Morphological alterations induced by <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonists</b> in tumor cells consisted of reduced membrane ruffling and pseudopodial protrusions.

These observations reveal that N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonists may increase neurodestruction in mature brain undergoing slowly progressing neurodegeneration, whereas blockade of the action of glutamate at α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazole-propionate receptors may be neuroprotective...|$|R

40|$|Phasic {{and tonic}} light {{responses}} provide a fundamental division of visual {{information that is}} thought to originate in the inner retina. However, evidence presented here indicates that this duality originates in the outer retina. In response to a steady light stimulus, the temporal responses of On-bipolar cells fell into two groups.

40|$|The ventrolateral {{thalamus}} (VL) is {{a primary}} relay point between the basal ganglia and the primary motor cortex (M 1). Using dual probe microdialysis and locomotor behavior monitoring, we investigated the contribution of VL input into M 1 during amphetamine (AMPH) ‐stimulated monoamine release and hyperlocomotion in rats. Tetrodotoxin (10  μM) perfusion into the VL significantly lowered hyperactivity induced by AMPH (1  mg/kg i. p.). This behavioral response corresponded to reduced cortical glutamate and monoamine release. To determine which glutamate receptors the thalamocortical projections acted upon, we perfused either the α‐amino‐ 3 ‐(3 ‐hydroxy‐ 5 ‐methyl‐isoxazol‐ 4 ‐yl) propanoic acid (AMPA) /kainate receptor antagonist 2, 3 ‐dihydroxy‐ 6 ‐nitro‐ 7 ‐sulfamoyl‐benzo[f]quinoxaline‐ 2, 3 ‐dione (NBQX) (10  μM) or the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist (MK‐ 801) intracortically followed by systemic AMPH. The results show that AMPA/kainate, {{and to a lesser}} extent NMDA receptors, mediated the observed effects. As glutamate–monoamine interactions could possibly occur through local or circuit‐based mechanisms, we isolated and perfused M 1 tissue ex vivo to determine the extent of local glutamate–dopamine interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AMPH generates hyperlocomotive states via thalamocortical signaling and that cortical AMPA receptors are an important mediator of these effects. This study utilizes dual probe microdialysis sampling and comprehensive LC‐MS analysis to determine the effects of amphetamine (1  mg/kg i. p.) on thalamocortical neurotransmission.

Its regular frequency of firing is modulated during several distinct behaviors. The pacemaker nucleus continues firing regularly when isolated in vitro, and modulatory behaviors can be reproduced by stimulating the descending input pathway.

40|$|AbstractWe studied {{feedback}} from horizontal cells to cones in isolated goldfish retinae {{and found that}} surround stimuli evoke an inward current and a slowly developing outward current. The surround-evoked currents are blocked by the <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonist</b> 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (DNQX) and are, like horizontal cell responses, most effectively evoked by large stimuli. This indicates that the currents are caused by {{feedback from}} horizontal cells. The surround-evoked inward current is neither blocked by picrotoxin nor carried by chloride. Instead, it is carried by calcium, and it triggers a slowly developing calcium-dependent chloride current. We were unable to mimick the surround-evoked currents by modulating the extracellular GABA concentration. We conclude that when horizontal cells hyperpolarize they feed back to the cones by shifting the cone calcium-current activation range to more negative potentials. This type of feedback, directly targeted at the calcium current, scarcely influences the membrane potential of the receiving neuron, but effectively modulates its synaptic output...|$|E

They were then presented 200 ms stimuli at 17 wavelengths and several irradiances. Spectral sensitivity was calculated from the b-wave components ofthe ERG responses. Retinal injection of CNQX impacted the a-, b-, and d-waves ofthe ERG, especially at longer wavelengths. Significant differences in the spectral sensitivity functions of the CNQX and saline groups were found at 460 nm and 540 urn-the location ofM - Sand L - M color opponent mechanisms; thus, CNQX suppresses the color-opponent mechanisms. The fact that CNQX selectively affects sensitivity at longer wavelengths supports the presence of multiple Off-bipolar cell types.

40|$|Vigabatrin (γ-vinyl-GABA) is an {{irreversible}} inhibitor of {{the enzyme}} γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase.

Here, we use a guinea pig cortical tissue slice model to identify the metabolic sequelae of vigabatrin when incubated with tissue slices alone or when the tissue slices were activated by ligands with targeted activating mechanisms. We show that incubation of slices with AMPA, the group II metabotropic <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonist</b> EGLU [(2 S) -α-ethylglutamic acid], or the GABA BR antagonist CGP 52432 in the presence of vigabatrin produces very similar metabolic profiles, consistent with the large-scale turning off of metabolic activity.

40|$|Prepulse {{inhibition}} of startle (PPI), {{a measure of}} sensorimotor gating used to identify antipsychotics, is reduced in schizophrenia patients and in rodents treated with dopamine agonists or glutamate antagonists. The National institute of Menial Health (NIMH) -funded Measurement And Treatment Research to improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) program has initiated {{a new era in}} the development of procognitive cotreatments in schizophrenia, independently of treating positive symptoms. Although PPI is not a cognitive process per se, such abnormalities in attention may be predictive of or lead to cognitive deficits. Since first-generation antipsychotics block PPI deficits induced by dopamine agonists, this model cannot identify cognitive enhancers for use as cotreatments with antipsychotics, PPI deficits caused by glutamate antagonists, like the exacerbation of symptoms they produce in patients, are insensitive to dopamine antagonists, but reduced by clozapine. Similarly, both PPI and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia patients are insensitive to firstgeneration antipsychotics, but attenuated by clozapine. Hence, treatment-induced reversals of <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonist</b> effects on PPI may provide animal and human models to identify treatments of cognitive deficits in patients already treated with existing antipsychotics...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of dizocilpine malate (MK- 801), a non-competitive <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonist,</b> in the model of 10 -min gerbil cerebral ischemia. Gerbils were given MK- 801 (3 mg/kg i. p.) or saline immediately after the occlusion. On day 4 after reperfusion, neuronal damage was examined in the hippocampus (30 μm) and striatum slices (5 μm) stained with hematoxylin/eosin, fluorescent Nissl staining and membrane tracer DiI. The striatum and C 3 regions of the hippocampus were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Neuroprotection was determined by quantifying the degree of cell loss, reduction of morphologically damaged cells, and the degree of preservation of recognizable neuroanatomical pathways after the ischemic insult. Our results demonstrate that the neuronal damage induced by sustained ischemia is related to abnormalities in glutamatergic function associated with NMDA receptors.

In the present study we investigated the cardiorespiratory effects of unilateral microinjections of the broad spectrum <b>glutamate</b> <b>antagonist</b> kynurenic acid (2 nmol/ 200 nl) along the VMS of urethane-anesthetized rats. Within the VMS only one region was responsive to this drug. This area includes most of the intermediate respiratory area, partially overlapping the rostral ventrolateral medulla (IA/RVL). When microinjected into the IA/RVL, kynurenic acid produced a respiratory depression, without changes in mean arterial pressure or heart rate. The respiratory depression observed was characterized by a decrease in ventilation, tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow {{and an increase in}} respiratory frequency. Therefore, the observed respiratory depression was entirely due to a reduction in the inspiratory drive. Microinjections of vehicle (200 nl of saline) into this area produced no significant changes in breathing pattern, blood pressure or heart rate.
