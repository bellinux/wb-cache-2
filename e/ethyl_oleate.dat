50|$|<b>Ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> {{is one of}} the {{fatty acid}} ethyl esters (FAEE) that is formed in the body after {{ingestion}} of ethanol. There is {{a growing body of research}} literature that implicates FAEEs such as <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> as the toxic mediators of ethanol in the body (pancreas, liver, heart, and brain). Among the speculations is that <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> may be the toxic mediator of alcohol in fetal alcohol syndrome. The oral ingestion of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> has been carefully studied and due to rapid degradation in the digestive tract it appears safe for oral ingestion. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> is not currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any injectable use. However, it is used by compounding pharmacies as a vehicle for intramuscular drug delivery, in some cases to prepare the daily doses of progesterone in support of pregnancy.

50|$|One {{method for}} {{industrial}} production of dried cherries involves first dipping them in a boiling 0.5-2% solution of sodium carbonate for up to 20 seconds, and then rinsing in cool water; this induces small cracks in the skin and speeds up the drying process. Some other possible materials for the dipping solution include <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and oleyl alcohol; adding alkalis like potassium carbonate to such a dip was shown to have no positive effect on drying time. Such results had already been demonstrated in scientific research by the 1940s. Dried cherries might also be produced by freeze drying or air drying.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to other drugs consumed, alcohol is deposited {{directly in the}} hair. For this reason the investigation procedure looks for direct products of ethanol metabolism. The main part of alcohol is oxidized in the human body. This means it is released as water and carbon dioxide. One part of the alcohol reacts with fatty acids to produce esters. The sum of the concentrations of four of these fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs: ethyl myristate, ethyl palmitate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and ethyl stearate) are used as indicators of the alcohol consumption. The amounts found in hair are measured in nanograms (one nanogram equals only one billionth of a gram), however {{with the benefit of}} modern technology, it is possible to detect such small amounts. In the detection of ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, testing can detect amounts in picograms (one picogram equals 0.001 nanograms).|$|E

The pheromone <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> {{used in this study}} acts as a primer pheromone in honeybees. The behavior of guard bees was examined after direct exposure to <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> by recording the number of treated bees present in the hive.

40|$|Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.) is {{an internationally}} {{consumed}} vegetable containing high amounts of vitamins (C, A and E) and minerals (phosphorus, potassium, and calcium). It has many medicinal properties like anti-diabetic, anti-infective, antipyretic, anthelmintic, antifungal, androgenic, antiviral, antimalarial actions and is widely recommended in daily diet. Despite of many advantages, proper processing and value addition {{have not been}} explored yet. Drying with appropriate pretreatments can extend the shelf life and availability of the product for consumption throughout the year. The present work investigates various physico-chemical and textural properties of Bitter gourd and explores the effects of different pre-treatments on drying characteristics of Bitter gourd. The textural properties were dependent on the size and were significantly (P< 0. 05) different for small, medium and large size of Bitter gourds. However, {{there was no such}} difference for physical properties such as geometric mean diameter, sphericity, surface area, aspect ratio, bulk density, true density and coefficient of friction. Various drying characteristics like moisture ratio, drying rate, moisture diffusivity, shrinkage ratio and rehydration efficiency were determined. The drying of the pre-treated Bitter gourd was mathematically modelled for three temperatures (50, 60 and 70 ºC). The dried samples were analysed for biochemical quality parameters like colour, vitamin C, total phenolic compounds, 2 - 2 diphenyl picryl hydrazyl, and ferric antioxidant reducing power. To improve the drying quality pre-treatments like hot water blanching, microwave blanching, <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> dipping and combination of these pre-treatments were given to Bitter gourds. At 70 ºC, not pre-treated samples had maximum (190 min) drying time whereas the combined <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and microwave blanched samples had minimum (100 min) drying time. Thus, <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> treated microwave blanched samples significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the drying time at all three temperatures. Drying temperature had significant (P< 0. 05) effect on moisture ratio. Increased temperature reduced the drying time of the samples. Pre-treatment and drying temperature had significant (P< 0. 05) effect on the moisture diffusivity of Bitter gourd. The moisture diffusivity was found lowest in not pre-treated samples (2. 65 to 4. 85 x 10 - 8 m 2 /s) and highest in <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> treated microwave blanched samples (3. 86 to 7. 48 x 10 - 8 m 2 /s). The moisture diffusivity was also dependent on temperature and the value increased from 3. 86 to 7. 48 x 10 - 8 m 2 /s with increase in drying temperature from 50 to 70 ºC. The activation energy was minimum (22. 44 KJ/mol) for water blanched samples and was maximum (30. 55 KJ/mol) for <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> treated microwave blanched samples. At 70 ºC not pre-treated samples showed the highest (80. 2 %) shrinkage ratio whereas <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> treated microwave blanched samples showed the lowest (52. 06 %) shrinkage ratio. As the drying temperature increased from 50 to 70 ºC the shrinkage ratio increased significantly (P< 0. 05) from 70. 3 to 80. 2 %. The lowest and highest rehydration ratio was found in not pre-treated and <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> treated microwave samples respectively. The rehydration ratio increased from 3. 49 to 4. 9 % for not pre-treated samples as the drying temperature increased from 50 to 70 ºC.

HTL of algae producing bio-oil has the advantage of energy efficiency and capability of dealing with wet biomass. Very {{little is known about the}} mechanism and chemistry of biomacromolecules reactions in high temperature water (HTW). In this project, we overcome the existing gap by studying <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> phenylalanine, phytol, and DOPC as representative model compounds for triglycerides, proteins, chlorophyll and phospholipid, respectively, in HTW. We examined the behavior of model compounds from 175 – 350 °C. Hydrolysis of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> (to oleic acid) was autocatalytic. A phenomenological and mechanistic kinetics model was developed that was consistent with the experimental data. We suggest that hydrolysis of ester is catalyzed by both H+ and fatty acid. Phenylalanine primarily formed phenylethylamine, while minor products included styrene and phenylethanol isomers. Major products from phytol included neophytadiene, isophytol, and phytone, while pristene, phytene, phytane, and dihydrophytol were the minor products. Phenylalanine and phytol disappearance followed first order kinetics. DOPC hydrolyzed to form 1 -acyl and 2 -acyl lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) along with oleic acid as primary products. LPC subsequently formed other phosphorus-containing intermediates, which finally led to phosphoric acid as the ultimate P-containing product. Hydrolysis of DOPC was catalyzed by oleic and phosphoric acids. A kinetics model based on proposed pathways was consistent with experimental data for the model compound. Lastly, we studied the effects of inorganic (salts and boric acid) and organic (<b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate)</b> additives on phenylalanine conversion and product distribution at 250 °C and 350 °C, respectively. Inorganic additives increased phenylalanine conversion favoring formation of high molecular weight compounds. Higher concentration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> lead to an increase in the rates of deamination of phenylethylamine and hydration of styrene. Amides are also formed due to the interaction of fatty acid/ethyl oleate and amines/ammonia.

This result was not secondary to failure of absorption of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> as 1 [4 Cqoleic acid and ethyl 11 -' 4 Cioleate were absorbed to a similar extent. Furthermore, developing intestine was able to remove the ethyl group and then re-esterify the fatty acid to form triacylglycerol. These studies indicate that oleic acid-induced mucosal injury can be abolished when the carboxylic group of the fatty acid is esteri-fied with an ethyl, but not a glycerol, group. Since the ethyl ester is also absorbed and metabolized similarly to the free fatty acid, this may provide a means of supplying long-chain fatty acids to developing intestine without causing mucosal dam-age.

The acylation of 6 -amino- 1 -hexanol by <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> in 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol catalysed by Novozym 435 ® has been investigated and modelled. This acylation process generated two products issued respectively from the O-acylation of the 6 -amino- 1 -hexanol, and from the N-acylation of the O-acyl product, {{which leads to the}} N,O-diacyl product. Experimental results confirmed the sequential reaction scheme. An experimental approach was adopted to identify the impact of several operating conditions on the reaction performances, such as initial substrates molar ratio and stirring rate. The kinetics of enzyme deactivation was also studied and included in the kinetic model. The establishment of the kinetic model was based on three major hypotheses: (i) a sequential bi bi ping-pong enzymatic mechanism, (ii) an interaction between acyl-acceptor and the acyl-enzyme formation steps, (iii) the absence of influence of the residual hydrolysis of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> on the kinetics. Under this hypothesis, the kinetic parameters of the model were quantified using a genetic-evolutionary algorithm as an innovative identification method.

Phenylethylamine forms via decarboxylation of phenylalanine, styrene forms via deamination of phenylethylamine, and phenylethanol forms via hydration of styrene. We quantified the molar yields of each product at the four temperatures, and the carbon recovery was between 80 – 100 [*]% for most cases. Phenylalanine disappearance follows first‐order kinetics with an activation energy of 144 ± 14  kJ[*]mol − 1 and a pre‐exponential factor of 10 12. 4 ± 1. 4  min − 1. A kinetics model based on the proposed pathways {{was consistent with the}} experimental data. Effects of five different salts (NaCl, NaNO 3, Na 2 SO 4, KCl, K 2 HPO 4) and boric acid (H 3 BO 3) on phenylalanine behavior at 250 [*]°C have also been elucidated. These additives increase phenylalanine conversion, but decrease the yield of phenylethylamine presumably by promoting formation of high molecular weight compounds. Lastly, binary mixtures of phenylalanine and <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> have been studied at 350 [*]°C and three different molar concentration ratios. The presence of phenylalanine enhances the conversion of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and molar yields of fatty acid. Higher concentration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> leads to increased deamination of phenylethylamine and hydration of styrene. Amides are also formed due to the interaction of oleic acid/ethyl oleate and phenylethylamine/ammonia and lead to a decrease in the fatty acid yields. Taken collectively, these results provide new insights into the reactions of algae during its hydrothermal liquefaction to produce crude bio‐oil. High Temperature Water: Several products are quantified and a reaction network is developed for phenylalanine alone and in binary mixtures. This study has several implications to bio‐oil production during hydrothermal liquefaction of algae...|$|E

40|$|Antitumor {{effects of}} <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> (EO), Lipiodol Ultra-Fluide? (LP) and viscous <b>ethyl</b> <b>oleate</b> (VEO) {{containing}} cis-diamminedichloro platinum (II) (CDDP) on the tumor-bearing animals were investigated. The in vitro CDDP release from EO and LP was fast {{and the total}} CDDP was released within 24 h. In contrast, CDDP release from VEO was very slow. When these oily drug carriers were infused into the proper artery of the liver implanted with VX- 2 tumor in rabbits, the rank order of the accumulation of CDDP in the tumor site was VEO > LP > EO. However, the inhibition effect of these oily drug carriers on the tumor growth was almost the same. Next, controlled drug release property of the VEO was evaluated by addition of non-ionic surfactants (Tween 80, Span 20 and 80) using the AH 272 ascites in rats. The in vitro CDDP release from the VEO containing the surfactants was faster than that without the surfactants (the extent of suppress was Span 80 > Span 20 > Tween 80). The mean survival (T/C%) of EO-, LP-, VEO containing Tween 80, Span 20 or Span 80 -treated groups was 164. 5, 179. 4, 166. 7, 298. 6 or 475. 4, respectively. These results suggested that VEO containing non-ionic surfactants was very useful as a bifunctional drug carrier with abilities of “targeting” and “controlled release” for intra-arterial infusion therapy...|$|E
