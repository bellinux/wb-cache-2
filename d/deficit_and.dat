5|$|Two debates {{were held}} for this race during the 2006 {{election}} cycle. The first took place September 18, {{and the second}} was on October 12. In the first debate Kilroy and incumbent U.S. Representative, Pryce discussed the war in Iraq, the War on Terror, taxes, social security, the federal <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> President Bush. In the final week before the election, Pryce attempted to demand another debate.|$|E

5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was still {{struggling}} to recover from the financial Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has come}} under {{pressure}} due to not having a government budget <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> funding it by borrowing more.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{stabilize}} the situation, the Icelandic government stated that all domestic deposits in Icelandic banks would be guaranteed, imposed strict capital controls to stabilize {{the value of the}} Icelandic króna, and secured a US$5.1bn sovereign debt package from the IMF and the Nordic countries in order to finance a budget <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> the restoration of the banking system. The international bailout support programme led by IMF officially ended on 31 August 2011, while the capital controls which were imposed in November 2008 were lifted on 14 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|In {{the playoffs}} the Giants, {{who were the}} top seed in the conference ahead of the Bears, {{defeated}} the San Francisco 49ers {{for the second consecutive}} year in the playoffs by a score of 49–3.

In the Super Bowl, behind Simms' 88% pass completion percentage and their strong defense, the Giants overcame a 10–9 halftime <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> scored thirty second half points while allowing only ten more and defeated the Broncos 39–20.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina edged James Madison 5250 in {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament. The Tar Heels beat Alabama in the {{succeeding}} round to advance to the regional final against Villanova.

The Tar Heels opened the game with a 140 run. Houston overcame the <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> tied the game at 29 just a few minutes before the half. Coming out of halftime, North Carolina went on a 72 run and eventually won the game 6863 after stalling for a significant period of time.|$|E

40|$|The {{improvement}} of budget <b>deficits</b> <b>and</b> current account <b>deficits</b> has renewed {{the debate over}} the twin deficits hypothesis. This paper examines the validity of the twin deficits hypothesis in nine members of the Organizations for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) over the period 1990 - 2007. We use recently developed panel cointegration tests with structural breaks to assess the relationship between budget <b>deficits</b> <b>and</b> current account <b>deficits.</b> The empirical findings in this paper are as follows: (1) There is a long-run relationship between budget <b>deficits</b> <b>and</b> current account <b>deficits</b> for these countries; (2) The empirical result is consistent with the Keynesian proposition...|$|R
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of an inverted totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E
5|$|The Labour party {{conference in}} Manchester on 21–24 September {{occurred}} {{days after the}} Scottish referendum result. Miliband's conference speech was criticised, particularly after he missed sections on the <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> immigration, after attempting to deliver the speech without notes. At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy on tobacco companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; a commitment to {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; and a promise to lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E
5|$|When Mike Harris {{was elected}} Premier in 1995 on his {{platform}} of the Common Sense Revolution, the Ontario government faced a $11billion annual <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> a $100billion debt. Seeking {{to balance the}} books, a number of publicly owned services were privatized over the following years. Although initially spared, Highway407 was sold quickly in the year {{leading up to the}} 1999 provincial elections. The highway was leased to a conglomerate of private companies for $3.1 billion. The Ontario corporation, known as 407International Inc., is jointly owned by the Spanish multinational Cintra Infraestructuras (43.23%), as well as various subsidiaries of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (40%) and the Montreal-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin (16.77%).|$|E

5|$|After lunch, {{the light}} was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor {{visibility}} in order to eradicate the <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a sticky wicket, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress {{in the hope that}} the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless {{the light was}} so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} inning of a 2007 game at Fenway Park, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four {{consecutive}} home runs off Yankee pitcher Chase Wright, powering a comeback from a three-run <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> completing a three-game sweep of the Yankees at Fenway Park {{for the first time}} since 1990. By May, after long speculation about what team he would play for after retirement, Roger Clemens chose to return to the Yankees as opposed to the Red Sox (where he started his career) or the Houston Astros (his hometown and last team he played for). Clemens helped the Yankees overcome a 14-game deficit in the standings to roar back to reach the playoffs again, however, this was not enough to win the division. On September 28, Boston won the AL East after a win against the Minnesota Twins and a loss by the Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles. This was the first AL East Championship for the Red Sox since 1995, ending the Yankees' nine-year reign in the division.|$|E

Getzlaf {{was named to the}} Canadian roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, however a sprained ankle suffered during the NHL season left his participation in doubt until just before Canada was required to confirm its roster. He had recovered enough to play and recorded seven points in seven games, including the game-winning goal in Canada's 3–2 semi-final victory over Slovakia. Canada won the gold medal with a 3–2 overtime victory over the United States.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing {{to stay within the}} confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to come back from a 3–0 series <b>deficit</b> <b>and</b> the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
