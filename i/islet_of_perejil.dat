40|$|Prolonged {{stimulation}} with glucose {{may induce}} desensitisation of pancreatic beta-cell function in male rats. The {{effects of such}} a treatment on pancreatic <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> pregnant (P) rats, in which beta-cell function is enhanced, were studied in a perifusion design and compared with the effects on <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> cyclic female (C) and male (M) rats. The treatment induced in all three groups <b>of</b> <b>islets</b> a transient increase in both insulin and amylin secretion, followed by a gradual decline (desensitisation). <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> P-rats released more insulin, but not amylin, than the other types <b>of</b> <b>islets.</b> Furthermore, desensitisation occurred later in <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> P-rats (after 2. 5 h) than in <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> C- and M-rats (after 0. 5 h) The amount of insulin, but not of amylin, stored in <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> P-rats was also much {{higher than in the}} <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> C- and M-rats. Glucagon release in all three groups <b>of</b> <b>islets</b> was suppressed during glucose stimulation, but tended to increase again after 3 h of continuous stimulation. It is concluded that the control of beta-cell function is similar in M- and C-rats, but is significantly altered in P-rats. It is suggested that desensitisation of the beta-cells is associated with desensitisation of the alpha-cells...|$|R
50|$|In mammals, insulin is {{synthesized}} in {{the pancreas}} within the β-cells <b>of</b> the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans. One million to three million <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans (pancreatic <b>islets)</b> form the endocrine {{part of the}} pancreas, which is primarily an exocrine gland. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans, beta cells constitute 65-80% of all the cells.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the abnormal insulin-secretory activity encountered in obese mice is due to an anomaly in the production <b>of</b> cyclic AMP, <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> lean and obese mice were incubated with forskolin under various conditions. Our data show that, {{in addition to the}} well-known quantitative differences in insulin-secretory activity between <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> lean and obese mice, there are important qualitative differences. The <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> obese mice accumulated less cyclic AMP than did those of lean mice in response to given doses of forskolin, yet their insulin secretion was enhanced to much higher values. In the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> obese mice, but not in those of lean mice, the stimulatory effect of forskolin on insulin secretion was evident even at non-stimulatory concentrations of glucose or in Ca 2 +-deprived incubation media, showing that the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> the obese mouse is less dependent on a primary stimulus (glucose) and on the provision of normal concentrations of Ca 2 + in the bathing medium than is the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> the lean mouse...|$|R

50|$|Insulin is {{produced}} by the pancreas in a region called <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans. In the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans, there are beta-cells, which are responsible for production of insulin. Insulin is secreted as a response mechanism for counteracting the increasing excess amounts of glucose in the blood.|$|R

50|$|In 2002, Morocco and Spain {{agreed to}} a US-brokered {{resolution}} over the disputed island <b>of</b> <b>Perejil.</b> Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag. There were renewed tensions in 2005 as hundreds of African migrants tried to storm {{the borders of the}} Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco deported hundreds of the illegal migrants. In 2006 the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year, Spanish King Juan Carlos I visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.|$|R
40|$|The maximal {{extractable}} {{activity of}} "malic" enzyme (EC 1. 1. 1. 40) in rat <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans {{was similar to}} that reported for liver. Thus "malic" enzyme may catalyse a near-equilibrium reaction in the cytosol <b>of</b> <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans. Measurements <b>of</b> <b>islet</b> content <b>of</b> malate and pyruvate, the metabolite substrate and product of "malic" enzyme, were therefore used to calculate the cytosolic ration of [NADPH]/[NADP+]. This ratio was higher in islets incubated with 20 mM-glucose than in islets incubated with 2 mM-glucose...|$|R

40|$|In diabetes, {{pancreatic}} ß-cells {{play a key}} role. These {{cells are}} clustered within structures called <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans inside the pancreas and produce insulin, which is directly secreted into the blood stream. The dense vascularization <b>of</b> <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans is critical for maintaining a proper regulation of blood glucose homeostasis and {{is known to be}} affected from the early stage of diabetes. The deep localization <b>of</b> these <b>islets</b> inside the pancreas in the abdominal cavity renders their in vivo visualization a challenging task. A fast label-free imaging method with high spatial resolution is required to study the vascular network <b>of</b> <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans. Based on these requirements, we developed a label-free and three-dimensional imaging method for observing <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans using extended-focus Fourier domain Optical Coherence Microscopy (xfOCM). In addition to structural imaging, this system provides threedimensional vascular network imaging and dynamic blood flow information within <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> Langerhans. We propose our method to deepen the understanding of the interconnection between diabetes and the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>islet</b> vascular network...|$|R
