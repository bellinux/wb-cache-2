5|$|Barium is not {{carcinogenic}} and it {{does not}} bioaccumulate. Inhaled dust containing <b>insoluble</b> barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a benign condition called baritosis. The <b>insoluble</b> sulfate is nontoxic and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is soluble {{in water}} but is almost <b>insoluble</b> in nitric acid.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an {{ammonium}} salt, such as ammonium chloride, gives ammonium hexachloroplatinate, {{which is}} relatively <b>insoluble</b> in ammonium solutions. Heating this ammonium {{salt in the}} presence of hydrogen reduces it to elemental platinum. Potassium hexachloroplatinate is similarly <b>insoluble,</b> and hexachloroplatinic acid has been used in the determination of potassium ions by gravimetry.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is <b>insoluble</b> in {{the usual}} acids, but is soluble in {{alkaline}} molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2, Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) sulfate is <b>insoluble</b> in water, {{like the}} sulfates of other heavy {{divalent}} cations. Lead(II) nitrate and lead(II) acetate are very soluble, {{and this is}} exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds.|$|E
5|$|Most {{ingested}} uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when <b>insoluble</b> forms of uranium, {{such as its}} oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas <b>insoluble</b> uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay {{for many years in}} bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E
5|$|Other {{compounds}} {{of barium}} find only niche applications, {{limited by the}} toxicity of Ba2+ ions (barium carbonate is a rat poison), {{which is not a}} problem for the <b>insoluble</b> BaSO4.|$|E
5|$|Other {{products}} of hydrolysis include the trimeric ion 3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is <b>insoluble</b> even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, {{that is at}} biological pH. It is amphoteric and dissolves in strongly alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{interactions}} of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from {{water to a}} carbonate containing solution. While {{the vast majority of}} carbonates are <b>insoluble</b> in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are <b>insoluble</b> in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides. Alkaline earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are <b>insoluble</b> in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the <b>insoluble</b> blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black <b>insoluble</b> residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|By extension, any pentadienyl cation {{regardless}} of its origin is capable of undergoing a Nazarov cyclization. There have been {{a large number of}} examples published where the requisite cation is arrived at by a variety of rearrangements. One such example involves the silver catalyzed cationic ring opening of allylic dichloro cylopropanes. The silver salt facilitates loss of chloride via precipitation of <b>insoluble</b> silver chloride.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is a soft, malleable, ductile, bluish-white {{divalent}} metal. It {{is similar}} in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds. Unlike most other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and {{is used as a}} protective plate on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is <b>insoluble</b> in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.|$|E
5|$|Crushed {{minerals}} {{are treated}} with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their <b>insoluble</b> oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes {{one of the main}} components, cerium, whose oxide is <b>insoluble</b> in HNO3. Several rare earth metals, including lutetium, are separated as a double salt with ammonium nitrate by crystallization. Lutetium is separated by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are sorbed onto suitable ion-exchange resin by exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. Lutetium salts are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent. Lutetium metal is then obtained by reduction of anhydrous LuCl3 or LuF3 by either an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{fluoride}} is <b>insoluble</b> {{in water}} {{and can be used}} as a qualitative test for the presence of La3+. The heavier halides are all very soluble deliquescent compounds. The anhydrous halides are produced by direct reaction of their elements, as heating the hydrates causes hydrolysis: for example, heating hydrated LaCl3 produces LaOCl.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{bromides}} of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Silver bromide is very <b>insoluble</b> in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous ethanol, but <b>insoluble</b> {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous lipids make an {{important}} contribution in maintaining {{the integrity of the}} skin barrier, and express both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Sebum may act as a delivery system for antioxidants, antimicrobial lipids, pheromones, and hydration of the stratum corneum. The <b>insoluble</b> fatty acids contained within sebum have broad antimicrobial activity. Additionally, sebaceous gland secretion provides vitamin E to the upper layers of facial skin.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{dysprosium}} salts, such as dysprosium chloride and dysprosium nitrate, are mildly toxic when ingested. Based on {{the toxicity}} of dysprosium chloride to mice, {{it is estimated}} that the ingestion of 500grams or more could be fatal to a human. The <b>insoluble</b> salts, however, are non-toxic.|$|E
5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture {{with water and}} are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, {{but they can be}} separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the <b>insoluble</b> tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of parsnips has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the <b>insoluble</b> type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the <b>insoluble</b> barium sulfate on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including aluminium, zinc, lead, and tin, forming intermetallic phases and alloys.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for monazite, (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. Monazite, because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation. After separation, it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their <b>insoluble</b> oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is <b>insoluble</b> in HNO3 and hence precipitates out. Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter.|$|E
5|$|The {{substitution}} of hydrogen atoms in an alkane by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties: melting and boiling points are lowered, density increases, solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases. Perfluorocarbons, {{in which all}} hydrogen atoms are substituted, are <b>insoluble</b> in most organic solvents, reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia.|$|E
5|$|The {{three major}} {{components}} of peat are humic acid, humins, and fulvic acid. Of these, humins give {{the most reliable}} date as they are <b>insoluble</b> in alkali {{and less likely to}} contain contaminants from the sample's environment. A particular difficulty with dried peat is the removal of rootlets, which are likely to be hard to distinguish from the sample material.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing {{is a mixture of}} carbonate with bicarbonate. At high pH, this results in precipitation of diuranate, which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an <b>insoluble</b> uranium tetracarbonate.|$|E
5|$|Traces of {{californium}} can {{be found}} near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments. The element is fairly <b>insoluble</b> in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations {{of it in the}} soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of iridium compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are <b>insoluble,</b> which makes absorption into the body difficult.|$|E
5|$|Water-soluble {{compounds}} of yttrium {{are considered}} mildly toxic, while its <b>insoluble</b> compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium {{and its compounds}} caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused pulmonary edema and dyspnea, while inhalation of yttrium chloride caused liver edema, pleural effusions, and pulmonary hyperemia.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an <b>insoluble</b> complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is <b>insoluble</b> in water and can be leached out with 0.5M hydrochloric acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly <b>insoluble</b> deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of <b>insoluble</b> fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, grass, and grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. <b>Insoluble</b> carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed {{a small amount}} of a dark, <b>insoluble</b> residue. Joseph Louis Proust thought that the residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
