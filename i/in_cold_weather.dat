5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|The war then {{interrupted}} Ring's first-class career. Ring {{joined the}} Australian Army {{and served with}} an anti-aircraft regiment in New Guinea. During his military service he injured his back, displacing a disc. The injury flared up from time to time, especially <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> and this affected his ability to bowl to a consistent length.|$|E

The dress is the same as C-1, except that the medal ribbons replaces the medals. C-3 and C-4 is the same as C-2, except that the turtleneck and blue T-shirt replaces the shirt and tie respectively; C-3 may be worn <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{flexible}} fuel car {{is built}} with an ethanol-ready engine and one fuel tank for both fuels. The small gasoline reservoir for {{starting the engine}} with pure ethanol <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> used in earlier ethanol-only vehicles, was kept in {{the first generation of}} Brazilian flexible-fuel cars, mainly for users of the central and southern regions, where winter temperatures normally drop below. An improved flex motor generation was launched in 2009 that allowed for the elimination of this secondary gas reservoir tank.|$|E
5|$|As a small {{woodland}} {{bird with}} cryptic plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops mouse-like up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, {{it is not}} wary, and is largely indifferent {{to the presence of}} humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering butterfly-like wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.|$|E

50|$|Prairie voles {{are active}} year-round. <b>In</b> <b>colder</b> <b>weather,</b> {{they tend to}} be more active during the day; at other times, they are mainly nocturnal. Prairie voles live in colonies and have been known to exhibit human-like social {{behavior}} in groups.|$|R
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, {{it is especially important}} for horse owners to encourage their horses to drink when there is a risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the strap}} between the toes, {{flip-flops}} are typically not worn with socks. <b>In</b> <b>colder</b> <b>weather,</b> however, some people wear flip-flops with toe socks. The Japanese commonly wear tabi, a type of sock with a single slot for the thong, with their zōri.|$|R

5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b> Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|The first {{train was}} {{delivered}} on 22 October and {{was put into}} use on the Sørland Line from 1 November. Scheduled travel time was reduced by 40 minutes to 3 hours and 40 minutes. In December, the trains had problems with the pantographs not working correctly <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> causing the trains to lose power and be several hours delayed. NSB stated that a contributing cause was the previous year's mild winter, which {{made it impossible to}} test the trains in extreme weather. After {{two and a half months}} of operation on the Sørland Line, every other train was at least 5 minutes late and every tenth train at least 20 minutes late. The trains also caused travel sickness, also among employees, particularly on the section from Kristiansand to Bø. NSB stated that this had also occurred on the old trains and that it was reports of the number of people affected were exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. <b>In</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather,</b> they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
50|$|However, {{stockings}} {{do have a}} drawback <b>in</b> <b>colder</b> <b>weather,</b> {{because more}} skin is exposed to the cold compared to pantyhose. Also, pantyhose do not require garters and garter belts, and {{do not need to}} be adjusted as much, whilst also leaving a smoother line under form-fitting clothing.|$|R

5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached the knees and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b> In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
5|$|Plant food {{is stored}} year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, {{occasionally}} in walls {{or in the}} ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached food is retrieved <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b> Siberian birds store {{the seeds of the}} Siberian stone pine, sometimes hoarding enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter that those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast {{is an important part of}} the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.|$|E

25|$|The fuel in {{an engine}} {{has to be}} vaporized before it will burn. Insufficient {{vaporization}} is a known problem with alcohol fuels during cold starts <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather.</b> As the heat of vaporization of butanol {{is less than half}} of that of ethanol, an engine running on butanol should be easier to start <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>weather</b> than one running on ethanol or methanol.|$|E
