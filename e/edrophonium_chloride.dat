40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that there is a myopathic component in myasthenia gravis. Serum enzyme analyses and lactate and pyruvate assays were undertaken before and after exercise in order to detect possible leakage from defective muscle membrane.

In addition, the average change in SGOT values in the patient group after one minute of aerobic exercise under the influence of <b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride</b> exceeded that of the control group. Both these findings suggest possible leakage of enzyme and metabolite from the myasthenic muscle due to a membrane defect and support the hypothesis {{that there may be a}} myopathic component in myasthenia gravis.

40|$|We {{present the}} case of a 79 year-old patient with megaesophagus and aphagia, who {{required}} percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. Megaesophagus was considered the sole cause of aphagia by the referring secondary hospital. Solid state sensor videofluoromanometry (VFM) showed a substantial decrease in manometric values within the hypopharynx along with good relaxation of the upper-esophageal sphincter (UES). This led to electromyography (EMG), which showed features compatible with the diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis (MG). The diagnosis of MG was confirmed by an intravenous injection of <b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> performed under VFM monitoring.

40|$|Twenty-three smooth fox terriers with an {{inherited}} form of myasthenia gravis were studied. All dogs developed muscle weakness between 4 and 8 weeks of age. This weakness increased in severity with exercise and age. Muscle weakness was alleviated {{by the administration}} of a short acting cholinesterase inhibitor (<b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride).</b> Electrophysiological examination revealed a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation, which decreased with anticholinesterase administration. Acetylcholine receptors (AChR) were assayed in nonaffected and affected dogs by extracting the AChR from intercostal muscle and labelling with an excess of 125 I- alpha bungarotoxin and quantitating with immunoprecipitation. Affected dogs had only 23 % AChR of the normal littermate controls. Anti-AChR antibodies were not detected in the serum {{of any of the}} dogs.

Electromyography and motor nerve conduction velocity were normal. Repetitive nerve stimulation showed a decremental response of the compound muscle action potential with improvement upon intravenous administration of <b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> The serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titer was within reference range. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. A presumptive diagnosis of post-synaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) was made.

Immunofluorescence staining for AChRs in external intercostal muscle biopsies showed absence of AChRs and biochemical quantitation showed a markedly decreased concentration of AChRs with no detectable AChR-bound autoantibody which confirmed the diagnosis of a CMS. Evaluation for the CHRNE mutation previously identified as the causative mutation of CMS in Jack Russell Terriers was performed and was negative.

40|$|Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, {{autoimmune}} {{neuromuscular junction}} disorder. Contemporary prevalence rates approach 1 / 5, 000. MG presents with painless, fluctuating, fatigable weakness involving specific muscle groups. Ocular weakness with asymmetric ptosis and binocular diplopia {{is the most}} typical initial presentation, while early or isolated oropharyngeal or limb weakness is less common. The course is variable, and most patients with initial ocular weakness develop bulbar or limb weakness within three years of initial symptom onset. MG results from antibody-mediated, T cell-dependent immunologic attack on the endplate region of the postsynaptic membrane. In patients with fatigable muscle weakness, the diagnosis of MG is supported by: 1. pharmacologic testing with <b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride</b> that elicits unequivocal improvement in strength; 2. electrophysiologic testing with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) studies and/or single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) that demonstrates a primary postsynaptic neuromuscular junctional disorder; and 3. serologic demonstration of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies. Differential diagnosis includes congenital myasthenic syndromes, Lambert Eaton syndrome, botulism, organophosphate intoxication, mitochondrial disorders involving progressive external ophthalmoplegia, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), motor neuron disease, and brainstem ischemia. Treatment must be individualized, and may include symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and immune modulation with corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil. Rapid, temporary improvement may be achieved for myasthenic crises and exacerbations with plasma exchange (PEX) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Owing to improved diagnostic testing, immunotherapy, and intensive care, the contemporary prognosis is favorable with less than five percent mortality and nearly normal life expectancy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{concomitant}} disorders especially thyroid abnormalities {{have been}} reported in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). We aimed to estimate the frequency and pattern of thyroid disorders in Iranian patients with MG. Methods: All consecutive patients with MG referred to neurology clinic of Rasool-e-Akram Hospital during 2006 - 2007 were enrolled. All patients underwent clinical assessment of thyroid gland as well as thyroid function test. AChR Ab titer was measured as well. Nerve conduction study (NCS), Electromyography (EMG), and Repetitive Nerve Stimulation (RNS) was done by a same neurologist. The diagnosis of MG was {{made on the basis of}} clinical examinations, an <b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride</b> test and electrophysiological studies. The diagnosis of thyroid disorders were based on clinical presentation as well as thyroid function tests. Results: Fifty eight patients (mean age [SD]: 37. 1 [16. 9], range: 10 - 80; female: 65. 5 %) were enrolled in this 12 -month study. Four patients (6. 9 %) had abnormal thyroid function tests (Hypothyroidism: 3 [5. 2 %]; 4 females; 3 with hypothyroidism and 1 with hyperthyroidism). The mean age (SD) in men and women were 41. 4 (21. 3) and 34. 9 (13. 8) years (P: N. S.), respectively. In addition, once the MG patients are younger than 50, female gender is dominant while they are more than fifty, male is the dominant gender. Conclusion: Our results show that Iranian patients with MG tend to be female and young. Before sixth decade of life, women are the most presenting patients thereafter, men are the predominant gender. About 7 percent of them may suffer from concomitant thyroid problem especially hypothyroidism...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In the {{investigation}} of patients with myasthenia gravis, repetitive supramaximal stimulation of an affected peripheral nerve is commonly performed to detect abnormal transmission at the neuromuscular junction. A study was undertaken to determine whether abnormal transmission could similarly be detected during stimulation of the phrenic nerves. METHODS: The phrenic nerves were stimulated supramaximally with surface electrodes in 13 patients with myasthenia gravis and in 16 control subjects (six control patients with diaphragmatic weakness but not with myasthenia and ten normal subjects). The amplitude of diaphragm muscle action potentials was measured with surface electrodes during phrenic nerve stimulation at frequencies of 1 - 5 Hz for 3 - 4 seconds. RESULTS: In five patients with myasthenia gravis, a significant decrement (15 - 43 % decrease) occurred in the amplitude of diaphragm muscle action potential during stimulation at 3 Hz. When stimulation frequency was reduced to 1 Hz, diaphragm muscle action potentials returned to their original amplitude within 4 - 5 seconds. The decrement in the amplitude of the diaphragm muscle action potential was reduced temporarily in three of four patients after the administration of intravenous <b>edrophonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (Tensilon). There was no significant change (< 10 % decrease) in the amplitude of diaphragm muscle action potentials during stimulation at increased frequencies either in the 16 control subjects or in eight of the patients with myasthenia gravis. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in the amplitude of diaphragm muscle action potential occurred in five of 13 patients with myasthenia gravis during phrenic nerve stimulation at 3 Hz but in none of the control subjects. This may be a useful and non-invasive method for identifying patients with myasthenia gravis in whom weakness of the diaphragm is suspected...|$|E
