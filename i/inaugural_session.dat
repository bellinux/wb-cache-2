5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. In his position as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> was {{the issue of how}} to raise revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, as well as a trade imbalance with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and draining the nation of its currency. The first effort to begin addressing these issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. Life-Saving Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|He {{was arrested}} on 10 October 1990 on charges {{relating}} to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, {{he was elected to}} the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.|$|E

50|$|In the Croatian local elections, 2005, {{his list}} of {{independent}} candidates won a relative majority in Osijek and Osijek-Baranja County. This prompted Kramarić to approach all other parties in Osijek and attempt to form a broad anti-Glavaš coalition, an offer which was accepted and resulted in HDZ loyalists being allied {{with the likes of}} the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. In June 2005 Glavaš defeated this scheme, first by allying with the far-right Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), in a coalition that gave the HSP the mayoral position in Osijek for the first time; and then by persuading some assemblymen of the anti-Glavaš coalition to support his candidates in <b>inaugural</b> <b>sessions</b> of the Osijek-Baranja county and City of Osijek assembly.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the control {{of his or her}} own Department, the President carries out some of the representative duties that are normally carried out by a single head of state in other democracies. For example, since joining the United Nations, Swiss Presidents have on occasion spoken at <b>inaugural</b> <b>sessions</b> of the General Assembly along with other visiting heads of state and government. However, because the Swiss have no single head of state, the country carries out no state visits. When traveling abroad, the President does so only in their capacity as head of their department. Visiting heads of state are received by the seven members of the Federal Council together, rather than by the President of the Confederation. Treaties are signed on behalf of the full Council, with all Federal Council members signing letters of credence and other documents of the kind.|$|R

25|$|September 1: In {{addressing}} the <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> {{of the new}} Congress, PRD Senator Carlos Naverrete accused the federal government of violating Article 29 of the Constitution by cordoning off the Congress building, thus curtailing individual freedoms (the decision to defend Congress was taken because of fears that PRD supporters would carry out violent protests in the building.) Other PRD deputies and senators then occupied the podium in the Chamber of Deputies, saying they would remain there until the mass police and military presence was withdrawn. The speaker of Congress suspended the joint session, and President Fox was prevented from delivering his final State of the Nation speech viva voce, on camera (he fulfilled the constitutional requirement of reporting to Congress by handing over a printed copy to the congressional clerks). Fox addressed the nation on an all-channel telecast two hours later.|$|E
25|$|The {{assembly}} had {{the task}} of passing laws to prepare the Philippines for its eventual independence. Certain laws dealing with foreign relations and finance however, still required {{the approval of the}} U.S. President. Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon, who had practical control of the National Assembly, addressed the body on its <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> and laid-out his administration's priorities and legislative agenda. He was able to secure the passage of important legislation without much opposition, after he diluted the powers of the Speaker to a mere presiding officer. Among the first of such measures were the National Defense Act of 1935, which created the Philippine Army; the creation of the National Economic Council, to serve as an advisory body on economic matters; and the creation of the Court of Appeals. Several economic measures were also tackled, including the impending difficulties on the phase out of free trade between the Philippines and the United States after independence, setting a minimum wage, and the imposition of new taxes among others.|$|E

In the fall of 1866, Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, on which he served until 1872.

2500|$|Pope Gregory {{had responded}} to {{the call of the}} {{cardinals}} at Livorno in June 1408 with an announcement that he would hold a council, somewhere in the territory of Aquileia or the territory of Rimini. Aquileia ceased to be an attractive venue when its Patriarch announced his adherence to the Council of Pisa and sent representatives to Pisa. On 19 December 1408 Pope Gregory fixed the town of Cividale as the site of his council. [...] His council held its <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> on 6 June 1409, the day after he had been formally deposed by the Council of Pisa. The attendance was so embarrassingly small that he had to issue new letters of convocation on 20 June 1409, with a date of 22 July for the Second Session. He authorized his friend King Rupert (Ruprecht) to depose any prelate in his domains who refused to obey the summons to his council. He received a severe blow when the Venetians decided to support the Council of Pisa, since Venice controlled both the land and sea routes between Rimini and Cividale.|$|E

2500|$|One of Franklin's notable {{characteristics}} was his respect, {{tolerance and}} promotion of all churches. Referring to his experience in Philadelphia, {{he wrote in his}} autobiography, [...] "new Places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary Contribution, my Mite for such purpose, whatever might be the Sect, was never refused." [...] "He helped create a new type of nation that would draw strength from its religious pluralism." [...] The evangelical revivalists who were active mid-century, such as Franklin's friend and preacher, George Whitefield, were the greatest advocates of religious freedom, [...] "claiming liberty of conscience to be an 'inalienable right of every rational creature.'" [...] Whitefield's supporters in Philadelphia, including Franklin, erected [...] "a large, new hall, that... could provide a pulpit to anyone of any belief." [...] Franklin's rejection of dogma and doctrine and his stress on the God of ethics and morality and civic virtue made him the [...] "prophet of tolerance." [...] Franklin composed [...] "A Parable Against Persecution", an apocryphal 51st chapter of Genesis in which God teaches Abraham the duty of tolerance. While he was living in London in 1774, he was present at the birth of British Unitarianism, attending the <b>inaugural</b> <b>session</b> of the Essex Street Chapel, at which Theophilus Lindsey drew together the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in England; this was somewhat politically risky, and pushed religious tolerance to new boundaries, as a denial of the doctrine of the Trinity was illegal until the 1813 Act.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Kalamata, the Messenian Senate, {{the first of the}} Greeks' local {{governing}} councils, held its <b>inaugural</b> <b>session.</b> At almost the same time, the Achean Directorate was summoned in Patras, but its members were soon forced to flee to Kalavryta. With the initiative of the Messenian Senate, a Peloponnesian assembly convened, and elected a Senate on 26 May. Most {{of the members of the}} Peloponnesian Senate were local notables (lay and ecclesiastical) or persons controlled by them. The three major social groups that provided the leadership of the revolution were the primates (wealthy landowners who controlled about a third of the arable land in the Peloponnese), the captains drawn from the klephts and/or armatolos (klepts and armatolos tended to alternate), and the wealthy merchants, who were the most Westernised elements in Greek society. One of the more prominent leaders of the merchants and a [...] "Westerniser" [...] was the Phanariot Alexandros Mavrokordatos who was living with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Shelley in Pisa when the revolution began, and upon hearing of the revolution, purchased supplies and a ship in Marseilles and then set sail for Greece. Mavrokordhatos's wealth, education (he was fluent in seven languages) and his experience as an Ottoman official ruling Wallachia led many to look towards him as a leader. [...] When Demetrios Ypsilantis arrived in Peloponnese as official representative of Filiki Eteria, he tried to assume control of the Revolution's affairs, and he thus proposed a new system of electing the members of the Senate, which was supported by the military leaders, but opposed by the notables. Assemblies convened also in Central Greece (November 1821) under the leadership of two Phanariots: Alexandros Mavrokordatos in the western part, and Theodoros Negris in the eastern part. These assemblies adopted two local statutes, the Charter of Western Continental Greece and the Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece, drafted mainly by Mavrokordatos and Negris respectively. The statutes provided for the creation of two local administrative organs in Central Greece, an Areopagus in the east, and a Senate in the west.* Papageorgiou, [...] "First Year of Freedom", pp. 67–70. The three local statutes were recognized by the First National Assembly, but the respective administrative institutions were turned into administrative branches of the central government.
