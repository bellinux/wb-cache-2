40|$|We {{study the}} surface {{conductivity}} of a field-effect transistor (FET) made of periodic array of spherical semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs).

When first layer NCs have two electrons per NC the quantization energy gap between its 1 S and 1 P levels induces occupation of 1 S levels of second layer NCs. Only at a larger gate voltage electrons start leaving 1 S levels of second layer NCs and filling 1 P levels of first layer NCs. By substantially larger gate voltage, all the electrons vacate the second layer and move to 1 P levels of first layer NCs. As a result of this nontrivial evolution of the two layers concentrations, the surface conductivity of FET non-monotonically depends on the gate voltage.

In this paper we introduce modelling the extended wings of strong emission lines by the electron scattering with the aim to determine the electron optical depth, tau(e) and temperature, T(e), of symbiotic nebulae. We applied our profile-fitting analysis to the broad wings of the OVI 1032, 1038 A doublet and HeII 1640 A emission line, measured in the spectra of symbiotic stars AG Dra, Z And and V 1016 Cyg. Synthetic profiles fit well the observed wings. By this way we determined tau(e) and T(e) of the layer of electrons, throughout which the line photons are transferred. During quiescent phases, the mean tau(e) = 0. 056 +/- 0. 006 and T(e) = 19 200 +/- 2 300 K, while during active phases, mean quantities of both parameters increased to tau(e) = 0. 64 +/- 0. 11 and T(e) = 32 300 +/- 2 000 K. During quiescent phases, the faint electron-scattering wings are caused mainly by free electrons from/around the accretion disk and the ionized wind from the hot star with the total column density, N(e) <~ 1 E+ 23 cm- 2.

40|$|P-type doping of III-nitrides is {{explored}} {{in order to}} better understand the shortcomings of existing p-type material and achieve higher hole concentrations. Using a modified form of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) called metal-modulated epitaxy (MME), hole concentrations as high as 7. 9 x 1019 cm- 3 are achieved, nearly 20 - 40 x the previous state of the art. Impurity band conduction, resulting from proper incorporation of Mg at concentrations > 1020 cm- 3 by careful selection and monitoring of growth conditions, is suggested as the source of these unique properties and more than 10 x improvement in hole concentrations over previous state-of-the-art. Electrical properties and Mg incorporation were found to be sensitive to growth conditions and an optimal growth window is elucidated. Diode devices using these highly p-type layers were found to be properly rectifying with turn-on voltages near 3 V, exhibiting room-temperature and cryogenic luminescence, and unambiguously confirming the p-type nature of the films. High MBE growth rates in GaN are demonstrated using a modified high-conductance nitrogen plasma source. Growth rates from 1. 6 μm/hour up to 8. 4 μm/hour are achieved for pure nitrogen gas. A mixed argon/nitrogen plasma chemistry expands the range of achievable growth rates from ~ 1 μm/hour up to 9. 8 μm/hour due to reduced ion content and more efficient generation of reactive atomic nitrogen species compared to a pure nitrogen plasma. Repeatable background <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> 1 - 2 x 1015 cm- 3 are reported, and germanium is demonstrated as an alternative n-type dopant for high growth rate applications with electron concentrations from 2 x 1016 cm- 3 up to 4 x 1019 cm- 3. GaN growth on Si is explored using several unique nucleation methods in order to achieve a fully vertical device structure. Preliminary photovoltaic response is demonstrated in spite of the poor crystal quality of the GaN films. Further study of various diode configurations exhibit either conductive or rectifying junctions. Alternative nucleation techniques exploiting the Al-Si eutectic demonstrate improved crystal quality and surface roughness, providing a path forward for improved PV devices. Finally, an exotic substrate called alexandrite (BeAl 2 O 4) is examined for GaN growth to attempt to exploit a unique relaxation mechanism and reduce dislocation densities. Several nucleation and buffer layers demonstrate some improvements in crystal quality, but on the whole crystal quality remains poor in all cases compared to existing GaN growth on sapphire. Nonetheless, a diode structure is grown in spite of the defective films, which demonstrates proper rectifying behavior with ~ 3 V turn-on. Ph. D...|$|E

The observing scheme also allowed the establishement of upper limits for the degree of circular polarization. The Owens Valley Radio Observatory 90 ' interferometer was used for these observations, and it operated with the many advantages of a crossed-feed interference polarimeter over a single-dish system. With the use of all available data, the Faraday rotation measures of 354 radio sources, mostly extragalactic, have been computed with careful attention to ambiguities and uncertainties; a novel quality grading system has been employed. These rotation measures constitute a powerful probe of the magnetic field structure and electron density of the local spiral arm. If the electrons in the local regions of the galaxy form a disk 200 pc in thickness and 2 kpc in radius, {{then there is a}} uniform	linear component of the galactic field in the direction 1 = 94 [degress] [ [...] . ] 3 [degrees], b = - 8 [degrees] [ [...] . ] 8 [degrees] with a strength of n[subscript e]B = 0. 12 electrons-cm[superscript - 3]-[mu]guass, or B = 2. 0 [mu]gauss for n[subscript e] = 0. 06 cm[superscript]- 3. Distributions of the differences between this model and the actual rotation measures show that regions of magnetic loops and field reversals or <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> 100 to 200 pc in size have values of n[subscript e]B two to three times that of the average linear field of the model, implying a high degree of disorder. Most of the very large rotation measures seem to be produced by small scale structure in the galaxy, although a very few may be intrinsic to the source. The linear field model compares well with hydrogen line Zeem splitting, pulsar dispersion and rotation measures, and other magnetic field data. The apparent discrepancy with field structures given by stellar polarization can be resolved by differences in the distributions of electrons and dust and by the large-scale loops and field reversals. Searches for correlations between rotation measure and source type, depolarization, or redhsift have all led to negative results. The upper limit for a uniform, linear component of the intergalactic magnetic field, based on the failure of the last correlation, is n[subscript e]B < 2 x 10 [superscript - 13] cm[superscript - 3] gauss. ...|$|E
40|$|III-nitride-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers {{have so far}} used {{intracavity}} contacting schemes since {{electrically conductive}} distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) {{have been difficult to}} achieve. A promising material combination for conductive DBRs is ZnO/GaN due to the small conduction band offset and ease of n-type doping. In addition, this combination offers a small lattice mismatch and high refractive index contrast, which could yield a mirror with a broad stopband and a high peak reflectivity using less than 20 DBR-pairs. A crack-free ZnO/GaN DBR was grown by hybrid plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The ZnO layers were approximately 20 nm thick and had an <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 1 × 1019 cm- 3, while the GaN layers were 80 - 110 nm thick with an <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 1. 8 × 1018 cm- 3. In order to measure the resistance, mesa structures were formed by dry etching through the top 3 DBR-pairs and depositing non-annealed Al contacts on the GaN-layers at the top and next to the mesas. The measured specific series resistance was dominated by the lateral and contact contributions and gave an upper limit of ~ 10 - 3 Ωcm 2 for the vertical resistance. Simulations show that the ZnO <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> and the cancellation of piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization in strained ZnO have a large impact on the vertical resistance and that it could be orders of magnitudes lower than what was measured. This is the first report on electrically conductive ZnO/GaN DBRs and the upper limit of the resistance reported here is close to the lowest values reported for III-nitride-based DBRs...|$|R

Evidence of the existence of a native donor hydrogen-indium vacancy complex in LEC undoped and Fe-doped InP materials can be observed with infrared absorption spectra. The <b>concentration</b> increase <b>of</b> the donor complex correlates with the increase of ionized deep acceptor iron impurity Fe 2 + concentration in Fe-doped semi-insulating (SI) InP.
