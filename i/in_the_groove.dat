5|$|Marvin Gaye's {{version was}} {{recorded}} in spring 1967, and is the second known recording, though was also rejected by Gordy as a single, and would also later go onto an album, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Groove.</b> The third recording was in 1967 with Gladys Knight and the Pips in a new, faster arrangement. Gordy accepted the new arrangement and the Gladys Knight version was released as a single in September 1967, reaching number 2 in the charts. When Gaye's album with his version of Grapevine was released in August 1968, radio disc jockeys were playing the song, so Gordy had it released as a single in October, and it went to number one in December.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E
50|$|A {{complicated}} slipper {{bearing system}} was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Le Rhône engine. The master rod {{was of a}} split-type, which permitted assembly of the connecting rods. It also employed three concentric grooves, designed to accept slipper bearings from the other cylinders. The other connecting rods used inner-end bronze shoes, which were shaped to fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> <b>The</b> master rod was numbered as number one and the shoes of numbers two, five and eight rode <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>groove,</b> <b>the</b> shoes of three, six and nine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>groove</b> and four and seven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>groove.</b> Although this system was complex, the Le Rhône engines worked very well.|$|R

5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|When the lophophore is extended, cilia (little hairs) on {{the sides}} of the tentacles draw water down between the tentacles and out at the base of the lophophore. Shorter cilia on the inner sides of the tentacles flick food {{particles}} into a groove in a circle under and just inside the tentacles, and cilia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> push the particles into the mouth. Phoronids direct their lophophores into the water current, and quickly reorient to maximize the food-catching area when currents change. Their diet includes algae, diatoms, flagellates, peridinians, small invertebrate larvae, and detritus. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing the epistome (lid above the mouth) or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The gut uses cilia and muscles to move food towards the stomach and secretes enzymes that digest some of the food, but the stomach digests the majority of the food. Phoronids also absorb amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) through their skins, mainly in summer. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
40|$|Dynamics {{of water}} {{molecules}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> of DNA are {{of great interest}} both for practical functionality of DNA and fundamental as examples of confined systems interest. Here the authors employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to understand varying water dynamics at the minor and <b>the</b> major <b>grooves</b> of a 38 base-pair long DNA duplex in water. In order to understand and quantify <b>the</b> diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nature of hydrogen bond due to many hydrogen bond donors and acceptors present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four bases, they have undertaken study of hydrogen bond lifetime (HBLT) correlation functions of all the specific hydrogen bonds between the base atoms and water molecules. They find that the HBLT correlation functions are in general multiexponential, with the average lifetime depending significantly on the specificity and may thus be biologically relevant. The average hydrogen bond lifetime is longer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>groove</b> than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major <b>groove</b> by almost a factor of 2. Analysis further shows that water hydrogen bonds with phosphate oxygen have substantially shorter lifetimes than those with <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> atoms. They also compute two different orientational time correlation functions (OTCFs) of the water molecules present at the major and <b>the</b> minor <b>grooves</b> and attempt to correlate OTCF with HBLT correlation function. <b>The</b> OTCFs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>groove</b> exhibit three time scales, with the time constant of the slowest component one to two orders of magnitude longer than what is observed for bulk water. A slow component is also present for <b>the</b> major <b>groove</b> water but with shorter time constant. Interestingly, correlation between reformations allowed HBLT correlation function [$C_{HB}(t) ]$ and the OTCF markedly deviates from each other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves,</b> indicating enhanced rigidity of water molecules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Turbulence with a {{relatively}} larger vortex is obtained in drag-reducing surfactant solution, which provides an excellent condition {{for the application of}} small scale <b>grooves.</b> <b>In</b> this work, <b>the</b> coupling drag reduction performance of surfactant solution and grooves was experimentally investigated to explore the complementary possibility between their drag reduction mechanisms. The cationic surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (CTAC) mixed with the counterion salt sodium salicylate (NaSal) was experimented in smooth or grooved channel, respectively, at the mass concentrations of 50 - 150 ppm.

25|$|Tonearm skating {{forces and}} other {{perturbations}} are also {{picked up by}} the stylus. This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (restoring force) used to keep the stylus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5Hz (the frequency at which a rpm record turns on the turntable; Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.|$|E

40|$|Adsorption of {{monovalent}} and multivalent cat- and anions on a deoxyribose {{nucleic acid}} (DNA) molecule from a salt solution is investigated by computer simulation. The ions are modelled as charged hard spheres, the DNA molecule {{as a point}} charge pattern following the double-helical phosphate strands. The geometrical shape of the DNA molecules is modelled on different levels ranging from a simple cylindrical shape to structured models which include the major and minor <b>grooves</b> between <b>the</b> phosphate strands. The densities of the ions adsorbed on <b>the</b> phosphate strands, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>grooves</b> are calculated. First, {{we find that the}} adsorption pattern on the DNA surface depends strongly on its geometrical shape: counterions adsorb preferentially along the phosphate strands for a cylindrical model shape, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>groove</b> for a geometrically structured model. Second, we find that an addition of monovalent salt ions results in an increase of <b>the</b> charge density <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor <b>groove</b> while <b>the</b> total charge density of ions adsorbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major <b>groove</b> stays unchanged. <b>The</b> adsorbed ion densities are highly structured along <b>the</b> minor <b>groove</b> while they are almost smeared along <b>the</b> major <b>groove.</b> Furthermore, for a fixed amount of added salt, <b>the</b> major <b>groove</b> cationic charge is independent on the counterion valency.

500|$|Rhythm {{games have}} been used for health purposes. For example, {{research}} has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they burn more calories than walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity. Studies have found that playing Dance Dance Revolution can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which {{has one of the highest}} rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced Dance Dance Revolution into its schools' physical education classes. According to The New York Times, more than [...] "several hundred schools in at least 10 states" [...] have used Dance Dance Revolution (along with <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Groove)</b> in their curricula.

Bemani's testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game. There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective. Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.|$|E
