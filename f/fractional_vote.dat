5000|$|Imperial Count (Reichsgraf) was a {{title in}} the Holy Roman Empire. In the medieval era, it was used {{exclusively}} to designate the holder of an imperial county, that is, a fief held directly (immediately) from the emperor, rather than from a prince who was a vassal of the emperor or of another sovereign, such as a duke or prince-elector. These imperial counts sat {{on one of the}} four [...] "benches" [...] of Counts, whereat each exercised a <b>fractional</b> <b>vote</b> in the Imperial Diet until 1806.|$|E
50|$|In March 2004, Vasconcellos {{introduced}} Senate Bill 1606, {{known as}} Training Wheels for Citizenship, {{which would allow}} people 14 or older to vote. The votes of 14- and 15-year-olds would count as {{a quarter of a}} vote, and of 16- and 17-year-olds a half. The National Youth Rights Association supported the bill, but Republican legislators criticized it. Bob Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies, compared this bill's <b>fractional</b> <b>vote</b> to the policy of the Three-Fifths Compromise, which gave slaves three-fifths representation in the early history of the U.S. Vasconcellos abandoned the bill after it fell one vote short in the final committee.|$|E
5000|$|They participated {{with the}} emperor, electors and princes in ruling the Empire {{by virtue of}} being {{entitled}} to a seat on one of the Counts' benches (Grafenbank) in the Diet. Each [...] "bench" [...] was entitled to exercise one collective vote (Kuriatstimme) in the Diet and each comital family was allowed to cast one <b>fractional</b> <b>vote</b> toward a bench's vote: A majority of fractional votes determined how that bench's vote would be cast on any issue before the Diet. Four benches were recognised (membership in each being determined by which quadrant of the Empire a count's fief lay within). By being seated and allowed to cast a shared vote on a Count's bench an imperial count obtained, the [...] "seat and vote" [...] within the Imperial Diet which, combined with Imperial immediacy, made of his chief land holding an Imperial estate (Reichsstand) and conferred upon him and his family the status of Landeshoheit, i.e. the semi-sovereignty which distinguished Germany and Austria's high nobility (the Hochadel) from the lower nobility (Niederadel), who had no representation in the Diet and usually answered to an over-lord.|$|E
50|$|One simplistic {{formula for}} how to {{transfer}} surplus votes is:however, this can produce <b>fractional</b> <b>votes.</b> See Counting Methods {{for a discussion of}} how this is handled.|$|R
50|$|If <b>fractional</b> <b>votes</b> can be submitted, {{then the}} Droop quota may be {{modified}} {{so that the}} fraction is not rounded down.Major Frank Britton, of the Election Ballot Services at the Electoral Reform Society, observed that the final plus one of the Droop quota is never needed. So, the quota for one seat is fifty out of a hundred votes, not fifty-one.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. House of Representatives, by comparison, is {{required}} by Article I, Section 2, to be [...] "apportioned among the several states... according to their respective numbers." [...] The Constitution does not provide for either <b>fractional</b> <b>votes</b> nor Congressional seats spanning states, and guarantees every state at least one Representative. Thus, a resident of a state whose population just barely qualifies for two Representatives has almost twice the relative influence as a resident of a state that does not quite qualify for two.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{supporters}} of youth suffrage felt that voting should be all-or-nothing; for instance, 15-year-old Elliot Aglioni, {{a member of}} Berkeley High Schools Progressive Club said, [...] "Were just {{as much of a}} person as someone whos 18." [...] The use of fractional votes was also compared to the three-fifths compromise under which slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for U.S. Census enumeration purposes prior to slaverys abolition in 1865. Another criticism was that the sliding scale went against the principle of one person, one vote. Some opponents worried that it would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and be complicated to implement logistically. Counsel for the California Legislature opined, [...] "because the fundamental right to vote is implicated by SCA 19, a court would likely apply the strict scrutiny standard in determining whether the granting of only a <b>fractional</b> <b>vote</b> to a voter under the age of 18, or the differential treatment of classes of voters under the age of 18, would violate the equal protection clause and, pursuant to that standard, that the state would have to demonstrate, with a strong basis in evidence, that imposing those limitations is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest." [...] The bill was mocked by commentators who joked, [...] "They could have half a beer too or something like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{supporters}} of the single transferable vote method describe STV {{as a form of}} cumulative <b>voting</b> with <b>fractional</b> <b>votes.</b> The difference is that the STV method itself determines the fractions based on a rank preference ballot from voters and interactions with the preferences of other voters. Furthermore, the ranked choice feature of the STV ballot makes it unlikely that voters might split their votes among candidates in a manner that hurts their interests; with cumulative voting, it is possible to [...] "waste" [...] votes by giving some candidates more votes than necessary to win and by dividing votes among multiple candidates such that none of them win.|$|R
40|$|I {{attended}} a doctoral symposium of the conference. It {{was very good}} to know about how to guide PhD students to conduct high-quality research and complete PhD program. I {{attended a}}ll the keynote sessions of the conference. The presentation on Computational Disaster Management by Professor Pascal Van Hentenryck was very insightful and encouraging. The talk on “Agents might not be people” by Professor Nigel Gilbert was illuminating. The talk on “Satisfiability to Linear Algebra” by Professor Fangzhen Lin was revealing. I attended almost all sections of PRIMA 2013 and some presentations of AI 2013. They reflect the advancement of the field. The discussions with the people on-site were very interesting and helpful to my future research. Also, {{it was great to}} talk to active researchers in the field and exchanged ideas of our research and explored the possibility of collaboration. This paper describes the design of a multiagent system that facilitates course-offering decision making for a program in an institution. We first model course offering determination for upcoming semester as a multi-winner election with exogenous constraints which is a problem for computational social choice in multiagent systems, which has rarely been considered. Then, the paper describes the architecture and models of the multiagent system for course offering determination with Gaia role model methodology, TROPOS strategic actor diagram, Agent Unified Modeling Language (AUML) sequence diagram for a multi-agent negotiation interaction protocol, and Pseudo-code algorithms for generating <b>fractional</b> <b>votes</b> and course election protocol. A novel course selection preference model for students has been proposed and described formally. The effectiveness of the approach and the implemented system has been showed with the initial experimental results...|$|R
