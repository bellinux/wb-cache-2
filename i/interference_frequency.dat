2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{wideband}} FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this {{also makes the}} signal more robust against noise and <b>interference.</b> <b>Frequency</b> modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM {{was chosen as the}} modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term [...] "FM radio" [...] (although for many years the BBC called it [...] "VHF radio" [...] because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band—the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the capture effect, in which the tuner [...] "captures" [...] the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an AM receiver, where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.|$|E

Recently, we proposed a stimulation approximation approach {{to increase the number}} of visual stimuli that can be realized on a com-puter monitor. In addition to the fundamental and harmonic frequencies, the refresh rate-based stimulation approach also elicits SSVEPs at other frequencies that are termed interference frequencies, which are derived from the interaction between the stimulation frequency and the refresh rate.

The experimental results show that the electromagnetic disturbance (EMD) signal effect is dependent on the number of turns, the direction of the electromagnetic field, and the frequency and amplitude of the interference voltage. Specifically, it is shown that when the electromagnetic field acts in the opposite direction to that of the laser beam, the intensity and optical power of the detected signal decrease with an increasing <b>interference</b> <b>frequency</b> or amplitude. By contrast, when the electromagnetic field acts {{in the same direction as}} that of the laser beam, the intensity and optical power increase with an increasing <b>interference</b> <b>frequency</b> or amplitude.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of linear Vibration Energy Harvesters (VEH) under broadband vibrations with multiple frequency peaks. The output power of both electromagnetic and piezoelectric linear VEH is determined when excited by a single frequency excitation and when excited by two frequency peaks, one at resonance and the other at a different frequency (defined as the <b>interference</b> <b>frequency).</b> Experimentally, {{it was found that}} when a linear VEH is excited by two-peak vibrations, its output power is lower than {{in the case of the}} single frequency excitation. Furthermore, the larger the amplitude at the interference frequencies, the lower the output power of the VEH. Also, for the same interference peak amplitudes, the further the <b>interference</b> <b>frequency</b> is from the resonant frequency, the lower the output power is.

40|$|Abstract Background Public access defibrillators (PADs) are now {{available}} for more efficient and rapid treatment of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest. PADs are used normally by untrained {{people on the streets}} and in sports centers, airports, and other public areas. Therefore, automated detection of ventricular fibrillation, or its exclusion, is of high importance. A special case exists at railway stations, where electric power-line frequency interference is significant. Many countries, especially in Europe, use 16. 7 Hz AC power, which introduces high level frequency-varying interference that may compromise fibrillation detection. Method Moving signal averaging is often used for 50 / 60 Hz interference suppression if its effect on the ECG spectrum has little importance (no morphological analysis is performed). This approach may be also applied to the railway situation, if the <b>interference</b> <b>frequency</b> is continuously detected so as to synchronize the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) for introducing variable inter-sample intervals. A better solution consists of rated ADC, software frequency measuring, internal irregular re-sampling according to the <b>interference</b> <b>frequency,</b> and a moving average over a constant sample number, followed by regular back re-sampling. Results The proposed method leads to a total railway interference cancellation, together with suppression of inherent noise, while the peak amplitudes of some sharp complexes are reduced. This reduction has negligible effect on accurate fibrillation detection. Conclusion The method is developed in the MATLAB environment and represents a useful tool for real time railway interference suppression. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, Independent Front Wheel Steering (IFWS) is studied. To {{implement}} an IFWS system, it {{is important}} to understand how dynamics of the front wheel and steering motor work. Furthermore it can be challenging to provide haptic feedback to the driver, especially when an active safety system is constantly adjusting the angle of the front wheel and causing interference. First a model of a front wheel steering system with a variable gear ratio between motor and front wheels is created. At low gear ratios, the simulations show an improvement of the response of the steering system to the tyre forces. A compromise should be made between a small motor and low gear ratio. A low gear ratio is desirable as it improves the accuracy of a direct current measurement (DCM), which is required for providing the driver with haptic feedback with road information. Then a virtual model (VM) based on the bicycle model is created which can estimate the actual tyre forces within a 16 % accuracy. The error in the VM is caused by the approximation of nonlinear vehicle dynamics. The DCM and the VM are compared to their reference tyre forces in a modified double lane change and a steady state corner simulation. A combiner of the DCM and VM (Combiner DCM and VM (CDV)) is proposed which can blend the two feedback sources. At low <b>interference</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the CDV shows good results. At high <b>interference</b> <b>frequencies,</b> presence of the inertia and damping of the steering system become more dominant compared to the tyre forces and causes a phase lead in the DCM. Towards the natural frequency of the steering system, the magnitude of the required motor current decreases. The result is a poor performance of the CDV at high <b>interference</b> <b>frequencies.</b> One of the recommendation for improving the CDV is installing a motor with a high constant torque value. The motor is coupled to the front wheel with a low gear ratio and will lower the inertia and damping of the steering system. This increases the eigenfrequency of the steering system and improves the bandwidth of the DCM. However the space requirements of a bigger motor can cause problems for implementation.

40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{biomedical}} amplifiers have a {{very high}} common mode rejection ratio. Nevertheless, recordings are often contaminated by residual power-line interference. Traditional analogue and digital filters are known to suppress ECG components near to the power-line frequency. Different types of digital notch filters are widely used despite their inherent contradiction: tolerable signal distortion needs a narrow frequency band, which leads to ineffective filtering in cases of larger frequency deviation of the interference. Adaptive filtering introduces unacceptable transient response time, especially after steep and large QRS complexes. Other available techniques such as Fourier transform do not work in real time. The subtraction procedure is found to cope better with this problem. Method The subtraction procedure was developed some two decades ago, and almost totally eliminates power-line interference from the ECG signal. This procedure does not affect the signal frequency components around the interfering frequency. Digital filtering is applied on linear segments of the signal to remove the interference components. These interference components are stored and further subtracted from the signal wherever non-linear segments are encountered. Results Modifications of the subtraction procedure have been used in thousands of ECG instruments and computer-aided systems. Other work has extended this procedure to almost all possible cases of sampling rate and <b>interference</b> <b>frequency</b> variation. Improved structure of the on-line procedure has worked successfully regardless of the multiplicity between the sampling rate and the <b>interference</b> <b>frequency.</b> Such flexibility is due to the use of specific filter modules. Conclusion The subtraction procedure has largely proved advantageous over other methods for power-line interference cancellation in ECG signals. </p...|$|E
