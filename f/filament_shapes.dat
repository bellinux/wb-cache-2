40|$|Many {{bacteria}} use rotating helical flagellar filaments to swim. The filaments undergo polymorphic {{transformations in}} which the helical pitch and radius change abruptly. These transformations arise in response to mechanical loading, changes in solution temperature and ionic strength, and point substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the protein subunits {{that make up the}} filament. To explain polymorphism, we propose a new coarse-grained continuum rod theory based on the quaternary structure of the filament. The model has two molecular switches. The first is a double-well potential for the extension of a protofilament, {{which is one of the}} eleven almost longitudinal columns of subunits. Curved <b>filament</b> <b>shapes</b> occur in the model when there is a mismatch strain, i. e. when inter-subunit bonds in the inner core of the filament prefer a subunit spacing which is intermediate between the two spacings favored by the double-well potential. The second switch is a double-well potential for twist, due to lateral interactions between neighboring protofilaments. Cooperative interactions between neighboring subunits within a protofilament are necessary to ensure the uniqueness of helical ground states. We calculate a phase diagram for <b>filament</b> <b>shapes</b> and the response of a filament to external moment and force. Comment: 17 pages, 21 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{two-dimensional}} {{model for the}} dynamics of axonemal deformations driven by internally generated forces of molecular motors. Our model consists of an elastic filament pair connected by active elements. We derive the dynamic equations for this system in presence of internal forces. In the limit of small deformations, a perturbative approach allows us to calculate <b>filament</b> <b>shapes</b> and the tension profile. We demonstrate that periodic filament motion can be generated via a self-organization of elastic filaments and molecular motors. Oscillatory motion and the propagation of bending waves can occur for an initially non-moving state via an instability termed Hopf bifurcation. Close to this instability, {{the behavior of the}} system is shown to be independent of microscopic details of the axoneme and the force-generating mechanism. The oscillation frequency however does depend on properties of the molecular motors. We calculate the oscillation frequency at the bifurcation point and show that a large frequency range is accessible by varying the axonemal length between 1 and 50 μm. We calculate the velocity of swimming of a flagellum and discuss the effects of boundary conditions and externally applied forces on the axonemal oscillations.

40|$|Actuating {{periodically}} {{an elastic}} filament in a viscous liquid generally breaks {{the constraints of}} Purcell’s scallop theorem, resulting in the generation of a net propulsive force. This observation suggests a method to design simple swimming devices- which we call “elastic swimmers ”- where the actuation mechanism is embedded in a solid body and the resulting swimmer is free to move. In this paper, we study theoretically the kinematics of elastic swimming. After discussing the basic physical picture of the phenomenon and the expected scaling relationships, we derive analytically the elastic swimming velocities {{in the limit of}} small actuation amplitude. The emphasis is on the coupling between the two unknowns of the problems- namely the shape of the elastic filament and the swimming kinematics- which have to be solved simultaneously. We then compute the performance of the resulting swimming device, and its dependance on geometry. The optimal actuation frequency and body shapes are derived and a discussion of <b>filament</b> <b>shapes</b> and internal torques is presented. Swimming using multiple elastic filaments is discussed, and simple strategies are presented which result in straight swimming trajectories. Finally, we compare the performance of elastic swimming with that of swimming microorganisms and show that optimal elastic swimmers can achieve velocities similar to that of flagellated cells.

40|$|Among {{the most}} widely used {{additive}} manufacturing technologies is the material extrusion based process, in which a filament of thermoplastic material is liquefied and extruded through a nozzle to build a three-dimensional object in a layer-upon-layer fashion. One of the challenges of this technology is the limited availability of materials. In order to expand the portfolio of available materials, while reducing the cost of existing material productions, polypropylene-based polymers and composite materials for material extrusion additive manufacturing are investigated. However, since polypropylene is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic, a three-dimensional part fabricated with this material has a tendency to warp. In this thesis, material extrusion process simulation models are developed that are capable of predicting the temperature distributions, deposited <b>filament</b> <b>shapes,</b> residual stresses and warpages/deformations of fabricated parts. An alternative to reduce warpage of polypropylene parts is to create composite materials by combining with additives. Therefore, these process simulation models support the development of new materials by predicting part warpages quickly and cost effectively without the need of iterative experiments. These material extrusion process simulation models can be applied to both the quality and performance of fabricated parts, such as warpage and mechanical property anisotropy. The correlations between process variable settings on additive manufacturing machines and material properties of polypropylene-based composite materials on warpage characteristics are determined. In addition, the correlations between mechanical property anisotropy and the bonding quality of extruded filaments are examined experimentally by producing tensile property data of fabricated parts with different fill angles. The efficacy of the process simulation models are then evaluated by comparing the experimental and simulation model results. M. S...|$|E

They also are a suspected cause in the formation and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation, whose lethality is well known. It is therefore of considerable interest {{to find out what}} configurations can be adopted by such pathologies. A scroll's behavior is embodied in its organizing center or filament, a largely quiescent tube about which the scroll rotates. Predicting <b>filament</b> <b>shape</b> has normally required computer-intensive simulations of the whole scroll in time. We have found a fast and robust principle that yields the prediction for stationary filaments on a purely geometrical basis, blind to the reaction parameters of the medium. The procedure is to calculate the <b>filament</b> <b>shape</b> as a minimal path. We work in singly diffusive media whose diffusivity tensor—and no other feature—varies spatially. Mathematical and numerical evidence is presented for the proposition that a stable filament is a geodesic in a three-dimensional space whose metric is given by the inverse diffusivity tensor of the medium. Away from the boundaries, a stable filament is unaffected by the reaction parameters. The algorithmic aspects of this work are subsidiary to our main purpose of drawing attention to the universal and unexpectedly exact fit of an elementary geodesic principle within reaction–diffusion theories...|$|R
40|$|Elastic {{filaments}} {{subjected to}} hydrodynamic forcing {{are a common}} class of fluid-structure interaction problems. In biology, they are crucial to cytoskeletal motions of the cell, the locomotion of micro-organisms, and mucal transport. In engineering, they are often the source of non-Newtonian rheological properties {{and a variety of}} complex fluid behavior such as hydrodynamic instabilities and chaotic mixing. At the heart of many of these dynamics is the competition between an elastic backbone and viscous forces acting to deform it, tangled with the anisotropic shape of such filaments as well as slowly decaying hydrodynamic interactions in a Stokesian fluid. In this work, we use slender-body theory for low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics to address theoretically and computationally a few such problems of physical and biological significance. We first describe the tumbling of polymers in shear flow and the suppression of thermal fluctuations in extensional flow. A theory for the stretch-coil transition of semiflexible polymers is also developed. We then turn to the transport properties of semiflexible filaments in a flow setup that mimics some of the dynamics of biological polymers in motility assays. Thermal fluctuations frequently trap polymers within vortical cells, and are shown to lead to subdiffusive transport at long times. The mechanism behind this anomalous feature and the subtle role of flexibility is emphasized. Then we focus on the sedimentation of flexible filaments. In the weakly flexible regime, a multiple-scale asymptotic expansion is used to obtain expressions for <b>filament</b> <b>shapes</b> and peculiar trajectories. In the highly flexible regime, we show that a filament sedimenting along its long axis is susceptible to a buckling instability. Our predictions are corroborated by detailed numerical simulations. Finally, we look at suspensions of sedimenting elastic fibers, emphasizing the role of filament shape, flexibility, and long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions. We develop a mean-field theory for such a suspension, and its stability to perturbations of fiber concentration is analytically explored. Detailed numerical simulations are also performed to verify these predictions and elucidate the microstructural mechanisms tied to the growth or suppression of this instability...|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method is disclosed for fabricating mats of ceramic material comprising preparing a slurry of ceramic particles in a binder/solvent, charging the slurry into a vessel, forcing the slurry from the vessel into spinneret nozzles, discharging the slurry from the nozzles {{into the path}} of airjets to enhance the sinuous character of the slurry exudate and to dry it, collecting the filaments on a moving belt so that the filaments overlap each other thereby forming a mat, curing the binder therein, compressing and sintering the mat to form a sintered mat, and crushing the sintered mat to produce <b>filament</b> <b>shaped</b> fragments. A process is also disclosed for producing a tape of densely packed, bonded ceramic particles comprising forming a slurry of ceramic particles and a binder/solvent, applying the slurry to a rotating internal molding surface, applying a large centrifugal force to the slurry to compress it and force excess binder/solvent from the particles, evaporating solvent and curing the binder thereby forming layers of bonded ceramic particles and cured binder, and separating the binder layer from the layer of particles.

We also neglected any <b>filament</b> <b>shape</b> change (thermal fluctuations or drag by viscous forces) that might affect the position of the filaments in space. This assumption, which is valid during the early phase when filament lengths are less than the persistence length (w 15 mm), does not weaken the model or our conclusions and numerical simu-lation over long periods is facilitated. Because the concentration of actin monomers is high and all actin-filament barbed ends are rooted on the circular line, where formins are located, the filament growth does not depend on <b>filament</b> <b>shape</b> changes away from the bead.

Lateral filament contacts between the hydrophobic loop and neighboring short-pitch helix monomers in native filaments are also compromised with cofilin binding.

40|$|International audienceComputational and {{structural}} {{studies have been}} indispensable in investigating the molecular origins of actin filament mechanical properties and modulation by the regulatory severing protein cofilin. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of cofilactin filament structures determined by electron cryomicroscopy reveal how cofilin enhances the bending and twisting compliance of actin filaments. Continuum mechanics models suggest that buckled cofilactin filaments localize elastic energy at boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated segments because of their nonuniform elasticity, thereby accelerating filament severing. Here, we develop mesoscopic length-scale (cofil) actin filament models and evaluate the effects of compressive and twisting loads on strain energy distribution at specific interprotein interfaces. The models reliably capture the filament bending and torsional rigidities and intersubunit torsional flexibility measured experimentally with purified protein components. Buckling is predicted to enhance cofilactin filament severing with minimal effects on cofilin occupancy, whereas filament twisting enhances cofilin dissociation without compromising filament integrity. Preferential severing at actin-cofilactin boundaries of buckled filaments is more prominent than predicted by continuum models because of the enhanced spatial resolution.

Previous models of chiral filament bundle formation have shown that this frustration gives rise to several distinct morphological responses, including self-limiting bundle widths, anisotropic domain (tape-like) formation and topological defects in the lateral inter-filament order. In this paper, we employ a combination of continuum elasticity theory and discrete filament bundle simulations to explore how these distinct morphological responses compete in the broader phase diagram of chiral filament assembly. We show that the most generic model of bundle formation exhibits at least four classes of equilibrium structure [...] finite-width, twisted bundles with isotropic and anisotropic shapes, with and without topological defects, as well as bulk phases of untwisted, columnar assembly (i. e. "frustration escape"). These competing equilibrium morphologies are selected by only {{a relatively small number}} of parameters describing filament assembly: bundle surface energy, preferred chiral twist and stiffness of chiral filament interactions, and mechanical stiffness of filaments and their lateral interactions.

40|$|Densely-packed {{bundles of}} {{biological}} filaments (filamentous proteins) are common and critical structural elements in range of biological materials. While most bundles form from intrinsically straight filaments, there are notable examples of protein filaments possessing a natural, or intrinsic, curvature, {{such as the}} helical bacterial flagellum. We study the non-linear interplay between thermodynamic preference for dense and regular inter-filament packing and the mechanical preference for uniform <b>filament</b> <b>shape</b> in bundles of helically-curved filaments. Geometric constraints in bundles make perfect inter-filament (constant spacing, or isometric) packing incompatible with perfect intra-filament (constant shape, or isomorphic) packing. As a consequence, we predict that bundle packing exhibits a strong sensitivity to bundle size, evolving from the isometric packing at small radii to an isomorphic packing at large radii. The nature of the transition between these extremal states depends on thermodynamic costs of packing distortion, with packing in elastically-constrained bundles evolving smoothly with size, while packing in osmotically-compressed bundles may exhibit a singular transition from the isometric packing at a finite bundle radius. We consider the equilibrium assembly of bundles in a saturated solution of filaments and show that mechanical cost of isomorphic packing leads to self-limited equilibrium bundle diameters, whose size and range of thermodynamic stability depend both on condensation mechanism, {{as well as the}} helical geometry of filaments.

A lumped-element-model (LEM) constructed to study the acousticmechanical behavior of the droplet generator. The droplet generator volumetric rejection from experimental study compared with that from LEM. Results show that LEM can predict the internal acoustic-mechanical behavior with reasonable accuracy. Based on the LEM, the PZT displacement magnitude dominates the internal pressure variation within the chamber. However due to the natural response of droplet generator, the acoustic pressure in the droplet generator decays exponentially. Experimental data show that the droplet formation process can be waveform and frequency dependent. When the droplet formation process is driven in "low frequency" regime, droplet formation process is weakly affected by frequency. Meniscus interaction effects, which are the interaction of a liquid filament from different droplet generation cycles, on droplet formation process are present when droplet formation process is driven in "high frequency" regime.
