30|$|Since {{our system}} is based on binary masking, it is {{informative}} to compare with the SNR gain of the IBM which is constructed from premixed instrument sounds. Although overlapping harmonics are not separated by ideal binary masking, the SNR gain is still very high, {{as shown in the}} fifth row of Table 1. There are several reasons for the performance gap between the proposed system and the ideal binary mask. One is that pitch-based labeling is not <b>error-free.</b> <b>Second,</b> a T-segment can be mistaken, that is, containing significant energy from two different sources. Also using contextual information may not always lead to the right labeling of a T-segment.|$|R
5000|$|The Dragon {{spacecraft}} rendezvoused {{with the}} International Space Station on 22 February, but its approach was automatically aborted by an on-board computer at 08:25 UTC when a data error {{was reported in}} its navigation system. This is the first rendezvous abort by a Dragon spacecraft. The problem was traced to an incorrect data value in the spacecraft's Global Positioning System, critical to operations as this data informs the vehicle of its relative position to the space station. The abort resulted in a 24-hour hold on its approach. The error was corrected in this time, during which the spacecraft entered a [...] "racetrack" [...] trajectory around the station to reset its approach. An <b>error-free</b> <b>second</b> attempt resulted in Dragon being captured by the station's Canadarm2 on 23 February at 10:44 UTC, with berthing to the Harmony module taking place {{a few hours later}} at 13:12 UTC.|$|R

40|$|Eukaryotic cells possess several {{mechanisms}} {{to protect the}} integrity of their DNA against damage. These include cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA-repair pathways, and also a distinct DNA damage-tolerance system that allows recovery of replication forks blocked at sites of DNA damage. In both humans and yeast, lesion bypass and restart of DNA synthesis can occur through an error-prone pathway activated following mono-ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a protein found at sites of replication, and recruitment of specialized translesion synthesis polymerases. In yeast, there is evidence for a <b>second,</b> <b>error-free,</b> pathway that requires modification of PCNA with non-proteolytic lysine 63 -linked polyubiquitin (K 63 -polyUb) chains. Here we demonstrate that formation of K 63 -polyUb chains protects human cells against translesion synthesis-induced mutations by promoting recovery of blocked replication forks through an alternative error-free mechanism. Furthermore, we show that polyubiquitination of PCNA occurs in UV-irradiated human cells. Our findings indicate that K 63 -polyubiquitination guards against environmental carcinogenesis and contributes to genomic stability...|$|R

This NR video quality assessment measure accounts for three key factors which affect the overall perceived picture quality of networked video, namely, picture distortion caused by quantization, quality degradation due to packet loss and error propagation, and temporal effects of the human visual system. First, the picture quality in the spatial domain is measured, for each frame, relative to quantization under an <b>error-free</b> transmission condition. <b>Second,</b> picture quality is evaluated with respect to packet loss and the subsequent error propagation.

40|$|Mutagenesis {{by simple}} alkylating agents {{is thought to}} occur by either a lexA+-dependent process called {{error-prone}} repair or a lex-independent process often attributed to mispairing during replication. We show here that error-prone repair {{is responsible for the}} majority of mutants formed after a large dose of alkylating agent, but it is unlikely that it contributes significantly to mutagenesis during exposure to low concentrations of these chemicals. The mutagenicity of these low doses of alkylating agent is reduced by a repair system constitutively present in lexA+ cells but absent in lexA mutants. This system reduces mutagenesis until a <b>second</b> <b>error-free</b> system, called the adaptive responses, can be induced [P. Jeggo, M. Defais, L. Samson, and P. Schendel, Mol. Gen. Genet, 157 : 1 - 9, 1977; L. Samson and J. Cairns, Nature (London) 267 : 281 - 283, 1977]. The adaptive response is capable of dealing with a much larger amount of alkylation damage than the constitutive system and, when induced, appears to be able to reduce mutagenesis by both decreasing the number of sites available for mutagenesis and delaying the induction of error-prone repair enzymes. Finally, we discuss a model of chemically induced mutagenesis based on these findings which maintains that the observed mutation frequency is dependent on a "race" between these two error-free systems and the two mutagenic pathways...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{cellular}} reorganization {{needed for}} successful mitosis requires spatial regulatory cues. I examine this problem at two different levels. First, I analyze a phosphorylation gradient for substrates of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC). CPC is a conserved regulator involved in key mitotic {{events such as}} chromosome-microtubule attachment and spindle midzone formation. Previously, spatial phosphorylation gradients have been reported for CPC substrates, raising the possibility that CPC-dependent signaling establishes order on the micron-length scale in dividing cells. However, this hypothesis has not been tested, largely because of incomplete characterization of the CPC-dependent phosphorylation dynamics. Here I examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of CPC-dependent phosphorylation along microtubules throughout mitosis using a Forster resonance energy transfer-based sensor. I find that a CFC-substrate phosphorylation gradient, with highest phosphorylation levels between the two spindle po l es, emerge s when a cell enters mitosis. After anaphase onset, the gradient emerges and persists until cell cleavage. Selective mislocalization of the CPC during anaphase suppresses gradient formation, but overall substrate phosphorylation levels remain unchanged. Under these conditions, the spindle midzone fails to organize and function properly. My findings suggest a model in which the CPC establishes phosphorylation gradients to coordinate the spatiotemporal dynamics needed for <b>error-free</b> cell division. <b>Second,</b> I examine the contribution of a microtubule crosslinking protein PRCl to microtubule organization during cytokinesis. I find that PRCl depletion leads to abnormal elongation of anaphase spindle, which depends on mic rotubules. I also find that the dynamics of growing microtubule plus-ends imaged by EBl-GFP is not significantly altered. Based on these findings, I propose a model for how PRCl contributes to the length control of the anaphase spindle...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Electrical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Energy cost-reduction {{projects}} implemented on complex industrial systems present several challenges. The {{involvement of}} multiple project stakeholders associated with programmes such as {{demand side management}} (DSM) further increases potential risks. The process of determining project impacts is especially important due to the direct financial impact on stakeholders. A good understanding of the independent measurement and verification (M&V) process is therefore vital to ensure an unbiased process. A review of existing M&V frameworks and guidelines found that M&V protocols and templates are well developed and widely implemented. Unfortunately, the official literature provides little guidance on the practical M&V of industrial DSM projects. This prompted a detailed literature analysis of numerous publications to ascertain the industry norm. The diverse results obtained are categorised, normalised and graphically presented to highlight shortcomings in present M&V processes. This thesis develops several practical methodologies and guidelines {{to address the needs}} highlighted by the literature analysis. Three chapters are dedicated to the development and verification of these solutions. The first entails the evaluation of data quality with the aim of producing an accurate and <b>error-free</b> dataset. The <b>second</b> develops, evaluates and ultimately selects a baseline model representative of normal system operations. The final chapter presents project performance and uses existing methods to monitor system changes and project performance over the long term. The new methodologies are designed to simplify the practical implementation of different processes. Results are graphically presented thereby enabling quick and intuitive evaluation whilst adhering to present M&V requirements. This makes the M&V process accessible to all stakeholders and enables the transparent development and improvement of all processes. The practical application of the new methodologies is verified by using 25 industrial case studies. The results obtained are validated using data obtained from independent third parties. This proves the functionality of the methodologies and highlights trends that can be evaluated in future studies. The new methodologies improve the accuracy and efficiency of the evaluation process. The potential annual impacts amount to R 27 million for DSM stakeholders and R 19 million for M&V teams. The extrapolation of these results indicates a massive potential impact on international projects. These results, albeit estimates, confirm the significant contribution of the new methodologies. I would like to officially thank Prof. Eddie Mathews and Prof. Marius Kleingeld for granting me the opportunity to work under their guidance. Thanks to all the staff at the Centre for Research and Continued Engineering Development Pretoria, who created the ideal environment for working and learning. I {{would also like to thank}} TEMM International (Pty) Ltd for the bursary without which my studies would not be possible.
