Despite the similarity of name, there is no documentary evidence that Edison's phonograph was based on Scott's phonautograph.

Although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced, his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later. The tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated. The recording could be played back immediately. The Scientific American article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned Marey, Rosapelly and Barlow as well as Scott as creators of devices for recording but, importantly, not reproducing sound. Edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats. Numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned, but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations, the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use. A decade later, Edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a <b>foil</b> <b>sheet.</b> This proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device.

5000|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round [...] "cylinder seals" [...] for rolling an impress onto clay tablets goes back to early Mesopotamian civilization before 3000 BC, where {{they are the most}} common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13&times;13 cm) stamps for marking clay bricks survive from Akkad from around 2270 BC. [...] There are also Roman lead pipe inscriptions of some length that were stamped, and amulet MS 5236 may be a unique surviving gold <b>foil</b> <b>sheet</b> stamped with an amulet text in the 6th century BC. However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of small stamps for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the same—in Europe special presentation impressions of prints were often printed on silk until at least the 17th century.|$|E

An oviposition experiment used arrays of S. polygaloides grown on Ni-amended (high-Ni) soil interspersed with plants grown on unamended (low-Ni) soil and eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae fed freely among plants in the arrays. We also explored oviposition preference by allowing moths to oviposit on <b>foil</b> <b>sheets</b> coated with high- or low-Ni plant extract. This was followed by an experiment using low-Ni plant extract to which varying amounts of Ni had been added and an experiment using sheets coated with sinigrin (allyl gluco-sinolate) as an oviposition stimulant. Diamondback moths laid 2. 5 -fold more eggs on low-Ni plants than on high-Ni plants and larval feeding was greater on low-Ni plants. High-Ni plants grew twice as tall, produced more leaves, and produced almost 3. 5 -fold more flowers. Low-Ni plants contained more allyl glucosinolate than high-Ni plants and moths preferred to oviposit on <b>foil</b> <b>sheets</b> dipped in low-Ni plant extract. Moths showed no preference when Ni concentration of low-Ni extract was varied and over-whelmingly preferred sinigrin coated sheets. We conclude that Ni hyperaccumulation is an effective ele-mental defence against this herbivore, increasing plant fitness {{through a combination of}} toxicity to DBM larvae and decreased oviposition by adults...|$|R

40|$|Large Strain Extrusion Machining (LSEM), a {{constrained}} {{chip formation}} process, is proposed and demonstrated {{as a method}} of Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD) for metals and alloys. It is shown that SPD parameters such as deformation strain, macro-texture and strain rate can be controlled by varying the tool rake angle and chip compression (thickness) ratio, while imposing large strains in the chip in a single step of deformation. This level of parameter control is not achievable in any of the conventional SPD processes. By controlling the geometry of the chip (extrudate) a priori using a constraining tool, production of bulk material in <b>foil,</b> <b>sheet</b> and bar forms, and with nanostructured and ultrafine grained (UFG) microstructures, is demonstrated using commercially pure copper and aluminum 6061 -T 6 as model systems. The effects of secondary deformation arising from friction at the tool-chip contact and of the incipient (transient) stage of chip formation on the foil/sheet microstructure are characterized. ^ A characterization of the deformation field is carried out using the method of slip line fields (SLFs). Unlike upper-bound models, it is possible to estimate strain profiles, hydrostatic pressure and modes of deformation using an SLF model. By using an SLF model, estimates are made of SPD parameters such as strain, machining force and hydrostatic pressure, and their dependence on controllable input variables of tool rake angle and chip compression ratio. This analysis provides a theoretical framework for the use of LSEM {{as a method of}} SPD, and for its implementation as a process for making bulk nanostructured materials. ^ The experimental results and the SLF model suggest a number of exciting possibilities for the LSEM. These include creation of bulk nanostructured and UFG alloys from a variety of materials, scaling of the process to make sheet, foil, wire and bar, study and control of material texture, and the possibility of a new method for consolidation of particulates and foils. ...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDouglas S. McGregorThe 3 He gas {{shortage}} for neutron detection has caused {{an increase in}} research efforts to develop viable alternative technologies. 3 He neutron detectors cover areas ranging from 10 – 1000 cm 2 in cylindrical form factors and are ideal for many nuclear applications due to their high intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency (> 80 %) and gamma-ray discrimination (GRR ≤ 1 x 10 - 6) capabilities. Neutron monitoring systems for nuclear security applications include Radiation Portal Monitors (RPM’s), backpack, briefcase, and hand-held sensors. A viable replacement technology is presented here and compares three neutron detectors, each with different neutron absorber materials, to current 3 He standards. These materials include Li and/or B silica aerogels, LiF impregnated foams, and metallic Li foils. Additionally, other neutron absorbing materials were investigated in this work and include LiF coated Mylar, B foils, BN coated carbon foam, and BN coated plastic honeycomb. From theoretical calculations, the Li foil material showed the greatest promise as a viable 3 He alternative, thus {{a majority of the}} research efforts were focused on this material. The new neutron detector was a multi-wire proportional counter (MWPC) constructed using alternating banks of anode wires and 95 % enriched 6 Li foils sheets spaced 1. 63 cm apart. In total, six anode banks and five layers of foil were used, thus an anode wire bank was positioned on each side of a suspended foils. Reaction products from the 6 Li(n,α) 3 H reaction were able to escape both side of a <b>foil</b> <b>sheet</b> simultaneously and be measured in the surrounding gas volume concurrently. This new concept of measuring both reaction products from a single neutron absorption in a solid-form absorber material increased the intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency and gamma-ray discrimination compared to coated gas-filled detectors. Three different sizes of Li foil MWPC neutron detectors were constructed ranging from 25 – 1250 cm 2 and included detectors for RPM’s, backpacks, and hand-held systems. The measured intrinsic thermal neutron detection efficiency of these devices was approximately 54 %, but it is possible to exceed 80 % efficiency with additional foils. The gamma-ray discrimination abilities of the detector exceeded 3 He tubes by almost three orders of magnitude (GRR = 7. 6 x 10 - 9) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{unloading}} springback of <b>sheet</b> metal <b>foils</b> after micro-bending process, a constitutive model is proposed {{based on the}} surface layer model by which the <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> is divided into surface layer and inner portions. For the inner portion, each grain is envisaged as a composite, comprised of grain interior and grain boundary work-hardened layer. The classical composite model is then used to calculate its flow stress. For the surface layer portion, a model without grain boundary strengthening is constructed to represent the flow stress in this zone. The developed method is verified through the comparison of the calculated strain-stress curves with the tensile test results of four kinds of pure copper <b>sheet</b> <b>foils</b> with different thicknesses ranging from 0. 1 mm to 0. 6 mm. To investigate the effect of thickness and grain size on the springback of pure copper <b>sheet</b> <b>foils,</b> three-point bending tests are carried out. A finite element (FE) model for predicting the springback in micro-bending process is further developed, which {{takes into account the}} deformation behavior and orientation of each grain. The influences of grain size and thickness on the springback of <b>sheet</b> <b>foils</b> are investigated. The research results show that the decrease of <b>sheet</b> <b>foil</b> thickness or the increase of grain size results in a big springback. The scatter of springback angle is mainly attributed to the elastic anisotropy of surface grains and increases with the reduction of grains along the thickness direction.

The efficiency of the DSCs based on the TiO 2 micro-flowers was found to reach 1.517 %. The efficiency levels of the DSCs based on the TiO 2 micro-flowers were relatively low compared to those of conventional DSCs based on TiO 2 nanoparticle structures, as the thickness of the TiO 2 nanotubes in the micro-flowers was very small.
