40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to (i) assess the {{efficacy}} of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) for detecting Arctic Charr at their spawning grounds and (ii) characterize the overall acoustic soundscape of these sites. PAM was carried out over three Arctic Charr spawning grounds in the UK, one lotic and two lentic. 24 -h cycles of recordings were collected prior to and during the Arctic Charr spawning season, which was determined from data returns by simultaneous net monitoring. Acoustic analysis consisted of manual quantification of sound sources, Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) calculation and spectral analysis in 1 / 3 octave band (SPL; dB re 1  μPa). In the lotic spawning ground, prior to the beginning of Arctic Charr spawning, SPL and ACI showed a restricted range of variation throughout the 24 -h, while during spawning the night values of SPL and ACI were found to significantly increase, concurrently with the rate of <b>gravel</b> <b>noise</b> induced by fish spawning activities and fish air passage sounds. Both prior to and during the Arctic Charr run, the lentic soundscape was characterized by diel variation due to the daytime presence of anthropogenic noise and the night-time presence of insect calls, while only a few occurrences of fish air passage sounds and <b>gravel</b> <b>noise</b> were recorded. These findings suggest that PAM over Arctic Charr spawning grounds could provide meaningful information to be used in developing management plans for this threatened species, such as determining the location and time of arrival, diel pattern and length of spawning activities.

40|$|Excessive noise {{generated}} by roller coasters during operation {{is a significant}} issue for amusement parks located near residential and business districts. Previous work showed that filling the rails with sand and pea <b>gravel</b> can provide <b>noise</b> reduction levels of up to 10 and 15 decibels. However, using damping materials may require additional support structures to accommodate the weight increase and, consequently, raise installation costs. This paper presents field results that characterize sound and vibration of roller coasters with different rail geometry and fill. Finite element modeling is used to compute the theoretical natural frequencies and mode shapes of a typical track section. Additionally, laboratory experimental results of lighter fill materials are presented. The results indicate that vermiculite provides similar, though less noise reduction than sand, but with a much lower additional weight. Furthermore, the handling and manufacturing characteristics are superior to the other materials investigated...|$|R
60|$|Columbine saw {{all this}} dazedly. As Wilson fell {{she closed her}} eyes, {{fighting}} a faintness that almost overcame her. She heard wrestling, threshing sounds, and sodden thumps, and a scattering of <b>gravel.</b> These <b>noises</b> seemed at first distant, then grew closer. As she gazed again with keener perception, Moore's horse plunged away from the fiercely struggling forms that had rolled almost under his feet. During the ensuing moments it was an equal battle so far as Columbine could tell. Repelled, yet fascinated, she watched. They beat each other, grappled and rolled over, first one on top, then the other. But {{the advantage of being}} uppermost presently was Belllounds's. Moore was weakening. That became noticeable more and more after each time he had wrestled and rolled about. Then Belllounds, getting this position, lay with his weight upon Moore, holding him down, {{and at the same time}} kicking with all his might. He was aiming to disable the cowboy by kicking the injured foot. And he was succeeding. Moore let out a strangled cry, and struggled desperately. But he was held and weighted down. Belllounds raised up now and, looking backward, he deliberately and furiously kicked Moore's bandaged foot; once, twice, again and again, until the straining form under him grew limp. Columbine, slowly freezing with horror, saw all this. She could not move. She could not scream. She wanted to rush in and drag Jack off of Wilson, to hurt him, to kill him, but her muscles were paralyzed. In her agony she could not even look away. Belllounds got up astride his prostrate adversary and began to beat him brutally, swinging heavy, sodden blows. His face then was terrible to see. He meant murder.|$|R
40|$|These {{personal}} essays are meditations and speculations; in this sense, they partake equally (in {{spirit and}} metaphorical resonance) of both poetry and prose, written {{over the last}} few years with the encouragement of my mentor and adviser Judith Slater, their subject matter is wide and often strange: abandoned shopping carts, transcribing tapes for an insurance firm, a homeless woman who talks to debris in the street, another woman killed by a trash compactor while inspecting garbage, a child 2 ̆ 7 s eye view of the sky from a snow bank, a troublesome toaster, the haunting presence of crows in winter, a keen sensitivity to <b>noise,</b> <b>gravel</b> roads, the shot-out windows of a church. As Annie Dillard once said of the essay, “The essay can do everything but fake it”—and these, too, try to come to grips with both lived experience and what those experiences have come to signify through the cleansing rigors of prose. They attempt to illuminate the deep mysteries of the commonplace, that which is right in front of our eyes in every day experience. Only the emergent field of creative nonfiction allows for such gambols of the heart and mind, and the possibility of epiphany and redemption in the commonplace only the essay is capacious enough in its variety to look at experience from so many different angles. ^ The settings where these essays “happen” are mostly urban or on I- 80 between Omaha and Lincoln. Although they inevitably draw on memory, the import of their assertions has implications for the present in just how these collective experiences have impinged on my sense of the world. The circuits of thought here are open loops, and raise many questions regarding certain felt omens and signs intuited about American culture at large. The “I” behind them, then, is merely a part of a broader and richer tapestry, one which weaves a contexture toward a deeper understanding—via prose—of the complex relations between the individual and his or her given place in the world. ...|$|R
