5|$|An {{additional}} {{reason for}} a quick <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conflict among the Silesian princes was the personal intervention of King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who in preparation for his final confrontation with King Rudolph I of Habsburg German needed to calm the situation in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{began to}} {{formally}} {{look for a}} new husband for Matilda in early 1127 and received various offers from princes within the Empire. His preference was to use Matilda's marriage to secure the southern borders of Normandy by marrying her to Geoffrey of Anjou, the eldest son of Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Henry's control of Normandy had faced numerous challenges since he had conquered it in 1106, and the latest threat came from his nephew William Clito, the new Count of Flanders, who enjoyed {{the support of the}} French King. It was essential to Henry that he did not also face a threat from the south as well as the east of Normandy. William Adelin had married Fulk's daughter Matilda, which would have cemented an alliance between Henry and Anjou, but the White Ship disaster put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this.</b> Henry and Fulk argued over the fate of the marriage dowry, and this had encouraged Fulk to turn to support William Clito instead. Henry's solution was now to negotiate the marriage of Matilda to Geoffrey, recreating the former alliance.|$|E

5|$|Harith {{advocated}} various reforms, {{the most}} prominent being the full legal equality of the native non-Arab converts (mawali) with the Arab Muslims, echoing a long-standing demand of the former, in conformity with the precepts of Islam. This had been attempted twice before, by the Caliph Umar II (r. 717–720) and by the governors Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Ashras ibn Abdallah al-Sulami, but both times the resulting rise in conversions and concomitant drop in revenue (as the numerous mawali {{would not have to}} pay the poll tax) put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> leading to a first rebellion in 728 under Abu al-Sayda' Salih ibn Tarif. Many of the groups and individuals associated with this first uprising would also participate in Harith's movement. Harith was seen as a champion of the rights of the ʿajam (non-Arabs, especially Iranians), many of whom flocked to his banner, but he also had a large following from the disaffected among the Arabs themselves, especially his fellow Tamim and the Azd. Disaffection was widespread among the Khurasani Arabs due to the heavy casualties suffered against the Turgesh at the Battle of the Defile in 731, as well as the dissemination of anti-Umayyad propaganda by proto-Shi'ite groups. This was exacerbated by the resentment felt at the introduction of 20,000 Iraqi troops into the province {{in the aftermath of the}} Defile, and the parallel order of Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 723–743) to disperse the older Arab settlers from Marw to other settlements so as to improve their defence against the Turgesh.|$|E

25|$|During the Medieval period, {{from the}} Norman Conquest of England in 1066 until the 1530s, much stained glass was {{produced}} and installed in churches, monasteries and cathedrals.

Caesar annexed Numidia for Rome.|$|E

25|$|Plans {{for this}} {{expansion}} were first conceptualized in 1979 when a planning study was undertaken. However, budgetary constraints forced an early <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> study in 1981. In 1988, {{the project was}} reinstated. A study released that year recommended that Highway7 be widened to five lanes with a centre turning lane south of Carleton Place as an interim measure; this {{was carried out in}} 1993.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{invasion}} of barbarian tribes from the north meant an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> prosperity {{in the middle of}} the 3rd century, with the Goths briefly capturing Anchialos around 270. Diocletian stayed in the city between 28 and 30 October 294. His and Constantine the Great's reforms restored the city's prosperity for a while, as the proximity to the new capital of Constantinople made Anchialos a key food supply centre.|$|E
25|$|Jesuits unsuccessfully {{tried to}} peacefully {{assimilate}} the aboriginals into the European culture {{brought by the}} Spanish conquistadores. A certain balance was found {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when the Salado River became the limit between both civilizations, despite frequent malones (aboriginal attacks on border settlements). The <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> situation came in 1879 with the Conquest of the Desert (Conquista del Desierto) in which the aboriginals where almost completely exterminated.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} a Turkic kingdom came up at Ghazni and Sabuktagin ascended its throne in 977. He first added Muslim ruled Bust, Dawar, Qusdar, Tukhristan and Gaur to his kingdom and started {{nibbling}} {{at the border}} territories of the Shahi king at Waihind. To put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> menace, Jayapala twice attached Sabuktagin but failed in his objective. Gradually, Sabuktagin conquered all Shahi territories in Afghanistan, north of the Khyber Pass. He died in 997 and was succeeded by his son Mahmud after a brief war of succession among the brothers.|$|E
25|$|This {{represented}} {{a change from}} previous eras, in which offensive action was the primary mission. In the Napoleonic Wars, for instance, there were instances of massive cavalry charges used for tactical envelopments of infantry formations. The technology of the rifled musket, which emerged in the 1850s, put an effective <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> practice. While swiftly moving cavalry could overwhelm infantry whose weapons fired accurately only 100 yards, the infantryman with a rifled musket (accurate to 300 yards or more) could fire multiple rounds {{in the time it}} took the cavalry to reach his position. A horse and rider were easy targets for these shots.|$|E
25|$|American {{settlement}} {{began in}} earnest in 1869. When the Lake Superior & Mississippi Railroad was built, people could move {{across the country in}} days instead of months. In 1869 Duluth grew from 14 families in January to a population of 3,500 in July. Construction on the Duluth Harbor was started to allow steamboat shipping between Duluth and Buffalo, Detroit and Chicago. The town of Beaver Bay was founded in 1869 as a fishing community, and Grand Marais was founded by Henry Mayhew and Sam Howenstine in 1871. Another panic in 1873 put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> growth, and Duluth shrunk to a population of 1,300.|$|E

25|$|The Cannes Film Festival has {{its origins}} in 1932 when Jean Zay, the French Minister of National Education, on the {{proposal}} of historian Philippe Erlanger and {{with the support of}} the British and Americans, set up an international cinematographic festival. Its origins may be attributed in part to the French desire to compete with the Venice Film Festival, which at the time was shocking the democratic world by its fascist bias. The first festival was planned for 1939, Cannes was selected as the location for it, but the funding and organization were too slow and finally the beginning of World War II put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> plan.|$|E
25|$|His {{admission}} was indirectly {{the cause}} of the only serious literary quarrel of his life. A dispute took place between the Academy and one of its members, Antoine Furetière, {{on the subject of the}} latter's French dictionary, which was decided to be a breach of the Academy's corporate privileges. Furetière, a man of no small ability, bitterly assailed those whom he considered to be his enemies, and among them La Fontaine, whose unlucky Contes made him peculiarly vulnerable, his second collection of these tales having been the subject of a police condemnation. The death of the author of the Roman Bourgeois, however, put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> quarrel.|$|E
25|$|Wendelin Weißheimer became music {{director}} in Augsburg. Despite his official duties {{and numerous other}} engagements he continued to compose. After scoring songs and ballads of the German Minnesang, {{as well as from}} Goethe and other poets, he dealt with his first opera Theodor Körner. Franz Liszt and Wagner spoke appreciatively of this work. Lassalle, who had particularly liked the libretto and was equally enthusiastic about the music, had offered to write Weißheimer a textbook on Florian Geyer, Thomas Munzer or the Bohemian Jan Žižka, but his death put an <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> idea. Wagner had written for Weißheimer a draft for the opera, Wieland the Blacksmith, but gave it back before scoring it.|$|E
