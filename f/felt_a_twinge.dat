5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because of continued pain in his shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E
2500|$|For {{some time}} the Duke {{and his colleagues}} {{had been looking for}} a way out of their difficulty, by which they could save themselves, satisfy public clamor and yet avoid {{responsibility}} before history. Bazaine stated in his defence [...] "I have graven on my chest two words - Honneur et Patrie. They have guided me for the whole of my military career. I have never failed that noble motto, no more at Metz than anywhere else during the forty-two years that I have loyally served France. I swear it here, before Christ". Despite a vigorous defence of Bazaine's actions by Lachaud, and the presentation of a number of strong witness statements from his staff including Colonel Willette, the court found Bazaine guilty of negotiating with and capitulating to the enemy before doing all that was prescribed by duty and honour. It was clear even to the most partial observer, that the verdict bore very little relation to the evidence. For example, the Marshal surrendered only after receiving letters recommending him to do so from his generals, but the presentation of these at the trial was ignored. [...] "I have read every word of the evidence [...] and believe it to be the most malicious casuistry" [...] (New York Times correspondent). A letter which Prince Frederick Charles wrote in Bazaine's favour only added to the wrath of the people, who cried aloud for his execution. The court sentenced Bazaine to 'degradation and death', and to pay the costs of the enormous trial (300,000 francs), which was to leave the Marshal's young family penniless. [...] Bazaine's reaction on being read the sentence of the court was [...] "It is my life you want, take it at once, let me be shot immediately, but preserve my family". Since the Revolution, only two French Marshals have been condemned to death — Ney, by a Bourbon, and Bazaine, by an Orléans. But, as though the judges themselves <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of conscience at the sentence, they immediately and unanimously signed a petition for 'Executive Clemency' to the President of the Third Republic, Marshal MacMahon, although Bazaine refused to sign this petition himself.|$|E
60|$|Philip <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> {{of horror}} in his heart. Sweat broke {{out on his}} forehead.|$|E
6000|$|Really, I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>twinge</b> of {{pity for}} the Italian. He was {{caught between the}} mill-stones, [...] "Bombini, stick that Jew," [...] Bert Rhine commanded.|$|R
60|$|I saw a quick, {{surprised}} {{start in}} Dirck; but I <b>felt</b> such <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> myself, {{that there was}} little opportunity to inquires into the state of my friend's feelings, at this coarse, but unexpected remark.|$|R
60|$|Maraton <b>felt</b> {{suddenly}} <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> {{of something}} I which was almost compunction. Mr. Foley's face {{was white and}} tired. He had {{the air of a}} man oppressed with anxieties which he was doing his best to conceal.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{hope you}} may never have it. ’Tis an infernal disease,” says my lord, “and its twinges are diabolical. Ah!” {{and he made a}} dreadful wry face, as if he just <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{know how}} they feel, I sympathize with the strikers, I want them to win--against you!" [...] She lifted her head and looked at him, {{and in spite of}} the state of his {{feelings}} he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of admiration at her defiance.|$|E
60|$|Marriages between young English {{officers}} and our pretty, delicate York belles, were of frequent occurrence, and I had <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> or two, {{on the subject}} of Anneke, that morning, as I passed the youths of the 55th, 60th, or Loyal Americans, 17th, and other regiments that were then in the province.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Garth <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> severe <b>twinge</b> at this {{mention of}} her husband, {{the fear that}} Caleb might think her in the wrong not being easily endurable. She answered, wanting to check {{unintended}} consequences-- ...|$|R
60|$|Possibly, the vexation {{might have}} been {{something}} different, {{were it not for}} the brisk confidence inspired by the breeze. But even as it was, he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>twinge,</b> from <b>a</b> sudden indefinite association in his mind of Babo with Atufal.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Etherington <b>felt,</b> perhaps, <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of conscience; for he said, {{something}} hastily, [...] "Pray go on, good woman, if {{you really}} have any thing to communicate {{to me as a}} magistrate--it is time your condition was somewhat mended, and I will cause you to be cared for directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he swung}} up the condemned, {{and made the}} rope fast; stood by and timed him half an hour with his watch, and then {{delivered}} the body to the court. A little after, as he stood contemplating the motionless figure, a doubt came into his face; evidently he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of conscience--a misgiving--and {{he said with a}} sigh: ...|$|E
60|$|Shovel even {{insisted on}} {{returning}} him his cap, {{and for some}} queer reason, this cut deepest. Tommy about to charge, with his head down, now walked away so quietly that Shovel, who could not help liking the funny little cuss, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of remorse, and nearly followed him with a magnanimous offer: to treat {{him as if he}} were still respectable.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{devote the}} whole of my plot to the largest crop of {{patience}} I can get, for that is what I need most," [...] said Mrs. Jo, so soberly that the lads fell to thinking in good earnest what they should say when their turns came, and some among them <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of remorse, that they had helped to use up Mother Bhaer's stock of patience so fast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't a doubt {{but what}} you're as {{innocent}} as I am." [...] Mr. Toogood, {{as he said}} this, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>twinge</b> of conscience. He did believe Mr. Crawley to be innocent, {{but he was not}} so sure of it as his words would seem to imply. Nevertheless he repeated the words again;--"as innocent as I am." ...|$|R
60|$|When Sim Burns woke {{the next}} morning he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharper <b>twinge</b> of remorse. It was not a broad or {{well-defined}} feeling--just a sense that he had been unduly irritable, not that on the whole he was not in the right. Little Pet lay with the warm June sunshine filling his baby eyes, curiously content in striking at flies that buzzed around his little mouth.|$|R
60|$|Old Silas Croft was {{to drive}} her with Bessie, who wished to do some {{shopping}} in Wakkerstroom, as ladies sometimes will; {{but at the last}} moment the old man <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> premonitory <b>twinge</b> of the rheumatism to which he was a martyr, and could not go. So, of course, John volunteered, and, though Jess raised some difficulties, Bessie furthered the idea, and in the end his offer was accepted.|$|R
60|$|It was the {{conclusion}} I arrived at {{in my own}} mind. But just why I had been chosen for the honour, especially at such a time, was a riddle. Jerry's invitations were charily given, and valued accordingly; and more than once, at our table, I had <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of envy when Conybear or someone else had remarked, with the proper nonchalance, in answer to a question, {{that they were going}} to Weathersfield. Such was the name of the Kyme place....|$|E
60|$|Sadly {{dismounting}} I led {{him back}} to the stable. It was evident that he would never again career with me across the hills. Bowed and dejected he resumed his place in the paddock. Standing thus, with hanging head, he appeared to be dreaming of the days when {{as a part of the}} round-up, in the far Northwest, he had carried his master over the range and through the herd with joyous zeal. Each time I looked at him I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of pain.|$|E
60|$|Frank <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of disappointment. Bannington's {{was still}} a good way off, {{and it seemed to}} him that the gale was {{increasing}} every moment. He scrambled forward with Harry, however, and when they loosened the rope the tall peak of the sail swung down. Soon after they had done this Mr. Oliver put down his helm, causing the mainboom to jerk and thrash to and fro furiously, while as the boat came up head to wind a white sea struck her side and foamed on board her.|$|E
60|$|The Dyak boy {{was beating}} up an egg in brandy. Woodhouse took this and sat up. He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>twinge</b> of pain. His ankle was tied up, so were {{his arm and}} {{the side of his}} face. The smashed glass, red-stained, lay about the floor, the {{telescope}} seat was overturned, and by the opposite wall was a dark pool. The door was open, and he saw the grey summit of the mountain against a brilliant background of blue sky.|$|R
60|$|Her room gave on {{one side}} of the sitting room, and her father's on the other. She waited until Colonel Harris went away, having helped him on with his overcoat. After he left she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>twinge</b> of remorse. The night was cold and raw and he really had not wanted to go out. He would have been quite willing to sit in front of the fire, smoking and reading. He had only gone because his own innate kindliness and tact had {{suggested}} to him that Louisa wished to remain alone.|$|R
60|$|He <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> {{momentary}} <b>twinge</b> of selfishness. Yet, after all, {{the great}} truths were incontrovertible. He could lighten her lot but little. There {{was very little}} of himself that he could give her--of his youth, his strength, his vigorous hold upon life. Through all the tangle of his expanding interests in existence, the medley of strange happenings in which he found himself involved, one thing alone was clear. He was passing on into a life making larger demands upon, him, a life in which their companionship must naturally become a slighter thing. Nevertheless, he spoke to her reassuringly.|$|R
60|$|As Norman of Torn rode {{back to his}} grim {{castle in}} the hills of Derby, he had much food for thought upon the way. Never till now had he {{realized}} what might lie in another manner of life, and he <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of bitterness toward the hard, old man whom he called father, and whose teachings from the boy's earliest childhood had guided him in the ways that had cut him off completely from the society of other men, except the wild horde of outlaws, ruffians and adventurers that rode beneath the grisly banner of the young chief of Torn.|$|E
60|$|Somerset, as they proceeded, {{pointed out}} where roofs {{had been and}} should be again, where gables had been pulled down, and where floors had vanished, showing her how to {{reconstruct}} their details from marks in the walls, much as a comparative anatomist reconstructs an antediluvian from fragmentary bones and teeth. She appeared to be interested, listened attentively, but said little in reply. They were ultimately in a long narrow passage, indifferently lighted, when Somerset, treading on a loose stone, <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of weakness in one knee, and knew in a moment {{that it was the}} result of the twist given by his yesterday's fall. He paused, leaning against the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am trying}} my best," [...] said the cosmopolitan, still calmly companionable. [...] "A moment since, we talked of Pizarro, gold, and Peru; no doubt, now, you {{remember}} that when the Spaniard first entered Atahalpa's treasure-chamber, and saw such profusion of plate stacked up, right and left, with the wantonness of old barrels in a brewer's yard, the needy fellow <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of misgiving, of want of confidence, as to the genuineness of an opulence so profuse. He went about rapping the shining vases with his knuckles. But it was all gold, pure gold, good gold, sterling gold, which how cheerfully would have been stamped such at Goldsmiths' Hall. And just so those needy minds, which, through their own insincerity, having no confidence in mankind, doubt lest the liberal geniality of this age be spurious. They are small Pizarros in their way--by the very princeliness of men's geniality stunned into distrust of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. They're not qualms--in the old sense." [...] She smiled {{down at me}} {{a little}} tearfully. [...] "Hugh, do you {{remember}} when we used to go to Sunday-school at Dr. Pound's church, and Mrs. Ewan taught us? I really believed something then--that Moses brought down the ten commandments of God from the mountain, all written out definitely for ever and ever. And I used to think of marriage" [...] (I <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sharp <b>twinge),</b> [...] "of marriage as something sacred and inviolable,--something ordained by God himself. It ought to be so--oughtn't it? That is the ideal." ...|$|R
6000|$|Eustacia bounded {{into the}} vehicle {{and sat on the}} stool, ensconced from view on the side towards the trackway. Soon she heard the {{brushing}} of other feet than the reddleman's, a not very friendly [...] "Good day" [...] uttered by two men in passing each other, and then the dwindling of the footfall of one of them in a direction onwards. Eustacia stretched her neck forward till she caught a glimpse of a receding back and shoulders; and she <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> wretched <b>twinge</b> of misery, she knew not why. It was the sickening feeling which, if the changed heart has any generosity at all in its composition, accompanies the sudden sight of a once-loved one who is beloved no more.|$|R
6000|$|Dry and taciturn as the Captain was on all {{ordinary}} occasions, he proved, on the present, eloquent {{and almost}} pathetic; for the tears {{came into his}} eyes when he recounted the various quarrels which had become addled, notwithstanding his best endeavours to hatch them into an honourable meeting; and here was one, at length, just chipping the shell, like to be smothered, for want of the most ordinary concession {{on the part of}} Winterblossom. In short, that gentleman could not hold out any longer. [...] "It was," [...] he said, [...] "a very foolish business, he thought; but to oblige Sir Bingo and Captain MacTurk, he had no objection to walk with them about noon as far as the Buck-stane, although he must observe the day was hazy, and he had <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> prophetic <b>twinge</b> or two, which looked like a visit of his old acquaintance podagra." ...|$|R
60|$|Hereupon {{a glorious}} shouting, a rapping, a jingling, a clattering, and a shouting, with {{plentiful}} da capo, pleasanter than {{a strain of}} sublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first time. Arthur had <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of conscience during Mr. Poyser's speech, {{but it was too}} feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being praised. Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole? If there was something in his conduct that Poyser wouldn't have liked if he had known it, why, no man's conduct will bear too close an inspection; and Poyser was not likely to know it; and, after all, what had he done? Gone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but another man in his place would have acted much worse; and no harm would come--no harm should come, for the next time he was alone with Hetty, he would explain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had passed. It was necessary to Arthur, you perceive, to be satisfied with himself. Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions for the future, which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be uncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr. Poyser's slow speech was finished, and {{when it was time for}} him to speak he was quite light-hearted.|$|E
60|$|And about ourselves? My good people, do you {{by chance}} know any {{man or woman}} who has formed unjust {{conclusions}} regarding his neighbor? Have you ever found yourself willing, nay, eager to believe evil of some man whom you hate? Whom you hate because he is successful, and you are not: because he is rich, and you are poor: because he dines with great men who don't invite you: because he wears a silk gown, and yours is still stuff: {{because he has been}} called in to perform the operation though you lived close by: because his pictures have been bought and yours returned home unsold: because he fills his church, and you are preaching to empty pews? If your rival prospers have you ever <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of anger? If his wife's carriage passes you and Mrs. Tomkins, who are in a cab, don't you feel that those people are giving themselves absurd airs of importance? If he lives with great people, are you not sure he is a sneak? And if you ever felt envy towards another, and if your heart has ever been black towards your brother, if you have been peevish at his success, pleased to hear his merit depreciated, and eager to believe all that is said in his disfavor--my good sir, as you yourself contritely own that you are unjust, jealous, uncharitable, so, you may be sure, some men are uncharitable, jealous, and unjust regarding YOU.|$|E
5000|$|On November 10, 2010, {{an aging}} fan <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> <b>twinge</b> of sadness {{when he noticed}} that Winnipeg had lost one of its long-standing links to band—the [...] "Permanent Wave" [...] sign at 1174 Pembina Highway, which graced {{the cover of the}} [...] "Outie" [...] {{cassette}} (1994), had been taken down.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the views}} of scholars, {{especially}} Muhammad Khawja Bukhari in his book Fasl-ul-Khetab, Hamidah the daughter of Muhammad al-Jawad, the ninth Shia Imam, and the aunt of Hasan al-Askari, used to pray a lot to witness the son of Hasan al-Askari. On the eve of 14 Sha'ban in 255 AH she met Hasan al-Askari. When she decided to return, Hasan al-Askari asked her to stay with {{them in order to}} witness the birth of the child whom she wished so much to see. Hamidah narrates that when it was the dawn, Nargis <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>twinge</b> of pain. Hakima went to her. After a few moments, Narjis delivered the child. Hakima embraced the child and brought him to Hasan al-Askari. He took the child in his arms and he stroked his back and his eyes. Then he said aloud Adhan (call to prayer) in his right ear and Iqama (the second call to prayer) in his left ear.|$|R

I have not yet received the package you sent me but the mail situation here is kind of rough and I will just have to sweat it out. Well it is Xmas Eve here and it is a lot different than the one we would have at home. Over here the people are of a different religion than we are and do not celebrate Xmas. We have tried {{to make it look like}} Xmas here but with the hot weather and being away from home we just cannot get into the mood. I guess we will have to save it up until we get home. They are keeping us on the go all the time here and we are pretty busy. I have not met any of the fellows from Bryant since I have been over here but last year I met some of them in Africa. I guess we are scattered all over the globe and it sure will be a grand reunion when this mess is all cleaned up. We have the nips pretty well on the run in this theatre and we intend to keep them running right back to their Island. I sure <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little <b>twinge</b> of homesickness when I read of the first smokers and the dances that you are holding but I hope to be back there someday to make up for lost time. Well I guess this is all for now so I will close and write later C. Lindquist [Transcription ends...|$|R
