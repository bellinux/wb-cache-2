5|$|Another risk to rat owners is Rat-bite fever. This is a {{rare disease}} among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the {{intention}} of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat.|$|E

5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bright orange to yellow cap that in young specimens is covered with tufts of fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil.

The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E

The smallpox epidemic of 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-kyō, then to Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> appearance of several traits, which {{are found in}} all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of}} the skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E

5|$|The Kirtlandian is a North American land-vertebrate faunal {{age of the}} Cretaceous period, {{following}} the Judithian and succeeded by the Edmontonian. It lasted about 2 million years, ca 74.8 to 72.8 Mya and <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii, which lived throughout the Kirtlandian. It was first named by R.M. Sullivan and S.G. Lucas in 2003 as a faunal age for the Kirtland and Fruitland formations. Previously, only five land-vertebrate ages were identified from the Late Cretaceous. as identified by Loris S. Russell in 1975, they include the Paluxian, Aquilan, Judithian, Edmontonian, and the Lancian. Before the naming of the Kirtlandian, three gaps, between the Paluxian and Aquilan, the Aquilan and the Judithian, and the Judithian and Edmontonian, were identified but not named.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species of}} catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the restored churches seen today falls in the period between 1745 and 1770 and <b>is</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of locally available natural materials like wood, used in the carved columns, pulpits and sets of drawers. Artistic adornments were added even after the Jesuits’ expulsion in 1767, until around 1830. Some of the altars are covered in gold. Often {{the walls of the}} mission churches were made of adobe, the same material that had been used for the houses of the natives. In San Rafael de Velasco and San Miguel de Velasco, mica also was used on the walls, giving them an iridescent effect. The {{construction of}} the church in San José de Chiquitos is an exception: inspired by an unknown baroque model, it has a stone façade. The only other example where stone was used on a grand scale is in the construction of San Juan Bautista, although only the ruins of a tower remain.|$|E
