50|$|Throughout {{classical}} repertoire, {{there are}} notes that fall below {{the range of}} a standard double bass. Notes below low E appear regularly in the double bass parts found in later arrangements and interpretations of Baroque music. In the Classical era, the double bass typically doubled the cello part an octave below, occasionally <b>requiring</b> <b>descent</b> to C below the E of the four-string double bass. In the Romantic era and the 20th century, composers such as Wagner, Mahler, Busoni and Prokofiev also requested notes below the low E.|$|R

40|$|The American Medical Research Expedition to Everest had a {{wide variety}} of medical problems, ranging from leech bites to high-altitude {{pulmonary}} edema. Preventive measures, however, such as careful attention to ingesting only pure water and food at the lower elevations and adequate personal hydration, nutrition and rest at extremely high altitude minimized the morbidity suffered by the group. Prophylactic administration of doxycycline was effective in reducing the severity of diarrheal illness in the group. Every member of the expedition suffered upper respiratory tract infections and many other infections, some of which were resistant to all therapy until the patient moved down from high altitude. Despite careful acclimatization, several cases of acute mountain sickness occurred and <b>required</b> <b>descent</b> to a lower altitude for treatment. Frostbite was avoided entirely...|$|R
