50|$|Carbon black (subtypes are {{acetylene}} black, channel black, <b>furnace</b> <b>black,</b> {{lamp black}} and thermal black) is a material {{produced by the}} incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as FCC tar, coal tar, ethylene cracking tar, and a small amount from vegetable oil. Carbon black {{is a form of}} paracrystalline carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, albeit lower than that of activated carbon. It is dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and significantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) content. However, carbon black is widely used as a model compound for diesel soot for diesel oxidation experiments. Carbon black is mainly used as a reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products.

40|$|International audienceNearly 300 Millions {{of waste}} tires {{have to be}} managed in Europe. The main {{industrial}} ways to treat this kind of waste are incineration for energetic valorization and tires milling in chips or granulates for material valorization in construction industry. Steam water thermolysis (SWT) of tires, a hybrid of pyrolysis and solvolysis, is a good alternative to valorize waste tires. Recovered carbon black (rCB), which can be reintroduced in rubber industry as reinforcing filler (circular economy concept), is a more economical added value material than shredded tires. Physical and chemical characterizations on SWT-rCB were performed following ASTM analytical standards. A comparison between <b>furnace</b> carbon <b>black</b> (N 330) and rCB from pyrolysis (commercial products) was carried out. Oil Absorption Number (ASTM D 2414) and nitrogen adsorption (ASTM D 6556) measurements demonstrate that rCBs structure and specific surface area are comparable to a <b>furnace</b> carbon <b>black</b> N 330. According to data issued from ASTM standards, the behavior of rCBs reinforcement in rubbers is then expected to be equivalent to a N 330 carbon black.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to propose a {{detailed}} model {{for the formation of}} soot in turbulent reacting flow and to use this model to study a carbon black furnace. The model is based on a combination of a detailed reaction mechanism to calculate the gas phase chemistry, a detailed kinetic soot model based on the method of moments, and the joint composition probability density function (PDF) of these scalar quantities. Two problems, which arise when modeling the formation of soot in turbulent flows using a PDF approach, are studied. A consistency study of the combined scalar-soot moment approach reveals that the molecular diffusion term in the PDF-equation can be closed by the IEM and Curl-type mixing models. An investigation of different kernels for the collision frequency of soot particles shows that the influence of turbulence on particle coagulation is negligible for typical flame conditions and the particle size range considered. The model is used as a simple toot to simulate a <b>furnace</b> <b>black</b> process, which is the most important industrial process for the production of carbon blacks. Despite the simplifications in the modeling of the turbulent flow reasonable agreement between the calculated soot yield and data measured in an industrial <b>furnace</b> <b>black</b> reactor is achieved although no adjustments were made to the kinetic parameters of the soot model. The effect of the mixing intensity on soot yield and different soot formation rates is investigated. In addition the influence of different operating conditions such as temperature and equivalence ratio in the primary zone of the reactor is studied...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the carbothermal {{reduction}} of mechanical mixtures of TiO 2 and 2. 7 mol C (using a <b>furnace</b> <b>black</b> or graphite) {{was investigated in}} laboratory-scale experiments. Reaction in argon, Ar- 10 vol% N 2 and nitrogen atmospheres was performed in the temperature range 1300 - 1800 °C with an isothermal treatment time of 0. 5 h. The kinetics of the reaction was studied in an Ar- 10 vol% N 2 atmosphere at 1250 and 1350 °C with isothermal treatment times ranging from 0. 5 to 16 h. The solid reaction products obtained in these investigations were characterized by X-ray diffraction, chemical nonmetal analysis, SEM and physical adsorption. The results confirm {{the validity of the}} reaction mechanism consisting of two interconnected solid-gas reactions (oxide with CO and carbon with CO 2) and three reaction steps for the case of presence of nitrogen in the atmosphere at atmospheric pressure, leading to the formation of oxycarbonitrides and carbonitrides, with the oxide particles as th e precursors. Due to its instability in nitrogen-containing atmospheres, Ti 2 O 3 does not appear as an intermediate reaction product if nitrogen is present. Other factors leading to its appearance in noble gas atmospheres have not been determined, but a carbon deficiency in the starting mixture relative to a stoichiometric mixture for the formation of TiC can safely be excluded. Nitrogen is probably not incorporated into the oxide intermediate products however, this is difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Nitrogen is incorporated into the solid phase as cubic TiCxOyNz is formed, its content depending on its partial pressure. At the same time, an increase in nitrogen content above 10 % seems to have no effect on the oxygen content of the cubic phase. Despite their different structures, <b>furnace</b> <b>black</b> and graphite do not show clear differences with respect to their reaction kinetics. The composition and particle size of the oxycarbonitride obtained in identical reaction cond itions are nearly independent of the type of carbon used.
