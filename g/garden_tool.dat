5000|$|A 1986 {{study used}} a tape-{{recording}} of a three-pronged <b>garden</b> <b>tool</b> {{similar to a}} fork being [...] "" [...] across a chalkboard, which roughly reproduces the sound of fingernails on chalkboard. The recording was then manipulated, removing pitches at the extremities and the median. The results were then played back. It was determined that the median pitches are in fact {{the primary cause of}} the adverse reaction, not the highest pitches as previously thought. The authors hypothesized that it was due to predation early in human evolution; the sound bore some resemblances to the alarm call of macaque monkeys, or it may have been similar to the call of some predator. This research won one of the authors, Randolph Blake, an Ig Nobel Prize in 2006. [...] More recent research contradicts this hypothesis.|$|E
