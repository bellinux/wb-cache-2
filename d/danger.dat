5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea {{is to reduce the}} individual's domain of <b>danger.</b> A domain of <b>danger</b> is the area within the group in which the individual {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of <b>danger,</b> so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of <b>danger.</b> The seals with a greater domain of <b>danger</b> had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E

5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual {{stays on the}} lookout for <b>danger,</b> often standing on a termite mound to see farther. At times of <b>danger,</b> the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E

40|$|In a lapse {{of a few}} decades, deep {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in the treatment of <b>dangers</b> which may affect human communities. Whereas {{since the end of the}} XIXe century there was a continuous progression ofthe treatment of these <b>dangers</b> through their approach as risks, one notes today an erosion of these procedures which, on multiple plans (technical, scientitic, economical, political), made it possible toconsider certain forms of control. All seems indeed lo occur as if the work of domestication of collective <b>dangers</b> undertaken with the generalization of the concept of risk found its limits. The are several reasons explaining this situation. The nature even of <b>dangers</b> significantly changed, making more problematic their approach in the form of risks. But also, and in a bound way, the difficulty in containing new <b>dangers</b> within the framework of risk management led to exploration of other methods of treatment of <b>dangers,</b> in particular by new actors mobilizations around these questions which tend to become major topics in modern societies...|$|R
40|$|The paper explores parental {{perception}} of social <b>dangers</b> {{in the urban}} environment as a constraint for children to walk and cycle. Group discussions with 37 Swedish and 35 English parents of 7 to 12 year old children revealed that social <b>dangers</b> related to strangers, criminality and drugs concerned parents in both countries. These concerns also influenced travel mode choices for their children’s journeys. To protect their children from the perceived <b>dangers,</b> parents chose to chauffeur and accompany {{them as well as}} employ various strategies related to fear of crime. The level of protection was generally higher among the English than the Swedish parents. Further more, the {{perception of}} social <b>dangers</b> was discussed in relation to media, design of the physical environment and sense of community in the neighbourhood, as well as the child’s capability and preferences. It is concluded that traffic <b>dangers</b> and social <b>dangers</b> must be considered in parallel if we are to prevent new barriers against children’s pro-environmental travel modes when designing traffic safe routes...|$|R

5|$|In some cases, <b>danger</b> listing {{has sparked}} {{conservation}} efforts and prompted {{the release of}} funds, resulting in a positive development for sites such as the Galápagos Islands and Yellowstone National Park, {{both of which have}} subsequently been removed from the List of World Heritage in <b>Danger.</b> Despite this, the list itself and UNESCO's implementation of it have been the focus of criticism. In particular, States Parties and other stakeholders of World Heritage Sites have questioned the authority of the Committee to declare a site in <b>danger</b> without their consent. Until 1992, when UNESCO set a precedent by placing several sites on the <b>danger</b> list against their wishes, States Parties would have submitted a programme of corrective measures before a site could be listed. Instead of being used as intended, the List of World Heritage in <b>Danger</b> is perceived by some states as a black list and according to Christina Cameron, Professor at the School of Architecture, Canada Research Chair on Built Heritage, University of Montreal, has been used as political tool {{to get the attention of}} States Parties. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) notes that UNESCO has referenced the List of World Heritage in <b>Danger</b> (without actually listing the site) in a number of cases where the threat could be easily addressed by the State Party. The Union also argues that keeping a site listed as endangered over a long period is questionable and that other mechanisms for conservation should be sought in these cases.|$|E
