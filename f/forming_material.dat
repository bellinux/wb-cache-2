According to the school of which Mr. St. John was a disciple, the only use of the human passions is, that they produce situations for the historical painter; and nature, according to these votaries of the [Greek: to kalon], is only to be valued as affording hints for the more perfect conceptions of a Claude or a Salvator.|$|E

50|$|HVCs are {{important}} to the understanding of galactic evolution because they account for a large amount of baryonic matter in the galactic halo.

50|$|Roller cutting: Process {{whereby the}} vacuum formed product {{is placed on}} a custom made cutter and pushed through a roller cutter machine. An {{efficient}} way of cutting vacuum formed items from the original sheet of vacuum <b>forming</b> <b>material.</b> The cutter can also cut any necessary holes, such as cable or access holes, at the same time. Roller cutting is suitable for fairly large items, where precision alignment is not required. As the vacuum formings and the cutter are rolled sideways through the roller cutter machine, some misalignment can occur. Roller cutting can't be used for making holes or features in the sides of vacuum formings, as the cutter tool always cuts vertically from the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|To {{inquire into}} {{the origin and}} fate of a galaxy's halo gas is to inquire into the {{evolution}} of said galaxy. HVCs and IVCs are significant features of a spiral galaxy's structure. These clouds are of primary importance when considering a galaxy's Star formation rate (SFR). The Milky Way has approximately 5 billion solar masses of star <b>forming</b> <b>material</b> within its disk and a SFR of 1-3 [...] yr−1. Models for galactic chemical evolution find that {{at least half of}} this amount must be continuously accreted, low-metallicity material to describe the current, observable structure. Without this accretion, the SFRs indicate that the current star formation material will only last for another few gigayears (Gyr) at most.|$|E

40|$|The main accusative of {{the present}} work was to develop {{sustained}} release matrix tablets of Diclofenac sodium for maintaining therapeutic blood or tissue levels of the drug for {{extended period of time}} with minimized local or systemic adverse effects. In the present study, Polysaccharide mucilage derived from the seeds, Linum usitatissimum (family Linaceae) was investigated as sustained release matrix <b>forming</b> <b>material</b> in tablet formulations. Mucilage extracted from seeds was subjected to physicochemical characterization. Matrix tablets were prepared by wet granulation technique using isopropyl alcohol as a granulating agent in different drug: polymer ratios. Compressed tablets were evaluated for uniformity of weight, content of active ingredient, friability, hardness, thickness and in vitro dissolution using paddle method. All the formulations showed compliance with pharmacopoeial standards. Tablets prepared with Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC 50 cps) and Xanthan gum as matrix <b>forming</b> <b>material</b> for the comparative study.
