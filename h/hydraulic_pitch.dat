40|$|Pitch Control plays a {{significant}} role for a large wind turbine. This study investigates a novel robust <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> control system of a large wind turbine. The novel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> control system is driven by a novel high efficiency and high response hydraulic servo system. The pitch controller, designed by two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) motion control with feedback linearization, is developed to enhance the controllability and stability of the pitch control system. Furthermore, the full-scale testbed of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> control system of a large wind turbine is developed for practically experimental verification. Besides, the wind turbine simulation software FAST is used to analyze the motion of the blade which results are given to the testbed as the disturbance load command. The 2 -DOF pitch controller contains a feedforward controller with feedback linearization theory to overcome the nonlinearities of the system and a feedback controller to improve the system robustness for achieving the disturbance rejection. Consequently, the novel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> control system shows excellent path tracking performance in the experiments. Moreover, the robustness test with a simulated disturbance load generated by FAST is performed to validate the reliability of the proposed pitch control system...|$|E
40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of the working principles of the hydraulic variable pitch system of a wind turbine, a novel Petri net model and reliability evaluation method are proposed. First, Petri net theory is adopted to build a model for each discrete state of the operation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> system of the wind turbine {{and at the same time}} a fault Petri net model is established. Then through qualitative analysis and quantitative calculations based on the fault Petri net, the system reliability indexes are obtained. During the qualitative analysis process, in order to more conveniently find the minimal cut sets of the fault Petri net, a Visual C++ 6. 0 -based algorithm is compiled and the minimal cut sets are tested correctly with another method. During the quantitative calculation process, the fault probability has been obtained from the equations according to the fault probability of libraries and transitions between different states. Not only does the proposed Petri net describe the structure, function and operation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> system with a graphic language, but the fault Petri net model can also clearly express the logical relations among faults. The novel Petri net model offers simple calculations and the prospect of broad applicability and the new reliability evaluation method provides an important reference for the performance evaluation of these systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} nonlinear {{model for}} a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator under healthy and faulty situations is introduced in the FAST/AERODYN wind turbine simulator. Frequency response functions (FRF) are determined by using a random phase multi-sine excitation for different healthy and faulty operating conditions. The major changes observed in the FRF arise significantly above the actuator bandwidth. A linear model of the actuator thus appears to be sufficient to simulate the wind turbine in healthy conditions. However, {{when it comes to}} the study of fault diagnosis, it is advised to use a nonlinear model and to resort to active fault detection methods to probe the high frequency behaviour. Finally a user friendly graphical interface is presented for the wind turbine simulator. SCOPUS: cp. pSCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A fault {{diagnosis}} based on bond graph model is proposed for <b>hydraulic</b> variable <b>pitch</b> system. Because the knowledge representation of bond graph model can provide information {{of cause and}} effect between components, a bond graph model of <b>hydraulic</b> variable <b>pitch</b> system is given above rated wind speed. A fault tree, using cause and effect analysis by back propagation, is developed. Qualitative value of parameters is assigned and the fault source is detected by analyzing boundary parameters of fault tree. Comparing with quantitative {{fault diagnosis}} based on model, the bond graph fault diagnosis is more flexible and has good completeness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Recently, an {{increasing}} number of multi-MW (1 MW and up) wind generation systems are being developed and variable speed-variable pitch (VS-VP) control technology is usually adopted to improve the fast response speed and obtain the optimal energy, which means to obtain the maximum power at low wind speed and the rated power at high wind speed. However, the power generated by wind turbine changes rapidly for the continuous fluctuation of wind speed and direction, and wind energy conversion systems are of strong nonlinear characteristics for many uncertain factors and external disturbances. Based on modeling and analyzing of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and the <b>hydraulic</b> variable <b>pitch</b> mechanism (HVPM), this paper presents an adaptive fuzzy proportional integral derivative (AFPID) control strategy to capture optimal power. Simulation results show that the controller can improve the wind turbine performance than conventional PID controller...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{roughness}} is used {{in solar}} air heater absorber plate to break laminar boundary sub layer. It enhances rate of heat transfer from the absorber plate to the over flowing air stream. Various roughness geometries {{have been designed to}} study thermo hydraulic performance of black coated metallic (Al alloy) absorbers under standard testing condition. They are namely two pass sine wave corrugated absorber, hemispherical protruded and pin fin absorbers. The different geometrical parameters such as height of roughness element, long way and short way length, hydraulic diameter, etc. were studied by standardized procedures. Their effects on overall on performance of solar air heater have also been highlighted. It was observed that pin fin absorber gave best thermal performance following hemispherical protruded and sine wave absorber. Collector heat gain factor based on outlet temperature for different absorber reveals pin fin to be the best choice. Corrugated sine wave absorber gave best hydraulic performance following protruded and pin fin absorber. Variation of Reynolds number with Nusselt number, friction factor for different geometrical parameters such as <b>hydraulic</b> diameter, <b>pitch,</b> and roughness height has also been studied...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydraulic pitch-controlled {{system is}} one of the {{components}} of wind turbines which are frequently prone to faults. Early fault prediction of the pitch control system can improve the operation reliability effectively and reduce the unnecessary loss. Wind turbines suffer much environmental interference; moreover, data-based fault prediction is vulnerable to occur false alarms by the impact of these factors. And it is difficult to implement the fault isolation. So this paper presents a fault prediction method for the pitch-controlled system, which is based on the mathematical model of wind turbines physical properties. The residual root mean square (RMS) is used as residual evaluation function. In the end of the paper, by the simulation using the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> actuator fault as the example, the effectiveness of the proposed fault prediction scheme is verified...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the loads inﬂicted on large offshore wind turbines from sudden and persistent loss of electrical connection during severe operational conditions. The load case that is discussed is loss of electrical connection during an extreme operating gust. The sudden loss of generator torque {{leads to an}} increase in rotor speed and an emergency shutdown situation. The load cases are simulated using the time domain aeroelastic code fast, and compared to the maximum loads the turbine experiences during normal operational conditions. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pitch</b> system is modelled in detail, and the effects of changes in the pitch speed are investigated by varying the dimensions of valves and the accumulator. The grid fault {{does not seem to be}} dimensioning for structural loads on the tower or the blades, but it would likely be dimensioning for the blade tip deﬂection towards the tower in the case of a downwind turbine...|$|E
40|$|The Oscillatory Motion Support (OMS), {{used in the}} German-Dutch Wind Tunnels - Low Speed Wind Tunnel Braunschweig (DNW-NWB) for the {{measurements}} of damping derivatives has undergone substantial changes and improvements.

An active strut has been employed to suppress the wind tunnel model's natural oscillations. A new data acquisition system along with new data evaluation software is used.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} modelling and analysis of offshore wind turbine-driven hydraulic pumps. The concept consists of an open loop hydraulic system with the rotor main shaft directly coupled to a swash plate pump to supply pressurised sea water. A mathematical model is derived to cater for the steady state behaviour of entire system. A simplified model for the pump is implemented together with different control scheme options for regulating the rotor shaft power. A new control scheme is investigated, based on the combined use of <b>hydraulic</b> pressure and <b>pitch</b> control. Using a steady-state analysis, the study shows how the adoption of alternative control schemes in a the wind turbine-hydraulic pump system may result in higher energy yields than those from a conventional system with an electrical generator and standard pitch control for power regulation. This is in particular {{the case with the}} new control scheme investigated in this study that is based on the combined use of pressure and rotor blade pitch control. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Mixing {{suspensions}} is a {{very important}} <b>hydraulic</b> operation. The <b>pitched</b> six-blade turbine is a widely-used axial-flow impeller. This paper deals with effect relative impeller size and particle content on theefficiency of a pitched six-blade turbine at particle suspension. Two pitched six-blade turbines were used in model measurements of just suspension impeller speed. The ratios of the vessel to agitator diameter D/d were 3 and 4. 5. The measurements were carried out in a dish-bottomed vessel 300 mm in diameter. The just suspension impeller speeds were measured using an electrochemical method, and were checked visually. A 2. 5 % NaCl water solution was used as the liquid phase, and glass particles with four equivalent diameters between 0. 18 and 0. 89 mmand volumetric concentration from 2. 5 % to 40 % were usedasthesolid phase. The criterion values π s =P o √Fr' 3 (d/D) 7 were calculated from the particle suspension and power consumption measurements. The dependencies of π s on particle content c v show that larger agitators are more efficient for higher particle content...|$|R
40|$|On soccer grounds, {{grass cover}} is often reduced {{and the ground}} surface becomes uneven. Therefore, {{in order to assess}} the effects of climatic conditions, {{construction}} types and maintenance of the Italian soccer pitches, a detailed study was carried out. During 2000 - 2001, 61 soccer grounds were analysed, from continental to Mediterranean environments. First and second division Italian League grounds were about 30 %, 40 % were semi-professional and 30 % were public grounds. Several parameters such as overseeding, fertilization, aeration, weed control, mowing and irrigation were collected in winter {{and at the end of}} the playing season, in order to evaluate soil profiles, grass mixtures and composition, and maintenance practices. Only 20 % of the professional and semi-professional pitches had an all sand profile, while most of the remaining had a sand-soil mixture as topsoil. Drainage systems were commonly used, except from 13 % of the non-professional <b>pitches.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> conductivity was often reduced since in the all-sand profile it ranged from 118 (corner) to 30 (penalty area) mm h- 1, while on natural soil or sand-soil mictures, it ranged from 20 to 18 mm h- 1 respectively. Lolium perenne and Poa pratensis were the most widespread species in all seasons and environments. Ground cover was reduced in winter with the reduction being more dependent on shade rather than wear...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the pumping {{capacity}} of pitched blade impellers (two, three, four, five and six blade pitched blade impellers with pitch angles α = 35 ° and 45 °) coaxially located in a cylindrical pilot plant vessel with cylindrical draught tube provided with a standard dished bottom. The draught tube was equipped with four equally spaced radial baffles above the impeller pumping liquid upwards towards the liquid surface. In all investigated cases the liquid aspect ratio H/T = 1. 2 - 1. 5, the draught tube / vessel diameter ratios DT /T = 0. 2 and 0. 4 and the impeller / draught tube diameter ratio D/DT = 0. 875. The pumping capacity of the impeller was calculated from the radial profile of the axial component of the mean velocity in the draught tube below the impeller at such an axial distance from the impeller that the rotor does not affect the vorticity of the flow. The mean velocity was measured using a laser Doppler anemometer with forward scatter mode in a transparent draught tube and a transparent vessel of diameter T = 400 mm. Two series of experiments were performed, both of them under a turbulent regime of flow of the agitated liquid. First, the optimum height of the dished bottom was sought, and then the dependences of the dimensionless flow rate criterion and the impeller power number on the number of impeller blades were determined for both pitch angles tested under conditions of optimum ratio HT /DT. It follows from the results of the experiments that the optimum ratio HT /DT = 0. 25 when the cross sectional areas of the horizontal flow around the bottom and the vertical inflow to the draught tube are the same. For all the tested pitched blade impellers the impeller power number when α = 45 ° exceeds the value of this quantity when pitch angle α  =   35 °, while the flow rate number when α = 35 ° exceeds this quantity when α = 45 °. On the other hand, the absolute values of the impeller power number when the draught tube was introduced correspond fairly well to the dimensionless impeller power input measured in a system without a draught tube. However, the absolute values of the flow rate number found in the former system are significantly lower than the dimensionless impeller pumping capacity determined in the latter system. The <b>hydraulic</b> efficiency of <b>pitched</b> blade impellers N 3 Qp/Po for the investigated geometry of the agitated systems does not depend on the number of impeller blades, but it is significantly lower than the quantity determined in an agitated system with a dished bottom but without the draught tube. </p...|$|R
