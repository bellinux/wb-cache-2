5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>systems</b> were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E

Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>systems,</b> air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Fire {{disaster}} {{is a great}} threat to lives and property. Automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> provides real-time surveillance, monitoring and automatic alarm. It sends early <b>alarm</b> when the <b>fire</b> occurs and helps to reduce the fire damage. Wireless sensor network {{has become the most}} important technology in environmental monitoring and home or factory automation in recent years. In this paper, an automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. In order to provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors which periodically measure smoke concentration or temperature are deployed in buildings. Those scattered detectors report their monitoring information to the surveillance center via the self-organizing hierarchical wireless sensor networks. Test results from the prototype system show that the automatic <b>fire</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>system</b> achieves the design requirements.
