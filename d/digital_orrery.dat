50|$|Using the <b>Digital</b> <b>Orrery,</b> Sussman {{has worked}} with Jack Wisdom to {{discover}} numerical evidence for chaotic motions in the outer planets. The <b>Digital</b> <b>Orrery</b> is now retired at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Sussman was also the lead designer of the Supercomputer Toolkit, another multiprocessor computer optimized for evolving systems of ordinary differential equations. The Supercomputer Toolkit was used by Sussman and Wisdom to confirm and extend the discoveries made with the <b>Digital</b> <b>Orrery</b> to include the entire planetary system.|$|E
50|$|Another project {{involved}} {{constructing the}} <b>Digital</b> <b>Orrery</b> by Gerry Sussman and his MIT group in 1988. The group used a supercomputer {{to integrate the}} orbits of the outer planets over 845 million years (some 20 per cent {{of the age of}} the Solar System). In 1988, Sussman and Wisdom found data using the Orrery which revealed that Pluto's orbit shows signs of chaos, due in part to its peculiar resonance with Neptune.|$|E
50|$|Douglas is {{best known}} for the {{development}} of matrix models (the first nonperturbative formulations of string theory), for his work on Dirichlet branes and on noncommutative geometry in string theory, and {{for the development of the}} statistical approach to string phenomenology. He was on the team (led by Gerald J. Sussman) that built the <b>Digital</b> <b>Orrery,</b> a special-purpose computer for computations in celestial mechanics, and maintains an active interest in computer science. He is also very active in organizing schools and workshops, for example at Les Houches, Cargese, and the KITP Santa Barbara.|$|E
50|$|Sussman {{saw that}} {{artificial}} intelligence ideas {{can be applied}} to computer-aided design. Sussman developed, with his graduate students, sophisticated computer-aided design tools for VLSI. Steele made the first Scheme chips in 1978. These ideas and the AI-based CAD technology to support them were further developed in the Scheme chips of 1979 and 1981. The technique and experience developed were then used to design other special-purpose computers. Sussman was the principal designer of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Orrery,</b> a machine designed to do high-precision integrations for orbital mechanics experiments. The Orrery was designed and built by a few people in a few months, using AI-based simulation and compilation tools.|$|E
