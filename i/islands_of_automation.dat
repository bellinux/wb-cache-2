Though this is recognized, the state of the art in {{measurement and}} inspection of components is still recognized as a separate <b>island</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> with no formal overall integration of standards and specifications. Although the introduction of probing has enabled automated inspection processes to become commonplace, the solutions for the in-process gauging at CNC machine tools and the programming of coordinate measuring machines is still vendor specific. The introduction of new standards for data exchange, such as STEP, AP 219, and STEP-NC, has influenced the future direction of the inspection process. In light of current research in this field, a STEP compliant inspection framework for a component is presented. This framework aims to provide a capability to establish standardized measuring and inspection across the total CAx chain. It will facilitate the use of information downstream in the chain, such as an inspection workplan, workingsteps, and a mechanism to close the loop and feedback of inspection results to component model design. In order to achieve this integration STEP-NC (ISO 14649) along with AP 219 has been used in this research to provide the basis of a STEP-compliant inspection framework...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} future need for fault current limitation in the UK's power system, {{and some of}} the technical implications of this change. It is estimated that approximately 300 - 400 distribution substations will require fault current limitation, based on the statistical analysis of the projected fault level "headroom" (or violation). The analysis uses a UK electrical system scenario that satisfies the Government's target for an 80 % cut in CO 2 emissions by 2050. A case study involving the connection of distributed generation (DG) via a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is used to illustrate the potential protection and control issues. In particular, DG fault ride-through, autoreclosure schemes, and transformer inrush current can be problematic for SFCLs that require a recovery period. The potential solutions to these issues are discussed, such as the use <b>of</b> <b>islanding</b> or <b>automation</b> to reduce the fault level...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} theoretical, empirical, {{and analytical}} studies pertaining to human use, misuse, disuse, and abuse <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> technology. Use {{refers to the}} voluntary activation or disengagement <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> use difficult. Misuse refers to overreliance on automation, which can result in failures of moni-toring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization <b>of</b> <b>automation,</b> is com-monly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the <b>automation</b> <b>of</b> functions by design-ers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products <b>of</b> the au-tomation. <b>Automation</b> abuse can also promote misuse and disuse <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> by human operators.

40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing international competitiveness, many manufacturing businesses are rethinking their management strategies and philosophies towards achieving a computer integrated environment. The explosive growth in Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMI) {{has resulted in the}} formation of functional "Islands of Automation" such as Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) and Manufacturing Resources Planning (MRPII). This has resulted in an environment which has focussed areas of excellence and poor overall efficiency, co-ordination and control. The main role of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) is to integrate these <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> and develop a totally integrated and controlled environment. However, the various perceptions of CIM, although developing, remain focussed on a very narrow integration scope and have consequently resulted in mere linked <b>islands</b> <b>of</b> <b>automation</b> with little improvement in overall co-ordination and control. This thesis, that is the research described within, develops and examines a more holistic view of CIM, which is based on the integration of various business elements. One particular business element, namely control, has been shown to have a multi-facetted and underpinning relationship with the CIM philosophy. This relationship impacts various CIM system design aspects including the CIM business analysis and modelling technique, the specification of systems integration requirements, the CIM system architectural form and the degree of business redesign. The research findings show that fundamental changes to CIM system design are required; these are incorporated in a generic CIM design methodology. The affect and influence of this holistic view of CIM on a manufacturing business has been evaluated through various industrial case study applications. Based on the evidence obtained, it has been concluded that this holistic, control based approach to CIM can provide a greatly improved means of achieving a totally integrated and controlled business environment. This generic CIM methodology will therefore make a significant contribution to the planning, modelling, design and development of future CIM systems...|$|E
