25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The <b>degradation</b> <b>rate</b> {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity. There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2cm. Furthermore, nerve regeneration with these conduits has yet to reach the level of functional recovery seen with nerve autografts.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{growth rates}} of chicks can be varied by dietary manipulations. The rates of {{synthesis}} of protein in selected muscles can be measured by using radioactive amino acids. Mea-surements are made of expired air, plasma, and muscle tissues. Synthesis rates are most rapid in the young chick and turkey. As the bird ages, synthesis <b>rates</b> and <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> decrease; but tfiese two parameters gradually come together so that the net gain in protein is zero. Synthesis rates remain fairly similar in chicks fed a complete diet or a diet lacking in lysine. This is true even if the growth rate is extremely low. However, the <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> are extremely high in the deficient birds so mat the gain in protein deposition is very low. When the energy is restricted, growth is reduced dramatically, but synthesis rates are reduced only a small amount. Again, <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> are extremely high. Chickens with muscular dystrophy exhibit very high synthesis rates in breast muscle. The leg muscle changes compare with a normal bird. There are also high <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> in the breast muscle throughout so that {{the growth rate of}} the muscle was only greater during the early stages of growth. Additional work needs to be conducted to develop a reliable accurate chemical method for determining the <b>degradation</b> <b>rates.</b> It is apparent that the emphasis in research to increase the rapidity of growth should center on the <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> rather than on increasing synthesis rates.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{understand}} how Arabidopsis thaliana plants control starch degradation at night. Starch is the major energy reserve in Arabidopsis. It is broken down at night to maintain growth and metabolism of the plant, when photosynthesis is not possible. The <b>rate</b> of starch <b>degradation</b> follows a linear pattern and is matched {{to the length of}} the night period such that almost all starch is exhausted by dawn. The mechanisms and the proteins involved in controlling starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> are largely unknown. With my work I wanted to identify components involved in the control of starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates.</b> Using a forward genetic screen, I discovered several mutants with new starch degradation phenotypes. One of them was affected in the circadian clock component EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF 3). It degraded its starch slower than wildtype plants and in a non-linear way. Two mutants degraded their starch at a much faster rate than wild-type plants and exhausted their reserves before dawn. One of them lacks a novel protein, which was named EXCESS STARCH TURNOVER 1 (EST 1). This protein is required for normal starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates,</b> but its function is still unknown. The second mutant is affected in BETA-AMYLASE 1 (BAM 1) and produces aberrant BAM 1 protein containing a serine to asparagine amino acid substitution in position 132. Faster starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> in this mutant depend on the presence of another protein of the pathway, LIKE SEX FOUR 1 (LSF 1). The data indicate that modulation of BAM 1 activity can strongly affect the <b>rates</b> of starch <b>degradation,</b> although starch is degraded normally in absence of BAM 1. In a second approach, I analysed which known components of the starch degradation pathway are necessary for the adjustment of starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates.</b> I found that PHOSPHOGLUCAN WATER DIKINASE (PWD) and BAM 3 might play a role in adjusting starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> in response to an unexpectedly early night. In summary, in this thesis I introduce a novel protein necessary for normal starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> in Arabidopsis leaves and provide insights into proteins and mechanisms which might control starch <b>degradation</b> <b>rates</b> in response to an early night...|$|R
