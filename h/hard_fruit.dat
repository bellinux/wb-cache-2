Because they eat fruit, some megabat species are unpopular with orchard owners. Megabats are frugivorous or nectarivorous, i.e., they eat fruits or lick nectar from flowers. Often, the fruits are crushed and only the juices are consumed. The teeth are adapted to bite through <b>hard</b> <b>fruit</b> rinds.|$|E

6000|$|... "Prince Ennui" [...] {{conducted}} me with shining lantern into a dense orchard thickly under-grown, marvellously green, with a small, <b>hard</b> <b>fruit</b> {{upon its}} branches, {{shaped like a}} medlar, of a crisp, sweet odour and, despite its hardness, a delicious taste. The interwoven twigs of the stooping trees were thickly nested; a veritable wilderness of moonlike and starry flowers ran all to seed amid the nettles and nightshade of this green silence. And while I ate--for I was hungry enough--Prince Ennui stood, his hand on Sallow's muzzle, lightly thridding the dusky labyrinths of the orchard with his faint green eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{species of}} bamboo, the [...] "Payong" [...] and [...] "Praong" [...] of the Lepchas, here replace the Pao {{of the lower}} regions. The former was {{flowering}} abundantly, {{the whole of the}} culms (which were 20 feet high) being a diffuse panicle of inflorescence. The [...] "Praong" [...] bears a round head of flowers at the ends of the leafy branches. Wild strawberry, violet, geranium, etc., announced our approach to the temperate zone. Around the temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet, yam, brinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic leaves), and cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a summer crop, at 7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from the Dorjiling stock) cultivated as a winter crop in the plains, is superior both in size and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part of Sikkim, apparently from the want of sun; the tree grows well at from 3000 to 7000 feet elevation, and flowers abundantly; the fruit making the nearest approach to maturity (according to the elevation) from July to October. At Dorjiling it follows the English seasons, flowering in March and fruiting in September, when the scarce reddened and still <b>hard</b> <b>fruit</b> falls from the tree. In the plains of India, both this and the plum ripen in May, but the fruits are very acid.|$|E
60|$|Tarzan's retreat was no {{indication}} that he felt fear. Jungle life is ordered along different lines than ours and different standards prevail. Had Tarzan been famished he would, doubtless, have stood his ground and met the lion's charge. He had done the thing before upon more than one occasion, {{just as in the}} past he had charged lions himself; but tonight he was far from famished and in the hind quarter he had carried off with him was more raw flesh than he could eat; yet it was with no equanimity that he looked down upon Numa rending the flesh of Tarzan's kill. The presumption of this strange Numa must be punished! And forthwith Tarzan set out to make life miserable for the big cat. Close by were many trees bearing large, hard fruits and to one of these the ape-man swung with the agility of a squirrel. Then commenced a bombardment which brought forth earthshaking roars from Numa. One after another as rapidly as he could gather and hurl them, Tarzan pelted the <b>hard</b> <b>fruit</b> down upon the lion. It was impossible for the tawny cat to eat under that hail of missiles--he could but roar and growl and dodge and eventually he was driven away entirely from the carcass of Bara, the deer. He went roaring and resentful; but in {{the very center of the}} clearing his voice was suddenly hushed and Tarzan saw the great head lower and flatten out, the body crouch and the long tail quiver, as the beast slunk cautiously toward the trees upon the opposite side.|$|E
5000|$|L. lufengensis had a {{diet that}} {{consisted}} of both <b>hard</b> and soft <b>fruits</b> based on the paleoenvironment. L. lefungensis had similarly developed molar shearing crests to other miocine hominids such as Proconsul nyanzae, Ouranopithecus macedoniensis, Dendropithecus macinnesis and a Yuanmou hominoid, indicating a possible preference for <b>harder</b> <b>fruits.</b> However, the Yuanmou hominoid differs from teeth of the genus Lufengpithecus in several aspects of the evidence studied such as tooth size proportions, M2 shearing crest development, tooth enamel thickness and body weight [...]When compared to hominoid species of similar regions such as a Yuanmou hominid, L. lufengensis has smaller front teeth indicating at least a partly more folivorous diet compared to other extinct hominoids. This means along with consuming some <b>hard</b> <b>fruits,</b> they would also consume berries and leaves.|$|R
40|$|Even {{primates}} considered dietary specialists tend to eat {{a combination}} of fruit pulp, seeds, other plant parts, or animals. Specialist seed predators could either feed on seeds preferentially, or to avoid competition when ripe pulps are scarce. Pitheciin monkeys have specialized dentition {{that allows them to}} feed on seeds protected by hard shells, and the upper limit on the hardness of these {{is likely to be a}} function of jaw size. We recorded the diet of Peruvian red uakaris (Cacajao calvus ucayalii) on the Yavari River, Peru, to test the prediction that this seed predator would feed on the seeds of hard-shelled fruits preferentially over softer ones in relation to their availability in the forest. We also tested predictions that adult male, adult female, and juvenile diets would differ, with larger individuals eating more <b>hard</b> <b>fruits.</b> Uakaris ate 55. 4 % seeds, 38. 9 % pulps and arils, and 5. 6 % other items, but proportions varied through the year. More pulps, especially from the palm Mauritia flexuosa, were eaten when fruit availability was low, and more <b>hard</b> <b>fruits</b> were positively selected for than softer ones. Juveniles did not open the <b>hardest</b> <b>fruit</b> species opened by adults, and adult males ate <b>harder</b> <b>fruits</b> than females. These results provide evidence that seed eating in some primates has evolved beyond a means of avoiding competition for the ripe pulps typically preferred by many primates. Specialist seeding-eating primates therefore occupy divergent niches that require separate consideration from those of similar-sized primates...|$|R
