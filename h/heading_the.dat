5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new president {{on the first night}} of the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} {{away in the}} third round, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Both teams scored rapidly, with three goals scored {{in the space of}} six minutes. The first {{as the result of a}} {{scramble}} which ended with Jimmy Brain <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> ball into the net for Arsenal. United quickly responded, equalising from a header by Harry Johnson. But Arsenal went ahead once more following a goal by Charlie Buchan. David Mercer equalised once more for Sheffield after 40 minutes, to keep the scores level going into half-time. Joe Hulme scored the final goal of the match, and the winner for Arsenal, in the 60th minute.|$|E
5|$|Chairman Kelvin Thomas {{stepped down}} during the 2012 close season, to be {{replaced}} by owner Ian Lenagan. The 2012–13 season was blighted by injuries and patchy form: after opening the season with three wins and briefly <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> table, United lost their next six games, a pattern of inconsistency that was to continue throughout the season. United finished outside the play-offs for the third consecutive season, but manager Chris Wilder was given a further one-year contract in April 2013. Some Oxford fans were unhappy about the decision to renew Wilder's contract, having pressed for his sacking {{during the second half of}} the 2012–13 season.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea {{travelled}} to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham Hotspur in {{the sixth}} round. The team finished the tie as comfortable 4–0 winners, never looking as though they would crumble once William Gallas scored inside 12 minutes. The one negative from their performance was the dismissal of Graeme Le Saux for a second bookable offence in the second half. Local rivals Fulham were Chelsea's semi-final opponents. A scrappy match, which saw Fulham dominate much of the play but creating little, was settled in Chelsea's favour. Terry scored just before half time, <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> ball through the legs of Louis Saha standing in Fulham's goal.|$|E

In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration.

5|$|In summer 727, another {{large-scale}} invasion {{was led by}} Mu'awiya, with Abdallah al-Battal <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> {{vanguard of}} the army. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor claims that the vanguard alone numbered 15,000 men and the entire invasion force 100,000, clearly a grossly inflated number. Theophanes also records a certain Amr as Mu'awiya's second-in-command, but Arab sources are unambiguous in this regard. The Arab army moved west into northwestern Asia Minor, and the vanguard under al-Battal attacked and sacked the town of Gangra in Paphlagonia and a place called in Arab sources Tabya, possibly the fort of Ateous in Phrygia. Gangra was razed to the ground, but during the attack on Tabya the Arabs, especially the Antiochene contingent, {{are said to have}} suffered heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was {{optimism}} surrounding the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross from Paul Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, before making a cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of Courtois's net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, <b>heading</b> <b>the</b> ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over.
