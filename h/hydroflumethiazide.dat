40|$|ABSTRACT: Two multisample {{laboratory}} powder diffractometers {{have been}} evaluated {{for the purpose of}} pattern indexing in the context of physical form screening. Both diffractometers utilise foil transmission geometry, primary monochromated radiation, and a position-sensitive detector. Data collected from six compounds (sotalol hydro-chloride, <b>hydroflumethiazide,</b> verapamil hydrochloride, captopril, clomipramine hydro-chloride, and famotidine) showed good angular resolution (FWHM as small as ca. 0. 068) and lattice parameters were easily obtained using the indexing program DICVOL- 91. The extent of preferred orientation in each pattern was estimated using the DASH implementation of the March-Dollase function and is most evident with clomipramine hydrochloride and famotidine. Otherwise, the data compare favorably with reference capillary data sets. In conclusion,where there is a requirement to analyze 20 – 30 sample...|$|E

The extent of preferred orientation in each pattern was estimated using the DASH implementation of the March-Dollase function and is most evident with clomipramine hydrochloride and famotidine. Otherwise, the data compare favorably with reference capillary data sets. In conclusion, where there is a requirement to analyze 20 - 30 samples per day, with an emphasis on obtaining the high-quality data that are important in pattern recognition and imperative in indexing, the combination of foil transmission geometry, primary monochromated radiation, plus a position-sensitive detector is highly effective. The data also afford opportunities for crystal structure determination...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 8528 The {{studies in}} this thesis {{explored}} the solid state and inhalation properties of various systems produced by the spray drying technique. The work focused on the feasibility analysis of spray drying {{as a means of}} producing materials for pulmonary delivery. The chemical and physical stability of different processed systems have also been addressed. The drugs investigated were salbutamol base, formoterol fumarate dihydrate, budesonide, bendroflumethiazide, <b>hydroflumethiazide</b> and hydrochlorothiazide. In all cases the physicochemical characteristics were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The inhalation properties were investigated using the twin stage impinger. Different aspects of chemical and physical stability studies were examined. Spray drying of salbutamol base alone resulted in predominantly amorphous powdered products and the degree of amorphicity depended on the spray drying conditions. Difficulties in processing were observed with the drug exhibiting stickiness due to its low glass transition temperature. Co-spray drying of salbutamol base with sugars and PVP resulted in composite particles that demonstrated a lesser degree of particle fusion...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure {{was developed for}} the fast screening of 16 diuretics (acetazolamide, althiazide, amiloride, bendroflumethiazide, bumetanide, canrenoic acid, chlorthalidone, chlorthiazide, clopamide, ethacrynic acid, furosemide, hydrochlorthiazide, <b>hydroflumethiazide,</b> indapamide, triamterene, trichlormethiazide) and a masking agent (probenecid) in human urine. The whole method involves three analytical steps, including (1) liquid/liquid extraction of the analytes from the matrix, (2) their reaction with methyl iodide at 70 ◦C for 2 h to form methyl derivatives, (3) analysis of the resulting mixture by fast gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (fast GC/EI-MS). The analytical method was validated by determining selectivity, linearity, accuracy, intra and inter assay precision, extraction efficiencies and {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/N) at the lowest calibration level (LCL) for all candidate analytes. The analytical performances of three extraction procedures and five combination of derivatization parameters were compared in order to probe the conditions for speeding up the sample preparation step. Limits of detection (LOD) were evaluated in both EI-MS and ECNI-MS (electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry) modes, indicating better sensitivity for most of the analytes using the latter ionization technique. The use of short columns and high carrier gas velocity in fast GC/MS produced efficient separation of the analytes in less than 4 min, resulting in a drastic reduction of the analysis time, while a resolution comparable to that obtained from classic GC conditions is maintained. Fast quadrupole MS electronics allows high scan rates and effective data acquisition both in scan and selected ion monitoring mode...|$|E
