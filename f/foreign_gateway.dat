40|$|Ports are the <b>foreign</b> <b>gateway</b> for {{countries}} and regions, {{and it is}} playing an increasingly {{important role in the}} world economy. While embracing the economic benefits brought by port development, Chinese ports are also faced with an unprecedented number of environmental problems. The overall goal of this thesis is to explore the similarities and differences between Canadian and Chinese ports in terms of their environmental protection policies, environmental management, and environmental protection measures. The thesis also aims to sum up valuable environmental protection experiences from both countries, in an effort to provide a reference guide for environmental protection activities in China. In this paper, many research methods have been used, including a review of the literature, site inspection, expert advice and case analysis in order to explore the similarities and differences in policies, concepts and measurements of port environmental protection in Canada and China. This information will be used to define the advanced concepts, managerial methods and measurements of environmental protection in Canada that Chinese government departments and port authorities could learn from. Through this study, suggestions will be made regarding what China's port sectors can learn from Canada in the following areas: (1) connecting port authorities with relevant environmental protection experts to carry out environmental protection research; (2) expanding the scope of port environmental protection, paying attention to co-operation with other agencies to protect the environment; (3) enhancing the protection of the ecological environment of the port， (4) paying attention to public participation in the process of port environmental protection; and (5) upgrading the environmental protection management concept on the part of port managers. It will be suggested that from Canada, relevant Chinese government departments should learn to (1) promulgate operational laws and regulations related to port environmental protection; (2) set up port management institutions to improve the port environmental management; (3) clarify the role of government departments, ports and environmental regulatory authorities {{in the course of the}} environmental protection; and (4) strengthen enforcement and regulations. In addition, it will be suggested that the enhancement of public awareness regarding environmental protection be continued and that relevant laws be passed to expand the scope of public participation...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) applications, such as Internet access and Infotainment, highlights {{the requirements for}} improving the underlying mobility management protocols for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Mobility management protocols in VANETs are envisioned to support mobile nodes (MNs), i. e., vehicles, with seamless communications, in which service continuity is guaranteed while vehicles are roaming through different RoadSide Units (RSUs) with heterogeneous wireless technologies. Due to its standardization and widely deployment, IP mobility (also called Mobile IP (MIP)) {{is the most popular}} mobility management protocol used for mobile networks including VANETs. In addition, because of the diversity of possible applications, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) issues many MIP's standardizations, such as MIPv 6 and NEMO for global mobility, and Proxy MIP (PMIPv 6) for localized mobility. However, many challenges have been posed for integrating IP mobility with VANETs, including the vehicle's high speeds, multi-hop communications, scalability, and ef ficiency. From a security perspective, we observe three main challenges: 1) each vehicle's anonymity and location privacy, 2) authenticating vehicles in multi-hop communications, and 3) physical-layer location privacy. In transmitting mobile IPv 6 binding update signaling messages, the mobile node's Home Address (HoA) and Care-of Address (CoA) are transmitted as plain-text, hence they can be revealed by other network entities and attackers. The mobile node's HoA and CoA represent its identity and its current location, respectively, therefore revealing an MN's HoA means breaking its anonymity while revealing an MN's CoA means breaking its location privacy. On one hand, some existing anonymity and location privacy schemes require intensive computations, which means they cannot be used in such time-restricted seamless communications. On the other hand, some schemes only achieve seamless communication through low anonymity and location privacy levels. Therefore, the trade-off between the network performance, on one side, and the MN's anonymity and location privacy, on the other side, makes preservation of privacy a challenging issue. In addition, for PMIPv 6 to provide IP mobility in an infrastructure-connected multi-hop VANET, an MN uses a relay node (RN) for communicating with its Mobile Access Gateway (MAG). Therefore, a mutual authentication between the MN and RN is required to thwart authentication attacks early in such scenarios. Furthermore, for a NEMO-based VANET infrastructure, which is used in public hotspots installed inside moving vehicles, protecting physical-layer location privacy is a prerequisite for achieving privacy in upper-layers such as the IP-layer. Due to the open nature of the wireless environment, a physical-layer attacker can easily localize users by employing signals transmitted from these users. In this dissertation, we address those security challenges by proposing three security schemes to be employed for different mobility management scenarios in VANETs, namely, the MIPv 6, PMIPv 6, and Network Mobility (NEMO) protocols. First, for MIPv 6 protocol and based on the onion routing and anonymizer, we propose an anonymous and location privacy-preserving scheme (ALPP) that involves two complementary sub-schemes: anonymous home binding update (AHBU) and anonymous return routability (ARR). In addition, anonymous mutual authentication and key establishment schemes have been proposed, to authenticate a mobile node to its <b>foreign</b> <b>gateway</b> and create a shared key between them. Unlike existing schemes, ALPP alleviates the tradeoff between the networking performance and the achieved privacy level. Combining onion routing and the anonymizer in the ALPP scheme increases the achieved location privacy level, in which no entity in the network except the mobile node itself can identify this node's location. Using the entropy model, we show that ALPP achieves a higher degree of anonymity than that achieved by the mix-based scheme. Compared to existing schemes, the AHBU and ARR sub-schemes achieve smaller computation overheads and thwart both internal and external adversaries. Simulation results demonstrate that our sub-schemes have low control-packets routing delays, and are suitable for seamless communications. Second, for the multi-hop authentication problem in PMIPv 6 -based VANET, we propose EM 3 A, a novel mutual authentication scheme that guarantees the authenticity of both MN and RN. EM 3 A thwarts authentication attacks, including Denial of service (DoS), collusion, impersonation, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. EM 3 A works in conjunction with a proposed scheme for key establishment based on symmetric polynomials, to generate a shared secret key between an MN and an RN. This scheme achieves lower revocation overhead than that achieved by existing symmetric polynomial-based schemes. For a PMIP domain with n points of attachment and a symmetric polynomial of degree t, our scheme achieves t x 2 ^n-secrecy, whereas the existing symmetric polynomial-based authentication schemes achieve only t-secrecy. Computation and communication overhead analysis as well as simulation results show that EM 3 A achieves low authentication delay and is suitable for seamless multi-hop IP communications. Furthermore, we present a case study of a multi-hop authentication PMIP (MA-PMIP) implemented in vehicular networks. EM 3 A represents the multi-hop authentication in MA-PMIP to mutually authenticate the roaming vehicle and its relay vehicle. Compared to other authentication schemes, we show that our MA-PMIP protocol with EM 3 A achieves 99. 6 % and 96. 8 % reductions in authentication delay and communication overhead, respectively. Finally, we consider the physical-layer location privacy attacks in the NEMO-based VANETs scenario, such as would be presented by a public hotspot installed inside a moving vehicle. We modify the obfuscation, i. e., concealment, and power variability ideas and propose a new physical-layer location privacy scheme, the fake point-cluster based scheme, to prevent attackers from localizing users inside NEMO-based VANET hotspots. Involving the fake point and cluster based sub-schemes, the proposed scheme can: 1) confuse the attackers by increasing the estimation errors of their Received Signal Strength (RSSs) measurements, and 2) prevent attackers' monitoring devices from detecting the user's transmitted signals. We show that our scheme not only achieves higher location privacy, but also increases the overall network performance. Employing correctness, accuracy, and certainty as three different metrics, we analytically measure the location privacy achieved by our proposed scheme. In addition, using extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the fake point-cluster based scheme can be practically implemented in high-speed VANETs' scenarios...|$|E

The key behind this idea is a threshold that is set to admit a new call in GFA, cooperating with a dynamic channel allocation algorithm in RFA. Explicit advantages of this scheme are not only reduced congestion in the hierarchical network structure, but also guaranteed Grade of Service (GoS) in terms of handoff call dropping probability.

40|$|Mobile IP {{has been}} defined by Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3 GPP 2) to be the {{mobility}} solution {{for the next generation}} cellular networks. The Mobile IP related issues therefore become important and popular. Mobile IP provides the Mobile Node (MN) the ability of roaming around a foreign domain. An MN needs to register with its Home Agent (HA) through the attached Foreign Agent (FA) when it roams to a foreign domain. If the frequency of MN handoffs is high and the foreign domain is too far from the home domain, the delay of the registration will be significant. The hierarchical foreign agent management is proposed to solve this problem. However, the <b>Gateway</b> <b>Foreign</b> Agent (GFA) will become a bottleneck when it serves too many MNs.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a proxy-based integrated cache consistency and mobility management scheme in Mobile IP systems. Our scheme {{is based on}} a stateful strategy by which cache invalidation messages are asynchronously sent by the server to a mobile host (MH) whenever data objects cached at the MH have been updated. We use a per-user proxy to buffer invalidation messages to allow the MH to disconnect arbitrarily and {{to reduce the number of}} uplink requests when the MH is reconnected. Moreover, the MH’s proxy serves as a <b>gateway</b> <b>foreign</b> agent (GFA) as in the MIP Regional Registration protocol to keep track of the address of the MH in a region. The proxy migrates with the MH when the MH crosses a regional area. We identify the optimal regional area size under which the overall network traffic cost, due to cache consistency management, mobility management, and query requests/replies, is minimized. We demonstrate that the integrated cache consistency and mobility management scheme outperforms both no-proxy and/or no-cache schemes in Mobile IPv 6 environments. ...|$|R

However, it still has some problems, such as triangle routing, handoff delay, insecurity, and foreign agent's heavy loading. Route Optimization has solved the triangle routing problem, and fast handoff has improved the situation of handoff delay and packet loss during handoff process. Even many proposals resolve some of these problems, Mobile IPv 4 not {{meet the requirements of}} seamless handoff (Session Continuity) in some situations such as the internet access of bus passengers. This article has considered all possible combination of Care-of Address types of MN and MG (Co-located Care-of Address and Foreign Agent Care-of Address), and proposed the structure called “Multilevel Mobile IPv 4 ” where the Foreign Agent (FA) of MN, called Mobile Gateway, moves together with MNs when many MNs moving together. As Mobile IPv 4 protocol remains unchanged and the legacy MN can also work under its condition, this structure can decrease the opportunities of MN directly registering a remote foreign agent, increase MN's security and reduce FA's loading. Meanwhile, MN could also select the best effort network regarding current condition to improve user's facility and to reach the best transmission quality. In the other hand, Route Optimization and Fast Handoff mechanics are also demonstrated in each case mentioned above to improve the performance of packet routing and handoff procedure. 摘要 i Abstract ii 目錄 iii 圖目錄 vi 表目錄 viii 第一章 緒論 1 第二章 相關技術 3 2. 1 背景知識 3 2. 1. 1 Mobile IPv 4 3 2. 1. 2 Route Optimization 9 2. 1. 3 Fast Handoff 12 2. 2 相關研究 13 2. 2. 1 Mobile IPv 6 13 2. 2. 2 NEMO 14 2. 2. 3 Micro Mobility及其他Mobility方案 16 2. 3 待解決的問題 17 第三章 系統架構 19 3. 1 MG與MN之CoA皆為FACoA 19 3. 1. 1 系統架構 19 3. 1. 2 註冊訊息 21 3. 1. 3 封包傳遞 22 3. 1. 4 Route Optimization及Fast Handoff 23 3. 2 MG與MN之CoA分別為CCoA及FACoA 26 3. 2. 1 系統架構 26 3. 2. 2 註冊訊息 27 3. 2. 3 封包傳遞 28 3. 2. 4 Route Optimization及Fast Handoff 29 3. 3 MG與MN之CoA分別為FACoA及CCoA 31 3. 3. 1 系統架構 31 3. 3. 2 註冊訊息 32 3. 3. 3 封包傳遞 33 3. 3. 4 Route Optimization及Fast Handoff 35 3. 4 MG與MN之CoA皆為CCoA 36 3. 4. 1 系統架構 36 3. 4. 2 註冊訊息 37 3. 4. 3 封包傳遞 38 3. 4. 4 Route Optimization及Fast Handoff 39 第四章 比較與分析 41 4. 1 各個雙層Mobile IPv 4 架構移動網路的比較 41 4. 2 使用雙層Mobile IPv 4 的效益 42 第五章 總結 44 參考文獻 4...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} and analyze a proxy-based hybrid cache {{management}} scheme for client–server applications in Mobile IP (MIP) networks. We leverage a per-user proxy as a gateway between the server and the mobile host (MH) such that any {{communication between the}} MH and server must pass through the proxy. The proxy has dual responsibilities in our design. It keeps track of the current location of the MH by acting as a regional <b>Gateway</b> <b>Foreign</b> Agent (GFA) as in the MIP Regional Registration protocol for mobility management. The proxy is also responsible for cache consistency management and query processing {{on behalf of the}} MH. To reduce the network traffic, a threshold-based hybrid cache consistency management policy is applied. That is, when a data object is updated at the server, the server sends an invalidation report to the MH through the proxy to invalidate the cached data object, provided that the size of the data object exceeds the given threshold. Otherwise, the server sends a fresh copy of the data object through the proxy to the MH. We identify the best “threshold ” value that would minimize the overall network traffic incurred due to mobility management, cache consistency management, and query processing, when given a set of parameter values characterizing the operational and workload conditions of the MIP network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Mobile IP {{is one of}} the {{solutions}} for connecting mobile nodes without breaking ongoing communications. Mobile IP uses two IP addresses: one is home address and another is care-of address which is used when the mobile node is moved to another network. Although original mobile IP can support seamless roaming, it still has many problems such as packet loss during handoff and handoff latency. Those problems usually effect on the performance of mobile IP. In mobile IP regional registration, a <b>Gateway</b> <b>Foreign</b> Agent (GFA) is added at just one hop away from foreign networks. Registration process within the same domain does not need to connect with the home agent and the GFA performs as local home agent for the mobile node. In Fast Optimized Smooth Handoff (FOSH), the foreign agents share information of mobile nodes by sending binding updates to each other. By sending registration request message to all entries in the Cache, the mobile node can perform an early registration. In our proposed method, FOSH mechanism is applied to mobile IP Regional Registration {{in order to reduce the}} number of packet loss that is lost at foreign agents during handoff. ëNetwork Simulator Version 2 í (NS 2) is used to implement the proposed method and output trace file is manipulated in order to evaluate the performance of mobile IP in terms of packet loss and packet delay.
