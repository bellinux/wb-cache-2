40|$|The {{effect of}} arachidonic acid (AA) cascade on bovine embryo {{development}} in a granulosa cell co-culture system was studied. Arachidonic acid (100 µM) was supplemented from 1 -cell to 8 - 16 cell block stage (first three days of co-culture) and from 1 -cell to hatching. Specific cyclooxygenase (indomethacin, 28 µM) and lipoxygenase (nordihydroguaiaretic acid - NDGA, 28 µM) inhibitors were used from 1 -cell to 8 - 16 cell block stage with AA. Embryo development was assessed by cleavage, day 7 -day 8 and <b>hatched</b> <b>embryo</b> rates and by measuring growth rates through development stages found in days 7 - 10 of culture (day 0 = insemination day). Embryo quality was scored at day 8. A 6. 5 - 10. 4 % increase on cleavage rate after AA supplementation was found. This AA supplementation from 1 -cell to hatching delayed embryo growth rate beyond day 7 and a reduction on hatching rate was detected. When AA supplementation was restricted to {{the first three days}} of co-culture those negative effects were overcome. Also, indomethacin and NDGA prevented the positive effect of AA and induced a significant reduction on cleavage, respectively. NDGA further decreased day 7 embryo rate and quality. Results suggest that AA has a two-phase action on bovine embryos, promoting early development and impairing embryo growth from day 7 onwards and hatching rates.

40|$|I {{examined}} the effects of offspring stage, brood size, and parental age on the patterns of brood defense in nesting male smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui), a centrarchid fish with male parental care, in Lake Opeongo, Ontario. Parental defense against conspecific models of equal length ((+OR-) 1 cm) was used as a measure of parental commitment to the brood. Based on Williams 2 ̆ 7 principle, or the trade-off between present and future reproduction, parental males should adjust their level of brood defense to reflect the value of current offspring relative to their expected future reproduction.;Parental defense increased as a model intruder approached the nest and as offspring progressed from egg to <b>hatched</b> <b>embryo</b> stages (wrigglers), and peaked prior to 2 ̆ 7 swim-up 2 ̆ 7 of fry from the nest. This pattern of brood defense over a nest cycle demonstrates the changing value of present offspring relative to the parent 2 ̆ 7 s expected future reproduction within a season.;In response to manipulating brood size, parental males increased their defense for augmented broods and decreased their defense for reduced broods, relative to a control. This demonstrates that parental males can adjust their level of brood defense to reflect future prospects of reproductive success.;Long-term data on population estimates and tagged nesting males in Lake Opeongo provided the necessary life history information to predict patterns of parental defense based on the reproductive value of males. Reproductive value at the age of first nesting for males in different age groups was partitioned into current reproduction (wrigglers in the nest) and to future reproduction (residual reproductive value). This index indicated that young nesting males (age 4, 5, and 6) should be more aggressive than older males (age 8 +). The prediction was not supported; older males were more aggressive than young males. This discrepancy can be interpreted as either reduced reproductive effort in young males or increased effort in older males because of possibly larger resource budgets. The life history of this population suggests that size-based energetic constraints are important in determining patterns of brood defense between different age classes...|$|E

40|$|The egg-release, mating, courting and {{aggressive}} acts for the spawning {{behaviour as well}} as the survival rates after spawning at stages of eyed embryos, viable hatchlings, and larvae to dry food consumption for the mating success were studied in cultured silver bream Blicca bjoerkna × rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus hybrids at their first sexual maturity. Experiments were conducted in experimental environments simulating natural reproductive conditions of the parental species. Spawning behaviour was analysed over 1 day from 8. 00 to 18. 00 hours using a remote-controlled video. Mating success was assessed from eggs and <b>hatched</b> <b>embryos</b> collected on the spawning ground. The results showed that these hybrids exhibited all the reproductive behaviours of the parental species with significantly more courtship than mating. Each egg-release act was accompanied by mating behaviour, involving all the experimental males. A surprising aggressive behaviour was observed in one male which attacked all other experimental fish. Successful mating resulted in the presence of fertilized eggs, the production of <b>hatched</b> <b>embryos</b> in experiments, and the survival of larvae at the dry food consumption stage. However, the low viable hatchling rate observed could indicate a very low chance of survival for these hybrids in rivers in which the occurrence of post-F 1 individuals may be more possible by backcrossing.

40|$|Synchronization and {{superovulation}} {{are commonly}} used to obtain large numbers of embryos for experimental and practical purposes. This study compared the number, quality, and in vitro development of embryos recovered from gilts following single or double estrus synchronization and superovulation. Prepubertal gilts from the single synchronization group were injected with 1500 I. U. PMSG and 1000 I. U. hCG 72 h later. The double synchronized group of gilts was treated with 750 I. U. PMSG and 500 I. U. hCG 72 h later. After 17 days, 1500 I. U. PMSG followed by 1000 I. U. hCG was administered. Five days after insemination embryos were recovered and cultured for 6 days. Both single and double hormonal stimulation schedules resulted in recovery of elevated numbers of embryos (28. 4 and 23. 4 vs. 11. 3; p< 0. 01 and p≤ 0. 05, respectively) with {{a higher percentage of}} embryos classified as degenerated (39. 2 % and 43. 1 %, respectively) compared to the non-stimulated, control group (5. 1 %). The number of embryos destined for culture did not differ between the single and double synchronized groups. The highest percentage of <b>hatched</b> <b>embryos</b> was observed in the control group.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} brood {{production}} was analyzed {{in the grass}} shrimp Palaemonetes pugio. Determination of patterns of brood production as successive (spawning after each molt) or alternate (spawning after every other molt) was made by observations on individual females paired with males in the laboratory over a four-month period. A pattern of successive parturial (spawning) molts {{was the most common}} pattern. However, in a majority of these successive parturials, the ovary of the female was not mature at <b>hatching</b> of <b>embryos</b> from a previous brood. There was a delay of 10 - 11 days, during which ovarian maturation took place, between <b>embryo</b> <b>hatching</b> and the next (parturial) molt. This pattern of "slow successive " parturials does not result in the truly continuous brood production which occurs in many caridean species, i. e., spawning of a new brood within 1 - 2 days after hatching of a previous brood. However, there was a relatively low percentage of females in which the ovary was mature at <b>embryo</b> <b>hatching.</b> These latter females did have a parturial molt after only 2 days ("fast successive " parturial).

40|$|Glucose 6 -phosphate {{isomerase}} (GPI), alternatively named phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), autocrine motility factor (AMF) or neuroleukin (NLK), is a sugar metabolic enzyme catalyzing the interconversion between glucose- 6 -phosphate and fructose- 6 -phosphate. When secreted {{out of the}} cell, it can induce cellular {{activities of}} neighboring cells. As a prerequisite to study the function of gpi during development, we analyzed the sequences and expression patterns of zebrafish gpia and gpib. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that gpia and gpib are two paralogs resulting from the teleost fish-specific whole genome duplication. In adult zebrafish, gpia is widely expressed in many tissues, whereas gpib is only expressed in heart, muscle, and at lower abundance in eye. During embryonic development, gpia mRNA is maternally deposited in cleavage and blastula embryos, but gpib mRNA is not. Zygotic expression of gpia mRNA initiates in the primitive gut of segmentation embryos, and its expression increases in eye, cerebellum, hindbrain, heart, pharyngeal arches, pectoral fin buds and gut of <b>hatching</b> <b>embryos</b> at 60 hpf (hours post fertilization). At 72 hpf, gpia mRNA is strongly expressed in the retina of eye, rectum, hindbrain, and gut derivatives such as liver, intestine and circular smooth muscle layer of the swim bladder. By contrast, gpib is expressed in the yolk syncytial nuclei of late blastula, gastrula and segmentation embryos. Somitic gpib expression initiates in late pharyngula embryos, and it is most prominent in the muscle of <b>hatching</b> <b>embryos</b> around 48 - 60 hpf Transcript of gpib is also expressed in the pectoral fins and portions of the pharyngeal arches in the hatching period. The differential expression of gpia and gpib in zebrafish suggests partition or divergence of gpi functions between the two duplicates. (c) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Eggs of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and ring-necked {{pheasants}} (Phasianus colchicus) were incubated in clutches {{arranged to}} stimulate <b>embryos</b> to <b>hatch</b> earlier or later than normal. This manipulation of hatching time {{was achieved by}} combining eggs of different age in the same clutch. To ensure <b>hatching</b> synchrony, <b>embryos</b> {{communicate with each other}} during the last stage of incubation, resulting in either a delay or an acceleration of <b>hatching.</b> <b>Embryos</b> of both species that accelerated their hatching time suffered a higher mortality rate after hatching. Combining mortality with the proportion of hatchlings that suffered from leg deformities, impeding their movements, resulted in a cost also to pheasant chicks delaying their hatching. Chicks of both species accelerating hatching time had a lower minimum mass and a shorter tarsus length than control chicks, whereas chicks delaying hatching time either grew as well or slightly better than control chicks. Mallard chicks had better balance and mobility immediately after hatching the longer they stayed in the egg. This indicates that the period immediately before hatching, is an important period for muscular and organ maturity. Reducing this period results in costs affecting post-hatching survival. The strategy to assure synchronous hatching in mallards and pheasants probably reflect a trade-off between the negative effects of shifting the age at hatching away from normal and differences in predation risk during different stages of reproduction...|$|R
