25|$|Australia is {{the only}} {{continent}} where venomous snakes outnumber their non-venomous cousins. Australian snakes belong to seven families. Of these, the most venomous species, including the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake,</b> eastern brown snake, taipan and eastern tiger snake are from the family Elapidae. Of the 200 species of elapid, 86 are found only in Australia. Thirty-three sea snakes from family Hydrophiidae inhabit Australia's northern waters; many are extremely venomous. Two species of sea snake from the Acrochordidae also occur in Australian waters. Australia has only 11 species from the world's most significant snake family Colubridae; none are endemic, and they {{are considered to be}} relatively recent arrivals from Asia. There are 15 python species and 31 species of insectivorous blind snake.|$|E

An amateur photographer showed a picture he had {{of what looked like}} a <b>fierce</b> <b>snake</b> on a rail fence. By and by he gave the trick away. The snake was nothing but a garden worm wound around some little sticks and toothpicks, and the picture had been snapped at close range." ...|$|E

60|$|Then he {{sat down}} on the grass, and told them the story of his life, or as much of it as he could remember, from the day when he was first cradled in a warrior's brazen shield. While he lay there, two immense serpents came gliding over the floor, and opened their hideous jaws to devour him; and he, a baby of a few months old, had griped one of the <b>fierce</b> <b>snakes</b> in each of his little fists, and strangled them to death. When he was but a stripling, he had killed a huge lion, almost as big as the one whose vast and shaggy hide he now wore upon his shoulders. The next thing that he had done was to fight a battle with an ugly sort of monster, called a hydra, which had no less than nine heads, and {{exceedingly}} sharp teeth in every one of them.|$|R

60|$|The poet's {{attention}} was now drawn {{off by a}} noise of lamentation, and he perceived that he was approaching the city of Dis.[19] The turrets glowed vermilion with the fire within it, the walls appeared to be of iron, and moats were round about them. The boat circuited the walls till the travellers came to a gate, which Phlegyas, with a loud voice, told them to quit the boat and enter. But a thousand fallen angels crowded {{over the top of}} the gate, refusing to open it, and making furious gestures. At length they agreed to let Virgil speak with them inside; and he left Dante for a while, standing in terror without. The parley was in vain. They would not let them pass. Virgil, however, bade his companion be of good cheer, and then stood listening and talking to himself; disclosing by his words his expectation of some extraordinary assistance, and at the same time his anxiety for its arrival. On a sudden, three raging figures arose over the gate, coloured with gore. Green hydras twisted about them; and their <b>fierce</b> temples had <b>snakes</b> instead of hair.|$|R
50|$|Frederick McCoy is the taxon {{author of}} three species of Australian venomous snakes, {{including}} Oxyuranus microlepidotus, {{commonly known as}} the inland taipan or <b>fierce</b> <b>snake,</b> which is considered to be the world's most venomous snake.|$|E
5000|$|Oxyuranus microlepidotus {{has been}} the fierce snake's {{binomial}} name since the early 1980s. The generic name, Oxyuranus, means oxus (Greek) [...] "sharp pointed", oura (Greek) [...] "tail"; -anus (Latin) [...] "belonging to", and refers to the inland taipan's long pointed tail. The specific name, microlepidotus, means [...] "small-scaled" [...] (Latin). Hence the common name, small-scaled snake. Since it has been determined (Covacevich et al., 1981) that the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake</b> (formerly: Parademansia microlepidota) is actually part of the genus Oxyuranus (taipan), another species, Oxyuranus scutellatus, which was previously commonly named taipan (coined from the aboriginal snake's name Dhayban) became coastal taipan (or eastern taipan), and the now newly classified Oxyuranus microlepidotus, became commonly known as inland taipan (or western taipan). The word [...] "fierce" [...] from its alternative name, <b>fierce</b> <b>snake,</b> describes its powerful venom.|$|E
50|$|The inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus), also {{commonly}} known as the western taipan, the small-scaled snake, or the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake,</b> is an extremely venomous snake of the taipan (Oxyuranus) genus, and is endemic to semi-arid regions of central east Australia. Aboriginal Australians living in those regions named the snake Dandarabilla. It was first described by Frederick McCoy in 1879 and then by William John Macleay in 1882, but for the next 90 years, it was a mystery species to the scientific community. No more s were found, and virtually nothing was added to the knowledge of this species until its rediscovery in 1972.|$|E
50|$|The inland taipan {{first came}} to the {{attention}} of Western science in 1879. Two specimens of the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake</b> were discovered in the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers in northwestern Victoria and described by Frederick McCoy, who called the species Diemenia microlepidota, or small-scaled brown snake. In 1882 a third specimen was found near Bourke, New South Wales, and William John Macleay described the same snake under the name Diemenia ferox (thinking it was a different species). No more specimens were collected until 1972. In 1896 George Albert Boulenger classified both as belonging to the same genus, Pseudechis (black snakes), referring them as Pseudechis microlepidotus and Pseudechis ferox.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{story about}} the origin of the murti in 'Narada Puranam'. King Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, {{grandson}} of Abhimanyu and great-grandson of Arjuna, conducted a fierce yajna called 'Sarpasatra' to kill the whole clan of Takshaka, the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake</b> who killed his father. Many innocent snakes died in the yaga fire, but Takshaka survived. Thus Janamejaya got affected with the curse of snakes, making him a leprosy patient. Even though he was well looked by his wife, children and palace doctors, there was no cure. At that time, sage Dattatreya appeared before him and advised him to worship Lord Vishnu at Guruvayoor. He also told the story of the idol. That is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|In the wild, {{the inland}} taipan consumes only mammals, mostly rodents, {{such as the}} {{long-haired}} rat (Rattus villosissimus), the plains rat (Pseudomys australis), the introduced house mouse (Mus musculus) and other dasyurids. Unlike other venomous snakes that strike with a single, accurate bite then retreat {{while waiting for the}} prey to die, the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake</b> subdues the prey with a series of rapid, accurate strikes. It is known to deliver up to eight venomous bites in a single attack, often snapping its jaws fiercely several times to inflict multiple punctures in the same attack. Its more risky attack strategy entails holding its prey with its body and biting it repeatedly. This injects the extremely toxic venom deep into the prey. The venom acts so rapidly that its prey does not have time to fight back.|$|E
50|$|The sand monitor is a {{relentless}} forager. It is diurnal, meaning {{most of its}} activities take place during the day. Anything smaller than itself will be eagerly devoured. The diets of hatchlings and juveniles often consist mostly of insects and small lizards, but generally varies more with age. Adult monitors will prey on mice, small birds, large insects, small lizard species, snakes, and carrion. They are seemingly immune to snake venom and will kill and eat even the most venomous species such as the <b>fierce</b> <b>snake.</b> The sand goanna does consume smaller species of monitors: Ackies, rock monitors and other dwarf species are often found and eaten. It is common to see a Gould's disturbing rock piles {{in an attempt to}} flush out any Odatria. It lays its eggs in termite mounds to protect them from the harsh desert climate.|$|E
50|$|In Ovid's Metamorphoses 9, AcheloÃ¼s, a river god, tells Theseus {{the story}} of how he lost his horns. There was a very {{beautiful}} woman named Deianira, who had many suitors. The many suitors of Deianira gathered in the palace of Deianira's father in hopes of marrying her. However, once the other suitors realized that AcheloÃ¼s, a god, and Heracules, the son of Jupiter, wanted to marry Deianira, the other suitors withdrew from the competition. This left only AcheloÃ¼s and Hercules as the only two suitors. Each spoke to Deianira's father proclaiming they should be the one to have her hand in marriage. After AcheloÃ¼s concluded his speech, Hercules charged at AcheloÃ¼s and the two began to wrestle. At the first, the two grappled pretty evenly; however, after many attempts, Hercules finally started to get the better of AcheloÃ¼s. Hercules was locked onto AcheloÃ¼s' back and put AcheloÃ¼s into a strangle hold. Feeling impending defeat in this human form, AcheloÃ¼s transformed into a snake. Laughing, Hercules easily began to choke out the snake-formed AcheloÃ¼s. Hercules had defeated a much more <b>fierce</b> <b>snake</b> while just a baby, so AcheloÃ¼s was no match to Hercules in snake-form. Finally, AcheloÃ¼s decided to transform into a bull. Hercules grabbed the bull by the neck and shoved AcheloÃ¼s' head deep into the dirt. Then, Hercules grabbed AcheloÃ¼s' horn tore it from his head. Hercules then took Deianira as his wife.|$|E
