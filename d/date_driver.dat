The mean group-specific changes were higher (better) in the feedback group than in the non-feedback group during the first, second, and third weeks of follow-up (p 0. 25 in all cases).

40|$|In normal {{cells and}} under {{physiological}} conditions, the binding of various cyto-kines to their receptors rapidly and tran-siently activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3). STAT 3 is negatively regulated by various proteins, such as suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS). When con-stitutively activated, STAT 3 promotes malignant transformation. 1 Accordingly, somatic mutations in the Src homology 2 (SH 2) domain of STAT 3 are frequently found in large granular lymphocytic leu-kemia. 2 Furthermore, mutations in Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) {{that result in}} constitutive STAT 3 activation have also been identified in myeloproliferative disorders. 3 However, similar mutations in the JAK/STAT 3 pathway have not been reported in lung cancer patients.

The impact shattered and completely disintegrated the March chassis, causing the fuel tank to explode, and sent debris, including Smiley's exposed body, into the catch fence and then back onto the track, tumbling hundreds of feet across the short-chute connecting turns 3 and 4.
