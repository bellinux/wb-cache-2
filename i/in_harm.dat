25|$|Many {{conflicts}} that result <b>in</b> <b>harm</b> and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults. Steven Pinker {{in his book}} The Blank Slate argues that in non-state societies without a police {{it was very important}} to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation ("honor"). Pinker argues that the development {{of the state and the}} police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.|$|E

In response Superman, Green Lantern, Shazam, and Wonder Woman lift the entire city of Atlantis off the sea floor and carry it to dry deserts, putting its inhabitants <b>in</b> <b>harm</b> to bully Aquaman.
