25|$|In 1846 another Act of Parliament {{established}} the Great Western Dock Company to provide <b>full</b> <b>facilities</b> for shipping at Millbay. Gill sold his Millbay Pier to this company {{and became a}} director. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to design new docks; both he and Gill {{were involved in the}} South Devon Railway, so {{it is no surprise that}} the first railway station in Plymouth was opened nearby in 1849. The next year a railway extension was built to the new docks, customs facilities were granted and the docks were recognised as a Government mail packet station.|$|E
25|$|Grosmont {{railway station}} was the railway's {{permanent}} northern terminus until 2007, when trains began operating into Whitby {{on a regular}} basis. The locomotive sheds are situated here, {{just south of the}} tunnel through which trains run en route for Goathland and beyond. The station itself has been restored to the British Railways style circa 1952. It has <b>full</b> <b>facilities</b> including a shop, café serving cooked meals, toilets including disabled, a ticket office and a waiting room. The shed area has facilities to provide water and coal for the engines, as well as stabling. The 'running shed' is usually open to public access at one end, where stationary engines can be viewed. These are usually either operational but not in service that day, or undergoing light repair work. Also open to the public is the 'deviation shed' which houses locomotives and stock owned by NELPG as well as a small display {{about the history of the}} organisation. A number of other sheds not available for public access are used for the maintenance and overhaul of the engines. At Grosmont, the line connects with the Network Rail operated Esk Valley Line, where passengers may change trains to travel to the coast at Whitby, or inland to Middlesbrough and the rest of the national network. Thus, platform one of the station is served by Northern Rail services, whilst platforms two, three and four are used by the NYMR.|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} MacNeil's letter, von Engelken conferred with sculptor and Commission of Fine Arts member Herbert Adams, {{and with}} Commission Chairman Charles Moore. [...] Von Engelken {{agreed that the}} design of the quarter could be modified to meet MacNeil's wishes. [...] Although no correspondence is known to exist, it appears that the Mint Director and sculptor spoke by telephone over the next several days, as on January 17, von Engelken sent Secretary McAdoo a letter asking for discretion to allow MacNeil to modify the design. [...] McAdoo summoned MacNeil to Washington for a meeting, and then ordered von Engelken to provide MacNeil with all the facilities and help he would need at the Philadelphia Mint—von Engelken had intended that the redesign take place at the sculptor's expense. [...] On January 17, the Mint released the first Standing Liberty quarters, dated both 1916 and 1917, into circulation. [...] On January 30, 1917, von Engelken instructed Joyce to give MacNeil <b>full</b> <b>facilities,</b> and told the Mint Superintendent, [...] "see that Mr. Barber keeps his objections to himself while Mr. MacNeil is there". [...] George T. Morgan, who had worked under Barber for the Engraver's entire 37-year tenure, was assigned to assist MacNeil.|$|E

2500|$|However, the 1965 {{agreement}} {{was a source}} of contention for the Parliament, which wished to be closer to the other institutions, so it began moving some of its decision making bodies, committee and political group meetings to Brussels. In 1983 it went further by symbolically holding a plenary session in Brussels, {{in the basement of the}} Mont des Arts Congress Centre. However the meeting was a fiasco and the poor facilities partly discredited Brussels' aim of being the sole seat of the institutions. Things looked up for Brussels when Parliament gained its own plenary chamber in Brussels (on Rue Wiertzstraat) in 1985 for some of its part-sessions. This was done unofficially due to the sensitive nature of the Parliament's seat, with the building being constructed under the name of an [...] "international conference centre". When France unsuccessfully challenged Parliament's half-move to Brussels in the Court of Justice, Parliament's victory led it to build <b>full</b> <b>facilities</b> in Brussels.|$|E
