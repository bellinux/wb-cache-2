50|$|Two {{separate}} {{measurements were}} used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of the neural response. The first {{was based on the}} Fourier power spectrum of the spike time series response. The power spectra from the averaged spike data for three different noise intensities all showed a clear peak at the 55.2 Hz component with different average levels of broadband noise. The relatively low- and mid-level added noise conditions also show a second <b>harmonic</b> <b>component</b> at about 110 Hz. The mid-level noise condition clearly shows a stronger component at the signal of interest than either low- or high-level noise, and the <b>harmonic</b> <b>component</b> is greatly reduced at mid-level noise and not present in the high-level noise. A standard measure of the SNR as a function of noise variance shows a clear peak at the mid-level noise condition. The other measure used for SNR was based on the inter-spike interval histogram instead of the power spectrum. A similar peak was found on a plot of SNR as a function of noise variance for mid-level noise, although it was slightly different from that found using the power spectrum measurement.|$|E

50|$|When in the {{unstable}} configuration, {{for a particular}} <b>harmonic</b> <b>component</b> of the initial perturbation, the torque on the interface creates vorticity that will tend to increase the misalignment of the gradient vectors. This in turn creates additional vorticity, leading to further misalignment. This concept is depicted in the figure, where {{it is observed that}} the two counter-rotating vortices have velocity fields that sum at the peak and trough of the perturbed interface. In the stable configuration, the vorticity, and thus the induced velocity field, will be in a direction that decreases the misalignment and therefore stabilizes the system.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{powerful}} uses of surface SHG is the probing of surface structure of buried interfaces. Traditional surface tools such as Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy as well as many forms of electron diffraction must be conducted under vacuum, and are not sensitive to interfaces deeper in the probed medium. SHG measurements allow the incident laser beam to pass without interaction through higher level materials to the target interface where the second harmonic signal is generated. In cases where the transmitting materials do interact with the beam, these contributions to the second harmonic signal can be resolved in other experiments and subtracted out. The resulting measured second harmonic signal contains the second <b>harmonic</b> <b>component</b> from the buried interface alone. This type of measurement is useful for determining the surface structure of the interface. As an example, Cheikh-Rouhou et al. demonstrated this process to resolve interface structures of 5 layer systems.|$|E
