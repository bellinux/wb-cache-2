6000|$|Cornelia shivered as she {{sat down}} on the edge of this divan, and Charmian ran back to put another stick of {{lightwood}} on the fire, and turn the gas down to a blue flame. She pulled down rugs and draperies, and dragged them toward the alcove for covering. [...] "Oh, how different it is from the way I always supposed it would be when I expected to sleep here!" [...] She sank <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to <b>a</b> <b>ghostly</b> whisper, and yawned. [...] "Now you go to sleep, Cornelia; but if you want anything I shall be watching here beside you, and you must ask me. Would you like anything now? An olive, or a--cracker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What? My adversary! His name is Feraud." [...] Shadowy in his tricorne {{and old-fashioned}} clothes like a bowed thin ghost of the ancien régime the Chevalier <b>voiced</b> <b>a</b> <b>ghostly</b> memory.|$|R
60|$|Lady Delahaye shrugged her shoulders. She dropped <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little.|$|R
6000|$|Shadowy in his tricorne {{and old-fashioned}} clothes, like a bowed, thin ghost of the ancien regime, the Chevalier <b>voiced</b> <b>a</b> <b>ghostly</b> memory. [...] "I can {{remember}} the feud about little Sophie Derval, between Monsieur de Brissac, Captain in the Bodyguards, and d'Anjorrant (not the pock-marked one, the other--the Beau d'Anjorrant, as they called him). They met three times in eighteen months in a most gallant manner. It was the fault of that little Sophie, too, who would keep on playing [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|Josephine laughed. Then she saw Phipps {{standing}} {{in the background and}} she raised <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Van Reinberg was {{a little}} embarrassed. She hesitated, and dropped <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little in {{answering}} me.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that there was a sort of {{something}} in <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> kind of thingummy, you know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] she answered, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little, [...] "in Frederic Mansions. By the bye, we are neighbours, I believe, are we not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are sure, John?" [...] she asked, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little broken. [...] "You want me really? I am to come? You won't be sorry--afterward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Squire Fentolin," [...] she answered, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little. [...] "He's a very kind-hearted gentleman, Squire Fentolin, but he don't like strangers hanging around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He might eat all {{the cake}} {{in the house}} for what I care," [...] said Mrs. Chinnery, turning very red, and raising <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you bring}} your friend in to supper, Mr. Tavernake?" [...] she begged. [...] "It's good news, I hope?" [...] she added, {{lowering}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will remember," [...] the Princess said, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little, [...] "that {{before anything}} definite is said, you and I {{must have a}} little conversation." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{too dark}} to see her face, but my heart bounded with joy to catch in <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> quaver that argued, methought, regret for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho! carn’t I?" [...] {{said the}} lady, raising <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little. [...] "You go an’ {{tell him that}} his lawful wedded wife, what he deserted, is aboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember, I want {{to belong}} to your society--remember," [...] she added, having to raise <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little, and {{shutting}} the door upon {{the rest of her}} words.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you thought, of course, that I must be of my uncle's mind?" [...] There was <b>a</b> {{crispness}} about <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>an</b> ominous challenging sparkle in her hazel eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "How you had--how you {{had earned}} your living. How you had gained your power," [...] she went on, her pain lending to <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>an</b> {{exquisite}} note of many modulations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Priscilla is here," [...] said she, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little {{lower than}} usual. [...] "Have not you learnt {{as much from}} your chamber window? Would {{you like to see}} her?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had raised}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little, {{thinking}} the man might be asleep. But no sound answered her, save {{from outside the}} cry of a bird frightened by some midnight prowler.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy Coulson sighed. [...] "Harford," [...] she said, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> trifle, [...] "you {{must try}} not to blame me. If one of us had been richer--I, at least, can't help remembering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he has," [...] she agreed, {{lowering}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little. [...] "At least, I believe one thing. I {{believe that}} he is a good German and yet a great friend of England." ...|$|R
6000|$|She leaned {{towards him}} and dropped <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little. [...] "Tell me," [...] she begged, [...] "do {{you ever think}} of the years we spent {{together}} in the country? Do you ever regret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{lifted up}} {{her head and}} looked at him. There was a new-born note in <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> tremulous note of joy {{in the midst of}} sorrow. It was of her he was thinking! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are few better {{men than}} my brother, {{though he is}} not clever," [...] she said and dropped <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little. [...] "As to the other, he died in India--beside his {{mountain}} gun--long ago." ...|$|R
5000|$|The puppet {{used for}} Granny Bird is a spare Big Bird puppet, and Caroll Spinney {{provides}} <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> <b>As</b> Granny Bird's appearances are often alongside Big Bird, (who is, as she stated, her [...] "favorite grandson"), <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> is usually pre-recorded so that Spinney can perform Big Bird.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then tell me, monsieur," [...] she begged, <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> very caress of suppliant softness,--"tell me what vexes you {{and sets}} a curb upon your tongue. You exaggerate, I am assured. You {{could do nothing}} dishonourable, nothing vile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you and Henry {{were our}} salvation. I haven't felt so thrilled for ages. I only wish," [...] she added, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little, [...] "that it might {{bring you the}} luck you deserve." ...|$|R
60|$|He had had before, in the {{presence}} of his wife, this vague feeling of having passed boundaries invisible to him. In her eyes was a curious smile that lacked mirth, in <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> dispassionate note that added to his bewilderment.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's generous of you!" [...] she exclaimed, and thrilled {{him with}} the tribute. Nor was the tribute wholly in the words: there had come spontaneously into <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>an</b> exquisite, {{modulated}} note that haunted him long after it had died away....|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>a</b> little hysterical. Her unnatural calm {{was giving}} way.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Muldoon glanced round <b>her,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> was <b>an</b> hysterical whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ssh!' whispered Miss Reed--the widow, in her excitement, {{had raised}} <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little and Miss Reed could never suffer the least irreverence in church.... 'She {{never came back}} last night, and George Browning saw them get into the London train at Tercanbury.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I think Miss Harding is here now,” she said. “She {{asked if}} she might come, and I fancied I heard <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> little while ago, but I {{do not know if}} she will tell you. I am glad you are going, Tony.” ...|$|R
60|$|Once she reproved Valerie for {{her lack}} of appetite, and there was in <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> <b>a</b> {{kindness}} Valerie had not heard for months--not since the old Marquis died, nor did she hear it now, or, hearing it, she did not heed it.|$|R
2500|$|She celebrated her {{retirement}} by issuing a vocal album entitled Modae no Heya. On this disc's recent re-release in CD format, a reviewer commented of Tani's vocals, [...] "There’s <b>a</b> worldliness in <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and <b>a</b> maturity which suggests she’s seen it all... There is however <b>a</b> fragility to <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>a</b> cracking {{sense of the}} truly erotic, the unseen, the taboo which drapes each syllable... hearing music which would usually be readily associated with a mid-70s Samurai movie bedding down with such muted eroticism {{is more than a}} winning formula." ...|$|R
