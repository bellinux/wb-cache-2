40|$|This paper {{systematically}} {{investigates the}} safety of <b>fuel</b> preparation <b>room</b> containing high pressure fuel gas supply systems {{in order to identify}} shortcomings and practical gaps of the current regulations. A very large ore carrier of 300, 000 DWT was taken as an example and the LNG fuel system was designed for it. An event tree analysis was conducted on the fuel system to identify events that can lead to an explosion. Along with a fault tree analysis model, generic failure data from various sources were used to estimate frequency of potential explosion. For the consequence analysis computational ﬂuid dynamics and ﬁnite element analysis software were used to estimate the impact of explosions on the boundary structure of the <b>fuel</b> preparation <b>room.</b> Research ﬁndings show that the current rules and regulations concerning {{the safety of}} <b>fuel</b> preparation <b>rooms</b> and that the high pressure fuel gas supply system is subject to an unacceptably high level of explosion risk with the frequency of explosion as high as 3. 13 E- 04 per year. The impact of an explosion within the <b>fuel</b> preparation <b>rooms</b> can cause stresses in excess of allowable stress in the bottom structure if not being strengthened. It is proposed that special attention is given to the structural design and/or enhanced safe measures for the FPRs and the relevant regulations updated to account for this...|$|R

Starting from 7:30 pm all four units lost their 225 kV power supplies, while units 2 and 4 also lost their 400 kV power supplies. The {{isolator}} circuits that should have allowed units 2 and 4 to supply themselves with electricity also failed, causing these two reactors to automatically shut down, and diesel backup generators started up, maintaining power to plants 2 and 4 until the 400 kV supply was restored at around 10:20 pm. In the pumping room for unit 1, one set of the two pairs of pumps in the Essential Service Water System failed due to flooding; had both sets failed then the safety of plant would have been endangered. In both units 1 and 2, flooding in the <b>fuel</b> <b>rooms</b> put the low-head safety injection pumps and the containment spray pumps, part of the Emergency Core Cooling System (a back-up system in case of coolant loss) out of use.

40|$|Ionic liquids {{were found}} to be highly {{selective}} for the extractive removal of aromatic sulfur compounds from <b>fuels</b> at <b>room</b> temperature. The efficiency of ionic liquids for the removal of aromatic sulfur compounds is dependent on the properties and structure of the ionic liquids. In this work, the Lewis-acidic ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrahalogenoferrate(III) ([BMIM] [FeCl 4]) was synthesized and demonstrated to be more effective for the removal of aromatic sulfur compounds from diesel over ionic liquids 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM][PF 6]) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM] [BF 4]) because of its Lewis-acidic property. The ionic liquids favorably extracted organic compounds with a higher density of aromatic -electrons.

In 1993 the 2nd prototype [...] lifeboat Sam and Joan Woods (ON 1075), Operational Number 47-002, built in 1982 and having spent nine years in the Relief fleet was allocated to the station.

Sam and Joan Woods stayed at Walton for less than three years, launching on service 67 times and saving 10 lives, before returning to the Relief fleet and being replaced in May 1996 by the newer 1989 built Tyne Kenneth Thelwall II (ON1154), Operational Number 47-036.
