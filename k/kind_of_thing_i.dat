500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for giving me the faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying about that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|Tyler {{attended}} the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, {{before returning to}} New York City with her mother at age 12. She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> have no regrets. I love the way my life has gone." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were named}} 2012 inductees for the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. In an {{interview}} that same day, Anthony Kiedis talked about Frusciante and if he would attend the ceremony. Kiedis stated, [...] "It would be a guess on my behalf {{on whether or not}} he’ll come. I can’t imagine that he would, but it’s a 'you never know' <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> haven’t talked to him in quite a while. I don’t know where he’s at these days. He’ll obviously be more than welcome, and embraced if he does. If he doesn’t, that’s cool too." [...] Flea also spoke about Frusciante by saying [...] "He left us so many great gifts. He’s a phenomenal musician and songwriter who gave so much to our band. All the feelings I have for him not being in the band any more... He really took us to a higher level." [...] Frusciante eventually declined to be present for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April.|$|E

500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse and that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy things in my life. I hope he sees {{the positive side of}} the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E
500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo as myself or anything, and I wouldn't do that. Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when I read that in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's {{response}} {{when asked about}} LSD and [...] "Hang On to Your Ego" [...] was: [...] "I had taken a few drugs, and I had gotten into that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> guess it just came up naturally." [...] Despite concerns over the song's drug references, the key lyric [...] "they trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night" [...] was kept for the final version. Elsewhere for [...] "Sloop John B", Wilson's lyric change from [...] "this is the worst trip since I've been born" [...] to [...] "this is the worst trip I've ever been on" [...] has also been suggested to be another subtle nod to acid culture.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a little}} odd about Ayala," [...] said Gertrude, {{resuming}} her confidential tone. [...] "It {{is so hard to}} make papa understand about these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> declare I believe he thinks that I never ought to speak to another man because of that scoundrel Frank Houston." ...|$|R
5000|$|That {{opened up}} all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> ... <b>I</b> {{realized}} I was always Chinese, but there's the duality {{of taking the}} next step.

And {{those are the things that}} came out of my paintings.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Blaylock," [...] {{said the}} little elderly lady, shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent {{explanation}} at J. Pinkney Bloom, [...] "is so devoted to businesss. He {{has such a}} talent for financiering and markets and investments and those <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on life's journey--I am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{walking out}} of her contract, Varsi's {{participation}} or consideration to several films were cancelled, including a starring role in The Best of Everything (1959). After leaving Hollywood, Varsi played in several small plays in San Francisco. At some point thereafter, {{she made her way}} to New York long enough to successfully audition for the Actors Studio, which she would attend at least briefly in 1965. As a result of being released from her contract, Varsi returned to film acting in the late 1960s, but by this time she was no longer being offered major film roles. She called the films she made in this period [...] "cheap films of little merit". She furthermore said that although producers were curious, they would not hire her. [...] Her later films include Johnny Got His Gun in 1971, a film which Varsi described as her favorite, and a 1972 ABC-TV [...] "Movie of the Week", titled The People. Of Johnny Got His Gun, the actress said: [...] "This is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> always wanted to do. It comes very late to me. It's been a long time to wait." [...] She was nervous to play the role, saying: [...] "I felt too inadequate to do [...] It's so intense, the responsibility." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just so," [...] said Charnock, smiling. [...] "Betting against marked cards doesn't pay, but I've stopped that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> However, <b>I</b> think I {{could get}} you the money you need." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Crosbie isn't afraid <b>of</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> And <b>I</b> {{always thought}} that Frank was very wrong,--very wrong indeed. What's the good of two men beating {{each other in the}} street?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Too melodramatic," [...] he said. [...] "'I call on {{heaven to}} judge between {{this man and}} me!' <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't. What do you propose to tell, anyway?" ...|$|E

I'm not of much use in the world, but {{from time to time}} I like to do my poor best; and this is just one <b>of</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> think I'm fitted for. I should like to see this young man.

6000|$|Mose arose. [...] "I guess not; I'm {{trying to}} keep clear of gun-play these days. I've never hunted that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>I</b> won't start in on a game that's sure to give me trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, their principles! I believe I {{have some}} vague idea as to {{supporting}} property and land {{and all that}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't know that anybody wants to attack anything." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, Brooklyn band Dirty Projectors {{released}} their New Attitude EP on the label. According to bandmember Dave Longstreth, Marriage Records was {{an important}} influence on their early sound, saying [...] "I love {{a lot of the}} music that my friends have made up in Portland. I feel like it has totally affected who I am and what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> ended up making—people like Adrian Orange, Adam Forkner, and Curtis..." [...] In 2007, the Seattle Stranger interviewed Steven Malkmus of Pavement who stated [...] "There's just crazy stuff on in Portland... Marriage Records, this guy Curtis, has got some good stuff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much or little, {{it made no}} {{difference}} with me. I should never have thought of marrying a girl for her money. It's a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> hate. I almost wish she was to have nothing." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{wanted it}} to be real rock 'n' roll, real basic", Dio told WERS' Nasty Habits show. [...] "We wanted to capture what we are live and that's really what I think we did. We didn't do tons of overdubs or a lot <b>of</b> chorus-y <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> think the {{important}} thing is that a band should be able to do all the things they do on record live, without any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sampling crap or that rubbish - so, of course, we didn't. We recorded it true to what the band is: just guitar, bass, drums and vocals, y'know - a couple <b>of</b> keyboard <b>things</b> here and there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{which do}} you think pays best? I don't mind telling you,--though it's a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> never talk about to strangers,--the {{royalties}} from the Blogownie and Toodlem mines go up regularly two thousand pounds every year." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It must be {{admitted}} that it does. In fact, I've been acquiring parsimonious habits and worrying myself about expenses lately. They {{have to be}} kept down somehow, and that's a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> never took kindly to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper began {{painting}} {{urban and}} architectural scenes {{in a dark}} palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the Impressionists {{before returning to the}} darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, [...] "I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> do now." [...] Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver Charles Méryon, whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lee, {{changing}} {{in a moment}} to his old pedantic style I had almost forgotten. [...] "Thou hast not the message; it's thy work to till the soil, and I had thought to bide in this good land helping thee until my time came. But a voice kept on saying, 'Go back to them hopeless poor and drunkards thou left in Lancashire.' I would not listen. The devil whispered I was worn out and done, but when I talked with Harry, he, not having understanding, said: 'You're looking younger every day. If <b>I</b> heard those <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> should say it was liver.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Austin was {{a little}} annoyed to feel that he was smiling sardonically. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I should almost have fancied that you were too super-refined and {{ethereal}} to admire that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> but <b>I</b> really believe you do." ...|$|R
