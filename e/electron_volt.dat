50|$|In {{crystals}} excitons {{interact with}} phonons, the lattice vibrations. If this coupling is weak as in typical semiconductors such as GaAs or Si, excitons are scattered by phonons. However, when the coupling is strong, excitons can be self-trapped. Self-trapping results in dressing excitons with a dense cloud of virtual phonons which strongly suppresses {{the ability of}} excitons to move across the crystal. In simpler terms, this means a local deformation of the crystal lattice around the exciton. Self-trapping can be achieved only if the energy of this deformation can compete with {{the width of the}} exciton band. Hence, it should be of atomic scale, of about an <b>electron</b> <b>volt.</b>|$|E

50|$|Nuclear {{reaction}} kinematics are customarily {{performed in}} units involving the <b>electron</b> <b>volt,</b> {{a consequence of}} accelerator technology. The combination of this practical point with the theoretical relation E = mc2 makes units of mega electron volts over {{the speed of light}} squared (MeV/c2) a convenient form to express nuclear mass. However, the numerical values of nuclear masses in MeV/c2 are quite large (even the proton mass is ~938.27 MeV/c2), while mass excesses range in the tens of MeV/c2. This makes tabulated mass excess less cumbersome for use in calculations. One trivial point worth noting is that the 1/c2 term is typically omitted when quoting mass excess values in MeV, since the interest is more often energy and not mass; if one wanted units of mass, one would simply change the units from MeV to MeV/c2 without altering the numerical value.|$|E
5000|$|In physics, the {{electronvolt}} (symbol eV, {{also written}} electron-volt and <b>electron</b> <b>volt)</b> is {{a unit of}} energy equal to approximately [...] joules (symbol J).

Thus it is 1 volt (1 joule per coulomb, [...] ) multiplied by the elementary charge (e, or [...] ). Therefore, one electronvolt is equal to [...] Historically, the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy E = qV after passing through the potential V; if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts, one gets an energy in eV.|$|E
