25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might not have been so inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
500|$|The {{past decade}} has shown that {{harnessing}} consumer power to effect positive environmental change is far <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done. The so-called [...] "green consumer" [...] movements in the U.S. and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and {{to remain in the}} forefront of shoppers' minds. While public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies, consumers' efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best.|$|E

Having Chun Li getting her spine ripped out, or Ryu's head bouncing off the floor...it doesn't necessarily match." [...] In 2014, martial artist Frankie Edgar opined Mortal Kombat has been far superior to Street Fighter.|$|E

2500|$|Macomb’s {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{was marked by}} [...] "continuing {{uncertainty}} about the responsibilities and authority of his position. To secure his seniority over the other two-star brevet major generals, Macomb added {{a provision in the}} 1834 regulations that 'the insignia of the major general commanding in chief should be three stars.' In the same document he sought to define his relationship to the Secretary of War and establish his primacy over the bureau chiefs, including his successor as Chief of Engineers. This was <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done. Most issues were not fully resolved until early the next century." ...|$|E
2500|$|The concept {{itself was}} {{certainly}} not a new one, but putting it into practice under the military dogma and commander egos {{of the day was}} <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done. Throughout 1942 in particular, the coordination and flexibility exercised between Coningham's Western Desert Air Force (WDAF) and the 8th Army has been contrasted with the more rigid relationship between the Luftwaffe and German ground forces. During the first week of July, 1942, WDAF flew 5,458 sorties against Axis forces, using the innovative tactic of leap-frogging airfields, and Erwin Rommel informed Berlin on 4 July that he was abandoning his El Alamein offensive to concentrate on defence. [...] Later, the tactic of bombing known as Tedder's carpet was developed.|$|E

2500|$|By a {{handbook}} or a portolan chart, a navigator {{could see}} immediately that, for example, Pisa lay 85 miles southeast ("Scirocco" [...] {{in the traditional}} compass rose nomenclature) of Genoa, and so a ship that set out from Genoa to Pisa would simply maintain that bearing for that distance. However, most sailing courses were not nearly that neat. [...] A mariner wishing to sail from Majorca to Naples could tell the latter was due east ("Levante") by some 600 miles – but the island of Sardinia lies in the way, therefore the ship's bearing must be changed along the route. [...] This is <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done, as geographical coordinates did not exist during this era. [...] The only way to determine the exact position of the ship at sea would be to calculate via past bearing and distance travelled.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "...while I can’t say I LOVED “The Bear King”, I {{can at least}} say I {{respected}} what it was going for: It’s clear that Merida (Amy Manson) {{is going to be}} important to the endgame of this King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) storyline, so we needed to establish why and to what degree. And this is <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done, considering Merida is a character who, up until this point, hasn’t even been particularly likable. I like Amy Manson in the role of Merida, but she hasn’t always been given the best material, often coming across as unnecessarily combative and standoffish. And so this episode was necessary to soften the character and illustrate why she’s as hard-nosed as she is. This episode also gave Manson the opportunity to really shine, while also bringing back some OUAT alums I didn’t realize I’d missed, such as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Ruby (Meghan Ory). We also get to meet more of Merida’s family, such as Queen Elinor (Caroline Morahan), and — through flashbacks — the late King Fergus (Glenn Keogh). It’s a story that details how Merida is shaped into a warrior and a ruler who inspires leadership in her people, and from that standpoint, it’s one of the season’s more effective character studies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leaving Company A {{behind to}} secure the MACV Compound, the Marine {{battalion}} commander took Company G, reinforced by the three M-48 tanks from the 3rd Tank Battalion and a few ARVN light M-24 tanks from the 7th Armored Squadron, and attempted to cross the Trường Tiền Bridge, the main bridge over the Perfume River. Gravel left the armor behind on the southern bank to provide direct fire support. As he remembered, the American M-48s were too heavy for the bridge and the ARVN tankers [...] "refused to go." [...] As the Marine infantry started across, an enemy machine gun {{on the other end}} of the bridge opened up, killing and wounding several Marines. One Marine, Lance Corporal Lester A. Tully, later awarded the Silver Star for his action, ran forward, threw a grenade, and silenced the gun. Two platoons successfully made their way to the other side. They turned left and immediately came under automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from the Citadel wall. The Marines decided to withdraw. This was <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done. The enemy was well dug-in and firing from virtually every building in Huế city north of the river. The number of wounded was rising, the Marines commandeered some abandoned Vietnamese civilian vehicles and used them as makeshift ambulances to carry out the wounded. Among the casualties on the bridge was Major Walter M. Murphy, the 1st Battalion S-3 or operations officer, who later died of his wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Sender (1999), Ingebretsen (1999), and Bhat et al. (1998) {{point out}} that there are {{advertisers}} who do use gay and lesbian models to promote directly to the gay and lesbian community, but wish to remain innocuous to heterosexuals. Gay and lesbian advertisers do not actively pursue national recognition (which is essentially to a much larger demographic of heterosexuals) mostly due to fear and criticism. However, some very notable corporations, such as [...] "Sony, Toyota, Microsoft, Levi's, Banana Republic, American Express, Miller, and Absolut now commonly use gay media. Some firms (IKEA, Calvin Klein, Benetton) have gone further into using homosexual imagery in advertising to [...] more general audiences" [...] (Bhat et al., 1998, p.10). The gay and lesbian advertisers should be creating ads that appeal to all sexual preferences, even though this may be <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than done. The gay and lesbian advertisers must go beyond their select audience for ad campaigns targeting gays and lesbians to look at the inclusion, instead of exclusion, of heterosexuals. Sender (1999) suggests that on the heterosexual side, [...] "images which are arousing for lesbians, but which may not have originally been intended for , may actually offer greater pleasure than those which are implicitly coded to suggest a lesbian reading" [...] (p.191). If such is the case for [...] "hot lesbian" [...] advertisements, then there is nothing to say that actual lesbian advertisements might find heterosexuals left wanting something as well from them.|$|E
2500|$|Sandé {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much <b>easier</b> <b>said</b> than actually done. Sandé said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to Sandé's head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. Sandé said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back so much you kind of learn to believe in yourself, stand up for yourself, because you can bet that nobody else is going to do it." ...|$|E
