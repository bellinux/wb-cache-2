5000|$|Early {{front wheel}} drive systems such as those used on the CitroÃ«n Traction Avant and the front axles of Land Rover and similar four wheel drive {{vehicles}} used universal joints, where a cross-shaped metal pivot sits between two <b>forked</b> <b>carriers.</b> These are not CV joints as, except for specific configurations, they result in {{a variation of the}} angular velocity. They are simple to make and can be tremendously strong and are still used to provide a flexible coupling in some propshafts, where there is not very much movement. However, they become [...] "notchy" [...] and difficult to turn when operated at extreme angles.|$|R
40|$|Besides {{mutations}} in BRCA 1 /BRCA 2, heterozygous defects in PALB 2 {{are important in}} breast cancer predisposition. PALB 2 heterozygosity {{increases the risk of}} malignancy about sixfold. PALB 2 interacts with BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 to regulate homologous recombination and mediate DNA damage response. Here we show, by analysing lymphoblastoid cell lines from hetero-zygous female PALB 2 mutation carriers, that PALB 2 haploinsufficiency causes aberrant DNA replication/damage response. Mutation carrier cells show increased origin firing and shorter distance between consecutive replication <b>forks.</b> <b>Carrier</b> cell lines also show elevated ATR protein, but not phosphorylation levels, and a majority of them display aberrant Chk 1 -/Chk 2 -mediated DNA damage response. Elevated chromosome instability is observed in primary blood lymphocytes of PALB 2 mutation carriers, indicating that the described mechanisms of genome destabilization operate also at the organism level. These findings provide a new mechanism for early stages of breast cancer development that may also apply to other heterozygous homologous recombination signalling pathway gene {{mutations in}} hereditar...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} new {{installations}} of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is decreasing worldwide. Classical wire-guided AGVs often do not work cost-effectively and cannot fulfil the challenging requirements given by new organisational structures in production. In this paper {{an overview of the}} current situation in autonomous transport is given. To overcome the existing problems, the requirements and demands to the next generation of free-ranging vehicles are analysed. New profitable solutions are required. The approach described is based on studies and developments performed at IPA in the area of modular open system architecture for industrial motion control. An open control concept including innovative sensor and control functions is presented - e. g. the localisation of roughly positioned pallets. The paper includes major results of study as well as industrial expierences with a pilot installation of a prototype <b>fork</b> lift <b>carrier</b> at BMW, Munich, {{based on the results of}} EP 5292 MOSAIC...|$|R
