5|$|Henry I's successors did not {{consider}} the royal touch fundamental, reducing its application. The ritual remained a marginal aspect of kingship until the 17th century, when its appeal grew to unprecedented proportions and when <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> became an object of scrutiny in literature.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds nothing there. Then <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled {{in one corner of}} the room.|$|E
5|$|After {{saving the}} Mushroom Kingdom in Super Mario Bros. 3, {{brothers}} Mario and Luigi {{decide to go}} on holiday to a place called Dinosaur Land, where there are many types of dinosaurs. However, while resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. <b>It</b> <b>suddenly</b> hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who then tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas. Mario and Luigi soon realise {{that it must be}} the evil King Bowser and his Koopalings.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E

5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> collapsed, killing 13 people and {{injuring}} 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely {{cause of the}} collapse, noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along a line of rivets, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge {{at the time of}} the collapse contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E
5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E

5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. <b>It</b> <b>suddenly</b> acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Thảo was {{promoted}} to the post of chief of Bến Tre Province. He covertly worked with the cadres of Nguyễn Thị Định, a Vietcong leader who later became the highest ranking female communist in post-war reunified Vietnam. The area was a traditional communist stronghold, and anti-government attacks had increased in recent times, but <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> became peaceful when Thảo arrived. There were rumours that Thảo and the communists had decided to cease fighting for their mutual benefit; the guerrillas could quietly strengthen themselves, while Thảo {{would appear to be}} successful and he would be promoted to a more powerful position where he could cause more damage to Diệm. The lack of fighting between Thảo's forces and the Vietcong proved to beneficial to the communist cause. In a three-month period in 1963, the Vietcong were able to recruit 2,000 men in Bến Tre and formed two more battalions. Thảo was praised by the Ngô family and U.S. military advisors, unaware of his ruse. He received another promotion, and with it, more influence and contacts among the officer corps.|$|E
5|$|Natives {{incorporated}} the natural {{features of the}} ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual belief systems. Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting {{the course of the}} Connecticut River where <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> swings east in Middletown, Connecticut, after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating beaver who lived in a great lake that existed in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the Sleeping Giant, part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial Lake Hitchcock, extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear–sized beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, that lived at that time. Many features of the Metacomet Ridge region still bear names with Native American origins: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.|$|E

The CPUSA initially treated The Decline of American Capitalism sympathetically, placing a large order for the party's book store network, but {{in the fall of}} 1934 <b>it</b> <b>suddenly</b> was made the object of intense criticism, including a harsh serialized critique in the October and November 1934 issues of The Communist, the party's monthly theoretical magazine.|$|E
