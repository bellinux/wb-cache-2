One hundred twenty-three triads (target children, <b>friends,</b> <b>and</b> unacquainted peers) participated in a round-robin design during 4 th grade with partial replication during 5 th grade (N 112). Results indicated that children’s negative behavior, positive behavior, and play sophistication with <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> nonfriends were significantly different, but the effect sizes of these differences were typically small. SRM was used to divide children’s behavior with <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> nonfriends into three components: actor, partner, and relation- ship/error. The actor and partner effects significantly accounted for variance in children’s behavior with <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> nonfriends...|$|R
