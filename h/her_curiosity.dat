5|$|Ariel is {{kind and}} caring to others {{no matter what}} their circumstances, as {{depicted}} in the television series. In an early episode, Ariel helps an orphaned merboy who had fallen in with a bad crowd. In another episode, Ariel befriends a supposed bad luck creature and protects it from Ursula and other merfolk who wish it harm. Ariel appears as an adult in Return to the Sea and gives birth to a daughter named Melody, becoming the first, and currently, only, Disney princess to become a mother. Ariel is protective of her daughter, as Triton was of Ariel in the first film. After Morgana threatens Ariel and King Triton, Prince Eric and Ariel build a wall around the palace to protect Melody from Morgana and other terrors of the ocean. Although it protected her, it could not protect <b>her</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Ariel's Beginning depicts her personality {{as it was in the}} original film after Jodi Benson had advocated returning the character to her roots. Ariel is once again rebellious, and after her father decrees music to be banned in Atlantica she runs away with Sebastian and his band.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E
5|$|In {{their attempt}} to create a world where humans and Tayutai can peacefully coexist, Yuri and Mashiro battle the members of the Three Mightiest in a successive, {{nonlinear}} order determined by the player's decisions. In one scenario, Nue, a young female Tayutai, begins to steal undergarments from the Flawless dormitories due to <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> in them. She is defeated by Mashiro and Mifuyu Kisaragi, and finds herself befriended by Mifuyu, who later begins {{to take care of her}} as a guardian. Yumina Takanashi, Yuri's stepsister, also begins to take care of Hou, an exhausted bird Tayutai who begins to nest on Yumina's head. Yumina is later attacked by Ou, another Tayutai who makes up the Houou couple with Hou, before the couple reconciles with the help of Yuri and Mashiro. Lastly, Ameri allies herself with Ouryu, the last of the Three Mightiest, out of jealousy from the amount of attention Mashiro receives from Yuri. After Ameri reconciles with Yuri, Ouryu agrees to stop attacking humans, and acknowledges Mashiro's goal.|$|E

25|$|Her {{personality}} was characterised by energy, intellect, and a {{thirst for}} adventure which shaped her path in life. Her grandfather was the ironmaster Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, an industrialist and a Liberal Member of Parliament, in Benjamin Disraeli's second term. His role in British policy-making exposed Gertrude {{at a young}} age to international matters and most likely encouraged <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> for the world, and her later involvement in international politics.|$|E
25|$|After dinner, Belle gets {{a tour of}} {{the castle}} {{courtesy}} of Cogsworth and Lumière, <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> leads her to enter the West Wing, a place the Beast told her was forbidden. Mesmerized by a mysterious rose floating in a bell jar, she reaches out to touch it but before she can, the Beast stops her and orders her to get out accidentally shoving her in the process. Fearing for her life, Belle flees from the castle. Realizing his deadly mistake, the Beast knows he will be a monster forever if he cannot learn to love her ("If I Can't Love Her").|$|E

25|$|Following a brief courtship, Elyot and Sybil are honeymooning at an {{hotel in}} Deauville, {{although}} <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> about {{his first marriage}} is not helping his romantic mood. In the adjoining suite, Amanda and Victor are starting their new life together, although he cannot stop thinking of the cruelty Amanda's ex-husband displayed towards her. Elyot and Amanda, following a volatile three-year-long marriage, have been divorced {{for the past five}} years, but they now discover that they are sharing a terrace while on their honeymoons with their new and younger spouses. Elyot and Amanda separately beg their new spouses to leave the hotel with them immediately, but both new spouses refuse to co-operate and each storms off to dine alone. Realising they still love each other and regretting having divorced, Elyot and Amanda abandon their spouses and run off together to Amanda's flat in Paris.|$|E
500|$|According to Clash and Gikow, Elmo's pet {{goldfish}} Dorothy and {{the members}} of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo to do all the talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. [...] Dorothy's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and <b>her</b> <b>curiosity,</b> which was created and enhanced by Elmo's imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards.|$|E
500|$|In DC's Free Comic Book Day 2012 offering, The New 52 Free Comic Book Day Special Edition #1, Pandora, the Phantom Stranger and the Question's punishments {{before the}} Council of Eternity were shown, {{as well as}} a final image foreshadowing the coming [...] "Trinity War". Back in the present, Pandora is seen in A.R.G.U.S.'s Black Room (where magical {{artifacts}} are kept) to retrieve her box. The back up to Justice League #0 shows Pandora trying to open her box. She fails and is approached by the Wizard from the Council of Eternity. He tells her that he has given up his power (to Billy Batson) and that the Circle were wrong to punish Pandora for <b>her</b> <b>curiosity.</b> He tells her only the purest or darkest of heart can open the box.|$|E

500|$|Allison Mack characterizes Chloe {{as being}} a [...] "misfit" [...] during the first season; more of [...] "a really smart girl with attitude". She goes on to {{describe}} Chloe as intelligent and independent. Another of Chloe's defining characteristics is her need to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and find the truth in every situation. The character is curious, and wants {{to be honest with}} people. She is always {{trying to make sense of}} the situation. Next to <b>her</b> <b>curiosity,</b> her impulsiveness is a key characteristic that eventually leaves her under the control of Lionel Luthor, when she offers to uncover information on Clark for Lionel. The reason for this betrayal is based on Chloe's love for Clark. As Allison Mack explains, Chloe is so blinded by her love for Clark that she neglects to see all of the mistakes that he makes. It is this unrequited love for Clark that [...] "drives [...] to be as ambitious and as focused as she is".|$|E
500|$|A major motif present {{throughout}} {{the game is}} that [...] "life goes on". A scene {{near the end of}} the game, in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, is referenced by many journalists as the denouement of this motif. Concept artist John Sweeney wrote that the scene was designed to [...] "reignite [...] lust for life", triggering <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> and forgetting the surrounding struggle and death. He explained that the scene originally involved zebras, but were replaced by giraffes due to their gentleness and elegance, stating that they were [...] "the most remarkable thing Ellie could possibly encounter". Druckmann felt that the sequence [...] "works because of all the horrible things" [...] encountered beforehand. IGN's Lucy O'Brien wrote that the scene acts as a reminder of Ellie's age, despite having been outwardly [...] "stripped of any semblance of a childhood", and Kotaku writer Kirk Hamilton found the scene to be a resemblance of hope for Ellie, having clearly suffered post-traumatic stress following her encounter with David.|$|E
500|$|Several of the episode's {{scenes and}} motifs have been {{compared}} to popular myths and legends. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, equated Mulder's overall quest {{to that of the}} search for the Holy Grail. She notes that in [...] "The Truth", Mulder and Scully metaphorically [...] "find their way to the Grail castle" [...] only to discover that the Fisher King—the wounded knight charged with protecting the secret—is actually The Smoking Man. Furthermore, Bush compared the final scene of the episode—featuring Mulder musing about hope regarding an alien invasion—to the myth of Pandora's Box. According to legend, the ancient Greek gods gave Pandora a box filled with evils and told her not to open it. Due to <b>her</b> <b>curiosity,</b> she disobeyed and unleashed various calamities unto the world. Bush argues that the Syndicate's tampering with alien technology—such as their alien-human hybrid experiments—are similar to the contents of the box. She notes that, in both cases, [...] "man's curiosity is his downfall". In the end, however, both Pandora's box and the world of The X-Files contain hope, which, in the legend, was the only thing in the box that Pandora did not let go of.|$|E

500|$|Jordan confides in Nick {{that the}} only reason Gatsby bought the mansion is because it was across the bay from Tom and Daisy's home, and that Gatsby's extravagant {{lifestyle}} and wild parties were an attempt to impress Daisy and raise <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> about her [...] "anonymous" [...] neighbor across the bay. Gatsby had hoped that one day curiosity would have brought the unsuspecting Daisy to appear at his doorstep, and thereby he'd be able to present himself as a [...] "new man", now of wealth and position, and now able to join her at her side and within her world. That however never played out, and although Tom had been invited (as a guest of Jordan's) to a Gatsby party and had attended more than one of them, both he and Daisy had (for different reasons) never responded affirmatively to an RSVP to attend as the Buchanans (Mr. and Mrs.). The deeper reasons behind this fact are expanded upon later in the story by Daisy. His research of Nick, who has so fortuitously rented the small cottage next door to Gatsby's mansion, results in a wholly new approach to his problem of how to introduce Daisy to the [...] "new" [...] J. Gatsby.|$|E
500|$|Samus {{has been}} well {{received}} by the video game community. In 2001, IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters. She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website's users, the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie, especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates. Among their list of voted characters, IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that [...] "could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage {{to live up to}} the source material." [...] Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs [...] "Character Battle" [...] contests, winning the [...] "Character Battle V" [...] in 2006. In 2009, GameSpot featured her in their poll [...] "All-Time Greatest Game Hero", in which she lost to Mario in the semi-finals. Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the Metroid series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in <b>her</b> <b>curiosity.</b> The book Videogames and Art noted that in the original Metroid the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that they have with the character is by being her through gameplay, while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, [...] "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," [...] referring to the revelation that she is a woman. MMA and actress Ronda Rousey told GameSpot in a 2016 interview that she [...] "always wanted to be Samus" [...] if a live-action Metroid film is made.|$|E
2500|$|Outside school, {{the young}} man was still introverted, and, Sandqvist notes, [...] "extremely shy, {{especially}} with girls." [...] Ciprian recalls Ciriviș's engrossing pick-up lines: he acted familiar to any young woman who caught his eye, assuring her that they had met once before, and, having stirred <b>her</b> <b>curiosity,</b> falsely recounting how they both used to kill flesh-flies for sport.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2008, {{she joined}} Carrie Underwood, a long-time {{vegetarian}}, in giving up eating meat. Pickler says she first {{decided to go}} vegetarian for health reasons, but a TV ad that vegetarian Pamela Anderson did for animal rights group PETA piqued <b>her</b> <b>curiosity.</b> [...] "One night I couldn't sleep and I was up and just Googling random stuff and I'm like, 'Hmmm, PETA.' I saw all the videos and I {{just thought it was}} horrible. It's animal cruelty. A {{lot of it has to}} do with knowing what happens to the animals and it really bothered me and so I will not eat meat." [...] In May 2009, it was announced that Pickler was nominated for, and won, the title of [...] "World's Sexiest Vegetarian" [...] by PETA.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sexuality}} of {{the character}} was also questioned following her introduction. The character built up a fanbase among the LGBT community which resulted in an online petition to have her revealed as a lesbian. It was pointed out in The Scotsman that the series avoided any [...] "lesbian subtext" [...] between Seven and Janeway because the series {{was intended to be}} seen as [...] "family-friendly". The approach by Harry Kim at one point, to which she suggested that he should disrobe in order to [...] "copulate", was suggested to be because of <b>her</b> <b>curiosity</b> about human mating practices rather than any traditional sense of attraction. The introduction of Seven on the series had subsequent effects on the series , as T'Pol (played by Jolene Blalock) was based on a combination of the Seven character and Leonard Nimoy's original Spock.|$|E
