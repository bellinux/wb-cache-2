40|$|Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is a shrub {{native to}} Paraguay now a {{commercial}} {{source of the}} natural and non-calorific sweeteners of the steviol glycoside class. In stevia leaves, stevioside and rebaudioside A are the major steviol glycosides (SGs), occurring at about 10 and 3 - 5 % of the leaf dw respectively. The large amount stored in the stevia leaves is interesting from an ecological perspective considering that the biosynthesis of SGs results from the up-regulation of a biosynthetic pathway shared with gibberellic acid (GA). The disparity in typical amount of GA (1. 2 µg. kg- 1 leaf fw) and SGs (10 % leaf dw) in a leaf suggests a biochemical investment in SG synthesis which merits an eco-physiological role within the stevia plant. This thesis hopes to initiate this research area by looking at possible physiological roles in carbon storage, osmoregulation, mammalian herbivory and insect deterrence. The role of stevioside and rebaudioside A in carbon storage and osmoregulation was not observed given the relatively stable leaf concentration which was unresponsive to short periods of light and water treatments. Rather change in stevioside and rebaudioside A leaf concentration was gradual and related to the leaf and plant ontogeny with the highest leaf concentration occurring in the top immature leaves. It seems that synthesis occurs mostly in top young leaves with the SGs stored until leaf aging. The build-up of SGs seems to be ecologically beneficial with observed deterrence towards the generalist insect, Valanga irregularis, a grasshopper native to Australia. The leaves also encouraged general mammalian herbivory with the domestic guinea pigs, Cavia porcellus, with possible application in animal feed fortification. Complementary to the ecophysiological investigations, methods for quantification of stevioside and rebaudioside A have also been developed with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) as the main reference method. Quick analytical methods with minimal sample preparation were also developed for possible estimation of stevioside and rebaudioside A in field application. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRs) was found useful for estimating {{the total amount of}} stevioside and rebaudioside A in dry ground leaves (R = 0. 87, RMSECV = 1. 63). Potential transfer of the NIRs method to a <b>handheld</b> <b>equipment</b> would find commercial use in quality assessment of leaf harvests managed by stevia manufacturers. Anthrone colorimetry was also useful in measuring the amount of stevioside and rebaudioside A in solution (up to 0. 06 µmol with R 2 = 0. 993 and RMSEC = 0. 002 µmol for stevioside and R 2 = 0. 996, RMSEC = 0. 002 µmol for rebaudioside A) and would be useful in quick estimates of liquids containing the sweetener such as beverage application...|$|E
40|$|Production {{of plants}} under glass {{is in many}} cases {{regarded}} as a closed production system, where input and output flow are known and under control. Plant Protection Products (PPP) are also viewed {{as part of this}} closed system. A recent Norwegian study reported residues of PPP in waterways downstream from greenhouse operations, thus indicating that leaching from closed systems can be a problem. To be able to develop measurement methods and models that predict leach rates and in order to do something about possible problems, it is important to identify the production activities that could be potential sources of leaching, both as point sources and as diffuse leaching. The objective of the investigation was to produce knowledge on different work site operations that would make it possible to estimate the potential leaching of PPPs to soil and water. A literature survey found limited research activity on these topics, with a few reports on mathematical modelling of leaching. Other, more applied reports, expressed a general view that application technology in the greenhouse industry was old-fashioned, with unnecessary high liquid volume application rates. Data on work operations were collected through interviews and observations in about 30 greenhouse companies, representing modern, Swedish greenhouse production. Statistics reported by the Swedish Chemicals Agency does not allow separation of PPP use between horticultural field and under-glass production, or into horticultural sub-branches. Greenhouse application technology is dominated by <b>handheld</b> <b>equipment,</b> high liquid rates and high pressure spraying. The most important exceptions are a ‘spray robot’ used in vegetables and cold foggers, used in all types of production. Both types imply reduced operator exposure to PPPs. Cold fogging has, furthermore, the advantage of using lower liquid rates. In some production systems, the PPPs are distributed through irrigation systems. The design of the irrigation system has a large impact on how surplus liquid is treated, i. e. recycled or dumped down a drain. In many cases today, recirculation systems are introduced; a system that minimises the losses to the ground. In the report, potential risk situations are described, both regarding point sources and diffuse spreading. Greenhouses have limited areas with biological active soil, which could break down the PPPs; instead greenhouses have inert materials and concrete surfaces with high pH. This influences the speed of the chemical degradation. A summary of the most important risks for polluting soil and water is described, both regarding point sources and diffuse spreading. Situation examples describe risks through point sources, related to handling, measuring, transport of measured out, concentrated PPP, etc. Simultaneously, examples are given on greenhouse operations where these risks are minimised through carefully designed systems, including suitable routines and equipment. The risks in the diffuse spreading are associated with the mixing of PPPs into irrigation systems, in combination with an uncontrolled discharge of surplus water. Recirculation systems provide the optimum closed system practice and ensure a very high level against leaching in production under glass. This type of irrigation is increasing in the industry...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary Numerous {{initiatives}} that are policy driven by national, European and global agencies target {{the preservation of}} our environment, human society’s health and our ecology. Ireland’s EPA 2020 Vision outlines a mandate {{to prepare for the}} unavoidable impact of climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the control of air-emissions standards, the sustainable use of resources and the holding to account of those who flout environmental laws. These strategies are echoed in the Europe 2020 : Resource-efficient Europe Flagship Initiative, which also advocates the creation of new opportunities for economic growth and greater innovation. The promotion of research and technical development is central to each of these strategies – specifically the achievement of accurate environmental monitoring technologies that will inform policy-makers and effect change. This is described in the EPA Strategic Plan 2013 – 2015 as the provision of ‘high quality, targeted and timely environmental data, information and assessment to inform decision making at all levels’. Specific to landfills, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Focus on Landfilling in Ireland stipulates the management of landfill gas to eliminate environmental harm and public nuisance, to promote energy generation where possible and to avoid liabilities in site closure and aftercare. It was in this context that the EPA STRIVE programme granted funding for this research project on developing autonomous sensor platforms for the real-time monitoring of gases generated in landfill facilities. Managing landfill gas is one of the crucial operations in a landfill facility, where gases (primarily methane [CH 4] and carbon dioxide [CO 2] generated from the decomposition of biodegradable waste) are extracted and combusted in a flare or preferably an engine (as biogas fuel). These gases, classified as greenhouse gases (GHGs), also pose localised hazards due to fire risk and asphyxiation, and are indicative of odorous nuisance compounds. Gas-monitoring on site is conducted to (i) ensure against gas migration into the local environment and to (ii) maintain the thorough gas extraction and optimum composition for combustion. This is becoming more relevant because of the numerous landfill closures brought by Europe-wide changes in waste-management policy. Even for landfills no longer actively receiving waste, substantial gas generation remains ongoing for years and even decades. Despite diminished financial resources and reduced manpower, management of this gas must be maintained. Traditionally, monitoring involves taking manual measurements using expensive <b>handheld</b> <b>equipment</b> and requiring laborious travel over difficult and expansive terrain. Consequently, it is conducted relatively infrequently – typically once a month. These issues can be addressed by adopting distributed continuous monitoring systems. These low-cost remotely deployable sensor platforms offer a valuable complementary service to operators and the EPA. They enable easier adherence to their licence criteria, the prevention of expensive remediation measures and the potential boost in revenue from increasing energy production through the use of biogas. Challenges arise in terms of achieving a long-term monitoring performance in a harsh environment while maintaining accuracy, reliability and cost-effectiveness. To meet these challenges, this project developed cost- effective autonomous sensor platforms to allow long- term continuous monitoring of gas composition (methane and carbon dioxide) and extraction pressure. The project’s work represents one of the only developments of autonomous sensor technology in this space; the few other market alternatives tend to be expensive or difficult to implement for remotely deployable continuous monitoring. Beyond the development of a platform technology, the challenge was to apply this technology to the adverse environmental conditions. The project delivered a total of 14 autonomous sensor platforms in deployments involving Irish landfill sites, a Scottish landfill site and a Brazilian wastewater treatment plant. The analysis and interpretation of acquired data, coupled with local meteorological data and on-site operational data, provided the translation from raw environmental data to meaningful conclusions that could inform decision-making. This report presents a number of case studies to illustrate this. Characteristics of site gas dynamics could be identified; for example, it was possible to show if excessive gas concentrations in a perimeter well could be resolved by increasing the flare extraction rate for a particular well. Furthermore, the potential for quantifying methane generation potential at distributed locations within the landfill was identified in addition to diagnosing the effectiveness of the extraction network – hence aiding in field-balancing and landfill gas utilisation. The extensive wealth of data enabled by this platform technology will help better-informed decision-making and improve operational practices in managing gas emissions. In landfills, this signifies alleviating gas migration with perimeter monitoring and enhancing flare/ engine operation by evaluating gas quality at distributed locations within the gas field. While landfilling is becoming outmoded as a waste-management process, the need for continuous monitoring will be relevant for many years to come. Indeed, a number of existing facilities are considering retrofitting engines because of the significant potential for additional landfill gas utilisation being identified by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland in 2010. Furthermore, the technology’s low-cost and autonomous nature would benefit the hundreds of historical and legacy landfills if any were deemed to be problematic in terms of their environmental impact. Beyond landfills, this work pertains to other applications within the waste sector, as demonstrated by measuring emissions from wastewater treatment plant lagoons. With some further development, this technology could apply to efforts in dealing with climate change (e. g. in evaluating GHG inventories), where applications include managed peatlands (one case study is presented in this report and future efforts could also be targeted at carbon sinks/storage) and agriculture (Ireland’s greatest contributor to GHGs). Further scope could also be pursued in air-quality monitoring, particularly relevant at present with 2013 being dubbed the ‘Year of Air’ by European leaders. Throughout this project, the commercial prospect of this technology was affirmed with positive feedback from landfill operators, environmental regulators and private consultancies. Continual technical developments and refinements in mechanical/electronic design delivered a platform with expanded functionality and reduced price-point, thus becoming more viable for scaled-up deployments and commercial feasibility. Ultimately, this innovative development shows good promise as a high-potential commercial venture, with this work continuing under Enterprise Ireland’s Commercialisation Fund...|$|E

40|$|Low-power, high-performance, space-efficient {{amplifiers}} and comparators offer design flexibility {{for consumer}} <b>equipment</b> In <b>handheld</b> consumer <b>equipment,</b> size and power consumption are of critical importance. This is true both for end products and each internal component. Consumers today also expect mobile devices to get progressively smaller and thinner, {{all the while}} supporting more functionality and longer operation. Knowing this, Maxim has designed a broad portfolio of small ICs that offer the versatility and low power so paramount for today’s consumer designs. Current monitoring Current-sense amplifiers (CSAs) are used {{in a variety of}} applications in handheld devices. CSAs monitor a battery’s current to estimate battery life, determine system's state of health, or, less commonly, monitor solar cell efficiency. In other designs, CSAs provide overcurrent protection and identify unexpected fault conditions, such as opens or shorts. Handheld consumer devices are characterized by their small form factors and limited battery life. It is n...|$|R
