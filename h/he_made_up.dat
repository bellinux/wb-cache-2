5|$|Batik was {{mentioned}} in the 17th century Malay Annals. The legend goes when Laksamana Hang Nadim was ordered by Malacca King, Sultan Mahmud, to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of serasah cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his own. On his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E
5|$|Windle later {{combined}} with Wood, Ryan and Dickson in the 4×200m freestyle relay final. Having rested their two individual medalists—Wood and Windle—in the heats, Australia struggled to fourth place {{and were the}} slowest qualifier for the final. In the decider, Australia were fourth when Windle dived in for the anchor leg, 3.7s behind the third-placed Japan. Windle posted a time of 1min 58.7s, the sixth fastest split in the race and the fastest Australian leg by 3.0s. Although <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> 1.8s on the Japanese anchor swimmer, {{it was not enough}} and Australia finished fourth, 1.9s out of the medals.|$|E

5|$|After {{catching}} {{very few}} passes {{in high school}} and college, Berry was drafted in the 20th round of the 1954 NFL Draft by the Colts and was considered a long shot to even make the team's roster. Diminutive and unassuming, his subsequent rise to the Pro Football Hall of Fame has been touted as one of American football's Cinderella stories. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for his lack of athleticism through rigorous practice and attention to detail, and was known for his near-perfect route running and sure handedness. Berry was a favorite target of quarterback Johnny Unitas, and the two were regarded as the dominant passing and receiving duo of their era.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized {{that he would have to}} go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki {{had wanted}} to produce a new film for years, but his two {{previous}} proposals (one based on the Japanese book Kirino Mukouno Fushigina Machi, and another about a teenage heroine) were rejected. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming Sen and Chihiro Spirited Away, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, {{and there was a}} small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of Spirited Away.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E
5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself {{before making a}} final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the}} law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E

6000|$|DAISY. Oh, I {{know his}} obstinacy. When <b>he's</b> once <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind--[Contemptuously.]--he {{prides himself on}} his firmness. Oh, what shall I do? ...|$|R

5|$|When {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Yamaha could not develop a dirt track motorcycle capable of competing with the dominant Harley-Davidson dirt track team, the American Yamaha importer, Yamaha USA, offered to send Roberts to Europe in 1978 to compete in the World Championship Grand Prix road racing series, along with Kel Carruthers to act as his mentor and crew chief. Roberts also secured the financial backing of the Goodyear tire company. The team planned to compete in the 250cc world championship as well as the Formula 750 series in order to have more practice time to learn the tracks, but their main focus would be on the 500cc class, considered the premier class at the time. His main competition in the 500cc world championship would come from Suzuki rider Barry Sheene, winner of the two previous titles. Roberts said that he was initially indifferent about competing in Europe, but when he read that Sheene had labeled him as"no threat", <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind to compete. Few observers gave Roberts any chance of winning the championship, citing the reasoning that it would take him at least one season to learn the European circuits.|$|E

25|$|He {{reached the}} top makuuchi {{division}} in June 1947. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for his lack of size by showing superb technique. He won no fewer than nine special prizes for Technique, and it was even suggested that the prize had been created especially for him. Tochinishiki {{was known as the}} Mamushi (Viper) due to his tenacity once he grabbed hold of his opponent's mawashi.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} Montoya {{suffered}} even more from oversteer {{than he had}} at Williams. On several occasions he spun during practice. More seriously he spun in his return from injury at the Spanish Grand Prix and most notoriously at the last corner during qualifying for the German Grand Prix. On that occasion <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for it by climbing from 20th to 8th after the first two corners eventually finishing in a respectable 2nd.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't until Prefontaine read {{a letter}} from Bill Bowerman that <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> his mind to attend the University of Oregon. Bowerman wrote that he was certain Prefontaine would become the world's {{greatest}} distance runner if he decided to run at Oregon. Although {{it was an odd}} promise, Prefontaine was up for the challenge. Sometime after Prefontaine announced that he signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Oregon on the first of May in 1969, Bowerman wrote a letter addressed to the community of Coos Bay describing his appreciation for their role in helping Steve become a great runner.|$|E

25|$|Round 5 was the Spanish Grand Prix and Montoya {{needed a}} good result {{but did not}} look like getting it, so, after another poor qualifying, Montoya found himself down in 12th place. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for it by making a quick start by gaining five places and was up to sixth in the first corner (David Coulthard was {{starting}} {{from the back of the}} grid after stalling on the formation lap). He got ahead of Jacques Villeneuve in the second round of pit stops. He stayed on the track and climbed up to second due to a high attrition rate.|$|E
25|$|On 2 July 2013, McGregor {{signed for}} Hull City for £1.5 million, signing a three-year contract. He made his debut {{on the first}} day of the 2013–14 season in a 2–0 loss away at Chelsea. Five minutes into his debut, McGregor conceded a penalty, mistiming a punch and {{subsequently}} hitting Fernando Torres in the head. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> for it however, as he saved the resulting penalty from Frank Lampard. In the 25th minute, Lampard got the better of him, scoring a free-kick from 30 yards. On 17 May 2014, he played in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, in which Hull City lost 3–2.|$|E
25|$|Before turning 17, Christiansen {{had made}} a clean sweep at the Junior Norwegian Championships in his age group, winning four gold medals, and he won the Norwegian Biathlon Cup (Norgescupen) in his age category, called the Statkraft Junior Cup, overall. He had also won two golds in the Junior Norwegian Summer Biathlon Championships in September 2008, in the 17-year-olds age group. At {{the end of the}} 2008–09 season, Christiansen {{participate}}d in the 2009 Norwegian Biathlon Championships. He did not participate in the 20km individual, but finished 17th in the sprint and 8th in the pursuit. This caused Christiansen to be selected for the first team of Buskerud alongside Christian Georg Bache, Frode Andresen and Ole Einar Bjørndalen. Though he incurred a penalty loop, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> two places over his leg, and good work by Andresen and Bjørndalen secured the gold.|$|E
