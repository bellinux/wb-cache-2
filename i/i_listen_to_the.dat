500|$|During {{her first}} {{performance}} since the Uh Huh Her tour at the Hay Festival of Literature & Arts on 26 May 2006, Harvey revealed that her next studio album {{would be almost}} entirely piano-based. Following the October release of The Peel Sessions 1991–2004, a compilation of songs recorded from 1991 to 2000 during her radio sessions with John Peel, she began recording her seventh studio album White Chalk in November, together with Flood, John Parish, and Eric Drew Feldman in a studio in West London. White Chalk was released in September 2007 and marked {{a radical departure from}} her usual alternative rock style, consisting mainly of piano ballads. The album received favourable reviews, its style being described by one critic as containing [...] "pseudo-Victorian elements—drama, restraint, and antiquated instruments and sounds." [...] Harvey herself said of the album: [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> record I feel in a different universe, really, and I'm not sure whether it's in the past or in the future. The record confuses me, that's what I like—it doesn't feel of this time right now, but I'm not sure whether it's 100 years ago or 100 years in the future", summing up the album's sound as [...] "really weird." [...] During the tour for the album Harvey performed without a backing band, and also began performing on an autoharp, which continues to be her primary instrument after guitar and has influenced her material since White Chalk.|$|E

As New York Times writer Sisario explained, he preferred the moniker of [...] "bluesologist". Referring to reviews of his last album and references {{to him as the}} [...] "godfather of rap", Scott-Heron said: [...] "It's something that's aimed at the kids ... I have kids, so I listen to it. But I would not say it's aimed at me. <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jazz station." [...] In 2013, Chattanooga rapper Isaiah Rashad recorded an unofficial mixtape called Pieces of a Kid, which was greatly influenced by Heron's debut album Pieces of a Man.|$|E

The situation led to the composition of his favourite cut on One Day... that offers a male slant on abortion. [...] "Retrospect for Life", produced by James Poyser and No I.D. featuring Lauryn Hill (who was due on the same day as Rashid's girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project. Rashid listens to [...] "Retrospect for Life" [...] today at the mastering session geeked, as if it were for the first time.

2500|$|Asquith {{had opposed}} votes for women {{as early as}} 1882, and he {{remained}} well known as an adversary throughout his time as prime minister. He took a detached view of the women's suffrage question, believing it should be judged on whether extending the franchise would improve the system of government, {{rather than as a}} question of rights. He did not understand—Jenkins ascribed it to a failure of imagination—why passions were raised on both sides over the issue. He told the House of Commons in 1913, while complaining of the [...] "exaggerated language" [...] on both sides, [...] "I am sometimes tempted to think, as one listens to the arguments of supporters of women's suffrage, that there is nothing to be said for it, and I am sometimes tempted to think, as <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arguments of the opponents of women's suffrage, that there is nothing to be said against it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like It Like That is {{an album}} of {{original}} soul music influenced by Sebastian's previous album, The Memphis Album, which was a covers album of Memphis soul songs recorded with members of The MGs including Steve Cropper in Memphis in 2007. Sebastian and Cropper remained friends, and Sebastian made several songwriting trips to Nashville in mid-2008, staying with the Croppers on these trips. Sebastian {{said in an interview}} with The Age in October 2009, [...] "The most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted me to make a record like this one." [...] Five of the songs on Like It Like That were co-written with the album's producer David Ryan Harris, four were written entirely by Sebastian himself, and three were co-written with other writers. He later said, [...] "I wrote the music on this album based on how I feel when <b>I</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Otis Reddings and the Wilson Picketts of the world. I'll put that music on and it always just lifts me and makes me feel great." ...|$|E
