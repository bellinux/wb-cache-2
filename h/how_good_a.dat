25|$|From 1997 to 2001, {{countries}} {{qualified for}} each contest {{based on the}} average of their points totals for their entries over the previous five years. However, there was much discontent voiced over this system because a country could be excluded merely because of poor previous results, which did {{not take into account}} <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> fresh attempt might be. This led the EBU to create what was hoped would be a more permanent solution to the problem. A qualification round, known as the semi-final, was introduced for the 2004 Contest. This semi-final was held on the Wednesday during Eurovision Week, and was a programme similar in format to the grand final, whose time slot remained 19:00 UTC on the Saturday. The highest-placed songs from the semi-final qualified for the grand final, while the lower-placed songs were eliminated. From 2005 to 2007, the semi-final programme was held on the Thursday of Eurovision Week. In these two shows there was enough time to include all the countries who wished to participate.|$|E
500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments {{with the thought of}} giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> new song is." ...|$|E

By contrast, informational processes are [...] observer-relative: observers pick out certain patterns in the world and consider them information processes, but information processes are not things-in-the-world themselves. Since they do not exist at a physical level, Searle argues, they cannot have causal efficacy and thus cannot cause consciousness. There is no physical law, Searle insists, that can see the equivalence between a personal computer, a series of ping-pong balls and beer cans, and a pipe-and-water system all implementing the same program.|$|E

[...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard said in 2011, [...] "I don't care <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>a</b> writer you are: If you subtract your three strongest characters from your tale, you severely undermine the basis for why readers fell under your spell in the first place. It didn't work. But there was also a sense in A Feast of Crows that Martin had lost his way. The characters whose stories he did tell wandered back and forth across a landscape devastated by war and oncoming winter, but didn't seem to be headed anywhere in particular." [...] Remy Verhoeve of The Huffington Post noted in their 2011 A Dance with Dragons review that the fifth volume had to [...] "repair some of the damage done by A Feast for Crows, which frankly felt as if it was written by a ghost writer at times." [...] Both books had [...] "the same structural problems", being [...] "sprawling and incoherent", and in her opinion Feast has the less interesting characters.

30|$|Thus, {{to solve}} these general issues, {{particularly}} when computers need to decide autonomously <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>an</b> enhanced image is, researchers have recently proposed methods based on evolutionary computation and metaheuristic optimization algorithms [21]. Metaheuristic algorithms are generally used to finding solutions involving non-linear optimization tasks.

They used an evaluation function (EF) to select automatically the most appropriate enhanced image without requiring human intervention. Thus, they proposed a novel EF and an evolutionary algorithm to globally search for the best enhanced image from among a solution space of candidate-enhanced images.|$|R
