5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two <b>exposed</b> <b>wire</b> ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E

40|$|Determination of {{the initial}} {{exothermic}} reaction of shredded tyres with wire content This paper presents the cause of exothermic reactions in shredded tyre with <b>exposed</b> <b>wire</b> content in shredded tyre piles. Data indicate that the oxidation of exposed steel wires is the exothermic reaction in shredded tyre embankments. This would lead to spontaneous combustion. Reaction of the steel with the sulphur or the carbon black appears {{not to be the}} source of the exothermic. Laboratory tests have been conducted to determine the heat transfer properties of the materials that compose tyres (i. e., tyre rubber and wires) by using a hot-plate apparatus. In addition, one-dimensional heat conduction experiments were conducted to compare the flow of heat through the materials while varying the physical and environmental conditions. The physical condi-tions were the size of tyre shred, water content, and wire con-tents. An exothermic reaction occurred when <b>exposed</b> <b>wire</b> was present but not when it was absent. A one-dimensional heat transfer equation was developed, and parametric studies were conducted to verify the laboratory model. Exothermic reaction was found to increase linearly with temperature, size and shape of the shredded tyres, density, amount of wire in shredded tyres, and water content...|$|E

30|$|A {{method to}} attach Hall {{electrodes}} {{on opposite sides}} of an individual bismuth nanowire encased in a quartz template was demonstrated using polishing, FIB processing, and carbon deposition. An accelerated Ga ion beam was used to detect the position of the nanowire in the quartz template without exposure. The quartz component covering the nanowire was then successfully removed with the Ga ion beam to locally expose the opposite side surfaces of the nanowire. Carbon thin films were then deposited in situ on the <b>exposed</b> <b>wire</b> surfaces to form electrical contacts, while avoiding oxidation of the nanowire. EDX analysis of the processed area indicated that the bismuth component remained after FIB processing.|$|E
40|$|Analytical, {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} analyses {{have been performed}} to investigate the effects of thermocouple wire electrical insulation on the temperature measurement of a reference surface. Two diameters of type K thermocouple, 80 μm and 200 μm, with different <b>exposed</b> <b>wire</b> lengths (0 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm) were used to measure various surface temperatures (4 °C, 8 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C and 35 °C). Measurements were made with the thermocouple {{in direct contact with}} the surface, with wires extending vertically and exposed to natural convection. Analytical results of the thermocouple wire with insulation confirm that there is no specific value for the critical radius and the rate of heat flux around the thermocouple wire continuously increases with the wire diameter even when this is larger than the critical radius. Numerical simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics software also confirms that there is negligible thermal effect from the electrical insulation. Moreover, the experimental results agree well with those obtained by both the analytical and numerical methods and further confirm that the diameter of the thermocouple has an impact on the temperature measurement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of two hypervelocity impact failure risk assessments for critical wire bundles exposed aboard the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS- 1) to an increased orbital debris environment at its 824 km, 98. 8 deg inclination orbit. The first “generic” approach predicted the number of wires broken by orbital debris ejecta emerging from normal impact with multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering 36, 18, and 6 strand wire bundles at a 5 cm standoff using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code. This approach also included a mathematical approach for computing the probability that redundant wires were severed within the bundle. Based in part on the high computed risk of a critical wire bundle failure from the generic approach, an enhanced orbital debris protection design was examined, consisting of betacloth-reinforced MLI suspended at a 5 cm standoff over a seven layer betacloth and Kevlar blanket, draped over the <b>exposed</b> <b>wire</b> bundles. A second SPH-based risk assessment was conducted that also included the beneficial effects from the high (75 degree) obliquity of orbital debris impact owing to the flight orientation of the exposed wiring and shadowing by other spacecraft components. These factors resulted in a considerably reduced likelihood of critical wire bundle failure compared to the original baseline design with normal impacts and no shadowing...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Recent {{studies in}} epilepsy, cognition, and brain machine {{interfaces}} {{have shown the}} utility of recording intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) with greater spatial resolution. Many of these studies utilize microelectrodes connected to specialized amplifiers that are optimized for such recordings. We recently measured the impedances of several commercial microelectrodes and demonstrated that they will distort iEEG signals if connected to clinical EEG amplifiers commonly used in most centers. In this study we demonstrate the clinical implications of this effect and identify some of the potential difficulties in using microelectrodes. Methods: Human iEEG data were digitally filtered to simulate the signal recorded by a hybrid grid (two macroelectrodes and eight microelectrodes) connected to a standard EEG amplifier. The filtered iEEG data were read by three trained epileptologists, and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) were detected with a well-known algorithm. The filtering method was verified experimentally by recording an injected EEG signal in a saline bath with the same physical acquisition system used to generate the model. Several electrodes underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Key Findings: Macroelectrode recordings were unaltered compared to the source iEEG signal, but microelectrodes attenuated low frequencies. The attenuated signals were difficult to interpret: all three clinicians changed their clinical scoring of slowing and seizures when presented with the same data recorded on different sized electrodes. The HFO detection algorithm was oversensitive with microelectrodes, classifying many more HFOs than when the same data were recorded with macroelectrodes. In addition, during experimental recordings the microelectrodes produced much greater noise as well as large baseline fluctuations, creating sharply contoured transients, and superimposed “false” HFOs. SEM of these microelectrodes demonstrated marked variability in exposed electrode surface area, lead fractures, and sharp edges. Significance: Microelectrodes {{should not be used}} with low impedance (< 1 GΩ) amplifiers due to severe signal attenuation and variability that changes clinical interpretations. The current method of preparing microelectrodes can leave sharp edges and nonuniform amounts of <b>exposed</b> <b>wire.</b> Even when recorded with higher impedance amplifiers, microelectrode data are highly prone to artifacts that are difficult to interpret. Great care must be taken when analyzing iEEG from high impedance microelectrodes...|$|E
