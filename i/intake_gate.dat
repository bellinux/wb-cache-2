The case study was upstream of three subwatersheds in Central Java Indonesia, named Samba, Soka, and Pusur Watersheds.

Problems (1) and (2) are related to land use and land cover changes in the upper area; problem (3) is related to irrigation network management; and problem (4) is influenced by social and economic aspects. To tackle this problem, one or two alternative solutions can be used: decreasing water demand or increasing water supply.

40|$|Performance {{tests were}} {{conducted}} at Unit 22 at Hydro-Québec’s Laforge- 2 plant between June 11 and 15, 1997. These tests included measurements of the discharge through the turbine using current meters. Simultaneous measurements were also taken in one bay of the intake with an Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter (ASFM). The ASFM is a new instrument which offers unique advantages for measuring intake flows in low-head, short intake plants for which current meters have been the traditional and only effective method. It is non-intrusive, and its deployment in <b>intake</b> <b>gate</b> slots is straightforward, allowing data to be collected {{with a minimum of}} plant downtime. Laforge- 2 is typical of large to medium-sized plants of that type: it is equipped with two 147 MW Kaplan turbines, each with a three-bay intake.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{hydropower}} {{development in}} Norway {{is more or}} less restricted to small scale installations without reservoirs as they are regarded as an environmentally solution. This thesis provides an overview of the hydropower potential of nine rivers in Sør-Trøndelag, a county in Norway. This feasibility study includes technical, economical and environmental considerations. There is a combination of theoretical, experimental and programming work. First of all, the hydropower plants locations were positioned on a map. The rivers considered are not gauged so the runoff data was scaled from a metering station in an adjacent watershed. Once the head and the runoff were determined, the hydropower was calculated. The main objective of this thesis is to build a user friendly program that estimates the costs of small hydropower plants, that consists of the cost of its components. The main components of a small hydropower plant are technically described: intake dam, <b>intake</b> <b>gate</b> or valve, trash rack, pipes, powerhouse, turbine, generator, crane, transformer, controller, switchgear and power cable. The program was developed with Microsoft Office Excel 2003. There are three different versions of the program: one that provides a general overview of the costs, another one that provides the costs for each component separately and finally one that optimizes the hydropower plant design. The profitability of the small hydropower plants projects was discussed in the economic analysis. Environmental aspects were, as they always should, considered when planning the hydropower plants. To take this investigation a step further one river was selected to undergo verification of the data. A field survey was made to check the location of the hydropower plant in its natural surroundings and to measure the flow of the river. The dimensions of the pipe and of the Pelton turbine were calculated. This thesis {{can be used as a}} guide for the landowners eager to developing hydropower on their property...|$|E

50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the <b>intake</b> <b>gates</b> and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Kaplan-type {{turbines}} with short, converging intakes are in widespread use, neither of the two test codes most commonly used in North America [1, 2] provide a practical method for measuring flow rate {{in this type of}} unit. Code-accepted flow rate measurement methods generally require relatively long sections of uniform penstock or a well-formed bellmouth inlet, which rarely exist with low-head Kaplan units. This paper describes the execution and results of an ASME and CEATI-sponsored test comparing methods for flow rate measurement suitable for use in the short converging intakes which are typical of low-head hydro plants. Three flow rate measurement technologies were evaluated – acoustic transit time, current meters, and acoustic scintillation. The former was installed in a non-uniform transition section, and the latter two in an <b>intake</b> <b>gate</b> slot. An existing code-accepted acoustic flowmeter in the penstock served as a “reference” measurement. The test was executed at the level of accuracy required for turbine acceptance testing, generally in accordance with ASME PTC 18 [1]. Furthermore it was conducted “blindly”, meaning the flow rate data was not shared among test participants during testing. The testing is described and the results of the comparison measurements are presented, including a statistical analysis that compares the intake method flow rate measurements with the reference meter at the 95 % confidence level. A comparison is also made with the results of flow rate comparison tests sponsored by EPRI at Kootenay Canal in 1983 [3]. That test included only methodologies inside the penstock, including acoustic transit time, current meter, salt velocity, pressure time, and dye dilution. Because the same acoustic transit time flowmeter section was used for both tests, the results for all methods are directly comparable. In addition to the intake flow rate measurement methods, a CFD model of the intake flow field was implemented, and comparison of the CFD model with the field measurements is briefly discussed...|$|E

We always have intaken water from the river by this head work, even {{at the time of}} flood. To design such structure, we have to know the rerationship between the gate opening and the discharge of water or the discharge coefficient which varies widely according to the river water level. That orifice formula could be used in calculation to obtain the amount of discharged water from the gate has experimentally been confirmed by Toch, Honma and others. The discharge coefficient of the <b>intake</b> <b>gate</b> Cq is shown in its relationship to parameters expressing the gate geometry. Any agreement between actual gate discharge and Toch's experimental results could never be found when the gate geometry is different. Therefore, we can only obtain Cq value through a specific model study for a particular project. Specially in this intake mention should be made here {{to the fact that the}} loss of head Ф in the uniform flow sections upstreams and downstreams from the gate is ignored, and the value of Ф related to the Cq value. Relation between Cq and Ф can be obtained by the following equation using the Bernoulli's energay theorem, in which ψ. Ф are head loss parameters, Cq H 1 ･H 2 /√H 12 (1 +ψ) + H 32 (Ф-l) and Cq value can be obtained by calculating head loss.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an evaluation of juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) behavior at Cougar Dam on the south fork of the McKenzie River in Oregon in 2010. The study was conducted by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The overall goal {{of the study was to}} characterize juvenile salmonid behavior and movement patterns in the immediate forebay of the Water Temperature Control (WTC) tower of the dam for USACE and fisheries resource managers use in making decisions about bioengineering designs for long-term structures and/or operations to facilitate safe downstream passage for juvenile salmonids. We collected acoustic imaging (Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar; DIDSON) data from March 1, 2010, through January 31, 2011. Juvenile salmonids (hereafter, called 'fish') were present in the immediate forebay of the WTC tower throughout the study. Fish abundance index was low in early spring (< 200 fish per sample-day), increased in late April, and peaked on May 19 (6, 039 fish). A second peak was observed on June 6 (2904 fish). Fish abundance index decreased in early June and remained low in the summer months (< 100 fish per sample-day). During the fall and winter, fish numbers varied with a peak on November 10 (1881 fish) and a minimum on December 7 (12 fish). A second, smaller, peak occurred on December 22 (607 fish). A univariate statistical analysis indicated fish abundance index (log 10 -transformed) was significantly (P< 0. 05) positively correlated with forebay elevation, velocity over the WTC tower <b>intake</b> <b>gate</b> weirs, and river flows into the reservoir. A subsequent multiple regression analysis resulted in a model (R 2 = 0. 70) predicting fish abundance (log-transformed index values) using two independent variables of mean forebay elevation and the log 10 of the forebay elevation range. From the approximate fish length measurements made using the DIDSON imaging software, the average fish length during early spring 2010 was 214 {+-} 86 mm (standard deviation). From May through early November, the average fish length remained relatively consistent (132 {+-} 54 mm), after which average lengths increased to 295 {+-} 148 mm for mid-November though early December. From mid-December through January the average fish length decreased to 151 {+-} 76 mm. Milling in front of the WTC tower was the most common fish behavior observed throughout the study period. Traversing along the front of the tower, east-to-west and west-to-east, was the next common behavior. The percentage of fish events showing movement from the forebay to the tower or from the tower to the forebay was generally low throughout the spring, summer, and early fall (0 to 30 % for both directions combined, March through early November). From mid-November 2010 through the end of the study (January 31, 2011), the combined percentages of fish moving into and out of the tower were higher (25 to 70 %) than during previous months of the study. Schooling behavior was most distinct in the spring. Schooling events were present in 30 to 96 % of the fish events during that period, with a peak on May 19. Schooling events were also present in the summer, but at lower numbers. With the exception of some schooling in mid-December, few to no schooling events were observed in the fall and winter months. Diel distributions for schooling fish during spring and fall months indicate schooling was concentrated during daylight hours and no schooling was observed at night. However, in December, schooling occurred at night, after midnight, and during daylight hours. Predator activity, most likely bull trout or rainbow trout according to a USACE biologist, was observed during late spring, when fish abundance index and schooling were highest for the year, and again in the fall months when fish events increased from a summer low. No predator activity was observed in the summer, and little activity occurred during the winter months...|$|E

This study analyzed the ways for {{water distribution}} and timely water release in a rice growing area during the pre-saturation period and the normal irrigation supply periods. The analyses were carried out using field data collected at the Besut Irrigation Scheme located in the northeastern corner of Peninsular Malaysia in the state of Terengganu. The scheme comprises two sub-schemes, giving a total irrigation area of 5, 164 ha for the overall Besut Irrigation Scheme. Based on field water requirements and available flows at the <b>intake</b> <b>gates,</b> canal simulations were performed and results show that land preparation should not be done continuously unless flow rates are at least 9. 00 m 3 /s and 3. 00 m 3 /s at the Besut Barrage and Angga Barrage respectively. If the respective flow rates fall below these values, then land preparation should be done in two phases. However, when the flow rate is between 5. 00 and 5. 50 m 3 /s at the Besut Barrage, land preparation is recommended to be carried out over three phases. During the normal irrigation supply period, flow rates of 6. 00 m 3 /s and 1. 75 m 3 /s for the Besut and Angga Barrage respectively, are to be maintained for the entire irrigation scheme, otherwise selective irrigation or irrigation on a rotational basis has to be enforced. When flow rates are 7. 20 - 9. 00 m 3 /s and 1. 70 - 3. 00 m 3 /s at the Besut and Angga Barrage respectively, then water should be released two days before the beginning of the pre-saturation period for the filling main and secondary canals. However, water should be released three days before the beginning of the pre-saturation period when flow rates are between 5. 00 and 7. 00 m 3 Is at the Besut Barrage.

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{measurements and}} observations {{in a laboratory}} channel, the hydrodynamic behaviour of the approaching flow {{and the amount of}} sediment entering a right-angled lateral intake in a diversion dam were investigated. The velocity field, both upstream of the intake in the main channel and in front of the intake in the sluiceway, were measured under various discharge combinations of the river, <b>intake</b> and sluice <b>gate.</b> In addition, velocity profiles both upstream and downstream of the intake and the amount of sediment entering it were measured. Analysis of the velocity data showed that the discharge of the sluice gate {{played an important role in}} determining the velocity profile and also the mechanism of sediment entry. All velocity profiles where the sluice gate was closed had an inflection point, where the flow direction changed, leading to a return velocity near the bed. The elevation of this point was a function of the intake discharge and approximately equal to the height of the entrance sill. Experimental observation showed that sediment entered the intake by a tornado-like vortex. The strength and frequency of the vortices depended on the <b>intake</b> and sluice <b>gate</b> discharges. Analysis of the sedimentation data showed that the amount of sediment entering the intake increased with increasing intake discharge.

40|$|Hydroelectric {{power is}} an {{important}} source of energy. This is particularly true for Quebec and some other provinces in Canada. In the event of a combination of power trip and wicket gate blockage, as an emergency response, it is necessary to close the <b>intake</b> <b>gates</b> in order to stop water flow through the penstock to the unit. Such emergency closure can cause air pressure inside the penstock chamber to drop so significantly that the safety risks to the power station structures and facilities become unacceptable. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop analysis methods for the assessment of air pressure drop in emergency closure. The scope of this research work covers the determination of the following time-dependent quantities: water discharge beneath a sluice gate, dry air flow through air vents leading to the penstock chamber, amount of air entrained by turbulent water motions through the penstock, and the resultant changes of air pressure in the penstock chamber. The analyses are based on the energy principle and take into account a large number of variables including the upstream and downstream water levels, the geometry of the hydraulic passage, the time rate of gate closing, and features of downstream control structures. The analysis methods are applied to two cases of emergency closure of power generating stations in Quebec. The results of calculated air demand and pressure drop are in good comparison with field measurements. Emergency closure is shown to produce two significant impacts on penstocks and air vents: 1) intensified water jet in the first half of the time period it takes to close the gate; and 2) pressure drop in the last one third of the time period. Air entrainment by high-velocity flowing water {{is an important}} cause of pressure drop in emergency closure, and can be modeled using hydraulic jump entrainment equations. The values of air pressure drop calculated for the Isle-Maligne and La Tuque stations are below one third of the standard atmospheric pressure. However, there are significant air pressure fluctuations. This study has contributed to the development of quantitative framework and calculation procedures that can easily be extended for applications to other sites. The development is of engineering relevance to upgrade of existing air vents and the design of new air vents and to safe operations of emergency closure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The water Savonius rotor is {{classified}} as a vertical axis water rotor like the Darrieus, Gyromill or H-rotor. The advancing blade with concave side facing the water flow would experience more drag force than the returning blade, thus forcing the rotor to rotate. In this work, we are interested {{on the study of}} the of the internal overlap effect of a water Savonius rotor. The experimental results is developed using a hydraulic test bench. The test bench consists on an <b>intake,</b> a control <b>gate,</b> a penstock, a canalization, a test section, an outflow and a pump. A detailed description of the global characteristics is presented such as power, dynamic torque, power and its coefficients...|$|R
