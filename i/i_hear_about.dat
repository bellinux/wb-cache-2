500|$|Guest star Laura Dern faced {{backlash}} {{over her}} {{appearance on the}} show. In a 2007 interview for DeGeneres's talk show commemorating the tenth anniversary of [...] "The Puppy Episode," [...] Dern stated {{that she did not}} work {{for a year and a}} half because of playing Susan. Nonetheless, Dern said that she was grateful for the [...] "extraordinary experience and opportunity" [...] of being a part of the episode. Speaking of her experience, DeGeneres said, [...] "It was a huge step in my life. I think people sensed the honesty in it. I think it helped a lot of people, and still to this day <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> parents and children being able to have an honest conversation through watching that show. That's ultimately what television can be: It can get conversations started." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mixed Martial Arts Champion Andrei Arlovski: [...] "The {{pit bull}} {{has a long}} history in America. In the early 1900s the U.S. proudly used pit bulls on WWI posters to symbolize qualities that make up America - friendly, courageous, hard working and worthy of respect. I chose my name because I admire the breed for the same reasons. When <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> pit bulls being used in dog {{fighting}}, it makes me angry. I have a choice to step into the cage to fight, but these dogs have no choice. Dog fighting is morally wrong and inhumane. In my opinion it's torture. Please join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jessie J {{has been}} criticized by people who find the lyrics of the song hypocritical: a [...] "rich rock star" [...] telling {{the rest of us}} that money doesn't matter, or {{questioning}} why she then charges for her music. She has repeatedly explained in interviews that this is a misreading of her meaning, which skewers the superficiality of conspicuous consumption -- or more simply, that [...] "show-offs suck." [...] "For me, so much <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> how much money people have and how people just take stuff too seriously. It’s not me saying that you can live for free, because obviously that isn’t the case; but I’m saying that you don’t always have to let it be about that. It isn’t always about how much your shoes cost. It’s {{about the fact that you}} even have a pair of shoes to walk in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Born to Mexican-American {{parents in}} Ontario, California, {{better known as}} the Inland Empire, T grew up singing in her church choir during Sunday school. In high school, T Lopez did not {{participate}} in early college enrollment with her peers. Instead, Lopez, who always knew she wanted to sing, attended Chaffey High School while working two jobs at the Ontario Mills Mall. That is until a car belonging to a talent scout, Nick Martinez, broke down near her father's garage and her father told Martinez about T's beautiful voice. T Lopez called Nick Martinez and he asked her to sing to him over the phone," [...] T Lopez said she thought it was weird, but she sang to him anyway so she sung [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] from her bathroom, she said that the acoustics were better in there. After she finished singing for Nick Martinez he told her When <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> something, I'll call you. Not thinking much of it, T Lopez returned to work at Ontario Mills until Nick Martinez did indeed call her back.|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
