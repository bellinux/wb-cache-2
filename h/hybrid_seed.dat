5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>seed</b> dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the modern}} {{hybridization}} process, where one inbred line of corn is crossed with another, developed from this early work in cross breeding. In 1908, George Harrison Shull described heterosis, {{also known as}} hybrid vigor. Heterosis describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. In 1917 a process was developed that would make this hybridization commercially viable. In 1933 less than 1% of the corn produced in the United States was produced from hybrid seed; by 1944 over 83% was.

40|$|Abstract — Artificial {{introductions}} of non-native species by humans can remove geographical barriers between species. In {{the absence of}} reproductive barriers, closely related introduced taxa {{may be able to}} hybridize, resulting in the formation of novel genotypes. These may be more suited to the new environment than either of their parent taxa, and have the potential to become more invasive. We investigated potential reproductive barriers between the non-native invasive Impatiens glandulifera and its less aggressive non-native congener I. balfourii. We examined behaviour of pollinators, including their foraging preferences and whether they switched from one species to the other. Moreover, conspecific and interspecific artificial crosses were performed between these species and seed production and the germination success of <b>hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> were assessed. Both I. balfourii and I. glandulifera had relatively long flowering periods which mostly overlapped. Insect visitors were observed to switch from flowers of one species to the other during a single foraging bout, confirming that natural pollen transfer between species is possible. Artificial interspecific pollination resulted in the production of seeds, suggesting the presence of incomplete reproductive barriers between the two species. However, <b>hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> mostly failed to germinate making the production of invasive hybrids unlikely. Nevertheless, because of the prolific reproductive output of these species we would not exclude the possibility that some viable <b>hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> could be formed and become established. Further investigation of the fitness of <b>hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> is required as hybridisation may allow Impatiens to exploit different ecological niches...|$|R

40|$|The smooth {{germination}} {{of mature}} Hybrid rose achenes is hampered by (i) hardseededness (HS), (ii) primary dormancy (PD) and (iii) germination polymorphism (GP). HS is {{owing to the}} hard pericarp. PD is, in principle, a natural phenomenon that protects the seeds from precocious germination. For germination, PD must be lifted by after-ripening. When the process of after-ripening is interrupted seeds become secondary dormant (SD). When SD both seeds and naked embryos are highly recalcitrant to germination. After-ripening of <b>Hybrid</b> rose <b>seeds</b> consists of two steps (i) softening the pericarp, (ii) hydrolysing and/or antagonizing the inhibitor ABA, present in the testa and/or embryo. The ratio ABA:GA (present or newly synthesized) controls readiness for germination. Imbibing previously cold-stratified <b>Hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> in GA 3, enhanced the even emergence and germination percentage. Likely owing to their unique descent, Hybrid roses bear achenes that are less recalcitrant to breaking PD than those of many rose species. Different levels of PD, occurring between the rose species, {{can be traced back}} to adaptation to their natural habitat. Comparing the after-ripening requirements of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> with those of rose species is a false position. GP is caused by varying temperatures during fruit ripening, is promoted by prolonged pollination periods, effects variation in dormancy and as such contributes to uneven germination of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>seeds.</b> PD of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>seeds</b> is deeper as mean ambient temperatures during the last 30 days of fruit ripening were lower. Hence, lower temperatures in autumn, as commonly set in glasshouses, cause deeper PD. Rose seeds may germinate without any after-ripening when harvested unripe. Each year, breeders should compose the "best protocol" for cold stratification/germination of <b>Hybrid</b> rose <b>seeds</b> from the elements: (i) the period of pollination, (ii) the temperatures during 30 days prior to hip ripening, (iii) the storage of achenes between extraction from the hip and sowing, (iv) the intended warm period prior to stratification and (v) the temperatures set for stratification. </p...|$|R
