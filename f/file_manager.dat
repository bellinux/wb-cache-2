5|$|Windows 8.1 adds tighter {{integration}} with several Microsoft-owned services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated {{at the system}} level to sync user settings and files. Files are automatically downloaded in the background when they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to be available offline. By default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and reparse points are used to {{give the appearance of}} a normal directory structure to provide backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was updated to include a local <b>file</b> <b>manager.</b> OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires that a user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported on Windows 8.1.|$|E
25|$|A navigational <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> is a newer type of <b>file</b> <b>manager.</b> Since {{the advent}} of GUIs, {{it has become the}} {{dominant}} type of <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> for desktop computers.|$|E
25|$|Dolphin replaces Konqueror as {{the default}} <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> in KDE 4.0. This {{was done to}} address {{complaints}} of Konqueror being too complicated for a simple <b>file</b> <b>manager.</b> However Dolphin and Konqueror will share as much code as possible, and Dolphin can be embedded in Konqueror to allow Konqueror to still {{be used as a}} <b>file</b> <b>manager.</b>|$|E

25|$|Orthodox <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> (OFM) or command-based <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> are text-menu based <b>file</b> <b>managers,</b> that {{commonly}} {{have three}} windows (two panels and one command line window). Orthodox <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> {{are one of}} the longest running families of <b>file</b> <b>managers,</b> preceding Graphical User Interface-based types. Developers create applications that duplicate and extend the manager that was introduced by PathMinder and John Socha's famous Norton Commander for DOS. The concept is more than thirty years oldâ€”PathMinder was released in 1984, and Norton Commander version 1.0 was released in 1986. Despite the age of this concept, <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> based on Norton Commander are actively developed, and dozens of implementations exist for DOS, Unix, and Microsoft Windows. Nikolai Bezroukov publishes his own set of criteria for an OFM standard (version 1.2 dated June 1997).|$|R
25|$|Most navigational <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> {{have two}} panes, the left pane being a tree {{view of the}} filesystem. This means that unlike {{orthodox}} <b>file</b> <b>managers,</b> the two panes are asymmetrical in their content and use.|$|R
25|$|Windows Explorer in Windows 95 was set as {{a spatial}} <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> model by default; because it also {{worked as a}} navigational <b>file</b> <b>manager,</b> {{directories}} could be opened in multiple windows, which made it fail all the above criteria. Later versions gradually abandoned the spatial model.|$|E

25|$|Chrome OS also {{includes}} an integrated <b>file</b> <b>manager,</b> resembling those found on other operating systems, {{with the ability}} to display directories and the files they contain from both Google Drive and local storage, as well as to preview and manage file contents using a variety of Web applications, including Google Docs and Box. Since January 2015, Chrome OS can also integrate additional storage sources into the <b>file</b> <b>manager,</b> relying on installed extensions that use the File System Provider API.|$|E

25|$|Three-dimensional GUIs {{appeared}} in science fiction literature and films {{before they were}} technically feasible or in common use. For example; the 1993 American film Jurassic Park features Silicon Graphics' three-dimensional <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> File System Navigator, a real-life <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> for Unix operating systems. The film Minority Report has scenes of police officers using specialized 3d data systems. In prose fiction, three-dimensional user interfaces have been portrayed as immersible environments like William Gibson's Cyberspace or Neal Stephenson's Metaverse. Many futuristic imaginings of user interfaces rely heavily on object-oriented user interface (OOUI) style and especially object-oriented graphical user interface (OOGUI) style.|$|E
25|$|A web-based <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> {{can serve}} as an organization's digital repository. For example, documents, digital media, {{publishing}} layouts, and presentations can be stored, managed, and shared between customers, suppliers, and remote workers, or just internally.|$|E
25|$|Some {{documents}} or applications can be run in disposable VMs {{through an}} action {{available in the}} <b>file</b> <b>manager.</b> The mechanism follows the idea of sandboxes: after viewing the document or application, then the whole Disposable VM will be destroyed.|$|E
50|$|RabbitVCS is a {{graphical}} front-end for {{version control}} systems available on Linux. It integrates into <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> to provide <b>file</b> context menu access to version control repositories. The project was originally called NautilusSvn, {{but due to}} the desire to support <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> in addition to Nautilus and more version control systems, it was renamed to RabbitVCS (Version Control System).|$|R

25|$|The {{interface}} in a navigational <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> often {{resembles a}} web browser, complete with back and forward buttons, and often reload buttons. Most also contain an address bar {{into which the}} file or directory path (or URI) can be typed.|$|E
25|$|The California startup Eazel {{developed}} the Nautilus <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> from 1999 to 2001. De Icaza and Nat Friedman founded Helix Code (later Ximian) in 1999 in Massachusetts; this company developed GNOME's infrastructure and applications, and in 2003 {{was purchased by}} Novell.|$|E
25|$|File {{operations}} {{are based on}} drag-and-drop and editor metaphors: users can select and copy files or directories onto the clipboard and then paste them {{in a different place}} in the filesystem or even in a different instance of the <b>file</b> <b>manager.</b>|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{it has two}} panes, {{with the}} {{filesystem}} tree in the left pane and {{the contents of the}} current directory in the right pane. For macOS, the miller columns view in Finder (originating in NeXTStep) is a variation on the navigational <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> theme.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{moving from one}} {{location}} to another need not open a new window. Several instances of the <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> can be opened simultaneously and {{communicate with each other}} via drag-and-drop and clipboard operations, so it is possible to view several directories simultaneously and perform cut-and paste operations between instances.|$|E
25|$|More advanced, {{and usually}} commercially distributed, web-based file {{management}} scripts allow {{the administrator of}} the <b>file</b> <b>manager</b> to configure secure, individual user accounts, each with individual account permissions. Authorized users have access to documents stored on the server or in their individual user directories anytime, from anywhere, via a web browser.|$|E

2500|$|Orthodox <b>file</b> <b>managers</b> {{are among}} the most {{portable}} <b>file</b> <b>managers.</b> [...] Examples are available on almost any platform, with both command-line and graphical interfaces. This is unusual among command line managers in that something purporting to be a standard for the interface is published. They are also actively supported by developers. This makes it possible to do the same work on different platforms without much relearning of the interface.|$|R
