Among various possible options, fuels derived from triglycerides (vegetable oils/animal fats) are promising for substitutes of fossil diesel fuels. Vegetable oil poses some problems when subjected to prolonged usage in <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engines</b> because of high viscosity as reported by different researchers. The research on alternative fuels <b>for</b> <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>engine</b> has become essential due to depletion of petroleum products and its major contribution for pollutants, where vegetable oil promises best alternative fuel. Vegetable oils, due to their agricultural origin, are able to reduce net CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere.
