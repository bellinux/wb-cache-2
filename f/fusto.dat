5000|$|His {{most famous}} book, <b>Füstös</b> képek ("Images in Smoke", {{translated}} in English as The Color of Smoke) {{is a novel}} based on personal experience, set in World War II. It is a bildungsroman that shows life in a Roma village in Northeast Hungary, from 1940 until the German occupation {{of the country in}} 1944 when Roma people were put into death camps. While filled with amusing anecdotes, with a petty criminal subplot, and adolescent eroticism, it portrays dehumanization of Romani in the society.|$|R

5000|$|Girolamo Maggi (c. 1523, in Anghiari [...] - [...] 27 March 1572 in Constantinople), {{also known}} by his Latin name Hieronymus Magius, was an Italian scholar, jurist, poet, {{military}} engineer, urban planner, philologist, archaeologist, mathematician, and naturalist who studied at Bologna under Francis Robortello. He authored several works, including {{a collection of}} poems on the Flemish wars, (Cinque primi canti della guerra di Fiandra, 1551), one detailing military fortifications (Della fortificatione delle città, by his friend Giacomo <b>Fusto</b> Castriotto, but edited, annotated, and published posthumously by Maggi in 1564), and several {{on the subject of}} philosophy.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the structural components of human life quality (both spatial and temporal) has yielded substantial results in recent times (Bácsy & Vizi 1998, Fekete 2006, Hankiss & Manchin & <b>Füstös</b> 1978, Kopp & Kovács 2006). The relevance of this issue in current day Hungary is ensured {{by the fact that}} the political-social transition is prolonged and is accompanied by strengthening social and spatial polarisation. Experts in spatial planning and development have gradually recognised the importance of knowledge in this field, and the creators of concepts and plans now rely on these results. Correlations between life quality, life expectancies, health conditions, and place of residence are becoming increasingly acute; their recognition by people other than just the small community of professionals is because of the need for spatial rationalisation, which is a determining element in the structural reform of health services, and for equal opportunities. In the present study, the authors provide an account of the spatial differences in the availability of the ambulance service, this field representing a special segment of health services. Within the health system, it is a specific area in which highly appreciated changes have already taken place; the quality of services has improved, costefficiency has increased, and the availability of equal opportunities has strengthene...|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the century}} saw the end of Communism in Hungary. Although state support for Hungary's one {{animation}} studio (Pannónia Film Stúdió) came to an end, the free market quickly prompted the development of a number of independent animation studios. In order to gain funding {{in the absence of the}} state, studios such as Kecskemétfilm Kft turn to employee ownership strategies while other studios work primarily as contractors for foreign markets doing work such as compositioning and inking. Yet other studios such as the American-Hungarian joint venture Studio 2 have focused instead on traditional hand-drawn cell animation techniques to preserve this now niche animation style. Among other animation studios that were founded since the withdrawal of state control are included Pannónia rajzfilmgyártók, Videovox, Funny Film, Animex, Dana Film, Reflex, Puppet Film, Aladin stúdió, Firka, and the German-Hungarian joint venture Loonland. Several feature-length films have been released since the late 1980s including Albert mondja... ("Albert Says...") and Majmok kastélya ("Monkey Castle") among others. Animators who have risen to prominence since the {{end of the}} Communist era include Péter Szoboszlay, László Hegyi <b>Füstös,</b> Mária Horváth, Líviusz Gyulai, István Orosz, Dóra Keresztes, László Haris, Péter Molnár, Zoltán Szilágyi Varga, Árpád Miklós, Gizella Neuberger, Béla Weisz, and László Ujváry.|$|R
50|$|A decade {{considered}} to {{have been responsible for}} the peak of Hungarian animation, the 1980s would see increasingly bold use of irony and allegory in portraying the Hungarian condition under Communist rule and would mark a renaissance in technical experimentation with the exploration of many non-traditional graphic media. Of particular note, several new experimental serials emerged during this period including Sándor Békési's Vázák meséi ("Tales of Vases"), Csaba Varga's Szekrénymesék ("The Wardrobe's Tales"), and plasticine animations including Csaba Varga's Auguszta ("Augusta") and Ferenc Cakó's Zénó. Feature-length films were made of a number of serials from the 1960s and 1970s, including Szabolcs Szabó and József Haui's Vízipók-csodapók ("Water-Spider, Wonder-Spider"), Ottó Foky's Misi Mókus kalandjai ("The Adventures of Sam the Squirrel"), Attila Dargay's Vuk, and Pál Tóth's Leo és Fred ("Leo and Fred"). New series were also launched including Attila Dargay's Pom-pom meséi ("Tales of Pom Pom") and A nagy hó-hó-horgász ("The Grrreat Angler"), Ferenc Cakó's Sebaj Tóbiás ("Never Mind Toby"), László Ujváry Jr.'s Mesék Mátyás királyról ("Tales about King Matthias"), Marcell Jankovics' Mondák a magyar történelemből ("Hungarian Historical Legends"), Zsolt Richly's Fabulák ("Fables") and Kíváncsi Fáncsi ("Curious Fáncsi"), Tibor Hernádi's Animália ("Animalia"), Líviusz Gyulai's Tinti kalandjai ("Tinti's Adventures") and Kentaurfi kalandjai ("Adventures of Fanny the Elephant"), Tamás Baksa's Trombi és a tűzmanó ("Trombi and the Fiery Imp"), and Ferenc Varsányi's Csepke ("Droplet"). Animators making a name for themselves in this period included Ferenc Varsányi, Miklós Kaim, István Kovács, Elek Lisziák, Zsolt Richly, Kati Macskássy, Béla Ternovszky, Tibor Hernádi, László Ujváry, Ferenc Cakó, László Hegyi <b>Füstös,</b> Csaba Varga, Ágnes Pásztor, Mária Horváth, István Orosz, and Ferenc Rofusz.|$|R
5000|$|Born Augusto Guglielmi in Sanremo, he {{graduated}} from ragioneria, then he enrolled at the university in the faculty of economics and business, though without finishing his studies. Guglielmi later attended the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, graduating in 1953, despite having participated in 1951-52 in a few films in minor roles. He then started a busy acting career on stage, television and cinema, even if often cast in supporting and character roles. Guglielmi also worked in fotoromanzi for the magazine Sogno. He was also active as screenwriter and novelist; his novel, [...] "Er più de Roma", co-written by Lucio Mandarà, was adapted into the film Il principe <b>fusto,</b> directed by Maurizio Arena and released in 1960.|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{examines the}} graphical {{representation of the}} military architecture {{in the sixteenth century}} and in particular the method of description used by Giorgio Palearo, an engineer, {{in the service of the}} Spanish Kingdom. He produces numerous designs, from project design to the survey representation of existing structures until a description of the "end of the work" that coordinates in Sardinia (Italy). The study conducted in the course of the Phd research, has highlighted a use by Jacopo and Giorgio Palearo Fratino, of the Treaty of Girolamo Maggi and Jacopo <b>Fusto</b> Castriotto, as a guide for planning the technical and structural solutions and compositional choices but not only; in fact, Giorgio Palearo occurs in a rigorous way, for a description of the strongholds of Cagliari and Alghero, to a method of representation that in the Treaty is called " military perspective ", where the eye in the figure & the compass in the plant, will show you the full consistency of this work, like Captain Castriotto says...|$|E
