5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating <b>in</b> <b>care</b> work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E

The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed <b>in</b> <b>care</b> in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E

40|$|IntroductionAn {{aspect of}} caregiving that has {{received}} little attention {{is the degree to}} which the choice to provide care affects a caregiver's emotional well-being. We compared a population-based sample of informal caregivers who reported having a choice <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> with caregivers who did not have a choice <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> to determine the extent to which choice affects caregivers' self-reported stress. MethodsWe identified 341 informal caregivers who completed a caregiving module appended to the 2005 North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. We determined participants' self-reported stress by using a 5 -point scale that was dichotomized and used adjusted binomial logistic regression to assess the risk of stress given lack of choice in caregiving. ResultsIn the fully adjusted model, caregivers without a choice <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> were more than 3 times as likely to report stress as caregivers with a choice <b>in</b> <b>caring.</b> High level of burden also increased stress. Caregivers with no choice <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> were most commonly the primary caregiver of a parent. ConclusionCaregivers who do not have a choice in caregiving were at increased risk of stress, which may predispose them to poor health outcomes. Further investigation is needed to determine whether interventions that target caregivers without a choice <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> can reduce their levels of stress...|$|R
5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a {{shooting}} spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's Criminal Code called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, {{that he had not}} been sane {{at the time of the}} incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years <b>in</b> <b>care</b> at Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre's Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the Executive Council of Ontario that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women <b>in</b> <b>care</b> homes. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

25|$|Siblings {{taken into}} care {{together}} were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so {{brothers and sisters}} rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up <b>in</b> <b>care</b> while others remained {{at home with their}} parents or were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only found out much later in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children <b>in</b> <b>care.</b> This makes it difficult for older care leavers to find out why and how they ended up <b>in</b> <b>care,</b> and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives.|$|E

Intermittently, a theory-practice gap is given expression- that theory does not go along with clinical practice <b>in</b> <b>caring.</b> The aim of this study was an investigation into the possible disparity between theory and practice <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> by analysingnurses’ lived experience of the understanding of <b>caring</b> theory <b>in</b> practice in the context of municipal elderly care. Hermeneutical phenomenology was the research approach used to explore the lived experience of <b>caring</b> science theories <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> practice from the perspective of 12 nurses working <b>in</b> municipal <b>care</b> for elderly. The findings shows that the nurses Impulsively described their experience of detachment to caring theory, but when describing their caring intentions, the relationship to theory became apparent, and even confirmed their practice. As such, a seedbed exists for caring theory to be reflected on and cultivated <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> praxis. However, as the nurses describe, the caring theory must be sensitive enough for the nursing practitioners to accept. The gap revealed itself on an organisational level, as the nurses’ commission <b>in</b> municipal <b>care</b> did not correspond with their caring intention. We believe it is important to seriously consider what we want to achieve as a caring profession. We have to reflect on our responsibility as culture carriers and knowledge developers.

40|$|In Swedish nursing education, student nurses should gain a {{bachelor}} degreein the main field of study. However, five designations {{of the main}} field ofstudy exist among the higher education institutions and the present thesisfocuses on the main field of study caring science. Former studies show thatthe acquisition of knowledge <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> by student nurses is characterized bytroubles, uncertainty and confusion. The aim was to describe how growingin caring is experienced by student nurses during education. The theoretical perspective was caring science with focus on caringscience didactics, while the epistemological frame constituted of a phenomenological lifeworld approach. Data was gathered with interviews andwritten narratives at different occasions during the education in order tograsp the general structure of growing <b>in</b> <b>caring.</b> The findings illuminated that growing <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> means a struggle forone’s own caring beliefs to exist and survive in a world filled with diverseexpectations of caring. Through recognizing expectations of caring, studentnurses discover the complexity of <b>caring.</b> <b>In</b> this complexity, they understand themselves as being different and the otherness appears. The otherness consists of unique beliefs about caring based on former experiences. Inorder to give evidence for the otherness, concepts from caring theories thatagree with one’s own caring beliefs are found, which transform the concepts from being meaningless to being essential <b>in</b> <b>caring.</b> The conceptsstrengthen the student nurses’ growth <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> and constitute a support intheir discussions about <b>caring.</b> <b>In</b> this struggle for gaining access with theirotherness, they become convinced {{that they can make}} changes for the patient and strength arises to fight for their otherness. The study showed that the otherness appears as the hub in the studentnurse’s world, which gains nourishment to discover paths to think, feel andact <b>in</b> a <b>caring</b> manner. This gives an incentive that innovative learningstrategies that both grasp the student nurses’ lifeworld as well as bringknowledge <b>in</b> <b>caring</b> into awareness for them are needed to be developed...|$|R
