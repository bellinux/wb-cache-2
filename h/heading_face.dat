In the blind drift, the air ducts are usually laid {{on one side}} of the drifting tunnel forming the wall-attached jet along the side of the tunnel and in order to dilute and pour out harmful gas and dust, and create an backflow at the same time, the airflow of the ventilation jet must reach at the head of the tunnel[1]. Therefore, the forced ventilation in <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> is actually restrained wall attached jet ventilation in confined space[2]...|$|E

These bring about the practicable need to forced ventilation technology of the long-distance <b>heading</b> <b>face.</b> Based on pre-processing software GAMBIT, three-dimensional computational model of the far-pressing-near-absorption has been set up. By using the commercial CFD software FLUENT, airflow organization of long <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> under the far–pressing-near-absorption local ventilation model has been simulated. According to this, the paper has elaborated the internal mechanism of the far-pressing-near-absorption local ventilation model, and has analysis the ventilation effect of the classic ventilation features model. Studies have shown that: In local forced ventilation mode of the long duct exhaust and short duct forced, the scope of jet was significantly greater than that of exhaust. Duct location layout according to the classic effective parameters ranges of forced and exhaust is not conducive to the <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> dirty winds rapidly carry out. The value of speed at the center of laneway was fluctuated and dual-controlled by forced and exhaust. The air volume difference of forced and exhaust determines dirty wind carry out time and air quality within the entire laneway.

Combined with the practical problems existing in the field, a series of methods were conducted to investigate and analyze the the dust source of tunneling, the authors propose the following optimal comprehensive directional measures: At first, using the wet shotcrete technology as more as possible to improving the shotcrete. Taking use of the corresponding measures of spraying and watering, and the use of water stemming is mandatory. The amount of wind in the exit of the ventilation duct should be controlled and the quality of water should be improved, enhancing the atomization effect. The settled dust {{on the walls of the}} tunnel should be moistened with sticking agent and the individual safeguard should be done better. Adopting the above dustproof measures should effectively solve the problems of a large amount of dust and the working environment of high dust concentration in the <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> by blasting. The working environment can be improved by the effective control for the dust concentration in the <b>heading</b> <b>face.</b> The work of dust comprehensive prevention in the <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> is of significance...|$|E

According to the ventilation of <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> in deep mine, the distribution of velocity and the temperature of the air within tube were simulated by using ANSYS software, and the thermal insulation effect was discussed. The result indicates that double-skin air tube has good effect on thermal insulation, and the number of air intakes and the thickness of the air layer are two important factors to the thermal insulation effect. The thermal insulation effect drops by increasing the number of air intakes. When the air layer thickness is less than 20 mm, the outlet temperature decreases significantly.

40|$|AbstractThe entry at Zhangcun {{coal mine}} in Lu’an coal mining area in Shanxi Province {{suffered}} from severe mining-induced stresses with the <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> driven oppositely to an adjacent working face. In this paper, {{the characteristics of}} deformation and failure of the entry were investigated {{in terms of the}} tempo-spatial relations between heading and working faces through field study and numerical modeling. The three-dimensional (3 D) finite difference models were built to investigate stresses, displacements and damages in the surrounding rocks of the entry and the working face. The field study includes selection of reinforcing methods and materials, design parameters, and determination of cable prestress. The monitoring data of entry deformation and stress along the cables during every stage were presented. The state of the reinforced entry was evaluated based on the monitoring data. The results demonstrate that before the <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> of the entry crosses the adjacent working face, the influence of advanced abutment pressure caused by adjacent working face upon the entry is not significant. After they cross each other, however, the lateral abutment pressure will have an evident impact on the entry. The displacement rate of the entry will be greatly increased and reaches a certain value within a certain distance between the <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> and the working face. Then, it will increase again with the presence of secondary mining-induced pressure on the entry when the present working face advances. The fully-grouted cable with short length, high strength and high prestress is an effective way to reinforce the entry suffering from severe mining-induced stresses, which greatly reduces the displacement and failure possibility of the entry. Finally, the principles and recommendations for reinforcing design of entries suffering from severe mining-induced stresses were proposed according to field study, numerical modeling and experiences from other coal mines. Problems encountered in field study and suggestions for reinforcement were also discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe driving {{safety in}} deep laneway is often {{affected}} by many geological anomaly factors in {{ahead of a}} laneway end. The variability of rock properties, faults and so geological anomaly have relations with groundwater in rock mass. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} employ various geophysical methods for geological anomaly detection in the front of laneway end in order to avoid mine inundation, which guides the process of driving in a laneway of coal mine. According to the comparative analysis between geological exploration and various geophysical methods used in the 2000 m-passageway of − 780 -south section in Guqiao coal mine of Huainan, the result shows as follows. 1) The abnormity of lithology and faults can be detected and forecasted by the reflected seismic wave in the laneway, long distance prediction and high resolution detecting ability are the main characters of the reflected wave method, and the spectrum characteristics of seismic wave can distinguish the change of lithology; 2) The transient electromagnetic method (TEM) is very sensitive to solve the change of aquosity in terrane ahead of the laneway <b>heading</b> <b>face,</b> and the relatively characteristics between lithology change and its containing water can be identified finely through the direct current resistivity method in laneway; 3) The relatively characteristics between lithology change and its contained water can be identified finely through the direct current resistivity method in laneway. In a limited space of laneway, the combined analysis method using variety of geophysics methods are an effective method to detect geological anomaly and hydrogeology ahead of the laneway end, which can provide a powerful technology for safety and efficient driving in a deep laneway...|$|E

40|$|Due to diversified {{topography}} {{a number}} of tunnels have been constructed on Slovenian motorway network in the last 15 years after {{the implementation of the}} National motorway construction programme. 3 D displacement measurements of the primary lining has been applied {{as an integral part of}} the observational method on all tunnel construction sites since the Golovec tunnel construction in 1997. Analysis and interpretation of the measured displacements allow the verification of the design parameters, support optimization and optimization of construction processes. Monitoring data from the 13 tunnels, constructed after 1998, were collected and arranged in the database in the framework of this thesis together with face logs. Further on, a computer code Predor (means Tunnel in Slovene) was developed for graphical presentation and analysis of these data. Code comprises also a system for automatic handling of the incoming data from construction sites and for the preparation of graphical reports in real time. The main emphasis of the work was given to the analysis of measured displacements in tunnels, situated in soft foliated rock mass of Carboniferous age (the Trojane, Golovec and Šentvid tunnels). Monitored displacements display more or less pronounced anisotropic response in the cross section as well as in the longitudinal section. To model the observed response, back analyses with numerical calculations suggested very low value of shear modulus along the discontinuities. Special attention was paid to the analysis of well documented longitudinal displacements in the excavation direction under decreasing overburden due to anisotropy of the rock mass. It was found out that the magnitude of final measured displacements and thus portion of pre-displacements strongly depends on the relative discontinuity orientation to the tunnel axis. A large number of numerical simulations was performed to define the portion of pre-displacements and the extent of pre-face domain for different discontinuity orientations and different sets of material properties of the anisotropic rock mass. To locate the merging caverns of the Šentvid tunnel in most favourable rock mass conditions the exploratory tunnel was constructed in the design stage and enabled 3 D displacement measurements ahead of the top <b>heading</b> <b>face</b> of the main motorway tunnel during its construction. Extensive information about the scheme and execution of this experiment is given (no reports have been found so far of any similar experiments). Monitored displacements were analyzed according to mapped geological structure. Further on, the observed phenomena and the influence of the exploratory tunnel and its position on the displacements were studied with 3 D numerical calculations...|$|E
