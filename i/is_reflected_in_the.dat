5|$|An {{important}} goal of Python's developers {{is making it}} fun to use. This <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> origin of the name, which comes from Monty Python, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials, such as using examples that refer to spam and eggs instead of the standard foo and bar.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{layout of}} many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E

5|$|Many of Oldham's present {{divisions}} and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons and ancient chapelries. Some, such as Moorside, exist as recently constructed residential suburbia, whilst places like Hollinwood exist as electoral wards and thoroughly industrialised districts. Throughout {{most of its}} recorded history, Oldham was surrounded by large swathes of moorland, which <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> placenames of Moorside, Greenacres moor, Littlemoor, Northmoor among others.|$|E
5|$|Random Access Memories is {{the fourth}} studio album by French {{electronic}} music duo Daft Punk. It was released on 17 May 2013, by the duo's imprint Daft Life and Columbia Records.

5|$|There {{is also a}} great {{difference}} between English and Scottish historiography on King Edward. G. W. S. Barrow, in his biography on Robert the Bruce, accused Edward of ruthlessly exploiting the leaderless state of Scotland to obtain a feudal superiority over the kingdom. This view of Edward <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> popular perception of the King, {{as can be seen in}} the 1995 movie Bravehearts portrayal of the King as a hard-hearted tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Warburton was {{predominantly}} a farming village {{during the}} medieval period. The north western {{corner of the}} township {{was used as a}} deer park. Warburton grew as an agricultural town during the medieval period, and it remained almost untouched by the Industrial Revolution; this <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population change between 1801 and 1901, dropping from 466 to 403, with little variation {{at a time when the}} rest of Trafford was expanding rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Zagreb and Varaždin, the A4 {{motorway}} runs near {{a number}} of Croatian cities, and connects {{to the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network east of Zagreb. The motorway route was completed in 2008. The motorway's national significance <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects, as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node, since the A4 represents an integral part of the RijekaZagrebBudapest transport route.|$|E

5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's What I Call Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's What I Call Music or the Hits series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so that, from 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto it was very rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as {{in the days of}} Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E

5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
5|$|Long {{thought to}} be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, gannets and boobies, {{pelicans}} instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes. Ibises, spoonbills, herons and the desolate bitterns have been classified in the same order. Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back to at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France. They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this <b>is</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.|$|E

The sovereignty of the Knights Hospitaller over Malta from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout Malta. The country's modern museums and art galleries feature relics from Malta's history for tourists and Maltese residents alike to enjoy.|$|E
