2500|$|The main {{straight}} phosphate fertilizers are the superphosphates. [...] "Single superphosphate" [...] (SSP) {{consists of}} 14–18% P2O5, {{again in the}} form of Ca(H2PO4)2, but also phosphogypsum (CaSO4 · 2 H2O). Triple superphosphate (TSP) typically consists of 44-48% of P2O5 and no gypsum. A mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called <b>double</b> <b>superphosphate.</b> More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.|$|E
30|$|The {{fertiliser}} application supplied 180, 120 and 150  kg ha−[*] 1 elemental N, P and K respectively. These nutrients {{were applied}} as granular limestone ammonium nitrate, <b>double</b> <b>superphosphate</b> and potassium chloride respectively (Germishuizen 1979). The trials were planted in 1971 at a 1.37 [*]×[*] 1.37  m spacing (equivalent to 5330 stems per hectare (sph) with a plot size of six rows by six rows, {{which was a}} much higher planting density than the standard 2.7 [*]×[*] 2.7  m spacing (equivalent to 1372 sph). At almost 4  years of age, mechanical thinning was conducted over the whole diameter distribution to decrease the stand density by 50 % (to 2665 sph) (Morris: Trial series B 43 : Comparison of establishment method on first and second rotation sites, Unpublished). Estimates of standing volume were made in 1976, 1978 and 1982 at 4, 6 and 10  years age respectively (Morris: Trial series B 43 : Site preparation and fertilizer application at time of planting, part 1 : Influence on volume increment, Unpublished).|$|E
40|$|Two {{granular}} {{formulations of}} phosphorus biofertilizers combining rock phosphate and two highly active phosphate solubilizing strains: Acinetobacter species 305 and Pseudomonas species 181 а have been investigated. Granules of about 3 mm in size {{were obtained by}} contact-convective drying of a mixture of ground ore, concentrated biomass of two different strains, starch and glucose. Micro granules with size of 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm were obtained by spray drying the biomass of two different strains and application of dried cells on the particles of the ground ore. Starch {{was used as a}} binder. In the model liquid medium it was shown that the microorganisms have retained the ability to solubilize mineral phosphates in granular formulations prepared. In laboratory pot trial on marigold (Tagetes patula) it was demonstrated that both formulations of biofertilizer increased the dry weight of the plants to the same level as that of chemical fertilizer - <b>double</b> <b>superphosphate,</b> but were inferior in the concentration of phosphorus in plants. Both formulations exceeded the effectiveness of rock phosphate and biomass used as biofertilizers both separately and jointly. No significant differences were noted between the two strains and the two granular formulations both for plant dry weight, and the content of phosphorus therein. Both granular formulations of biofertilizer retained their structure and avoided aggregating over a year of storage at 4 oC. The average persistence of living cells in the microbeads was about 1. 5 %, in granules - 32...|$|E
