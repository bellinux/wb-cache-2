60|$|Mr. Westwood {{has made}} a {{catalogue}} of books cited by Walton in his Compleat Angler. There is AElian (who makes the first known reference to fly-fishing); Aldrovandus, De Piscibus (1638); Dubravius, De Piscibus (1559); and the English translation (1599) Gerard's Herball (1633); Gesner, De Piscibus (s.a.) and Historia Naturalis (1558); Phil. Holland's Pliny (1601); Rondelet, De Piscibus Marines (1554); Silvianus Aquatilium Historiae (1554): these nearly exhaust Walton's supply of authorities in natural history. He was devoted, as we saw, to authority, and had a childlike faith in the fantastic theories which date from Pliny. 'Pliny hath an opinion that many flies have their birth, or being, from a dew that in the spring falls upon the leaves of trees.' It is a pious opinion! Izaak is hardly so superstitious {{as the author of}} The Angler's Vade Mecum. I cannot imagine him taking 'Man's fat and cat's fat, of each half an ounce, mummy finely powdered, three drains,' {{and a number of other}} abominations, to 'make an Oyntment according to Art, and when you Angle, anoint 8 inches of the line next the Hook therewith.' Or, 'Take the Bones and Scull of a <b>Dead-man,</b> at the opening of a Grave, and beat the same into Pouder, and put of this Pouder in the Moss wherein you keep your Worms,--but others like Grave Earth as well.' No doubt grave earth is quite as efficacious.|$|E

50|$|Where {{the single}} line section {{is part of}} a through route, then it is likely that each passing train would require to {{surrender}} and collect a token at each token station. Where the trains stop at every station this is a convenient arrangement, but where some trains run through without requiring to make a call, it was necessary for the signalman to exchange tokens with the fireman (in the case of steam trains) as the train passed at slow speed. In the case of driver-only operated trains, a <b>dead-mans</b> hold over button was provided, so the driver could exchange the token without the emergency brake being applied. A large staff could be handed over without any special apparatus, but if the system in use employed miniature staffs, tablets or key tokens, these were usually placed in a leather pouch attached to a hoop, and the fireman could put his arm through the hoop held up by the signalman, and vice versa as the locomotive ran past. In UK practice the permitted speed for this was 15 mph in daylight, but there are stories of drivers anxious to make up lost time when running late, and passing the exchange point at much higher speeds; bruised upper arms were common among signalmen and firemen on such lines.|$|R
50|$|The prophecy of The White King is an English political-astrological prophecy {{dating from}} medieval times. In its earlier form {{it may have}} {{referred}} to Stephen, King of England (c. 1092-1154).

50|$|Interest in dead-man's {{controls}} {{increased with}} the introduction of electric streetcars and especially electrified rapid transit trains, though <b>dead-man</b> equipment was quite rare on US streetcars until the successful PCC streetcar, which had a left-foot operated dead-man's pedal in conjunction with the right-foot operated brake and power pedals. This layout has continued to be used on some modern trams around the world. In conventional steam railroad trains, there was always a second person with the engineer, the fireman, who could almost always bring the train to a stop if necessary. For many decades this practice continued on electric and diesel locomotives, even though a single person could theoretically operate them.|$|E

50|$|The MB-4H {{has been}} {{designed}} to work over varying beach environments and can easily launch and recover inshore lifeboats via a A85 DoDo (drive-on, drive-off) launch cradle/carriage. It will comfortably work at full power into up to 2 m of calm water. The tractor is divided into two sections with the front section housing the power unit, hydraulic oil tank for the front axle, hydraulic pumps, cooling systems and the fuel tank. The rear section houses the rear axle, hydraulic winch with 100 meters of cable, the operator and his/her controls, batteries, electronic control panel, and the drive gear. The driver's seat within the cockpit can face forward or rear, with duplicated controls front and back, allowing the operator flexibility during deployment or retrieval of the DoDo trailer and payload. This allows the combination to drive to the launch site and then reverse round to launch the lifeboat into the sea. The rear-facing controls have the addition of a third foot pedal which is the <b>dead-man</b> control for the winch. The MB-4H has an automatic hydrostatic transmission which gives the tractor an ever-variable ground speed which corresponds to engine speed and ground/sea-bed conditions. To give the tractor excellent handling ability, the vehicle has a pivot steer type with all electrical, mechanical and hydraulic links passing through central wire-reinforced hose. The design allows the tractor to have a steering articulation of 40 degrees to the left or right and results in a turning circle of only ten metres.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{two-dimensional}} cold model, the dynamic behavior of particles in blast furnace was studied by {{the observation of}} the flow. The field of the flow was affected at the stagnant region (called <b>Dead-man)</b> formed in the central {{lower part of the}} apparatus. Usually, moving particles in the flow region do not go inside <b>Dead-man.</b> However, if <b>Dead-man</b> repeats ups and downs by the fusion iron, there could be a renewal of particles through the boundary of <b>Dead-man.</b> In our experiment, we simulate the renewal of <b>Dead-man</b> using the water and the plastic particles, which a density ratio was adjusted to by the real blast furnace...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to numerically simulate iron flow and heat transfer in the hearth of a blast furnace by solving the three-dimensional turbulent Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the transport equation of energy at steady state. Under the effects of conjugate heat transfer and natural convection, a computational fluid dynamic calculation was performed to generate flow field in the hearth and the temperature distribution in the refractories during the tapping process. The accuracy and computation of the model is validated using operation data from BHP Steel's No. 5 blast furnace. The shear stress and heat flux on the wall were then predicted for the different vertical movements, shapes of the coke zone (<b>dead-man),</b> and the lengths of the tap-hole. As shown in the results, it is worth noticing that an increase in the tap-hole length causes the peak values of shear stress to shift in the increasing azimuthal direction at a particular plane, and the location of the peak value of shear stress coincides with the location of higher temperature actually measured on the hearth wall, signifying enhanced heat transfer to the wall at location of peak stress.

40|$|The erosion {{caused by}} mass {{transfer}} in hearth {{is the most}} important factor for determining blast furnace campaign life. To support a helpful insight information of mass transfer for the hearth of the No. 2 blast furnace at CSC (China Steel Corporation), a numerical model including the mass transfer of carbon in thermal convective flow from a blast furnace hearth has been developed during the steady tapping process (based on a uninterrupted tapping process assumption). The three dimensional Navier-Stokes equation combined with the transport equations of energy and species with conjugate heat transfer and physical dissolution source is solved by the finite control volume scheme subjected to the segregated iterate under propriety boundary conditions. The results showed the concentration distribution of carbon expressed in terms of mass flux for analyzing the erosion of carbon brick in the blast furnace hearth with the different conditions including the status of <b>dead-man,</b> production of liquid iron, carbon concentration at the inlet, and porosity distribution in coke zone during tapping process at steady state. The result is useful to mitigate the erosion caused by mass transfer, and prolong the life span of the blast furnace. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} is an {{important}} unit for producing pig iron in the steel industry. The hearth of the blast furnace plays a critical role for the furnace campaign life. The erosion of the blast furnace hearth is significantly affected by the temperature distributions inside the hearth. Understanding the heat transfer characteristics of the blast furnace hearth is crucial to direct hearth operation and relining. A 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model had been developed to simulate the molten iron flow and heat transfer in a blast furnace hearth. Parametric studies focused {{on the effects of}} thermal conductivity, heat transfer coefficient, and <b>dead-man</b> shape. The application of the CFD model has provided recommendations for selecting the materials for the cooling wall and refractory. This research also introduces an application which uses Virtual Reality (VR) to visualize CFD results of a blast furnace hearth in a tracked immersive projection system. The VR technology made it possible for researchers to analyze a vast amount of CFD data in a virtual environment. The research mainly focuses on integration of CFD simulation data and VR technology to create a realistic virtual blast furnace hearth presenting complex operations and phenomenon. The virtual environment can help people easily understand the detailed operating information. The system also provides a useful training tool for new operators and engineers, who can learn, operate and design blast furnaces more efficiently. ...|$|E
40|$|We geared {{this project}} towards {{assisting}} {{an individual with}} limited[1] motor function to operate a wheelchair. The product targets individuals who find use of a joystick is ineffective or painful. We focused our design on the wheelchair bought from Adaptive Driving Systems (Driving, 2013); but ultimately {{we would like to}} field a final product capable of applying to any electric wheelchair. Our goal: a person to operate the electric wheelchair using sensors that transmit a translation of an individualâ€™s hand movement through a wireless transmission to a microcontroller installed on the wheel chair that then controls the wheelchairâ€™s movement. A bonus of this design is the operator does not have to sit in the wheel chair to operate it, (thereby giving the operator remote control of the chair) allowing them to call the chair to their person from across the room. We designed the primary sensing mechanism to be as nonintrusive as possible. We used a compact sensor and minimal other components that all would comfortably attach to the arm. A future design goal is to outfit this circuitry with waterproof packaging, therefore eliminating the risks of damaging the device or harming the person during daily activities in kitchen or bathroom facilities. Another safety measure that we include in our design is an automatic stop feature thatâ€”when triggeredâ€”will disengage the wheelchair operation and the wheelchair will remain on but inoperable until the emergency stop is disengaged (similar to a car in park). The switch circuitry will be implemented as a <b>dead-man</b> switch like mechanism and prevent the chair from moving if the switch is not active. We estimate that our design costs about $ 200 which by our research is less than half the price of any other alternative systems on the market. The basic hardware of this system includes Xbee radios, Xbee shields, an Arduino board, two DACs, external AAA battery power supply, and an ArduIMU + V 3. Our current prototype is not exceptionally visually appealing but we anticipate that, the final product could be fabricated in an aesthetically appealing glove design for the user by utilizing flexible circuit or wearable circuit technology, making our product far more desirable to customers than other systems currently available on the market. [1] Limited in this case would not include total paralysis; the operator would need some motion capability of their own arms...|$|E
