Aliasing typically manifests itself as jaggies, or jagged edges on objects where the pixel grid is visible. In order to remove aliasing, all rendering algorithms (if they are to produce good-looking images) must use some kind of low-pass filter on the <b>image</b> <b>function</b> to remove high frequencies, a process called antialiasing.|$|E

50|$|With the {{transfer}} of the airfield to the Maltese Government, who planned to convert Hal Far airfield into an industrial area, MIACO was asked to vacate its hangars and offices by September 1978. Both runways have been dug up and further development of the area reduced the airfield to a scar on the land. Runway 13/31 is currently being used by the Malta Drag Racing Association as a quarter mile dragstrip. Runway 9/27 is now a public road linking the various sections of the industrial area. Its scar can still be clearly seen on Google Maps when using the satellite <b>image</b> <b>function.</b> The control tower and the officer's quarters are still intact, together with a few Nissen huts.

40|$|We {{identify}} which hash function {{has the best}} characteristics for various applications. In some of those the computation speed {{may be the most}} important, in others the ability to distinguish similar images, and sometimes the robustness of the hash against attacks is the primary goal. We compare the hash functions and provide test results. The block mean value based <b>image</b> hash <b>function</b> outperforms the other hash functions in terms of speed. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) based <b>image</b> hash <b>function</b> is the slowest. Although the Marr- Hildreth operator based <b>image</b> hash <b>function</b> is neither the fastest nor the most robust, it offers by far the best discriminative abilities. Interestingly enough, the performance in terms of discriminative ability does not depend on the content of the images. That is, no matter whether the visual appearance of the images compared was very similar or not, the performance of the particular hash function did not change significantly. Different image operations, like horizontal flipping, rotating or resizing, were used to test the robustness of the <b>image</b> hash <b>functions.</b> An interesting result is that none of the tested <b>image</b> hash <b>function</b> is robust against flipping an image horizontally...|$|R
50|$|Understood dynamically, Chu spaces {{transform}} in {{the manner}} of topological spaces, with A as the set of points, X as the set of open sets, and r as the membership relation between them, where K is the set of all possible degrees of membership of a point in an open set. The counterpart of a continuous function from (A, r, X) to (B, s, Y) is a pair (f, g) of functions f : A → B, g : Y → X satisfying the adjointness condition s(f(a), y) = r(a, g(y)) for all a ∈ A and y ∈ Y. That is, f maps points forwards {{at the same time as}} g maps states backwards. The adjointness condition makes g the inverse <b>image</b> <b>function</b> f−1, while the choice of X for the codomain of g corresponds to the requirement for continuous functions that the inverse image of open sets be open. Such a pair is called a Chu transform or morphism of Chu spaces.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structural}} resolution achievable using SPDM can {{be expressed}} in terms of the smallest measurable distance between two in their spatial position determined punctiform particle of different spectral characteristics ("topological resolution"). Modeling has shown that under suitable conditions regarding the precision of localization, particle density etc., the [...] "topological resolution" [...] corresponds to a [...] "space frequency" [...] which in terms of the classical definition is equivalent to a much improved optical resolution. [...] SPDM is a localization microscopy which achieves an effective optical resolution several times better than the conventional optical resolution (approx. 200-250 nm), represented by the half-width of the main maximum of the effective point <b>image</b> <b>function.</b> By applying suitable laser optical precision processes, position and distances significantly smaller than the half-width of the point spread function (conventionally 200-250 nm) can be measured with nanometer accuracy between targets with different spectral signatures. An important area of application is genome research (study of the functional organization of the genome). Another important area of use is research into the structure of membranes.|$|E

40|$|In {{relation}} to the dynamic tests of materials, the approach to solve the viscoelastic wave propagations in a one dimensional viscoelastic rod was summarized.

Inversely transforming these <b>image</b> <b>functions</b> gives {{the results of the}} stress, velocity, and strain in the bar. Two wave problems occurred in split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests are analyzed: 1) the problem of evaluating the internal stress distributions in a viscoelastic specimen; and 2) the problem of stress wave propagations in a viscoelastic bar. Both problems were solved numerically by way of numerical inverse Laplace transform. For the first problem, the special case when the specimen is pure elastic was solved analytically, giving the exact {{solution to the problem of}} elastic wave propagation in a sandwich elastic media...|$|R
