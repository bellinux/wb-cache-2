25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine <b>design,</b> <b>optimization</b> is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the resistance to heat transfer.|$|E

30|$|In summary, in this section, we {{have built}} on our recent {{developments}} on PCZ implementation [7] and incorporated additional <b>design</b> <b>optimizations</b> to further improve performance. The new <b>design</b> <b>optimizations</b> discussed here include minimizing the rate of data transfers, enhancing coalesced access of GM, optimized utilization of SM, and enhanced GPU utilization by reducing thread granularity (operation complexity). The result is a simpler architecture with reduced bottlenecks and elimination of a dominant sequential loop. Collectively, these optimizations result in significant further improvement in throughput and latency.|$|R

2500|$|As {{mechanical}} engineering begins {{to merge with}} other disciplines, as seen in mechatronics, multidisciplinary <b>design</b> <b>optimization</b> (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process. [...] MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{powerful}} and very popular application for random numbers in numerical simulation is in numerical optimization. The {{problem is to}} minimize (or maximize) functions of some vector that often has {{a large number of}} dimensions. Many problems can be phrased in this way: for example, a computer chess program could be seen as trying to find the set of, say, 10 moves that produces the best evaluation function at the end. In the traveling salesman problem the goal is to minimize distance traveled. There are also applications to engineering design, such as multidisciplinary <b>design</b> <b>optimization.</b> It has been applied with quasi-one-dimensional models to solve particle dynamics problems by efficiently exploring large configuration space. Reference [...] is a comprehensive review of many issues related to simulation and optimization.|$|E
2500|$|For example, when {{designing}} a paper mill, one can seek {{to decrease the}} amount of capital invested in a paper mill and {{enhance the quality of}} paper simultaneously. If the design of a paper mill is defined by large storage volumes and paper quality is defined by quality parameters, then the problem of optimal design of a paper mill can include objectives such as: i) minimization of expected variation of those quality parameter from their nominal values, ii) minimization of expected time of breaks and iii) minimization of investment cost of storage volumes. Here, maximum volume of towers are design variables. This example of optimal design of a paper mill is a simplification of the model used in. [...] Multi-objective <b>design</b> <b>optimization</b> have also been implemented in engineering systems - e.g. design of nano-CMOS semiconductors, design of solar-powered irrigation systems, optimization of sand mould systems, engine design, optimal sensor deployment and optimal controller design.|$|E
