40|$|Asbestos {{diseases}} are {{closely associated with}} cancer and death. They are therefore widely recognised for their insidious, fearsome and tainted nature. Through an examination of stress associated with disease, the paper explores the medical and legal framings of asbestos disease in the UK and complements them with an investigation of laggers’ (or thermal insulation engineers) personal and bodily experience of asbestos diseases. These emic perspectives are then contextualised through examination {{of the social and}} political-economic ramifications of disease and litigation in a context of increasing distrust of science and of authority. The paper argues that victims of asbestos-related diseases draw on – and extend – medical and statistical estimations of disease; but also challenge medical notions of cause and effect while advancing their perspective based on lived experience. The paper also shows that laggers are facing uncertain futures as a result of industrial exposure to asbestos, while their way of life and socio-economic standing is also under threat.

40|$|Hong Kong (HK) is {{currently}} assessing its future policy on renewable energy and public consultation indicates greater support {{for renewable energy}} than previously envisaged, including “willingness-to-pay” for green electricity and also that the present (1 % by 2012, 2 % by 2017 and 3 % by 2022) targets are too conservative. This paper considers the role of de-centralised energy generation by looking at sector-by-sector energy generation and use, in this paper, schools. In HK, schools are horizontally biased compared with the vertical emphasis of other sectors. This paper assesses {{the contribution of the}} extensive photovoltaic (PV) arrays installed on the Ma Wan School to meet 10 % of the School's annual electricity demand based on the first four months data and compared with the project inception simulation studies plus the impact of a specially developed Schools Building Energy Management System (BEMS) to raise awareness of energy efficient use in classrooms.

5000|$|The Autotron spurred spinoffs: the Secatron (1954) for carton {{makers to}} ensure their {{pictures}} were centred; the Webatron for bag making machines; the Trakatron (1953) for the special requirements of cellophane and paper printers, and the Inkatron (1960) for sheet-fed offset presses. At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The Synchroscope gave machine minders the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop [...] "speckling", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas. In 1966 the Heliostat, which applied an electric charge of several thousand volts to attract ink to paper, appeared. By then Crosfield {{had the support of}} a team of talented researchers, <b>installation</b> <b>engineers,</b> a production facility and sales and administrative staff.|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} literature in public lighting contains {{a number of}} theoretical models to assess the quality of lighting <b>installations.</b> <b>Engineers</b> also use normative and state-of-the-art documents {{in order to achieve}} a given quality level. Such variety of models and practices may raise some questions. We make an overview of the theoretical models on which road lighting quality indexes are currently based, as well as some normative procedures and recommended practices. We try to point out their theoretical background and their purpose. This rapid overview leads us to separate 4 levels in the engineering process of building a quality index for road lighting applications. The first level is the functional one: the main objective of the lighting installation (e. g. road safety) must be specified. The second level is that of the task: once the objective is set, a corresponding visual task (e. g. target detection) must be identified. The third level is to collect vision science data {{in order to make a}} vision model of the task, and of the appropriate thresholds. The fourth level is the operational one: a measurement method must be defined, based on the vision model, for the actual assessment of the quality index of road lighting installations...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{a lot of}} {{initiatives}} were taken to improve the collaboration between actors in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry. ‘Integration’ seems to be amongst the most used aims to enhance collaboration in these initiatives. To achieve integration, one might distinguish between integration of process and product. This paper reports a quantitative study into the relationship between process requirements based on the collaborative design process {{and the level of}} integration of the architectural and climate design of a building. This study continues previous work of Prins and Kruijne (2011). Their definition of design integration is reformulated and their set of twelve criteria has been re-examined and adapted. This research provides evidence as of how to operationalize integration, as a ‘soft’ architectural quality. Through a questionnaire the design process of 168 projects was analysed focusing on several process requirements in terms of intensity of collaboration and {{the very nature of the}} collaboration of architects and climate <b>installation</b> <b>engineers.</b> Using logistic regression modelling, three process requirements (i. e. the moment of involvement of the engineer during the project, the architect as project manager during the initiative phase, and the ambition of the client) were found to significantly explain the level of integration of the architectural and climate installation design of projects. These requirements emphasise the importance of the initiative phase of the project in relation to the finally obtained level of product integration.
