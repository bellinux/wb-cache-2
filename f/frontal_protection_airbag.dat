25|$|In 1994, {{to add to}} its SIPS, Volvo was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} side airbags and installed them as standard equipment in all models from 1995. At the start of the 1995 model year, side impact <b>protection</b> <b>airbags</b> were standard on high trim-level Volvo 850s, and optional on other 850s. By the middle of the production year, they were standard on all 850s. In model year 1995, SIPS airbags became standard on all Volvo models.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> System (FPS) is {{a device}} fitted {{to the front}} end of a vehicle to protect both {{pedestrians}} and cyclists who are involved in the unfortunate event of a front-end collision with a vehicle.|$|R
50|$|This {{legislation}} {{amounts to}} a de facto ban on <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> Systems, due to {{the high cost of}} compliance and type testing, and the sheer complexity of the law. The type testing procedure can be seen here.|$|R
50|$|Subaru’s EyeSight {{suite of}} active safety {{functions}} is available, as {{is a new}} infotainment system with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. In the North American and Australian market models, CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all trims. The North American model Impreza Limited is also offered with a power driver's seat {{for the first time}} in the model's history. Although not present in the North American model, the new Impreza is also the first car ever produced by a Japanese brand to include a pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>airbag</b> as standard.|$|R
50|$|<b>Frontal</b> <b>protection</b> of 80/100 mm would {{guarantee}} equal performance with the machines designed by other nations, {{such as the}} Russian 1944 Iosef Stalin 2 of 44 tons (which was 122 mm) , the Tiger I of 57 tons and higher than the Panther of 45 tons, which was 80 mm.|$|R
50|$|The tank's welded turret {{is of an}} angular {{design with}} spaced modular armor and {{composite}} panels. The <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> {{is comparable to the}} Russian T-90A and Western tanks. Applique armor consists of modular armor mentioned above and track skirts. The Type 99A2 may mount 3rd generation (Relikt-type) ERA.|$|R
5000|$|Bullbars {{incorporating}} a winch are often known as [...] "winch bumpers", {{especially in the}} UK where the sale of bullbars that do not meet European standards, as mentioned above, was banned since 2007. However, the legislation was not retrospective, and steel <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> systems can still be legal, for instance when {{incorporating a}} winch fitting.|$|R
500|$|The <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> {{of the gun}} turrets was [...] in {{thickness}} with [...] thick sides, and an [...] {{roof and}} rear. Their barbettes had [...] armor above the deck that reduced to [...] between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck. The forward conning tower had walls [...] thick; those of the aft conning tower were [...] thick.|$|R
50|$|The <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> {{of the gun}} turrets was 280 mm in {{thickness}} with 240 mm thick sides, and an 85 mm {{roof and}} rear. Their barbettes had 230 mm armor above the deck that reduced to 180 mm between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck. The forward conning tower had walls 320 mm thick; those of the aft conning tower were 160 mm thick.|$|R
40|$|Every year {{approximately}} 400 000 pedestrians {{are killed}} worldwide in road related injuries where children and elderly {{are the most}} exposed age groups. The design of the front-end of a vehicle and the structural stiffness have a significant influence on the kinematics and injury risks of the pedestrian body. To create a clearance between the rigid hood structure and the hood, the hood is lifted. A lifted hood does however not provide protection over the cowl, windscreen and A-pillar areas. This study is performed at Autoliv Sverige AB and {{the purpose is to}} examine how fast the hood can be lifted 100 mm using a pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>airbag.</b> The airbag give an extended protection while covering the cowl, windscreen and A-pillar areas. A concept generation session was performed where modifications of the current pedestrian <b>protection</b> <b>airbag,</b> for a faster hood lift, were proposed. The generated concepts proceeded to a concept screening session where the Autoliv evaluation matrix was used. The selected concepts went further to static testing where the performance of each concept was tested. The performance include the lift time of 100 mm for the most rearward section of the hood, positioning of the cushion and pressure distribution. The tests were carried out in a room temperature environment. To conclude the thesis work, one winning concept could not be obtained. Two concepts excelled themselves from all the concepts and a difference in the performances between these two concepts could not be found. In this thesis no calculations on costs such as material costs and manufacturing costs has been made. This can be the major aspect on choosing one winning concept but {{due to the fact that}} there is no time for a cost analysis in this thesis, the PPA development team will take over...|$|R
50|$|Testing in 2001 {{showed that}} steel bull bars {{could lead to}} greater risk of injury. Later studies carried out by MIRA, one of the UK's leading testing-facilities, may have proved that the latest {{development}} of a vehicle <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> System can make many 4x4 vehicles safer {{in the event of}} front-end collisions with pedestrians or cyclists. Calculations based on these tests show that if fitted to a current large 4x4 vehicle, an FPS could save lives and reduce serious pedestrian-injuries.|$|R
50|$|The gunner {{sits behind}} {{the driver and}} on the basic model has a cupola with a two-piece hatch cover opening left and right and a single day {{observation}} periscope. A standard 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun is mounted on the forward part of the cupola and most vehicles are fitted with a shield to give limited <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> to the gunner. This model is known under the company designation of the 4K 4FA-G1 with its Austrian Army designation being the usMGSPz (Schützenpanzer/Überschweres MG).|$|R
50|$|This Tigr {{is used by}} the Russian Interior Ministry OMON in {{counter-terrorism}} {{operations and}} territorial defense. It is armoured, with IEC 50963-96 Class 3 side/rear protection and Class 5 <b>frontal</b> <b>protection.</b> The vehicle has accommodations for seven occupants including the driver. Early models permit the firing of personal weapons through one-way portholes in the body. In later models personal weapons can be fired through portholes in the armored glass. An automatic gun carriage can be fitted to the roof, along with radio signal jamming equipment.|$|R
50|$|The ISU-152's 90 mm of sloped frontal armor, in {{contrast}} to the SU-152's 65 mm, provided excellent <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> from the 75mm KwK 40 gun of the ubiquitous Panzer IV and StuG family at all but the closest ranges, while also forcing the original Tiger I, with its vaunted 88mm KwK 36 gun, to close to medium ranges in order to successfully penetrate the vehicle, negating its traditional long-range superiority and exposing more of its vulnerable flanks to the 85mm ZiS-S gun of the Soviet T-34-85.|$|R
50|$|This {{requirement}} is not specifically aimed at bullbars but does effectively prescribe requirements for their construction. ADR 42/00, {{the first version}} of this rule, applied to vehicles built from July 1988. Australian Standard AS4876.1-2002 Motor vehicle <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> systems Part 1: Road user protection was released in 2002, and applies construction rules to all bullbars manufactured since that date, regardless of the age of the vehicle that they are fitted to. Similar requirements for older vehicles fitted with bullbars manufactured before that Australian Standard was implemented exist only in state legislation.|$|R
50|$|The Leopard 2A7+ is {{designed}} to operate both in low intensity and high intensity conflicts. The tank's protection has been increased by modular armour; the <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> has been improved with a dual-kit on the turret and hull front, while 360° protection against RPGs and mine protection increase the survivability of the tank in urban operations. The modular armour's system components were first used by Canada in Afghanistan. It can fire programmable HE munitions and the turret mounted MG3 has been replaced with a stabilized FLW 200 remotely controlled weapon station. The mobility, sustainability and situational awareness have also been improved.|$|R
50|$|Most {{pedestrian}} deaths occur due to {{the traumatic}} brain injury resulting from the hard impact of the head against the stiff hood or windshield. In addition, although usually non-fatal, injuries to the lower limb (usually to the knee joint and long bones) {{are the most common}} cause of disability due to pedestrian crashes. A <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> System (FPS) is a device fitted to the front end of a vehicle to protect both pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in a front end collision with a vehicle. Car design has been shown to have a large impact on the scope and severity of pedestrian injury in car crashes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the test {{procedure}} development phase of the agency’s Improved <b>Frontal</b> <b>Protection</b> research program. It is anticipated that even after all {{cars and light trucks}} have air bags for drivers and front seat passengers there will remain over 8, 000 fatalities a year and over 100, 000 moderate to severe injuries. This research program will address these injuries/fatalities through development of crash tests with impact conditions not currently addressed by FMVSS No. 208, development of additional or more appropriate instrumentation and injury criteria on the test surrogate, and evaluation of other sizes of test surrogates. An analysis of crash data is presented using the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) and th...|$|R
30|$|It was {{simulated}} that a rider collides {{with the}} opening door in the condition of no <b>airbag</b> <b>protection.</b> The injury value was very high, which could cause serious injury to the rider’s head in actual accidents.|$|R
30|$|The {{head injury}} {{value in the}} rider-airbag-car door {{collision}} with <b>airbag</b> <b>protection</b> on the door opening angles of 60 ° and 70 ° are 537 and 769, which are lower than the threshold value of HIC.|$|R
50|$|Given Miranda's low gravity, {{it would}} take about 12 minutes to fall from the top, {{reaching}} the bottom {{at the speed of}} about 200 km/h. Even so, the fall might be survivable given proper <b>airbag</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of RBA (the first variant, which featured only the front ballistic armor plate and no rear armor plate) first saw active frontline service in 1993, {{being used in}} combat in Operation Gothic Serpent (22 August 1993 to 13 October 1993), when Rangers of Task Force Ranger first arrived in Mogadishu, Somalia. There, it {{was used by the}} Rangers of C Company and Command and Control, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. As the early RBA used only a front ballistic plate, it offered only <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> from small arms (rifle) fire. This limited protection resulted in serious injury and/or death for some of the Rangers in Somalia, such as SGT James Joyce, who was killed due to receiving a gunshot wound to his back.|$|R

40|$|During last {{decades the}} {{efficiency}} of the different architectures of evolutionary algorithms in comparison to other heuristic techniques has been tested in various engineering design problems. The evolutionary computing (including genetic algorithms) is used in the case of problems where conventional approaches fail or perform poorly (integer and mixed-integer programming, number of local extremes, number of global extremes, etc). In the current study, an optimization approach that integrates artificial neural networks (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. A number of engineering design problems including: design of car <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> system, modeling of new composite from recycled GFP, design of composite bathtub, material parameters identification problem for advanced yield criteria and optimal material orientation problem of orthotropic linear elastic 3 D materials are solved using global optimization technique.

50|$|Bullbars are {{not allowed}} to cause a vehicle to fail to comply with other ADRs to which they were {{originally}} constructed. This includes visibility of lights, such as headlights and indicators; but it particularly relates to ADR 69/00, the rule for Full <b>frontal</b> impact <b>protection.</b> In order to comply with this rule, bullbars manufactured for vehicles equipped with SRS (airbag systems) must be tested for compatibility with the airbag system.|$|R
40|$|The project {{focuses on}} the stress {{analysis}} of a car <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> system (bumper) simulations. To achieve that, we go to basic concepts of improving the safety on the car by do analysis the car bumper. It {{is important to know}} their mechanical properties, how their failure mechanism during the impact. This analysis was carrying out by using commercial Finite Elements software (ALGOR) to evaluate the behavior of bumper system. Another additional innovative for improving crashworthiness is the use of material to produces the part to absorb energy during the process of a crash. Research concentrates on polymer composite material. It is considering their function, geometry, and other parameters that influence the compatibility of the bumper. In future research, this bumper will face the static test and analyses do on their load distributions by applying the variation of load and locations. Result will be compare for the centre and side load. How the load applied effect the stress distrubution. After that a related study was carried out to know bumper properties during the impact...|$|R
50|$|The Panzer III Ausf. A through C had 15 mm of rolled {{homogeneous}} armour on {{all sides}} with 10 mm {{on the top and}} 5 mm on the bottom. This was quickly determined to be insufficient, and was upgraded to 30 mm on the front, sides and rear in the Ausf. D, E, F, and G models, with the H model having a second 30 mm layer of face-hardened steel applied to the front and rear hull. The Ausf. J model had a solid 50 mm plate on the front and rear, while the Ausf. J¹, L, and M models had an additional layer of offset 20 mm homogeneous steel plate on the front hull and turret, with the M model having an additional 5 mm Schürzen spaced armour on the hull sides, and 8 mm on the turret sides and rear. This additional frontal armor gave the Panzer III <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> from most British and Soviet anti-tank guns at all but close ranges. However, the sides were still vulnerable to many enemy weapons, including anti-tank rifles at close ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The hull {{sides were}} vertical, {{as in the}} case of the Tiger, while the front of the hull was in the first three prototypes evenly {{inclined}} at approximately 40 degrees from the horizontal, using sloped armour similar to that of the Panther and Tiger II. The corners between the glacis and the sides were truncated. The first two prototypes had a <b>frontal</b> <b>protection</b> level equivalent to about 120 mm [...] "line-of-sight" [...] thickness in the horizontal plane. The type was thus not particularly heavily armoured for its time. The armour was intended to provide protection against high-velocity guns in general use at the end of the Second World War. The weight increase with the third prototype was mainly caused by the larger turret and even in its fourth [...] "uparmoured" [...] form, doubling the frontal armour thickness, the AMX 50 was less well protected than its American and British competitors, themselves inferior in armour to the Soviet heavy tanks they had been created to fight. The fifth prototype used a lower cast hull, with a rounded frontal section for a better weight efficiency.|$|R
30|$|Compared {{with that}} of the rider-car door {{collision}} without <b>airbag</b> <b>protection</b> at an opening angle of 60 °, the peak acceleration of the adult head dummy decreases from 260 to 65  g and the value of HIC decreases from 2192 to 537. It shows that the safety performance of the door with airbag in this collision can effectively meet the requirements for head protection of the rider.|$|R
50|$|From 2004, the Academy chassis was {{modified}} slightly and made more rigid. The transmission tunnel was raised slightly, and all cars were supplied with a lowered floorpan, giving the driver {{a couple of}} inches more headroom under the rollcage. The rollcage supplier changed at this point, as cars were supplied with 'Caged' rollover cages with slightly curved bars and different <b>frontal</b> load <b>protection,</b> rather than the 'Safety Devices' cages with straight diagonal bars of 2001 to 2003.|$|R
30|$|Compared {{with that}} of the rider-car door {{collision}} without <b>airbag</b> <b>protection</b> at an opening angle of 70 °, the peak acceleration of the adult head dummy decreases from 375 to 80  g and the value of HIC decreases from 3317 to 769. It can be concluded that the safety performance of the door with airbag in this collision can effectively meet the requirements for head protection of the rider.|$|R
30|$|According to GB/T 24550 - 2009, if {{the value}} of HIC exceeds 1000 in the collision, it is {{regarded}} as serious injury and may lead to danger {{to the life of}} the rider.
