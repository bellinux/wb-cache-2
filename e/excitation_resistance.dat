40|$|A {{technique}} {{based on}} the Anderson loop measurement circuit topology is presented that continuously observes both impedance change and thermoelectric signals while using either AC or DC excitation of the impedance. AC excitation provides better separation of the signals while DC <b>excitation</b> observes only <b>resistance</b> change and results in wider bandwidth. All of the Anderson loop circuit topology benefits are maintained. The technique is illustrated with the simultaneous measurement of resistance variations and temperature by connecting to a strain gage with thermocouple wire...|$|R
40|$|Many {{parameter}} measurement problems, such as conductivity measurement, can {{be transformed}} into parameter estimation for resistance-capacitance (RC) coupling network. In this paper, alternating current (AC) square wave is adopted to excite RC network, and {{on the basis of}} the deduced mathematical model between response signal and <b>excitation</b> signal, <b>resistance</b> parameter, capacitance parameter, our method consists of two steps. 1) Multivariate polynomial is adopted to fit the mathematical model offline. 2) When RC parameters are estimated online, in order to eliminate the effect of measurement uncertainties, multiple AC square waves with different frequencies are adopted to excite RC network in turn, and by using the fitted multivariate polynomial to establish overdetermined equations, the real-time estimation of RC parameters can be obtained by only finite arithmetic operations of Gauss elimination for solving the least squares. Aiming at the RC network in conductivity measurement, experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R

It is shown that induction machines with similar or different parameters and speeds can be operated in parallel and their steady state performance characteristics can be accurately predicted using the proposed method. The performance characteristics of such machines {{are influenced by}} the <b>excitation</b> capacitance, load <b>resistance</b> as well as speeds and parameters of the individual machines. Typical cases have been investigated for a number of test machines operating in parallel. Predictions of the proposed method have been verified experimentally...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model for the}} determination of the acoustic impedance of a perforated plate liner is presented. The model allows the calculation of the effect on acoustic impedance of multiple frequency <b>excitation.</b> A nonlinear <b>resistance</b> model is used in the one-dimensional equations of motion with an arbitrary exciting pressure function. The effects of high amplitude fluid motion, grazing flow, and spectral excitation can thus be studied together. Sample calculations of acoustic resistances are presented using a high amplitude discrete tone superimposed upon a simulated white noise spectrum. The tone amplitude is varied and its effect is shown both with and without a grazing flow velocity...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of low-frequency noise {{properties}} of modern electronic components {{is a very}} demanding challenge due to the low magnitude of a noise signal and the limit of a dissipated power. In such a case, an ac technique with a lock-in amplifier {{or the use of}} a low-noise transformer as the first stage in the signal path are common approaches. A software dual-phase virtual lock-in (VLI) technique has been developed and tested in low-frequency noise studies of electronic components. VLI means that phase-sensitive detection is processed by a software layer rather than by an expensive hardware lock-in amplifier. The VLI method has been tested in exploration of noise in polymer thick-film resistors. Analysis of the obtained noise spectra of voltage fluctuations confirmed that the 1 /f noise caused by resistance fluctuations is the dominant one. The calculated value of the parameter describing the noise intensity of a resistive material, C = 1 · 10 − 21 m 3, is consistent with that obtained {{with the use of a}} dc method. On the other hand, it has been observed that the spectra of (<b>excitation</b> independent) <b>resistance</b> noise contain a 1 /f component whose intensity depends on the excitation frequency. The phenomenon has been explained by means of noise suppression by impedances of the measurement circuit, giving an excellent agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a new kind}} of shock absorber, hydraulic electromagnetic energy-regenerative shock absorber (HESA), which can recover energy from vibration of vehicles. The road <b>excitation</b> frequency, load <b>resistance</b> and damping ratio are found to greatly affect the energy recovery of HESA. Based on a quarter-car model, the optimal load resistance and damping ratio for maximizing the energy-recyclable power are discussed. The results indicate that for any excitation frequency, the energy-recyclable power first increases then decreases with the load resistance increase, and the optimal load resistance is changeable as the excitation frequency changes. Moreover, the energy-recyclable power is more sensitive to excitation frequency than to damping ratio, and the ideal excitation frequency for energy recovery is around the wheel resonant frequency. The exploration of active control of HESA confirms that the damping force varies with the load current magnitude, and the active control can be realized by appropriate matching...|$|R
40|$|The point defects {{of single}} ZnO microwires grown by carbothermal {{reduction}} were studied by microphotoluminescence, photoresistance <b>excitation</b> spectra, and <b>resistance</b> {{as a function}} of the temperature. We found the deep level defect density profile along the microwire showing that the concentration of defects decreases from the base to the tip of the microwires and this effect correlates with a band gap narrowing. The results show a characteristic deep defect levels inside the gap at 0. 88 eV from the top of the VB. The resistance {{as a function of}} the temperature shows defect levels next to the bottom of the CB at 110 meV and a mean defect concentration of 4 × 1018 cm- 3. This combination of techniques allows us to study the band gap values and defects states inside the gap in single ZnO microwires and opens the possibility to be used as a defect spectroscopy method. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{transport}} is conventionally {{determined by}} the momentum-relaxing scattering of electrons by the host solid and its <b>excitations.</b> The electrical <b>resistance</b> is set by geometrical factors and the resistivity, which is a microscopic property of the solid. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in contrast, is determined by geometrical factors, boundary scattering and the viscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal collisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids, brought into focus by the advent of new calculational techniques, has been whether the viscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable {{role in determining the}} resistance. At first sight this seems unlikely, because in almost all known materials the rate of momentum-relaxing collisions dominates that of the momentum-conserving ones that give the viscous term. Here, we show this is not always the case. We report experimental evidence that the resistance of restricted channels of the ultra-pure two-dimensional metal PdCoO_ 2 has a large viscous contribution. Comparison with theory allows an estimate of the electronic viscosity in the range between 6 × 10 ^- 3 kg(ms) ^- 1 and 3 × 10 ^- 4 kg(ms) ^- 1, which brackets that of water at room temperature.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} the problematic of ice impacts on a ships drive train and {{the similarity of}} this work to last year's thesis from Bjørn Eliassen Vik is mentioned. After that the Bond-Graph-Methodology on which this thesis is based in shortly explained. Then the modeling of the coupling is explained. Here the coupling is divided into parts and modeled separately. A particular interest is on the dynamic behavior of the springs. These parts are then joined together. In the next chapter the coupling model is compared to the values given by the manufacturer. It shows that the model is too stiff. Therefore {{the thickness of the}} springs and the bulk-modulus of the oil is adjusted until it matches the template. The model is than tested by varying the <b>excitation</b> frequency, the <b>resistance</b> of the load and the inertia of the coupling. It shows that the frequency has a great influence on the stiffness of the system, the resistance a limited influence and the inertia an influence on the nominal frequency of the system. In the end the coupling is inserted into a drive train model. First it is simulated in open water, than an additional ice load is placed upon the propeller. The results are compared to simulations of the drive train with a simpler coupling and without a coupling. The results show that both couplings have damping capabilities. However, the ice load is too little to determine the effect of sudden peak loads properly...|$|R
40|$|To improve vehicle {{fuel economy}} whilst {{enhancing}} road handling and ride comfort, power generating suspension systems have recently attracted increased attention in automotive engineering. This paper presents our {{study of a}} regenerative hydraulic shock absorber system which converts the oscillatory motion of a vehicle suspension into unidirectional rotary motion of a generator. Firstly a model which {{takes into account the}} influences of the dynamics of hydraulic flow, rotational motion and power regeneration is developed. Thereafter the model parameters of fluid bulk modulus, motor efficiencies, viscous friction torque, and voltage and torque constant coefficients are determined based on modelling and experimental studies of a prototype system. The model is then validated under different input <b>excitations</b> and load <b>resistances,</b> obtaining results which show good agreement between prediction and measurement. In particular, the system using piston-rod dimensions of 50 – 30 mm achieves recoverable power of 260 W with an efficiency of around 40 % under sinusoidal excitation of 1 Hz frequency and 25 mm amplitude when the accumulator capacity is set to 0. 32 L with the load resistance 20 Ω. It is then shown that the appropriate damping characteristics required from a shock absorber in a heavy-haulage vehicle can be met by using variable load resistances and accumulator capacities in a device akin to the prototype. The validated model paves the way for further system optimisation towards maximising the performance of regeneration, ride comfort and handling...|$|R
30|$|In view of {{the large}} number of {{available}} alternatives to produce hybrids and conjugates for bioapplications, carbohydrates have been often chosen, due to their biocompatibility, physicochemical and mechanical properties, and relative chemical solubility and stability in aqueous physiological environment [5 – 8]. Among these carbohydrates, chitosan (poly-β(1 [*]→[*] 4)- 2 -amino- 2 -deoxy-d-glucose) {{is one of the most}} abundant polysaccharides (semi-processed) from natural sources, second only to cellulose [5 – 8]. Chitosan is a polycationic polymer that has been broadly used in pharmaceuticals, drug carrier and delivery systems, wound dressing biomaterial, antimicrobial films, biomaterials, food packaging and many applications [5 – 10]. Chitosan is mainly produced from the alkaline deacetylation of chitin (usually extracted from the shells of marine crustaceans, such as crabs and shrimps), forming a copolymer composed of N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-glucosamine units available in different grades, depending upon the content of the acetylated moieties [5 – 8]. The degree of deacetylation (DD) and the molar mass (MM) of chitosan influence its properties, such as solubility in water, mechanical behaviour, chemical stability and biodegradability. Similarly, there are several alternatives of one-dimensional and zero-dimensional nanostructured inorganic materials, such as nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods and quantum dots, that are suitable for conjugation with carbohydrates to produce hybrid nanomaterials for bioapplications [11 – 13]. Quantum dots (QDs) are ultra-small semiconductor nanocrystals that consist of numbers of atoms in the range of a few thousands. Owing to their reduced dimension, QDs exhibit discrete electronic energy levels that give rise to unique electronic, optical and magnetic properties [13 – 16]. They have rapidly emerged as a new class of fluorescent nanomaterials for a boundless number of applications, primarily as probes in biology, medicine and pharmacy. Having many advantages over organic dyes, such as broad <b>excitation</b> and <b>resistance</b> to photobleaching, QDs are one of the most exciting tools for use in nanotechnology, nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology areas [13]. However, to be used in biological conditions, QDs must exhibit compatibility to the water-based physiological medium in which {{the large number of}} natural macromolecules exist. Therefore, surface chemical engineering of QDs is required to render them water soluble and biocompatible. Surprisingly, reports on the surface bio-functionalisation of QDs with chitosan and its derivatives are scarcely found in the literature [5, 17 – 20], and only recently has the direct synthesis of CdS QDs using chitosan and chemically modified chitosans in aqueous colloidal dispersion been published by our group [17 – 19]. Despite the noticeable advances in the synthesis of nanohybrids based on the conjugation of QDs and biomolecules, to date, most published studies and commercial QDs are synthesised through the traditional organometallic method and contain toxic elements, such as cadmium, lead and mercury, using organic solvents and ligands (trioctyl phosphine/trioctyl phosphine oxide, TOP/TOPO) at high temperatures. Presently, the most commonly used QDs contain divalent cadmium, widely known as a toxin, due to the accumulation of Cd 2 + in tissues and organs [13, 21, 22]. Although Cd 2 + is incorporated into a nanocrystalline core (as components of low-solubility sulphides or selenides) covered by another semiconductor 'shell’ like ZnS and surrounded by biologically compatible ligands, such as polymers, amino acids, proteins and carbohydrates [23 – 27], it is still unclear if these toxic ions will impact the use of QDs as clinical luminescent probes for biomedical applications. Consequently, great concern has been raised over the toxicity of QDs made by heavy-metal cores in living cells, animals and humans, and in the environment as the long-term impact is not entirely understood [5, 22]. In that sense, 'cadmium-free’ nanomaterials are very promising alternatives, such as zinc compounds [5, 28], due to their natural environmental abundance. Zinc divalent cations (Zn 2 +) are commonly found in nature, in forms varying from mineral inorganic sources to several living organisms as crucial metabolic species.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the development of microfabricated fluxgate type magnetic sensors operating within a wide linear operation range. Fluxgate type magnetic sensors are powerful devices due to their high sensitivity, low offset, and high temperature stability. Unfortunately, their linear operation range is limited, since an attempt to increase the linear range also increases the power dissipation of the sensor for the traditionally used parallel fluxgate configuration. In this study, microfabricated fluxgate sensors with wide linear operation range and low power dissipation are developed {{with the use of the}} orthogonal fluxgate configuration and a closed magnetization path for the excitation. In the scope of this work, three different fluxgate microsensor structures suitable for operation within a wide linear range are developed, fabricated, and characterized. The sensor structures are named as: rod type orthogonal macro fluxgate sensor, rod type orthogonal micro fluxgate sensor, and ring type micro fluxgate sensor. All of the structures have a CMOS compatible fabrication process flow. Furthermore, the rod type micro sensor and the ring type micro sensor are fabricated by using only standard thin film deposition and photolithography techniques, enabling batch fabrication of these sensor structures. All of the structures use planar sensing coils and an electroplated FeNi core. Apart from the design and development of the sensor, the FeNi electroplating process is intensively investigated since this process directly affects the performance of the sensors. The rod type orthogonal macro fluxgate sensor uses a 20 µm diameter gold bonding wire as the excitation rod, and a 10 µm thick FeNi core electroplated over the bonding wire. The AC current passing through the excitation rod creates a periodical excitation field in the radial direction, which is always perpendicular to the external magnetic field to be detected along the core. With this sensor, the idea of increasing the linear operation range without increasing the power dissipation by using a closed magnetization path and the orthogonal structure is verified. By using a 200 mA-peak sinusoidal excitation current at 100 kHz, passing through the low <b>resistance</b> <b>excitation</b> rod, a linear operation range of ± 2. 5 mT is reached with a 0. 5 mm long core, whereas the linear range is ± 250 µT with a 4 mm long core. The rod type orthogonal micro fluxgate sensor {{presents a}} modified version of the macro sensor, which can be fabricated in wafer level with standard deposition and photolithography techniques. For this sensor, the excitation rod is formed with an electroplated layer of copper which is sandwiched between two FeNi layers forming the ferromagnetic core. The cross-sectional dimensions of the excitation rod and the core are 8 µm × 2 µm, and 16 µm × 10 µm, respectively. The sensor operates with 100 mA-peak sinusoidal excitation current at 100 kHz, and the linear operation range for different sensors having 0. 5, 1, and 2 mm long cores are 1100, 410, and 160 µT, respectively. The linear operation range is independent of the excitation conditions for current peaks larger than 100 mA, which is required to saturate the core, and operating frequencies lower than 200 kHz, where the skin effect is not dominant. The sensitivity, perming, the equivalent magnetic noise density, and the power dissipation of the 0. 5 mm long sensor are 102. 8 µV/mT, 7. 1 µT, 268 nT/√Hz @ 1 Hz, and 10 mW, respectively for the given excitation conditions. The noise analysis showed that the noise of the sensor increases with decreasing sensor dimensions. The ring type micro fluxgate sensor has a core composed of cascaded planar 2 µm thick FeNi rings which can be fabricated in a single electroplating step, increasing the control of the magnetic properties of the core. The excitation rod passes through the middle of the FeNi rings as a sewing thread, providing a planar circular excitation loop. The angle between the excitation field and the external magnetic field changes according to the position on the ring, which leads to a partially orthogonal partially parallel fluxgate operation mode. The tests of the sensors showed that the maximum operating frequency is extended to 1 MHz level, which is due to the thinner FeNi layer. A sinusoidal current with 180 mA-peak at 1 MHz is used for the excitation of the sensors. A linear operation range of 2 mT and a sensitivity of 730 µV/mT is reached with a 4 -ring structure, with the rings having 22 µm and 38 µm inner and outer radius, respectively. The comparison of the developed sensors with the previously reported state of the art sensors show that the first microfabricated fluxgate sensors having a wide linear operation range and low power dissipation are realized as an accomplishment of this work. All the sensors are CMOS compatible, and a sensor system can be realized by using the metallization layers of a CMOS process for producing the sensing coils, and fabricating the cores on wafers as a post process...|$|R
