40|$|The phenomenal {{spread of}} the Internet places an {{enormous}} demand on content-ownership-validation. In this thesis, four new image-watermarking methods are presented. One method is based on discrete-wavelet-transformation (DWT) only while the rest are based on DWT and singular-value-decomposition (SVD) ensemble. The main target for this thesis is to reach a new blind-watermarking-method. Method IV presents such watermark using QR-codes. The use of QR-codes in watermarking is novel. The choice of such application {{is based on the}} fact that QR-Codes have errors self-correction-capability of 5 % or higher which satisfies the nature of digital-image-processing. Results show that the proposed-methods introduced minimal distortion to the watermarked images as compared to other methods and are robust against JPEG, resizing and other attacks. Moreover, watermarking-method-II provides a solution to the detection of <b>false</b> <b>watermark</b> in the literature. Finally, method IV presents a new QR-code guided watermarking-approach that can be used as a steganography as well. [...] Leaf ii.

40|$|Temporal {{synchronization}} is {{an important}} part of any audio watermarking system which involves an analog audio signal transmission. We propose a synchronization method based on the insertion of two-dimensional reference patterns in the time-frequency domain. The synchronization patterns consist of a combination of orthogonal sequences and are continuously embedded along with the transmitted data, so that the information capacity of the watermark is not affected. We investigate the relation between synchronization robustness and payload robustness and show that the length of the synchronization pattern can be used to tune a trade-off between synchronization robustness and the probability of <b>false</b> positive <b>watermark</b> decodings. Interpreting the two-dimensional binary patterns as one-dimensional N-ary sequences, we derive a bound for the autocorrelation properties of these sequences to facilitate an exhaustive search for good patterns...|$|R
40|$|Assessing that a {{probability}} of false alarm is below a given significance level {{is a crucial}} issue in watermarking. We propose an iterative and self-adapting algorithm which estimates very low probabilities of error. Some experimental investigations validates its performance for a rare detection scenario where there exists a close form formula of the probability of false alarm. Our algorithm appears to be much quicker and more accurate than a classical Monte Carlo estimator. It even allows the experimental measurement of error exponents.

40|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of existing watermarking methods is their limited resistance to extensive geometric attacks. In addition, {{we have found}} that the weakness of multiple watermark embedding methods that were initially designed to resist geometric attacks is their inability to withstand the watermark-estimation attacks (WEAs), leading to reduce resistance to geometric attacks. In view of these facts, this paper proposes a robust image watermarking scheme that can withstand geometric distortions and WEAs simultaneously. Our scheme is mainly composed of two components: (i) mesh generation and embedding to resist geometric distortions; and (ii) construction of media hash-based content-dependent watermark (CDW) to resist WEAs. Furthermore, we propose a <b>false</b> positive-oriented <b>watermark</b> detection mechanism, which can be used to determine the existence of a watermark so as to achieve a trade-off between correct detection and false detection. Extensive experimental results obtained using the standard benchmark and WEAs, and comparisons with relevant watermarking methods confirm the excellent performance of our method in improving robustness.

40|$|Abstract—The major {{disadvantage}} of existing watermarking methods is their limited resistance to extensive geometric attacks. In addition, {{we have found}} that the weakness of multiple water-mark embedding methods that were initially designed to resist geometric attacks is their inability to withstand the watermark-estimation attacks (WEAs), leading to reduce resistance to geo-metric attacks. In view of these facts, this paper proposes a robust image watermarking scheme that can withstand geometric distor-tions and WEAs simultaneously. Our scheme is mainly composed of three components: 1) robust mesh generation and mesh-based watermarking to resist geometric distortions; 2) construction of media hash-based content-dependent watermark to resist WEAs; and 3) a mechanism of <b>false</b> positive-oriented <b>watermark</b> detec-tion, which can be used to determine the existence of a watermark so as to achieve a tradeoff between correct detection and false detection. Furthermore, extensive experimental results obtained using the standard benchmark (i. e., Stirmark) and WEAs, and comparisons with relevant watermarking methods confirm the excellent performance of our method in improving robustness. To our knowledge, such a thorough evaluation has not been reported in the literature before. Index Terms—Attack, embedding, false positive detection, media hash, mesh, robustness, watermark. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{arrangement}} for detecting a watermark in an information signal. The method may include {{the steps of}} computing the correlation (dk) of the watermark (Wi) and the information signal (e. g. an image Q) for a plurality of positions (k) of the watermark {{with respect to the}} information signal, and detecting whether {{at least one of the}} respective correlation values exceeds a given threshold. The step of detecting may include determining the standard deviation (sigmad) of the respective correlation values (dk), and setting the threshold to a given multiple (T) of the standard deviation. The multiple (T) is derived form a desired <b>false</b> alarm rate (<b>watermark</b> detected when there is none, or no watermark detected when there is one) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} strength of watermarking algorithm against various noises like Gaussian, Speckle etc. Digital watermarking is the technique to insert some kind of ownership information in any digital media like image, audio, video. This enables {{the owner of the}} media to claim the ownership against any illegal use or claim of <b>false</b> ownership. These <b>watermarks</b> are permanent and unalterable and can be an image, receipt of copyright revenues etc. Proposed work deals with a review of the various attacks on the watermarked image to alter the watermark, remove the watermark, to degrade the quality of watermark. After the knowledge of all attacks we find a pre implemented algorithm for watermark embedding i. e. “Non blind discreet wavelet transformation based digital watermark embedding and extraction algorithm”...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, digital {{information}} science has emerged to seek answers to the question: can any technique ensure tamper-resistance and protect the copyright of digital contents by storing, transmitting and processing information encoded in systems where digital content can easily be disseminated through communication channels? Today it is understood {{that the answer is}} yes. This paper reviews the theoretical analysis and performance investigation of representative watermarking systems in transform domains and geometric invariant regions. Digital watermarking is a technology of embedding watermark with intellectual property rights into images, videos, audios, and other multimedia data by a certain algorithm. The basic characteristics of digital watermark are imperceptibility, capacity, robustness and <b>false</b> positive of <b>watermarking</b> algorithm and security of the hiding place. Moreover, it is concluded that various attacks operators are used for the assessment of watermarking systems, which supplies an automated and fair analysis of substantial watermarking methods for chosen application areas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} inherent vulnerabilities {{of digital}} watermarking that affect its mainstream purpose of rights protection. We ask: how resistant is watermarking to un-informed attacks? There are {{a multitude of}} application scenarios for watermarking and, {{with the advent of}} modern content distribution networks and the associated rights assessment issues, it has recently become a topic of increasing interest. But how well is watermarking suited for this main purpose of rights protection? Existing watermarking techniques are vulnerable to attacks threatening their overall viability. Most of these attacks have the final goal of removing the watermarking information while preserving the actual value of the watermarked Work. In this paper we identify an inherent trade-off between two important properties of watermarking algorithms: being “convincing enough ” in court {{while at the same time}} surviving a set of attacks, for a broad class of watermarking algorithms. We show that there exist inherent limitations in protecting rights over digital Works. In the attempt to become as convincing as possible (e. g. in a court of law, low rate of <b>false</b> positives), <b>watermarking</b> applications become more fragile to attacks aimed at removing the watermark while preserving the value of the Work. They are thus necessarily characterized by a significant (e. g. in some cases 35 %+) non-zero probability of being successfully attacked without any knowledge about their algorithmic details. We quantify this vulnerability for a class of algorithms and show how a minimizing “sweet spot ” can be found. We then derive a set of recommendations for watermarking algorithm design...|$|R
