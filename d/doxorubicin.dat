5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} <b>doxorubicin,</b> called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with <b>doxorubicin</b> in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the <b>doxorubicin</b> limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of <b>doxorubicin</b> through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with <b>doxorubicin,</b> only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and <b>doxorubicin</b> in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} <b>doxorubicin</b> concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. <b>Doxorubicin</b> fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> is photosensitive, and {{containers}} {{are often}} covered by an aluminum bag and/or brown wax paper to prevent light from affecting it. <b>Doxorubicin</b> {{is also available}} in liposome-encapsulated forms as Doxil (pegylated form), Myocet (nonpegylated form), and Caelyx, although these forms must also be given by intravenous injection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin,</b> {{sold under}} the trade names Adriamycin among others, is a {{chemotherapy}} medication {{used to treat}} cancer. This includes breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia. It is often used together with other chemotherapy agents. <b>Doxorubicin</b> is given by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} <b>doxorubicin</b> is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of <b>doxorubicin</b> is 500–550mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600mg/m². There are several ways in which <b>doxorubicin</b> is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53 mediated apoptosis. The drug dexrazoxane is used to mitigate doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Another {{common and}} {{potentially}} fatal complication of <b>doxorubicin</b> is typhlitis, an acute life-threatening {{infection of the}} bowel.|$|E
5|$|By intercalation, <b>doxorubicin</b> {{can also}} induce histone {{eviction}} from transcriptionally active chromatin. As a result, DNA damage response, epigenome and transcriptome are deregulated in doxorubicin-exposed cells.|$|E
5|$|Combination therapy {{experiments}} with sirolimus (rapamycin) and <b>doxorubicin</b> have shown promise in treating Akt-positive lymphomas in mice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> and {{daunorubicin}} together can {{be thought}} of as prototype compounds for the anthracyclines. Subsequent research has led to many other anthracycline antibiotics, or analogs, and there are now over 2,000 known analogs of <b>doxorubicin.</b> By 1991, 553 of them had been evaluated in the screening program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In 2016 GPX-150 was granted orphan drug designation by US FDA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> {{and several}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups {{of drugs that}} cause this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. <b>Doxorubicin</b> stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 3.88 to 32.79 USD per 50mg vial. In the United Kingdom this amount costs the NHS about £100.12. Versions that are pegylated and in liposomes are also available; however, are more expensive. <b>Doxorubicin</b> was originally made from the bacteria Streptomyces peucetius.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to <b>doxorubicin</b> to conform to the established naming convention. <b>Doxorubicin</b> showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher therapeutic index, yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E
5|$|Recent animal {{research}} coupling a murine {{monoclonal antibody}} with <b>doxorubicin</b> {{has created an}} immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. Current treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing T cells.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (<b>doxorubicin)</b> and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, rash, and {{inflammation}} of the mouth. Other serious side effects may include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, heart damage, tissue damage {{at the site of}} injection, radiation recall, and treatment-related leukemia. People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. <b>Doxorubicin</b> is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), <b>doxorubicin</b> (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and <b>doxorubicin.</b> For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being researched {{as a treatment for}} people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include <b>doxorubicin</b> and ifosfamide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> is {{synthesized}} by {{a specialized}} polyketide synthase.|$|E
25|$|Cardiotoxicity (heart damage) is {{especially}} prominent {{with the use}} of anthracycline drugs (<b>doxorubicin,</b> epirubicin, idarubicin, and liposomal <b>doxorubicin).</b> The cause of this is most likely due to the production of free radicals in the cell and subsequent DNA damage. Other chemotherapeutic agents that cause cardiotoxicity, but at a lower incidence, are cyclophosphamide, docetaxel and clofarabine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Doxorubicin</b> (Adriamycin) – A {{chemotherapeutic}} drug. This drug {{has been}} shown to potentiate cytotoxicity during HBO therapy.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} therapy of <b>doxorubicin</b> and sirolimus {{has been shown}} to drive AKT-positive lymphomas into remission in mice. Akt signalling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, such as <b>doxorubicin</b> or cyclophosphamide. Sirolimus blocks Akt signalling and the cells lose their resistance to the chemotherapy. Bcl-2-positive lymphomas were completely resistant to the therapy; eIF4E-expressing lymphomas are not sensitive to sirolimus.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, <b>doxorubicin,</b> vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, <b>doxorubicin,</b> prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents are}} associated with organ-specific toxicities, including cardiovascular disease (e.g., <b>doxorubicin),</b> interstitial lung disease (e.g., bleomycin) and occasionally secondary neoplasm (e.g., MOPP therapy for Hodgkin's disease).|$|E
25|$|Pre-treatment with {{corticosteroids}} {{has been}} used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. <b>Doxorubicin</b> was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating <b>doxorubicin</b> may affect the disposition of docetaxel. Etoposide has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is {{also used}} as a direct {{chemotherapeutic}} agent in certain haematological malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of <b>doxorubicin</b> (Adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Premedication with {{corticosteroids}} {{is recommended}} before each administration of docetaxel to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitive reactions. Other medications will often {{be given to}} aid pain management and other symptoms. The treatment of breast cancer with <b>doxorubicin</b> and cyclophosphamide is enhanced by adjuvant treatment with docetaxel. Docetaxel is also used in combination with capecitabine, a DNA synthesis inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Both {{amphotericin}} B and <b>doxorubicin</b> {{have been}} investigated as potentially effective against CJD, but as {{yet there is no}} strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, anticonvulsants and anxiolytic agents, such as valproate or a benzodiazepine, may be administered to relieve associated symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{clinical}} trials {{have shown that}} Totect (USA) or Savene (Europe) (dexrazoxane for extravasation) is effective in preventing the progression of anthracycline extravasation into progressive tissue necrosis. In two open-label, single arm, phase II multicenter {{clinical trials}}, necrosis was prevented in 98% of the patients. Dexrazoxane for extravasation is the only registered antidote for extravasation of anthracyclines (daunorubicin, <b>doxorubicin,</b> epirubicin, idarubicin, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include <b>doxorubicin</b> and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, <b>Doxorubicin,</b> Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E
25|$|PARP inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in early trials, {{particularly}} {{in people with}} BRCA gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, olaparib has shown greater survival compared to <b>doxorubicin,</b> though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which biomarkers are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors. Rucaparib is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II {{can be divided into}} two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include etoposide, <b>doxorubicin,</b> mitoxantrone and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E
25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal <b>doxorubicin,</b> gemcitabine, or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins.|$|E
