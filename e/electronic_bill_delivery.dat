40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{bill of lading}} is {{of great}} value in the maritime industry. However, as electronic communication takes over in international trade, the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> of lading is now being considered first in some situations. A brief introduction {{of the bill of}} lading will be made together with a general comparison between the traditional bill of lading and the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> of lading. Further analysis will concentrate on the issues of how the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> of lading applies in some particular international e-commerce cases and how we can improve the new electronic data interchange system. Finally, this paper aims to demonstrate that it may be advantageous to ultimately switch entirely from the paper bill of lading to an electronic one in a modern e-commerce-driven society...|$|R

Certain <b>electronic</b> <b>billing</b> applications also provide the ability to electronically settle payment for goods or services. Customers of banks and billing companies can utilize the internet or telecommunications to conveniently remit payment or access billing information. The service is also supported by customer service representatives (CSRs), which may be contacted directly by the consumer to facilitate payments or receive general assistance and answer questions. It can produce substantial savings to traditional print & mail billing and payment remittance, and as an added benefit results in {{a significant reduction in}} the use of paper.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} {{situation}} and potential success in legal practice of one major invention in the maritime industry, namely, the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> of lading by taking into consideration developments of the relevant regulatory frameworks through time by some few important institutions involved including CMI (Comité Maritime International), Bolero (<b>Bills</b> of Lading <b>Electronic</b> Registry Organisation) and UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law). The thesis focuses on analysing effectiveness of the legal attempts of these actors in supporting the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> to be accepted as fully legally enforceable as in the paper-based case. In doing so, {{emphasis is placed on}} the question of how fundamental legal requirements of the traditional bill can also be met by this paperless replacement. The thesis argues that the trendy bill concerned shall be regarded as the electronic equivalent of the paper bill since, based on some of the recent guidelines and provisions offered, it certainly satisfies such traditional requirements. That is, the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> of lading is, too, a legal document that can be signed and capable of performing all basic traditional functions which include being a receipt for the goods, being evidence of terms in a contract of carriage and, more sophisticatedly, being a negotiable document of title. The thesis points out that the CMI model fails to stay attractive for long as it is associated with a number of problems, while the Bolero system that follows, though imperfect, appears to be a better alternative for the contracting parties wishing to use the bill of lading in electronic form. UNCITRAL not only provides essential legal guidelines like Model Laws on Electronic Commerce and on Electronic Signatures, but also is developing Draft Convention on the Carriage of Goods [Wholly or Partly] [By Sea] purporting in part to build a thorough framework governing and help promoting the use of the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> of lading. This great prospect expected by many to be a dream legal solution for the <b>electronic</b> <b>bill</b> has, however, some room for improvement as suggested in the thesis...|$|R
