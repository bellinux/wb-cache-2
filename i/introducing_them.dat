5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> into a small enclosed space known as a Respirator Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production.

5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

5|$|Deliveries of the Vengeances to Australia {{were much}} delayed. Following Australia's entry into Pacific War in December 1941, the RAAF order still stood at 297 Vengeances. These {{aircraft}} {{were scheduled to}} be delivered between January and December 1942. No Vengeances had arrived by 8 May 1942, though the RAAF's order had been increased to 367. A small number of the type arrived in Australia in late May 1942, but subsequent deliveries were slow. This was because the USAAF was also rapidly expanding at this time, which limited the number and types of aircraft available to its allies. Attempts by the Australian Government to obtain Vengeances from USAAF allocations in March 1942, when the country faced a possible Japanese invasion, were unsuccessful. The majority of the dive bombers arrived after April 1943; {{by this time the}} threat of invasion had passed. Overall, Australia received 15 Vengeances in 1942, 227 in 1943 and 100 during 1944. Many of the aircraft suffered from defects, which led to delays in <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> into service and caused the type to have a relatively low serviceability rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{band was}} {{originally}} formed by Shaffer, Arvizu, and Morrill. Capra approached the band <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> to bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Faith No More. Still in {{need for a}} drummer, the band placed an advertisement in a local newspaper which was answered by Silveria. Shortly after this, the band recorded a demo album which {{was meant to be}} sent out to record companies. Realizing they would have to continue the band in a more populated area {{in order for them to}} expand, all of the members but Shaffer left Bakersfield and resided in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California (Shaffer later moved to Hollywood as well). In late 1989, the band hired a man named Arthur as their manager, resulting in them getting signed to Triple X Records. The band recorded and released their first extended play in 1989, but it suffered from poor distribution.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} three {{potential}} {{problems associated with}} the validity of personal genome kits. The first issue is the test's validity. Handling errors of the sample increases the likelihood for errors which could affect the test results and interpretation.

The third problem is the clinical utility of personal genome kits and associated risks, and the benefits of <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> into clinical practices.|$|E

When new students came to Miyagi, he would often train them for three to five years before <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> to sanchin. He would make them train very hard, and many of them quit before learning sanchin. Those that remained would focus almost exclusively on sanchin for two to three years. Miyagi's sanchin training was very harsh, and students would often leave practice with bruises from him checking their stance.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years after}} {{beginning}} the course, {{and two weeks}} before its completion, a special committee meets to examine all the cadets and determines which ones will be completing the course. While rare, it is not unknown for some cadets to be dropped from the course even at this late stage. After the special committee completes its deliberations, the cadets who will be graduating begin preparing for the ceremony. Since two flight courses graduate every year, there are therefore two ceremonies. One of the graduates' final tasks is to act as the induction cadre for the next class of cadets arriving to begin their gibush, <b>introducing</b> <b>them</b> to military service via a series of punishing physical and mental challenges.|$|E

25|$|Zachris Usko Nyström, {{known as}} Usko Nyström, (6 September 1861 – 6 January 1925) was a Finnish {{architect}} {{and one of}} the most influential professors of architecture at Helsinki University of Technology; among his students were later notable architects Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto.

Many of his key architectural works were made while he was in the architectural partnership Usko Nyström─Petrelius─Penttilä which operated from 1895 to 1908.

25|$|The Chrétien-Turner feud {{was only}} just the {{beginning}} of Liberal in-fighting. The PC Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's two signature policies of the late 1980s, namely free trade with the United States and the Meech Lake accord had badly fractionised the Liberals in ways that cut across traditional left-right lines, which was at least part of Mulroney's intention in <b>introducing</b> <b>them,</b> to use them as wedge issues to unite the PC base and divide the Liberals. The Liberal strategist John Duffy illustrated how badly Meech and free trade had fractionized the Liberals by pointing out the positions on each of four prominent Liberals of the late 1980s, namely the leftist Sheila Copps (anti-free trade, pro-Meech), the rightist Don Johnston (pro-free trade, anti-Meech), rightist Raymond Garneau (pro-free trade, pro-Meech) and the leftist Lloyd Axworthy (anti-free trade, anti-Meech). This was to be the context of Chrétien's return to politics in 1990.|$|E
