40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{differences}} in clinical manifestations between women with various HIV- 1 subtypes during acute (AI) and early (EI) HIV infection. In a longitudinal cohort study, clinical signs and symptoms among Uganda and Zimbabwe women with AI and EI were compared with HIV-negative controls; symptoms were assessed quarterly for 15 to 24 months. Early HIV infection was defined as the first visit during which a woman tested HIV antibody positive. Women who were HIV negative serologically but DNA polymerase chain reaction positive were considered AI. In all, 26 women were classified AI and 192 EI, with 654 HIV-negative controls. Primary HIV infection (AI and EI) was associated with unexplained fever (P <. 01), weight loss (P <. 01), fatigue (P <. 01), <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy</b> (P <. 01), and cervical friability (P. 01). More women with subtype C infection had unexplained fever, fatigue, and abnormal vaginal discharge compared to subtype A or D infection. <b>Inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy</b> occurred less often in women with subtype A infection than those with subtype C or D infection...|$|E

40|$|In August 2000, a 42 {{years old}} female, {{presented}} at the emergency department complaining of fever, night sweets and weight loss. Physical examination showed axillar adenopathy of 1 cm. Blood tests were normal. Thoracic CT scan showed left pleural effusion and axillary, mediastinal, retroperitoneal and <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathies.</b> Biopsy revealed Non Hodgkin Follicular Lymphoma (CD 20 +). Treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisolone (CHOP) was started. CT scan evaluation after 6 cycles showed persistant mediastinic adenopathies. The patient started treatment with radiotherapy to the mediastinal area. In July 2006, a new pleural effusion and adenopathies were detected. The patient started chemotherapy with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (R-ICE) and achieved a complete response. In October 2010, recurrence of the disease was detected. Chemotherapy was restarted and complete response achieved. In January 2014, the patient present with facial edema which worsened in the morning (figure 1 and 2). She also referred breast and mammary enlarged veins and dyspnea. PET scan was negative for recurrence of the disease. Brain CT scan was normal. Thyroid function, cortisol and auto-immune antibodies were negative. The patient started treatment with corticotherapy (1 mg/kg/day) and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The symptoms did not disappear. Angio-CT showed superior vena cava stenosis and thrombosis (figure 3). The patient started therapy with enoxaparin and therefore was submitted to dilation of the vena cava stenosis; the symptoms disappeared. Follicular lymphoma represents {{the second most common}} Non Hodgkin Lymphoma in adults, accounting for 10 - 20 % of all lymphomas (1). It is considered an indolent disease characterized by a relapsing pattern over years. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome refers to a constellation of symptoms produced by the obstruction of blood flow through the SVC, resulting in dyspnea, facial and upper-extremity edema, chest pain and dyspnea. Malignancies represent 60 %- 85 % of the etiologies (2) and lymphoma and lung cancer represent 95 % of malignancy-related SVC syndrome. The authors wish to emphasize a late complication due to stenosis of superior vena cava which mimetized a superior vena cava syndrome, although no evidence of disease was found; the symptoms were assumed to be a consequence of fibrosis and stenosis caused by previous radiotherapy; this situation is described as a rare complication in the literature (3).

40|$|AbstractMalignant primary {{epithelial}} tumours of {{the penis}} are rare and mainly affect uncircumcised {{men in their}} fifties to seventies. They are most frequently located in the glans and foreskin. Imaging is performed if the clinician has doubts about deep extension, after a diagnostic biopsy. High-resolution ultrasound and above all MRI are used to detect invasion of the corpora cavernosa and spongiosum. The lesion is often seen as a moderate T 2 hyposignal, {{making it possible to}} distinguish it from the relative hypersignal of the corpora cavernosa. The sentinel lymph nodes are <b>inguinal.</b> <b>Adenopathy</b> is frequently present, but does not, however, necessarily reflect tumour invasion, as secondary infection of the lesion, which is often ulcerated, is common.

40|$|Abstract. Lymphatic {{filariasis}} is {{a widespread}} infectious disease of children in endemic areas, but {{little is known about}} the early lymphatic damage in children and its evolution, either with or without treatment. Two girls (ages 6 and 12 years) from a Wuchereria bancrofti endemic region of Brazil presented with chronic <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy.</b> Neither had microfilaremia. By ultrasound both were shown to have living adult worms in their enlarged inguinal nodes and had occult local lymphatic damage (lymphangiectasis). One girl spontaneously developed acute adenitis in the affected node prior to any intervention; this adenitis resolved within 10 days and was associated with the progressive disappearance over 45 – 90 days of all local abnormalities detectable by ultrasound. In the other child, after treatment with a single dose of diethylcarbamazine (DEC), the same clinical picture of transient adenitis and resolving abnormalities (detectable by ultrasound) occurred. These findings demonstrated filariasis as the cause of adenopathy in children, and also both spontaneous and treatment-induced worm-death, with subsequent reversal of lymphatic abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{examinations}} {{were conducted}} {{in an effort to}} provide baseline data for a pilot filariasis elimination programme implemented in a Wuchereria bancrofti-endemic focus in Malindi district, Kenya. Of 186 mates aged 15 years and above examined, 64 individuals (34. 4 %) had hydrocele, and the prevalence of the manifestation in those above 40 years old was 55. 3 %. The prevalence of Leg lymphoedema in persons aged 15 years and above was 8. 5 %, with a higher rate in mates (12. 6 %) than in females (5. 7 %). The overall prevalence of <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy</b> was 8. 6 %, and mates had a significantly higher (12. 9 %) prevalence of adenopathy than females (5. 1 %) (P < 0. 001). The data in the present study provided support for consideration of filarial infection as a possible cause of inguinal lymphadenopathy in bancroftian filariasis-endemic areas. The results of this study also indicate that Lymphatic filariasis is a serious public health problem in the northern coastal areas and morbidity control programmes should be implemented to alleviate the suffering of those affected.

40|$|Haemophilus ducreyi is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} pathogen that causes genital ulcers and <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy.</b> Because chancroidal ulcers are most commonly {{located on the}} foreskins of uncircumcised males, we utilized human foreskin epithelial cells (HFECs) to investigate the initial interaction of H. ducreyi with its host. The eight different strains of H. ducreyi that were studied varied in their abilities to attach to these epithelial cells, with six strains consistently attaching to > or = 90 % of HFECs and two strains attaching to < 25 % of HFECs. The strains {{with low levels of}} adherence also failed to exhibit chaining in broth culture and were avirulent in the rabbit model, suggesting that virulence in this model and attachment may be linked. The most adherent strain, LA 228 R, was further evaluated for its ability to invade HFECs and HEp- 2 cells. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy of HFECs after interaction with LA 228 R produced images consistent with attachment, ingestion into vesicles, and escape from the vesicles into the cytoplasm. In addition, the gentamicin protection assay and inhibition of invasion by cytochalasin B and D indicated that LA 228 R was able to invade both HFECs and HEp- 2 cells. Further examination of the mechanisms involved in the adherence and invasion of H. ducreyi into epithelial cells and their correlation with virulence will provide {{a better understanding of the}} pathogenesis of the disease caused by this important pathogen...|$|E
40|$|A 37 -year-old male {{presented}} with a traumatic injury to the scrotal region necessitating emergency surgery. Evacuation of a haematoma and bilateral orchidectomy were performed. A left sided nonseminomatous germ cell tumour (NSGCT), predominantly yolk sac, was identified. Microscopic margins were positive for tumour. Initial tumour markers revealed an AFP of 22, 854 [*]ng/mL, HCG of < 1 [*]mIU/mL, and LDH of 463 [*]IU/L. Eight weeks after surgery, AFP levels remained elevated at 11, 646 [*]ng/mL. Computed tomography (CT) scanning demonstrated left <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy,</b> 1. 5 [*]cm in max dimension. On review, extensive evidence of scrotal involvement was evident. His tumour was staged as stage IIIC, poor risk NSGCT. He was treated with 4 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin over a 12 -week period. His tumour markers normalised after 3 cycles. There was a marked improvement noted clinically. Follow-up CT scans demonstrated complete resolution of his tumour. He later underwent further surgery to remove {{a small amount of}} remaining spermatic cord. Histology revealed no malignant tissue. The patient suffered many complications including testosterone deficiency, osteopenia, infertility, and psychological distress. Discussion. A small proportion of testicular cancer may present in an atypical manner. The scrotum and testicle have markedly different embryonic origins and therefore a distinct anatomic separation. As a result the scrotum is not a typical site of spread of testicular cancer. Case reports have been described that were managed in a similar manner with good outcomes. Therefore, even with significant scrotal involvement, if timely and appropriate treatment is administered, complete resolution of the tumour may be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Symbiotic Wolbachia organisms of filarial {{nematodes}} {{have received}} much attention as possible chemotherapy targets and disease-causing organisms. In order to further investigate {{the association between}} anti-Wolbachia immune responses and chronic filarial disease in humans, antibody responses to Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) were assayed in serum samples collected from 232 individuals living in Leogane, Haiti, an area where Wuchereria bancrofti infection is endemic, and from 67 North Americans with no history of lymphatic filariasis. As opposed to antifilarial antibody responses, which were largely influenced by the patient's infection status, the prevalence and levels of anti-WSP immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies among individuals with lymphedema or hydrocele were significantly greater than those in gender- and infection-matched individuals without disease. In at least one case, the anti-WSP IgG response was coincident {{with the onset of}} lymphedema development, and among anti-WSP-positive women with lymphedema, anti-WSP IgG levels were negatively correlated with the duration of lymphedema. The presence of anti-WSP IgG was also associated with the severity of <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy</b> among men with hydrocele. In addition to the presence of anti-WSP antibodies among Haitians, 15 of 67 (22 %) serum samples collected from individuals from North America, where filariasis is not endemic, were also positive for anti-WSP antibodies. In comparison to those from Haitians, anti-WSP antibodies from North Americans primarily recognized a distinct region of WSP located within the highly conserved second transmembrane domain. The results of this study demonstrate that anti-WSP antibody responses are associated with the presence of chronic filarial morbidity and not filarial infection status in humans and suggest that WSP should be further studied as a potential trigger for the development of filarial disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess whether}} {{there might be}} an {{association}} between genital papillomavirus infection (GPVI) and balanoposthitis. DESIGN [...] Retrospective HPV DNA examination of biopsy specimens from 23 men suffering from balanoposthitis and exhibiting acetowhite lesions that were penoscopically and histologically concurrent with HPV infection. SETTING [...] The STD clinics at Karolinska Hospital and South Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS [...] Randomly selected men attending with long-lasting and/or recurrent penile symptoms and exhibiting a clinical picture of balanoposthitis, who revealed a penoscopical and histopathological picture of epidermal lesions that were concordant with accepted criteria for typical or conspicuous GPVI. Asymptomatic controls were selected retrospectively on the basis of identical penoscopy and histology criteria. RESULTS [...] A history of previous condylomata was obtained in eight (35 %) of 23 men. At penoscopic evaluation tiny condylomatous lesions were observed in five (22 %) patients. The in situ hybridisation (ISH) assay using specific probes for the HPV types 6 / 11, 16 / 18, 31 / 33 and 42 was positive in 13 / 23 (56 %) of the patient samples, but in only 26 % of the 19 control samples. In patient biopsies the oncogenic HPV types 16 / 18 and/or 31 / 33 were found in 7 / 13 samples, whereas HPV 6 / 11 and/or 42 were present in another six cases. PCR performed on the ten ISH negative patient biopsies, were negative in all cases. CONCLUSION [...] Symptoms included redness, itching, burning, tenderness, dyspareunia, fissuring and in two cases penile oedema and <b>inguinal</b> <b>adenopathy.</b> All patients fulfilled penoscopical and histopathological criteria for HPV infection. We demonstrate some tentative evidence that HPV might be associated with long-lasting balanoposthitis, although our data still are circumstantial for a causative association.
