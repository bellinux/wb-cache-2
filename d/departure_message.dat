5000|$|Star ArielStar Ariel G-AGRE left Bermuda for Kingston, Jamaica on 17 January 1949. Soon after {{take-off}} captain John McPhee radioed a standard <b>departure</b> <b>message</b> including an estimate at Kingston of 14:10. This {{was followed by}} a position report [...] "I was over 30° N at 9:37 I am changing frequency to MRX." [...] Star Ariel was never heard from again. Over 70 aircraft and many ships searched between up to 500 miles south of Bermuda, including the aircraft carriers USS Kearsarge and USS Leyte, and the battleship , involving more than 13,000 men. No debris, oil slicks, or wreckage were found. The Tudor IV was later discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{a safety}} {{announcement}} and recorded <b>departure</b> <b>message,</b> [...] "Thank you and enjoy traveling {{at the speed}} of fright!", the ride would start out with two small dips out of the station, turning left then right before ascending the first lift hill. It would then travel down the first drop. The train would then steer its way though a mock Bavarian village, narrowly missing houses and shops. The ride completed three turns, first to the left, then the right, then the left, each of approximately 180 degrees. After the third turn, the ride hit a straight piece of track, then headed towards a helix through a wooded area adjacent to the village.|$|E
50|$|On 1 June 1943 the BOAC {{flight from}} Lisbon to Whitchurch was {{assigned}} to the Ibis and given flight number 777-A. The flight was originally scheduled to take off at 0730, but was delayed when Howard left the aircraft to pick up a package he had left at customs. At 0735 GMT, Flight 777-A departed from Portela Airport at Lisbon. Whitchurch received a <b>departure</b> <b>message</b> and continued regular radio contact until 1054 GMT. At that time, while the DC-3 was roughly 200 mi northwest of the coast of Spain, Whitchurch received a message from wireless operator van Brugge that they were being followed and that they were fired upon at 46°30'N, 009°37'W. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft crashed and sank into the Bay of Biscay.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles {{could send}} free text {{messages}} containing up to 1,900 characters. There were all preformatted or 'canned' messages where the driver only needed {{to fill in}} blank fields and hit send. Such messages included NBC1 reports, NEDIVAC message and arrival and <b>departure</b> <b>messages</b> among others.|$|R
30|$|Two {{application}} layer protocols, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [23] and Mobile Internet Telephony Protocol (MITP) [24], {{can be extended}} to support terminal mobility. In the SIP approach, when an MN moves and changes IP address, it just resends a new INVITE message to the CN to reestablish a session. In the MITP approach, when an MN moves and changes IP address, it sends the join and <b>departure</b> <b>messages</b> to MITP servers in order to reestablish a communication session. Although application approaches need not change the underlying protocol stack, they must reestablish connections after an IP address change [25]. Hence, the handoff latency may be large {{and may not be}} suitable for real-time multimedia applications.|$|R
40|$|For {{integration}} between application-systems {{in a global}} context, interoperability needs to be established on a global level; global interoperability, in turn, {{is based on a}} global common application-interface. This is achieved through resolving differences in, inter alia, protocol profiles, among participants in the global network. ebXML is used as the point of <b>departure.</b> A <b>messaging</b> framework, which is based on existing Web technology and standards, is proposed. Certain security and Web service standards are examined to determine specific parameters for an interoperable secure messaging environment. A security based framework comprising a predefined message format and architecture is investigated for a secure interoperable global electronic marketspace...|$|R

6000|$|The shock prostrated the mother. Jim {{had been}} her favorite. Mr. Anderson left at once for the East. Lenore had the care {{of her mother and}} the {{management}} of [...] "Many Waters" [...] on her hands, which duties kept her mercifully occupied. Mrs. Anderson, however, after a day, rallied surprisingly. Lenore sensed in her mother the strength of the spirit that sacrificed to a noble and universal cause. It seemed to be Mrs. Anderson's conviction that Jim had been shot, or injured by accident in gun-training, or at least by a horse. Lenore did not share her mother's idea and was reluctant to dispel it. On the evening of the fifth day after Mr. Anderson's <b>departure</b> a <b>message</b> came, saying that he had arrived too late to see Jim alive. Mrs. Anderson bore the news bravely, though she weakened perceptibly.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the realization of marked and unmarked theme types as point of <b>departure</b> of <b>message</b> in general English texts. The corpus {{of this study was}} 15 general English texts extracted from English general textbooks for university students published in Iran and taught at universities in Iran. The corpus was analyzed based on Halliday’s (1985) framework of thematic organization. Findings suggested the unmarked theme was predominant compared to marked theme. This is due to that writers prefer to use simple structure that help readers to get a better comprehension. Findings also showed that different types of marked theme were used to help in text organization and contribute to better comprehension. In such cases, the writers felt the need to mention some elements in the thematic position other than grammatical subject. The findings highlighted that general English instructors and developers need to take on board the notion of theme and its importance in teaching and developing general English texts...|$|R

Under the command of Sergeant Monty, who declares that he will toughen them up for the RHPS, the training begins. Meanwhile, Von Talon and his henchmen, Cufflingk and Underlingk, try numerous attempts to discover the <b>message's</b> <b>departure</b> location. However Mercury refuses to tell, despite the tortures inflicted upon him, such as irritating him with yodeling music and injecting him with truth serum, before Mercury accidentally reveals the location: Saint-Pierre.|$|R
6000|$|I sent Peter {{to inquire}} if I might be {{permitted}} to pay my respects to his master that evening. My messenger returned with an answer that was a new disappointment to me. Mr. Dunross begged that I would excuse him, if he deferred the proposed interview until the next morning. The next morning was the morning of my <b>departure.</b> Did the <b>message</b> mean {{that he had no}} wish to see me again until {{the time had come to}} take leave of him? I inquired of Peter whether his master was particularly occupied that evening. He was unable to tell me. [...] "The Master of Books" [...] was not in his study, as usual. When he sent his message to me, he was sitting by the sofa in his daughter's room.|$|R
6000|$|I {{returned}} to Limmeridge House early {{enough in the}} evening to take leave of Mr. Kyrle. He and his clerk, and {{the driver of the}} fly, went back to London by the night train. On their <b>departure</b> an insolent <b>message</b> was delivered to me from Mr. Fairlie--who had been carried from the room in a shattered condition, when the first outbreak of cheering answered my appeal to the tenantry. The message conveyed to us [...] "Mr. Fairlie's best congratulations," [...] and requested to know whether [...] "we contemplated stopping in the house." [...] I sent back word that the only object for which we had entered his doors was accomplished--that I contemplated stopping in no man's house but my own--and that Mr. Fairlie need not entertain the slightest apprehension of ever seeing us or hearing from us again. We went back to our friends at the farm to rest that night, and the next morning--escorted to the station, with the heartiest enthusiasm and good will, by the whole village and by all the farmers in the neighbourhood--we {{returned to}} London.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{assigned}} significant roles to research article abstracts {{for the purpose}} of informing the reader about the content of the article by compressing the most important findings in its writing. It also allows the reader to decide whether to read the entire article or not (Martin, 2003). Therefore, writing a research article abstract needs an initial focus on textual and rhetorical features that constitute an efficacious research article abstract. One of the textual features is Theme (Gosden, 1992). Theme is defined as an element, which serves as the point of <b>departure</b> of the <b>message</b> in a clause and {{plays a major role in}} text organization. It helps a text to be communicated and understood clearly (Halliday, 1994). This study aims to investigate the Theme types and patterns used in 120 research article abstracts from the disciplines of Applied Linguistics, Economics, Agriculture and Applied Physics. The gathered data were analyzed based on Halliday’s (1994) model of Thematic organization and Eggins’ (2004) model of Thematic progression. The results revealed disciplinary differences, which generally lead to specificity of selection of the Theme types and patterns used in the writing of the research article abstract...|$|R
5000|$|Until 1996, the Canadian federal {{government}} operated all air traffic services (FSS and {{air traffic control}}) through Transport Canada, a government department. Currently, a private non-profit corporation, Nav Canada, operates both FSS/FIC and air traffic control and has significantly modernized the system, which involved the closing of some local FSSs. However, the company in turn created six large Flight Information Centres (FICs) situated at airports in Halifax, Quebec City, London, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Kamloops. These provide standard en route flight services (weather briefing, flight-planning and commsearch). FSSs provide airport advisories, vehicle control, weather observations, clearance delivery, emergency assistance, and some provide Remote Aerodrome Advisory Services. FSSs {{are responsible for the}} safe and efficient movement of aircraft on manoeuvering areas and within their designated control zone. Most FSS stations are open 24/7; some have limited hours. They are no longer responsible for flight planning, except for sending <b>departure</b> and arrival <b>messages</b> to the appropriate FIC. The FICs have assumed the responsibility for flight plans, filing, in-flight alerting, flight plan closures, interpretive weather briefings and NOTAM (NOtices To AirMen) management. The FICs also have large areas they are overseeing and have networks of RCOs, some of which are co-located with FSS or air traffic control sites. The FICs are similar in function and scope to the FAA's former automated FSS system in the United States. North Bay FIC is tied into the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) North Warning System (NWS) radar system, and has a network of 23 RCOs located across Canada's Arctic coast. Quebec City, North-Bay and Kamloops FIC also assist and oversee the [...] "Community Aerodrome Radio Station" [...] (CARS) program.|$|R
40|$|Our {{presentation}} {{showed how}} we help our students improve their organizational skills in academic writing. The ideas came from our theoretical class at University of California, Davis where we both are {{graduate students in}} the applied linguistics. We had read Lock (1996) who uses the terms theme and rheme to discuss textual organization. According to Lock (1996) theme is “a jumping-off point, or point of <b>departure,</b> of the <b>message</b> in the clause ” (p. 222). Theme {{can be thought of}} as the first component in the clause and shows the reader what the clause is all about. Rheme, according to Lock (1996), is “a part of the message that is presented as most important, or most newsworthy ” (p. 222). In our lessons, we defined theme as everything before the main verb and rheme as everything after the main verb. There are two issues that a theme/rheme analysis can shed light on. For example, it is important not to use the same theme throughout an entire paragraph. Instead, students can be encouraged to use different themes to refer to the same person, idea, or object. It is also very common in academic writing that what is presented at the end of one clause then serves as the beginning the next, as theme allows the writer to relate the sentence logically with the previous sentence. Information introduced in the rheme (last part of clause) is picked up and recast as the theme of the next clause. Lesson 1 : Variety in the theme The following examples are from a theme/rheme lesson for undergraduate ESL students. The students responded to a prompt “Which one do you prefer paper and pencil testing or computerized testing? ” In this student’s paragraph, all of her sentences start with conjunctions. What I wanted the student to do was to think about expanding her ideas in the paragraph, really developing the argument she was making. I showed her how thinking about the themes in the paragraph could help. The following is the student’s “before ” paragraph: Paper and pencil is more secure than computerized. For instance, if a computer is dow...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{of the flow of}} information and mass media technology is one form of sending messages and information. In this case, the mass media plays a very important role, because in modern society, public life no longer be released from the journalism and press. Over time, the 20 th century to find a new mass medium that can deliver messages faster, radio, followed by the emergence of some of the findings from other electronic media such as television, movies, etc. that serves as the medium of the message to the audience. The film is often used as a movie medium to convey a particular purpose, in this case there are aspects which {{play an important role in}} a film. Because, basically the film as a medium of communication that can not be separated from the journalism and the press, in which the press has three main functions of providing information, entertainment and social control. One example is a cartoon titled indie Suroboyoan grammar. This film genre of humor lifted the two characters in a cartoon drawn by a shark named Sujancok Suro and Boyo Digdoyo mythological crocodile surabaya city icons Suro and Boyo. This film takes Surabaya city as a whole object of story ideas, can be seen from the use of grammar, described the location as well as some examples of cultural identity as a citizen Surabaya form of information, while the genre of humor as a form of entertainment media, by utilizing cartoon (up mainly) to more easily received and understood the community. In this film, there are some scenes that try to convey social criticism addressed to certain parties, such films were needed, of course, very public, where the film not only serve as mere entertainment for the masses, but it could be a means of information and sending <b>messages.</b> <b>Departure</b> of the few things that have been described above, researchers interested in doing research on "Social Criticism Cartoon In Indie Film '(film content analysis grammar Suroboyoan Muhammad Solikin part 1 - 3) ".
