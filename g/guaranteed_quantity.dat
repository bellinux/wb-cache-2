40|$|Demand {{variability}} {{increases as}} one moves up a supply chain. The demand for finished products is less variable than for subassemblies, {{which is less}} variable than for individual components. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} bullwhip or Forrester effect. It increases inventory unnecessarily and makes managing the capacity of equipment and personnel difficult. In 1999, Philips Semiconductors confirmed substantial bullwhip effects in some of its supply chains and began developing a collaborative-planning process and tool to reduce them. It sought to reduce inventory and increase customer-service levels by integrating its supply chain planning and control with those of its customers. By applying stochastic multiechelon inventory theory, it developed an advanced planning and scheduling system that supports weekly collaborative planning of operations by Philips Semiconductors and one of its customers, Philips Optical Storage. The project has brought substantial savings. A conservative estimate shows minimum yearly savings of around US$ 5 million from $ 300 million yearly turnover.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : Among {{the most}} common gross-motor {{abilities}} running, jumping and throwing have been considered {{some of the most}} important fundamental motor skills (FMS). Their development, 30 years ago,was guaranteed and performed throught a natural and active life style. Today the scholastic sport activitie and the structured extra scholastic sport activities are not enough to <b>guarantee</b> <b>quantity</b> and quality of motor development of our preadolescents. The study shows how since the late 1970 s one can see a progressive motor impoverishment related to the principal gross-motor abilities(1),caused by the diminution of movement opportunities for our children(2) and by the advent of computers,cellular telephones and electronic static games. METHODS :In the year 1976 a test battery was proposed to 1000 students. The same test battery was proposed to 500 students in 2007. The data have been collected through the scholastic system by submitting tests during PE lessons after a 20 minutes warm-up. Test battery: Speed run (boys mt. 80; girls mt. 60), Endurance run(mt. 1000), Long Jump, High jump, precision throw (Basket drought) and strength throw (one hand throwing of a little ball), twine-skip test and pole-climb test. RESULTS :After 30 years significant differences have been noticed in the weight, in the height and in the Body Mass Index. Today boys and girls are taller and heavier and we can also notice a marked increase in BMI. All data have been compared with NCHS Growth Charts(3). In all tests we noticed a loss of ability.

I will argue - after analysing some of Van Helmont's experiments such as his tree-experiment, ice-experiment, and thermoscope experiment - that Van Helmont had a strong preference to locate experimental designs in places wherein variables can be more easily controlled (and in the limit, in relatively closed physical systems such as paradigmatically the vessel, globe or sphere (vas, globus, sphera)).

40|$|The EU support {{regime is}} centred on a {{production}} aid per tonne of unginned cotton within national <b>guaranteed</b> <b>quantities.</b> Aid is granted to processors, who pay a minimum price to growers, {{based on the}} difference between the 'guide price' and the world price. Since 1995 / 96 the 'guide price' has been set at € 1, 063 per tonne with a guaranteed minimum price of € 1, 009. 9 per tonne. Greece has a NGQ of 782, 000 tonnes, Spain an NGQ of 249, 000 tonnes and other member states a total of 1, 500 tonnes. EU support to the cotton sector totalled € 773 million in 2001. The cotton sector contributes only 0. 5 % to final agricultural output in the EU, but is important in certain EU regions (Thessaly, Macedonia-Thrace, Sterea Ellada and Andalusia. For example in Greece, cotton represent 9 % of total agricultural output. In these areas cotton is farmed by small holders. The area under cotton however is decreasing. At a world level the EU is a minor producer, contributing only 2. 2 % of total production (the USA by contrast accounts for 20. 1 % of world production). The EU exports some 227, 000 tonnes of ginned cotton and is a major net exporter of ginned cotton. The USA however dominates world cotton exports, accounting for 30 % of world trade (west Africa accounts for only about 11 %). The EU consumes about 1 million tonnes of ginned cotton per annum. Comment: The guaranteed minimum price system means that regardless of the world market price EU cotton growers receive over € 1, 000 per tonne for their cotton. This insulates EU producers entirely from the low world market prices for cotton which have plagued west African cotton producers. Since 2000 EU imports of cotton have declined as EU production and exports have increased (despite a 13. 5 % decline in the price of ginned cotton). This demonstrates the extent to which production and trade in cotton in the EU is insulated from developments on world markets.
