These results showed that Pakistan is the most pro-China country in the world. Similarly, the Chinese state-run media has portrayed Pakistan in a favorable light in regional issues. In 2013, this figure increased to 90% of Pakistanis having a favorable view of China.|$|E

25|$|The main {{activity}} in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs to <b>give</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking {{the role of}} counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person {{in the role of}} counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.|$|E
25|$|The term “thangata” has {{had several}} {{meanings}} in Malawi {{in the last}} 120 years, and its traditional or pre-colonial use {{was very different from}} its uses in colonial and modern times. The word exists in the Chewa and the related Mang'anja languages, and its first pre-colonial meaning was “help” or “to assist”, in the sense of freely-given reciprocal help such as neighbours might <b>give</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> building huts or clearing fields. It also had the meaning of the agricultural work that a member of the village community did for his chief. The ownership of land in much of Malawi was vested in the community, not individuals. Traditional leaders acted as trustees over communal land, and granted the right to use it to individuals in their communities. By custom, these leaders received in gifts in kind or labour from those in their community who had benefitted. This was also called thangata. When communal land was plentiful, community leaders could not demand thangata, but once it became scarcer in the colonial period, and particularly after the introduction of Indirect rule on 1933, the chiefs could impose a condition of thangata work on any grant. In {{the last two or three}} decades, chiefs have begun to require cash sums or rents to allow the use of communal land, but these cash payments are not called thangata.|$|E

500|$|During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar {{gradually}} {{developed the}} [...] "Pixar Braintrust," [...] the studio's primary creative development process, {{in which all}} directors, writers, and lead storyboard artists at the studio look at each other's projects {{on a regular basis}} and <b>give</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> very candid [...] "notes" [...] (the industry term for constructive criticism). The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a [...] "filmmaker-driven studio," [...] in which creatives help each other move their films forward through a process somewhat like peer review, as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an [...] "executive-driven studio" [...] in which directors are micromanaged through [...] "mandatory notes" [...] from development executives ranking above the producers.

Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we <b>give</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

Yet despite Cleveland's prowess, the Browns went into the championship game as heavy underdogs against the Baltimore Colts.
