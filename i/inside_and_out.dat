5|$|On May 8, 2008 it was {{announced}} that Cole Hall would be remodeled <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> pending $7.7 million in state funding. This decision was made based on conversations between Dr. Peters and members of the campus community as well as the results of an online survey taken by students and faculty.|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>out,</b> as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E

5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks glued, and mostly faced <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with stitched rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} about 1735 and {{continued}} until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older {{house had been}} transformed <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>out.</b> The long building time partly explains the flaws and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, {{but by the time}} of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of Palladio's proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} may {{be manufactured}} from steel plate discs, which are cold {{drawn to a}} cylindrical cup form, {{in two or three}} stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.|$|E
