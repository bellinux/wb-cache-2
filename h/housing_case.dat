40|$|The scored Rorschachs of 30 {{schizophrenic}} patients criminally {{charged with}} threats against the President or other 2 ̆ 2 White House offenses 2 ̆ 2 were statistically compared to Rorschach data for a reference group fo 320 schizophrenics. These thirty patients represented the {{less than one}} percent of cases which the Secret Service chooses to charge criminally. ^ Study hypotheses were generated from psychodynamic formulations developed during the individual therapy and psychological evaluation of White <b>House</b> <b>cases</b> at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington D. C. Each psychodynamic hypothesis was operationalized as empirically coded Rorschach variables for the purpose of conducting statistical comparisons between White <b>House</b> <b>cases</b> and similarly diagnosed patients. ^ The Rorschach data indicate that the thirty White <b>House</b> <b>cases</b> differ from other schizophrenics in several important and sometimes counterintuitive respects. The White <b>House</b> <b>cases</b> were characterized not by a history of violence, but by a history of suicide attempts and gestures, as well as higher Rorschach suicide constellation scores. Compared to the schizophrenia reference group, the White <b>House</b> <b>case</b> Rorschachs were characterized not by aggressive content and fantasies, but by a preponderance of morbid images of self damage or narcissistic injury. The data also suggest that White <b>House</b> <b>cases</b> have a greater propensity for confusing the roles of aggressor and victim by relying on the primitive psychic defense of projective identification. ^ These psychodynamic characteristics of unconscious suicidal ideation, profound narcissistic injury, and projective identification are discussed as a White <b>House</b> <b>case</b> constellation. Associated cognitive styles and the aetiology of White <b>House</b> <b>case</b> delusional systems are discussed in the context of study results. Similarities and differences are noted between the mixed group of psychiatric White <b>House</b> <b>cases,</b> terrorists, and true potential assassins. ^ Actuarial efforts to develop an effective assassin profile from demographic/diagnostic variables and traditional indices of dangerousness (such as a history of arrest or violence) have been generally unsuccessful. Study results suggest that it may be helpful for the Secret Service to expend more research and clinical consultation focusing on the complex psychopathology specific to delusions of assassinating the President. Such an approach is particularly indicated because these cases are not characterized by a history of dangerousness, or even aggressive content on psychological testing. ...|$|R
