500|$|Although Duncan's initial tactics at {{the battle}} were {{reminiscent}} of those of Howe at the Glorious First of June, and his eventual attack {{has been compared to}} Nelson's tactics at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, Duncan credited the tactical work Essay on Naval Tactics by John Clerk of Eldin for inspiring his decisions on the day. Duncan was subsequently indirectly criticised some years after the battle by his colleague Earl St Vincent, who had won the Battle of Cape St Vincent over a Spanish fleet nine months before Camperdown. In a letter complaining of Clerk's assertion that he had been responsible for all of the major naval victories of the war, St Vincent wrote that Duncan [...] "was a brave officer, little versed in the subtleties of naval tactics, and who would have been quickly embarrassed by them. When he saw the enemy, he rushed upon him without thinking of such and such and order of battle. To conquer he calculated upon the brave example he set his captains, and the event justified his expectation." [...] This assessment was refuted by Captain Hotham, who publicly responded that [...] "the advanced season of the year and the close proximity of the enemy's coast all made what, upon another occasion, might have appeared haste imperatively necessary, for it was the prompt decision of the Admiral that occasioned the result". Some modern historians, such as Peter Padfield, have agreed with Hotham's assertion, with the added suggestion that Duncan's tactics during the battle might have had an influence on the newly promoted Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson, who was in England recovering from the loss of his right arm at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife at the time of Camperdown. Duncan himself felt that he could have done more, noting that [...] "We were obliged ... to be rather rash in our attack. Had we been ten leagues at sea none would have escaped." [...] but some of the highest praise came from his erstwhile opponent, De Winter, who wrote that [...] "Your not waiting to form line ruined me: if I had got nearer the shore and you had attacked, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have drawn both fleets on it, {{and it would have been}} a victory for me, being on my own coast." [...] Duncan's health deteriorated after the battle, forcing his retirement from the Navy in 1799 and contributing to his death at Cornhill-on-Tweed in 1804.|$|E
2500|$|When Maroney was 9 years old, {{she started}} {{training}} at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa, California. In 2012, she said, [...] "I realized that I {{had a dream}} that I {{wanted to go to}} the Olympics and I wanted to go as far as I could go. I thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> move to a new gym and start thinking about the Olympics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian had media {{interviews}} {{in the weeks}} leading up to and during Armageddons release week, saying in one, [...] "I think it's definitely time. I've released a few singles from this album already, like 'Don't Worry Be Happy', 'Gold' and 'Battle Scars', so three singles deep <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> get the album out". The fourth single [...] "Get Along" [...] was serviced to radio in the first week in November. Sebastian performed [...] "Get Along" [...] and [...] "Battle Scars" [...] on the Seven Network's morning program Sunrise on November 12. He also performed [...] "Get Along" [...] on the first night of the 2012 X Factor Grand Final on November 19. On 29 November Sebastian and Fiasco performed [...] "Battle Scars" [...] at the 2012 ARIA Music Awards. Sebastian and Fiasco continued the US promotion of [...] "Battle Scars" [...] in early 2013, performing the song on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon with The Roots, and on Conan. Both shows are also shown in Australia.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't see it. Besides, I {{might not}} have taken it if I had. As {{the wife of a}} {{struggling}} young playwright, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>probably</b> thought it unbecoming to drive. But the struggle is practically over, you'll be happy to know." ...|$|R
60|$|Realizing that {{he might}} break and run and that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> then <b>probably</b> miss him entirely, I raised my rifle to my shoulder. But even as I did so the animal leaped into the air, and {{simultaneously}} there was a sound of a shot from beyond the knoll.|$|R
2500|$|The revised 1870 {{second edition}} of 1,500 copies {{attracted}} more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs {{as the book}} became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical [...] "culture of progress" [...] in Otto von Bismarck's new German Empire. The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as Michael Foster of the University of Cambridge. In the introduction to his 1871 The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte [...] "had appeared before my essay had been written, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> never have completed it." [...] The first chapter included an illustration: [...] "As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, {{at about the same}} early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy" [...] with a footnote citing the sources and noting that [...] "Häckel has also given analogous drawings in his Schöpfungsgeschichte." [...] The fifth edition of Haeckel's book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Lord Arranmore answered. [...] "That little affair is {{not worth}} mentioning. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have done the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young man," [...] {{she said}} carelessly, [...] "I think I should prefer {{you in that}} capacity. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> see less of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would just}} as soon not tell it--rather not. There is no reason either why <b>I</b> <b>should,</b> as you <b>probably</b> will never {{have much to do with}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|I debated a moment, looking him {{squarely}} in the eyes. I had seen the frightful treatment of the cabin-boy, and knew that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> very <b>probably</b> receive the same, if not worse. As I say, I debated with myself, and then I did what I consider the bravest act of my life. I ran to the side, waving my arms and shouting: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{question}} we cannot decide, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say <b>probably</b> the Incas. We {{agreed that it}} was very possible they discovered the hidden treasures of the Chimoos. They must have learned, as the Spaniards did, how cleverly these places were hidden, and it must have been as evident to them as it is to us, that if there was a hiding-place here, this must be the spot." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily. I keep a diary {{in order}} to enter the {{wonderful}} secrets of my life. If I didn't write them down, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> forget all about them.|$|E
6000|$|Vanderbank {{had really}} {{to think a}} little. [...] "However much it might give me <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not be a fellow to gush. I'm a {{self-conscious}} stick of a Briton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hear that}} the English Church is to be open to-morrow, Mary. I called on the clergyman to-day {{and told him that}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> require his {{services}} next week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{will tell}} you," [...] replied the Prefect, as {{he gave a}} long, steady and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. [...] "I will tell {{you in a few}} words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair {{demanding}} the greatest secrecy, and that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> most <b>probably</b> lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> had, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> {{have put}} you on my knee, and told you fairy tales, or cut dolls for you out of this bark, instead of sitting respectfully silent and making a basket for your stores." ...|$|R
60|$|Of {{course we}} {{examined}} the premises. It was the ordinary basement or cellar of the San Francisco storehouse, cemented {{to keep out the}} damp. We poked our sticks into the pavement, and rapped on the walls, to satisfy our polite host--but for no other purpose. We were quite content to be the victims of any clever deception. For myself, I knew I was ready to be deluded to any extent, and, if I had been offered an explanation of what followed, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>probably</b> declined it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Blame him!" [...] and Jimmy's {{voice was}} strained. [...] "If I {{had had his}} load to carry and felt it as he did, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have gone under long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} you are," [...] Hunterleys remarked thoughtfully. [...] "I tell you frankly that if I thought you meant it, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> {{come to you}} before long for a little help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{need not}} suppose," [...] Sabatini replied. [...] "It {{is not worth}} while. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have done what the impulse of the moment demanded. So far, however, I have found most people reasonable." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bogdanovich later recalled:I {{thought that}} it would not be a very {{commercial}} picture, but I thought we'd made three in a row; what's wrong with making one that wasn't so commercial? This is not a good way to think. LAUGH Howard Hawks had warned me, [...] "Peter, make pictures that make money," [...] is what he said. It seems fairly obvious, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have listened to him... My partners, Coppola Ford Coppola and Friedkin Friedkin, were annoyed that I made it 'cause they saw it as a vanity production from my girlfriend. I thought it was rather a touching story. In retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>probably</b> done Rambling Rose which was a possibility at that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} allude to {{a matter of}} that sort," [...] he declared, [...] "unless I had {{satisfied}} myself as to the facts. It is true that I owe nothing to your husband and everything to you, or <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>probably</b> remained silent. As it is, all that I know is at your service. Felicia Roche is to make her début at the Opera House to-night. Your husband has been seen with her repeatedly. He was at her villa at one o'clock this morning. I have heard it {{said that he is}} a little infatuated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Eleanor," [...] he said, [...] "I {{hope you}} believe me when I assure {{you that you have}} no sincerer friend than I am." [...] To this Eleanor {{answered}} nothing, and therefore he proceeded. [...] "If you had a brother of your own, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>probably</b> trouble you with what I am going to say. But as it is I cannot but think that it must be a comfort to you to know that you have near you one who is as anxious for your welfare as any brother of your own could be." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{engineer}} skipped {{into the}} bracken like a rabbit. I bade him cut across Sir Michael Gregory's park, {{and if he}} caught my friend, to tell him <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be rather late for lunch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} bit of blame attaches to you," [...] she said. [...] "Had I been in your place, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> {{have done the same}} and behaved much more outrageously. For you were outrageous, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs Gowan, ma'am,' said Mr Meagles, 'I {{have been}} a plain man all my life. If I was to try--no matter whether on myself, on {{somebody}} else, or both--any genteel mystifications, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not succeed in them.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have always}} been a little haunted by that last dread. It gave a little {{undertow}} of funk to the mood of lively curiosity with which I got aboard the waterplane this morning--that sort of faint, thin funk that so readily invades one on the verge of any new experience; when one tries one's first dive, for example, or pushes off for the first time down an ice run. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>should</b> very <b>probably</b> be sea-sick--or, to be more precise, air-sick; I thought also that I might be very giddy, and that I might get thoroughly cold and uncomfortable None of those things happened.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the next}} evening after this that I went out to drink tea with two maiden ladies, {{relatives}} of mine, who kept a seminary for English girls at Brussels. The Misses Macmanus were very worthy women, and earned their bread in an upright, painstaking manner. I would not for worlds have passed through Brussels without paying them this compliment. They were, however, perhaps a little dull, and I was aware that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>probably</b> meet in their drawing- room many of the fashionable inhabitants of the city. Mr. Horne had declined to accompany me; but in doing so he {{was good enough to}} express a warm admiration for the character of my worthy cousins.|$|R
6000|$|Your elegant {{volume of}} Sonnets,[142] which you did me the honour to {{dedicate}} to me, was received {{a few months}} after the date of the accompanying letter; and the copy for Mr. Southey was forwarded immediately, as you may have learned long ago, by a letter from himself. Supposing you might not be returned from Scotland, I have deferred offering my thanks for this mark of your attention: and about the time when <b>I</b> <b>should</b> otherwise <b>probably</b> have written, I was seized with an inflammation in my eyes, from the effects of which I am not yet so far recovered as to make it prudent for me to use them in writing or reading.[143] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever I do {{is done in}} a hurry," [...] replied he; [...] "and {{therefore}} if I should {{resolve to}} quit Netherfield, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] the Princess answered. [...] "I {{suppose you}} have sense {{enough to see}} that we cannot stay on here for you to make your {{interesting}} confessions. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> have some of these tradespeople trying to put me in prison." ...|$|E
60|$|SOAMES. I {{admit that}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> not do so. I should perhaps be wrong not {{to steal the}} turnip: I cant defend my {{reluctance}} to do so; but I think I should not do so. I know I should not do so.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell is {{involved}} with a side band, The Dirty Knobs. [...] "It's rougher-edged ," [...] Campbell says of the group. [...] "It's slightly over-driven, less polished, lots of Sixties influence: The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, The Animals. It's something <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have done a long time ago, but I didn't 'cause I was {{wrapped up in the}} Heartbreakers." [...] Some Dirty Knobs material has been recorded.|$|R
5000|$|However, Campese {{later told}} Canberra sports {{journalist}} Geoff Hawke, in the Canberra Times, that he regretted publishing his comments about FitzSimons. Campese is reported saying that, “Fitzy {{is a good}} friend but he’s very upset about what I said about his fighting in a French Test last year. At the time, I thought it was okay, but in hindsight <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have toned it down.” ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{coming up}} just short, Truex said he [...] "did all I thought I could do. I had the lead. <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>should</b> have run him {{up a little}} more, just lost in the last second. … Really proud of everybody. Really proud of the {{teamwork}} with the JGR guys. We're team players, and we're {{in it for the}} long haul with them. Congrats to Denny. He beat me by a couple of feet.” ...|$|R
