"Virtual {{reference}} is reference service <b>initiated</b> <b>electronically,</b> often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet technology {{to communicate with}} reference staff, without being physically present. Communication channels used frequently in virtual reference include chat, videoconferencing, Voice over IP, co-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging.|$|E
5000|$|As {{libraries}} {{have begun}} to adopt technology into their operations, {{the idea of the}} virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service <b>initiated</b> <b>electronically,</b> often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, co-browsing and instant messaging.|$|E
50|$|Customer {{agencies}} are charged on a per-query basis, with {{a cost of}} $0.50 each for initial verification, retry, and additional verification, and a cost of $2.00 for a paper G-845 if the verification process is not <b>initiated</b> <b>electronically.</b> Billing is monthly, {{and there is a}} minimum monthly service transaction charge of $25.00 if the SAVE program is used at all, any time within the month. There is no charge during months when SAVE is not used at all. This pricing structure for SAVE has been effective since October 1, 2008. Billing is done by the USCIS's Burlington Financial Center, and methods of payment include credit card and check.|$|E
50|$|Metal Storm Limited was a {{research}} and development company based in Brisbane, Australia that specialized in <b>electronically</b> <b>initiated</b> superposed load weapons technology and owned the proprietary rights to the electronic ballistics technology invented by J. Mike O'Dwyer. The Metal Storm name applied to both the company and technology.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there is}} also an option of pure paper-based verification, where the agency {{directly}} submits a paper Form G-845, and gets a response within 10 to 20 federal government work days. This costs the customer agency $2, compared to the total maximum charge of $1.50 if <b>initiating</b> the query <b>electronically.</b> However, this option is discouraged since the use of electronic means for Initial Verification saves time and money for all parties involved.|$|R
50|$|In Finland, banks stopped issuing {{personal}} cheques {{in about}} 1993 {{in favour of}} giro systems, which are now almost exclusively <b>electronically</b> <b>initiated</b> either via internet banking or payment machines located at banks and shopping malls. All Nordic countries have used an interconnected international giro system since the 1950s, and in Sweden, cheques are now almost totally abandoned; in Denmark, all banks will stop accepting cheques by 1 January 2017. Credit cards are now preferred for direct shop payments when not using cash. For large shop payments, such as car purchases, a type of cheque, a money order (Swedish:postväxel) is still used.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2012 American Institute of PhysicsPhase-change devices exhibit {{characteristic}} threshold {{switching from}} the reset (off) {{to the set}} (on) state. Mainstream understanding of this electrical switching phenomenon {{is that it is}} <b>initiated</b> <b>electronically</b> via the influence of high electric fields on inter-band trap states in the amorphous phase. However, recent work has suggested that field induced (crystal) nucleation could instead be responsible. We compare and contrast these alternative switching “theories” via realistic simulations of device switching both with and without electric field dependent contributions to the system free energy. Results show that although threshold switching can indeed be obtained purely by electric field induced nucleation, the fields required are significantly larger than experimentally measured values...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the organization, structure {{and modes of}} operation of the virtual reference interactive communication platform Ask a librarian offered to the academic community by Poznań University Library. The main goal of the implemented platform is to provide quick, immediate and reliable reference service and to enable patrons to have the Library remotely accessible by choosing methods of communication most suitable to them. The Ask a librarian platform combines a number of <b>initiated</b> <b>electronically</b> internet technology forms of synchronous communication channels that include instant messaging (chat), such as AIM, Yahoo!, MSN, Google Talk, Tlen, GG, Skype, as well as asynchronous communication, i. e. via e-mail, web-based submission forms and Voip helpdesk. To contact a consultant on duty, patrons can also find mobile telephone numbers for communication. Enquiries are answered {{by a team of}} qualified library consultants on duty in the virtual library. The article emphasizes the role of educational training sessions for consultants in maintaining the effective and efficient operation of the service. Additionally, statistical data, forms and types of enquiry hitherto recorded {{in the history of the}} service are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Electron stimulated {{desorption}} (ESD) of fragment anions {{and thermal}} desorption spectroscopy (TDS) {{is applied to}} study reactions in thin films of afewCF 3 COOH/CF 3 COOD monolayers following low energy electron impact (0 – 20 eV). In ESD, the fragment ions H − /D − and F − are observed via resonant features in the energy range 5 – 12 eV similar to the dissociative electron attachment (DEA) resonances present in gas phase CF 3 COOH. Extended electron irradiation of the film at energies above 9 eV generates CO 2 and CHF 3 /CF 4 as revealed {{by a combination of}} TDS and ESD experiments. The yield for these reactions continuously increases with energy indicating that they are <b>initiated</b> via <b>electronically</b> excited neutrals rather than negative ion resonances. No reactions induced by sub-excitation electrons (≈ 1 eV) could be observed using the present experimental techniques. In a very recent study on electron attachment to clusters of CF 3 COOH [J. Langer, I. Martin, G. Karwasz, E. Illenberger, Int. J. Mass Spectrom. Ion Processes 249 / 250 (2006), 477], the ion–molecule complex CF 3 COO − ·H 2 O appeared as strongest signal via a resonance located at 0. 4 eV...|$|R
40|$|Central banks analyse issues {{concerning}} retail payments - or just payments - {{to be able}} to promote optimal means of payment. Over the years, electronic payments - i. e. payments <b>initiated</b> and settled <b>electronically</b> - have gradually replaced manual paper-based payments on the grounds of convenience, security and efficiency. Moreover, payments become more efficient when services are offered to customers both before and after payment. These so-called value-added services (VAS) are fully electronic services such as e-invoicing and e-reconciliation, which bring time and cost-savings for all participants, as paper-based services and manual work are replaced. In this paper we prove a clear-cut distinction between electronic payment products (e-payments) and VAS. We use the so-called Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project as a case study and discuss its current state of fatigue. Based on practical experience in Europe we conclude that the SEPA fatigue can be overcome by real-time settlement for payments and VAS supporting end-to-end (e 2 e) straight-through processing (STP) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the price discovery {{process in the}} S&P 500 and Nasdaq- 100 index futures contracts. By utilizing transactions data with attached trader type identification codes, this paper is able to analyze price discovery contributions of trades initiated by exchange locals and off-exchange customers. The empirical results show that price discovery appears to be <b>initiated</b> in the <b>electronically</b> traded E-mini index futures contracts and is driven by trades initiated by exchange locals. Furthermore, the information share of trades initiated by locals appears to be particularly pronounced {{in the beginning of}} the trading day when a large proportion of the daily price discovery takes place. Finally, results show that E-mini locals “front-run ” large trades that occur on the open outcry floor. We maintain that this trading technique at least partially explains the result of the price leadership of the E-mini contracts. Overall, the results are consistent with the notion that locals are informed traders who derive their informational advantage from the proximity to order flow...|$|R
50|$|The VFR800 was {{the first}} non-JDM {{motorcycle}} to use VTEC valve-gear. Honda used VTEC to meet tightening noise and emissions standards and to increase the peak engine horsepower.Based on the VTEC-E system, the simplified motorcycle version of VTEC employs {{only two of the}} four valves per cylinder when operating at lower engine speeds. All four valves per cylinder are engaged above approximately 6,800 rpm. This is <b>initiated</b> by an <b>electronically</b> actuated oil spool valve, which send oil pressure to the lifter actuators, which then move the engagement pins into place above the valve stem, allowing the remaining two valves to open. This design allows for variable valve timing as well, since the cam lobe profiles can be made different. After much criticism of the abruptness of power transition, Honda lowered the VTEC activation rpm threshold to 6,400 rpm in 2006. The VTEC disengages two cylinder valves when the engine speed drops again below 6,100 rpm.|$|R
40|$|The Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic, {{caused by}} the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a global crisis which threatens {{development}} gains, economies, and societies. Within sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic began the earliest and the HIV prevalence is the highest, African countries have death rates not seen before. In South Africa the epidemic has a devastating impact which creates profound suffering on individuals and their families, and {{the impact on the}} socio-economic level is of great concern. The eradication of HIV/AIDS represents one of humanity’s greatest challenges, which requires co-operation and comprehensive collaboration between many different role players. In this endeavour clinical information plays a major role. To combat the effect of the disease, the Free State Department of Health started with the provisioning of antiretroviral therapy in the public health sector. The objective of this paper was to address the challenges they faced in order to develop and implement an information system to manage the rollout of antiretroviral treatment effectively. They started with a paper-based system to collect vital information. It was followed by a palm computer project that was <b>initiated</b> to <b>electronically</b> capture the data collected by the paper-based system. This system was then replaced by a comprehensive Hospital and Clinic Information System which was acquired and customised for the antiretroviral data collection process. Research partners developed a standalone antiretroviral data warehouse for collecting information associated with the monitoring and evaluation of the Free State antiretroviral and HIV/ AIDS treatment programme. The data warehouse successfully produced several management information reports to the antiretroviral management team. A need was identified to design a comprehensive antiretroviral data warehouse that will integrate data from several operational sources which are all associated with HIV/AIDS. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of centralized blasting systems is progressively becoming {{a feature of}} the South African mining industry, owing to increased pressure from the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) to ensure safer blasting conditions. The purpose of a centralized blasting system (CBS) is to ensure reduced blasting-related incidents and improve the underground working environment for the mine’s employees. The brief from Samancor Western Chrome Mines (WCM) pertaining to this study was to explore—at a conceptual level–all variables pertaining to the implementation of the CBS. Studies have indicated that Sasol’s SafeBlastTM was preferred due to low overall risks and user-friendliness. Empirical observations, however, indicated that attention should be given to the current shaft-clearing procedure and to the installation of additional transformers. This is required to coordinate the power supply from 2 level to 10 level with the required supply of the network slave station. A cost analysis indicated that an <b>electronically</b> <b>initiated</b> CBS will result in a R 24 cost increase per panel, which relates to a mere 1 % cost increase per panel. This cost, in addition to the R 1. 1 million capital cost, proved to be negligible in comparison to the possible direct and indirect costs incurred by the mine {{in the event of a}} blasting-related incident. It was found that Samancor should conduct further studies incorporating the necessary requirements to ensure a successful transition, while considering all stakeholders on the mine. This study proved that the transition to a CBS would ensure safe and efficient blasting at Samancor’s Mooinooi Mine. Paper written on project work carried out in partial fulfilment of B.
