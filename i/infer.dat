The objectively <b>inferred</b> polarities are {{compared with a}} subjective index <b>inferred</b> earlier (Svalgaard, 1972 b). It is concluded that no significant difference exists between the two methods. The <b>inferred</b> polarities derived from Godhavn H are biased by the Sq-p signature {{in the sense that}} during summer, prolonged intervals of geomagnetic calm will result in <b>inferred</b> away polarity regardless of the actual sector polarity. This bias does not significantly alter the large-scale structure of the <b>inferred</b> sector structure...|$|R
40|$|To solve tasks {{concerning}} distances along a route, between locations which {{cannot be}} perceived {{from a single}} vantage point, people and other cognitive agents must generate <b>inferred</b> route distances. <b>Inferred</b> route distances, and <b>inferred</b> distances in general, are {{a special kind of}} subjective distances: <b>Inferred</b> distances cannot be retrieved from memory, but have to be <b>inferred</b> from several pieces of knowledge about distances whicheachhave been perceived from a single vantage point. What is the information content of <b>inferred</b> route distances, and how are they <b>inferred?</b> In this context, an important question is in what sense they, like other central concepts of spatial cognition, are qualitative, and in what sense they are quantitative. To answer these questions, the present study relates dierent theories of subjective distances to one another, anditdevelops a computational model of <b>inferred</b> route distances. It thereby aims to integrate research from arti cial intelligence, in particular Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, and cognitive psychology...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inferring</b> {{evolutionary}} trees {{has long}} been a challenging problem both for biologists and computer scientists. In recent years research has concentrated on the quartet method paradigm for <b>inferring</b> evolutionary trees. Quartet methods proceed by first <b>inferring</b> the evolutionary history for every set of four species (resulting in a set Q of <b>inferred</b> quartet topologies) and then recombining these <b>inferred</b> quartet topologies to form an evolutionary tree. This paper presents two results on the quartet method paradigm. The first is a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for recombining the <b>inferred</b> quartet topologies optimally. This is an important result since, to date, there have been no polynomial time algorithms with performance guarantees for quartet methods. In fact, this is the first known PTAS for <b>inferring</b> evolutionary trees under any paradigm. To achieve this result the natural denseness of the set Q is exploited. The second result is a new technique, called quartet cleaning, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|People rely {{extensively}} on inference {{as a source}} of information, and sometimes they confuse inference with observation. Specifically, <b>inferred</b> information is sometimes mistaken for observed information. Such confusion of inference with observation can be problematic, especially if the <b>inferred</b> information is erroneous. One factor that might affect the probability of mistaking inference for observation is the degree of consistency between <b>inferred</b> information and subsequently encountered information. The present research was designed to test this possibility. In three experiments subjects made inferences on the basis of presented information, and then were given additional information that was varied in consistency with the information they had <b>inferred.</b> Finally, subjects were tested for accuracy in discriminating the source (inference vs. observation) of the <b>inferred</b> information. As expected, accuracy was lower when subsequently presented information was relatively consistent with <b>inferred</b> information than when it was relatively inconsistent with <b>inferred</b> information. This effect did not vary with delay between making an inference and attempting to discriminate information source. It is concluded that consistency of <b>inferred</b> information with subsequently encountered information can affect the probability of mistaking inference for observation, with the probability of error increasing as consistency increases...|$|R

5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to <b>infer</b> phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E
