40|$|The oxazolidinones are a novel {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} that act by inhibiting protein synthesis. It as {{been reported that}} the drug exerts its primary activity on the initiation phase of translation. In order to study the possibility of direct interaction between the drug and the ribosome, we have developed a binding assay using 14 C-labelled <b>eperezolid</b> (PNU- 100592; formerly U- 100592). <b>Eperezolid</b> binds specifically to the 50 S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli. The specific binding of <b>eperezolid</b> is dose dependent and {{is proportional to the}} ribosome concentrations. Scatchard analysis of the binding data reveals that the dissociation constant (Kd) is about 20 microM. The binding of <b>eperezolid</b> to the ribosome is competitively inhibited by chloramphenicol and lincomycin. However, unlike chloramphenicol and lincomycin, <b>eperezolid</b> does not inhibit the puromycin reaction, indicating that the oxazolidinones have no effect on peptidyl transferase. In addition, whereas lincomycin and, to some extent, chloramphenicol inhibit translation termination, <b>eperezolid</b> has no effect. Therefore, we conclude that the oxazolidinones inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50 S ribosomal subunit at a site close to the site(s) to which chloramphenicol and lincomycin bind but that the oxazolidinones are mechanistically distinct from these two antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|The oxazolidinones are a {{relatively}} new structural class of antibacterial agents that act by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. The oxazolidinones inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis, as shown by [35 S]methionine incorporation into intact rat heart mitochondria. Treatment of K 562 human erythroleukemia cells with the oxazolidinone <b>eperezolid</b> resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. The cells remained viable, but an increase in doubling time was observed with <b>eperezolid</b> treatment. Inhibition was reversible, since washing and refeeding of cells {{in the absence of}} compound resulted in a resumption of growth. The growth-inhibitory effect of the oxazolidinones {{did not appear to be}} cell type specific, and inhibition of CHO and HEK cells also was demonstrated. Treatment of cells resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I levels, consistent with an inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis. <b>Eperezolid</b> caused no growth inhibition of rho zero (ρ 0) cells, which contain no mitochondrial DNA; however, the growth of the parent 143 B cells was inhibited. These results provide a direct demonstration that the inhibitory effect of <b>eperezolid</b> in mammalian cells is the result of mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{effectiveness}} of oxazolidinones <b>eperezolid</b> (U- 100592) and linezolid (U- 100766) against one strain each of Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was examined in a rat model of intra-abdominal abscess. MICs of both drugs were 2 μg/ml for each strain. At doses of 25 mg/kg {{of body weight}} twice daily intravenously or orally, linezolid produced small but statistically significant reductions in abscess bacterial density for E. faecalis. The reduction in viable cells observed would not likely be clinically relevant. <b>Eperezolid</b> was ineffective at this dose. At a dosage of 100 mg/kg/day, linezolid treatment led to an approximately 100 -fold reduction in viable cells per gram of abscess. Against E. faecium infections, intravenous <b>eperezolid</b> and oral linezolid were effective, reducing densities approximately 2 log 10 CFU/g.

40|$|The oxazolidinones are a novel {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} that inhibit initiation of protein synthesis in bacteria. In order to investigate their novel mechanism of action, {{the interactions of}} several oxazolidinones with bacterial 70 S ribosomes, 50 S subunits, and 30 S subunits have been characterized by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) line-broadening analyses and transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement (TRNOE) experiments. PNU- 177553 and PNU- 100592 (<b>eperezolid)</b> and their corresponding enantiomers, PNU- 184414 and PNU- 107112, were studied. The dissociation constants were determined to be 94 ± 44 μM and 195 ± 40 μM for PNU- 177553 and <b>eperezolid,</b> respectively. There was a ∼ 4 -fold decrease in affinity for their corresponding enantiomers. The NMR-derived dissociation constants are consistent with their antibacterial activity. PNU- 177553 and <b>eperezolid</b> were found to bind only to the 50 S subunit, with similar affinity as to the 70 S ribosome, and to have no affinity for the 30 S subunit. Specific binding of PNU- 177553 was further confirmed in TRNOE experiments in which positive NOEs observed for the small molecule alone were changed to negative NOEs {{in the presence of}} bacterial 70 S ribosomes. The observed NOEs indicated that PNU- 177553 did not adopt a significantly different conformation when bound to the 70 S ribosome, compared to the extended conformation that exists when free in solution. Since this is likeliest the case {{for each of the four}} compounds included in this study, the A ring C 5 side chain may be positioned in the proper orientation for antibacterial activity in PNU- 177553 and <b>eperezolid</b> but not in their inactive enantiomers...|$|E
40|$|The oxazolidinones are a {{new class}} of {{synthetic}} antibiotics with good activity against gram-positive pathogenic bacteria. Experiments with a susceptible Escherichia coli strain, UC 6782, demonstrated that in vivo protein synthesis was inhibited by both <b>eperezolid</b> (formerly U- 100592) and linezolid (formerly U- 100766). Both linezolid and <b>eperezolid</b> were potent inhibitors of cell-free transcription-translation in E. coli, exhibiting 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of 1. 8 and 2. 5 microM, respectively. The ability to demonstrate inhibition of in vitro translation directed by phage MS 2 RNA was greatly dependent upon the amount of RNA added to the assay. For <b>eperezolid,</b> 128 microg of RNA per ml produced an IC 50 of 50 microM whereas a concentration of 32 microg/ml yielded an IC 50 of 20 microM. Investigating lower RNA template concentrations in linezolid inhibition experiments revealed that 32 and 8 microg of MS 2 phage RNA per ml produced IC 50 s of 24 and 15 microM, respectively. This phenomenon was shared by the translation initiation inhibitor kasugamycin but not by streptomycin. Neither oxazolidinone inhibited the formation of N-formylmethionyl-tRNA, elongation, or termination reactions of bacterial translation. The oxazolidinones appear to inhibit bacterial translation at the initiation phase of protein synthesis...|$|E

All regimens tested {{resulted in the}} growth inhibition of each isolate. Against the three clinafloxacin-susceptible strains, clinafloxacin tested alone was the most active treatment, decreasing the bacterial inoculum by more than 3 log 10 CFU/ml after 24 h in time-kill curve studies...|$|E
40|$|Central venous {{catheter}} (CVC) -related infection (CVC-RI) is {{a common}} complication of CVC use. The most common etiological agents of CVC-RI are gram-positive organisms, in particular, staphylococci. An in vitro model {{for the formation of}} biofilms by Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 on polyurethane coupons in a modified Robbins device was established. Biofilm formation was confirmed by electron microscopy and was quantified by determination of viable counts. Mueller-Hinton broth was replaced with sterile physiological saline (control) or a solution of vancomycin (10 mg/ml), gentamicin (10 mg/ml), linezolid (2 mg/ml), or <b>eperezolid</b> (4 mg/ml). Viable counts were performed with the coupons after exposure to antimicrobials for periods of 24, 72, 168, and 240 h. The mean viable count per coupon following establishment of the biofilm was 4. 6 × 108 CFU/coupon, and that after 14 days of exposure to physiological saline was 2. 5 × 107 CFU/coupon. On exposure to vancomycin (10 mg/ml), the mean counts were 2. 5 × 107 CFU/coupon at 24 h, 4. 3 × 106 CFU/coupon at 72 h, 1. 4 × 105 CFU/coupon at 168 h, and undetectable at 240 h. With gentamicin (10 mg/ml) the mean counts were 2. 7 × 107 CFU/coupon at 24 h, 3. 7 × 106 CFU/coupon at 72 h, 8. 4 × 106 CFU/coupon at 168 h, and 6. 5 × 106 CFU/coupon at 240 h. With linezolid at 2 mg/ml the mean counts were 7. 1 × 105 CFU/coupon at 24 h and not detectable at 72, 168, and 240 h. With <b>eperezolid</b> (4 mg/ml) no viable cells were recovered after 168 h. These data suggest that linezolid (2 mg/ml) and <b>eperezolid</b> (4 mg/ml) achieve eradication of S. epidermidis biofilms more rapidly than vancomycin (10 mg/ml) and gentamicin (10 mg/ml) ...|$|E
40|$|Oxazolidinone-resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, {{isolated}} with {{a spiral}} plating technique, had a 16 -fold higher MIC (2 versus 32 mg/ml) of <b>eperezolid</b> {{when compared to}} the parental sensitive strain. <b>Eperezolid</b> inhibited in vitro protein translation with 50 % inhibitory concentrations of 30 mM for the oxazolidinone-sen-sitive S 30 extract and 75 mM for the resistant extract. Experiments mixing various combinations of S 100 and crude ribosome preparations from oxazolidinone-sensitive and-resistant S. aureus strains in a transcription-translation assay demonstrated that the resistant determinant resided within the ribosomal fraction. Ribosomes from the oxazolidinone-resistant strain bound less drug than ribosomes from the sensitive strain, indicating that the ribosome is the site of action for the oxazolidinones. These experiments demonstrate that an alteration of the ribosome is responsible for {{some or all of the}} oxazolidinone resistance observed in the S. aureus mutant.

40|$|The {{activities}} of linezolid, <b>eperezolid,</b> and PNU- 100480 were evaluated in a murine model of tuberculosis. Approximately 107 viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 35801 organisms were given intravenously to 4 -week-old outbred CD- 1 mice. In the first study, treatment was started 1 day postinfection {{and was given}} by gavage for 4 weeks. Viable cell counts were determined from homogenates of spleens and lungs. PNU- 100480 was as active as isoniazid. Linezolid was somewhat less active than PNU- 100480 and isoniazid. <b>Eperezolid</b> had little activity in this model. In the next two studies, treatment was started 1 week postinfection. A dose-response study was performed with PNU- 100480 and linezolid (both at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg of body weight). PNU- 100480 was more active than linezolid, and its efficacy increased with an escalation of the dose. Subsequently, the activity of PNU- 100480 alone and in combination with rifampin or isoniazid was evaluated and was {{compared to that of}} isoniazid-rifampin.

Commercial lots of linezolid (formerly U- 100766) and <b>eperezolid</b> (formerly U- 100592) disks containing 30 microg of drug were tested against 728 isolates of bacteria with defined mechanisms of resistance. Results from linezolid were highlighted {{because of its}} choice for clinical development. By using preliminary pharmacokinetic data, a tentative susceptibility breakpoint of or = 21 mm (or = 16 microg/ml) for resistance. Regression statistics demonstrated a high correlation coefficient (r > or = 0. 98), and absolute categorical agreement between methods was obtained, when staphylococci and enterococci were tested with the cited criteria. When Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) were tested, only the susceptibility breakpoint was suggested. Quality control (QC) guidelines for linezolid disk diffusion tests were established by a multilaboratory trial as follows: 27 to 31 mm for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and 28 to 34 mm for S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619. More than 95 % of all QC results were within these proposed ranges. Although not advanced to clinical trials, <b>eperezolid</b> demonstrated potency {{comparable to that of}} linezolid and had identical interpretive testing criteria.
