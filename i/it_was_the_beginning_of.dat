5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> Koufax's {{breakout}} season. Posting an 18–13 {{record for}} the Dodgers in 1961, Koufax led the league with 269 strikeouts, breaking Christy Mathewson's 58-year-old NL mark of 267. Koufax was selected as an All-Star {{for the first time}} and made two All-Star Game appearances; MLB held two All-Star games from 1959 through 1962. He faced only one batter in the 9th inning in the first game, giving up a hit to Al Kaline and he pitched two scoreless innings in the second game.|$|E
5|$|The German 500 was {{the first}} CART race ever {{to be held in}} Europe. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a two-week European stretch for the series; the Rockingham 500 was held at Rockingham Motor Speedway in Corby, England one week later. EuroSpeedway {{chairman}} Hans Joerg Fischer hoped for a crowd of 70,000 at the track, which had a capacity of 90,000.|$|E
5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln {{to send his}} army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the end for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the only significant obstacle remaining.|$|E
50|$|A megakaryoblast is a {{precursor}} cell to a promegakaryocyte, {{which in turn}} becomes a megakaryocyte during haematopoiesis. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of <b>the</b> thrombocytic series.|$|R

5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman {{had written to}} Carson {{welcoming}} her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere {{in the region of}} 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E
5|$|While {{this was}} not yet {{the end of the}} media’s freedom after the Prague Spring, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, {{declared}} that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies Reporter and Politika responded harshly to this threat, even {{going so far as to}} not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in Politika, the government banned Reporter for a month, suspended Politika indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.|$|E
5|$|In Milan, Sforza's enemies worked {{continually}} against him. The Piccinino brothers, sons {{of famous}} condottiere Niccolò Piccinino and former Captains-General before being replaced as supreme military commanders by Sforza, convinced the suspicious Republic to work secretly against Sforza. Rumors were spread among the troops about not receiving payment {{at the end}} of the war if they remained with Sforza, and Sforza himself was ordered back from the siege of Brescia, the city promised to him, while the citizens were secretly told to hold out until peace, already in the works, was signed. Sforza learned of this treachery and defected to the Venetians for 13,000 ducats and the Duchy of Milan in return for the Ghiaradadda, Crema, and his service. The treaty was signed on 18 October 1448, and Sforza now undid everything he had labored for over the past year. With such a powerful man on the Venetian side, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the end of the Golden Ambrosian Republic. Public opinion, despite the government's position, was generally pro-Sforza, and only an impassioned, patriotic speech from Giorgio Lampugnano subdued it at last. The Piccinino brothers became Captains-General once more, but were not as capable as the brilliant Sforza.|$|E
50|$|Exceptionally, in August 1978 Antonio Sicurezza {{does not}} go to Santa Maria Capua Vetere for {{the annual meeting of}} <b>the</b> Assumption. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of <b>the</b> {{sickness}} that, a year later, August 29, 1979, will bring the artist to die at the age of 74 years.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, {{pursuing}} {{a claim that}} Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined {{to make such a}} written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear lines of authority in the church to match the lines of authority in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the long-running Canterbury–York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{together}} with his colleague Nicholas Hildyard, Goldsmith authored a multi-volume report on the destructive effects of large-scale, hydroelectric dams. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a long attack against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which Goldsmith and his colleagues accused of financing {{the destruction of the}} planet.|$|E
25|$|The Classic era of Argentine {{rock music}} was {{completely}} over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated, grandiose, and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including Pastoral, and Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> {{the period of}} symphonic and progressive rock dominance.|$|E

25|$|The Junta of Aranjuez {{provided}} {{that each of}} the Spanish colonies send a representative to participate in its deliberations. This provision had a counterproductive effect in New Spain.

The Criollos deemed a single representative much too minor a concession to be of value.|$|E
25|$|Martineau began {{losing her}} senses of {{taste and smell}} at a young age, {{becoming}} increasingly deaf and having to use an ear trumpet. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> many health problems in her life.

25|$|He was {{a member}} of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) Supreme Council and was {{believed}} to be involved in gun-running (a matter on which in later life he threatened legal action). While he remained an active member during his early years in Parliament, as early as 1868–69 he had promoted co-operation with constitutional politicians such as George Henry Moore. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the New Departure.|$|E
25|$|From 1936-1937, Rush {{joined the}} Duke University faculty as an {{assistant}} professor and taught law.

25|$|Pierre Laval {{had succeeded}} Louis Barthou as Foreign Minister after the latter's {{assassination}} in Marseilles on October 9, 1934, {{at the side}} of the Alexander I King of Yugoslavia. He borrowed from his predecessor the idea of a system of collective security intended to contain the threat of Hitler in Europe. On January 4, 1935, Pierre Laval went to Rome, capital of Fascist Italy, to meet Mussolini. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a diplomatic offensive intended to enclose Adolf Hitler's Germany in a network of alliances.|$|E
25|$|Miller, who was chafing at the {{constraints}} of academic life, gladly left academia to help Newman with her organizing. Within the year, the two were living together. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a turbulent but mutually satisfying relationship that would last until Miller’s death in 1974. In 1923, the two women moved to New York’s Greenwich Village, where they raised Miller’s daughter together.

25|$|For the Burmese Empire, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the end {{of their}} independence. The Third Burmese Empire, for a brief time the terror of British India, was {{crippled}} and no longer a threat to the eastern frontier of British India. The Burmese would be crushed for years to come by repaying the large indemnity of one million pounds (then US$5 million), a large sum at that time. The British would wage two more wars against a much-weakened Burma, and swallow up the entire country by 1885.|$|E
