5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a collective clan crest, just as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|In one scene, C.J. {{says that}} special {{prosecutor}} Rollins was {{the editor of}} the Yale Law Review. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as the Yale Law Review, though the journal of legal scholarship affiliated with the Yale Law School is called the Yale Law Journal.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E
60|$|EVE [thoughtfully] There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as nothing. The {{garden is}} full, not empty.|$|R

25|$|A {{study that}} looked at other {{factors other than}} energy {{consumption}} and carbon emissions has suggested that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as an environmentally friendly car.|$|E
25|$|Conservation: The {{meaning is}} similar, {{with and without}} the supplement: There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a free lunch, but there is always free cheese in a mousetrap.|$|E
25|$|Hindu and Buddhist philosophies {{state that}} any event {{is the result}} of {{previous}} events, as reflected in the concept of karma, and as such there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a random event or a first event.|$|E
6000|$|... "No fear! I'm not a turnip. I've {{started in}} Hammersmith, manufacturing." [...] Sid spoke offhand {{as though there}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as pride.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} was silent a few moments, driving his pencil. Then at last, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as mistakes," [...] he affirmed.|$|R
60|$|Miss Betsey, {{without taking}} the least {{notice of the}} interruption, {{continued}} to address herself to Mr. Murdstone as if there had <b>been</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Wicca, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as hell because Wiccans largely do {{not believe}} in the concept of {{punishment}} or reward. Although Wiccan views differ among different denominations, Wiccans tend to prefer viewing the Horned God and the Goddess as gentle deities.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term postmodern there are critics of its application. Kirk Varnedoe, for instance, stated that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as postmodernism, and that the {{possibilities}} of modernism {{have not yet been}} exhausted. These critics are currently in the minority.|$|E
25|$|John Lukacs, Hungarian-American {{historian}} and Holocaust survivor, argues that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as generic fascism. He claims that National Socialism and communism are essentially manifestations of populism and that {{states such as}} National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy are more different than similar.|$|E
25|$|Without {{freedom of}} thought there can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as wisdom, and <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as public liberty without freedom of speech, which is the right of every man...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Much more Fennimorically than I {{wish her}} to hear, or you to speak,' said Honora; 'you talk {{as if there}} <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as truth.' ...|$|R
60|$|Sin is a {{thing that}} writes itself across a man's, face. It cannot be concealed. People talk {{sometimes}} of secret vices. There <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{explains}} {{that there is}} a cause for every effect, and an effect for every cause. It also states that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as chance, that chance is merely a term indicating extant causes not recognized or perceived. The Principle is clarified in the chapter Causation.|$|E
25|$|After 21 {{months of}} investigation, judge Juan del Olmo {{processed}} Moroccan national Jamal Zougam, among several others, for his participation {{carrying out the}} attack. The September 2007 sentence established no known mastermind nor direct al-Qaeda link, but experts have repeatedly said that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as an intellectual author in Spanish law.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius. Weininger argues that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{chain of}} {{incidents}} that drew her there was plain, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as {{chance in the}} matter. It was all Edward's doing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{may well}} ask me, love,' replied Lady Annabel; 'it seems a spell-bound place. But, Venetia, I have often told you there <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as ghosts.' ...|$|R

25|$|The popular {{mind was}} taken with Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. This was {{accompanied}} by other feminist philosophers, such as Alicia Ostriker and Adrienne Rich. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values like objectivity and what {{they believe to be}} masculine approaches to ethics, such as rights-based political theories. They maintained there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{the same}} {{principle}} it might be pretended there should <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as personals, as they tempt men, beyond what they can bear, to commit petty larceny." ...|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom of León {{started as}} an {{independent}} Kingdom in 910 when the seat of Asturias moved to León, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as an official name change.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{am quite}} happy. Don't trouble about me," [...] she said, {{laughing}} as merrily {{as though there}} <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>things</b> as sore feet and headaches in the world.|$|R
25|$|There simply <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> {{among us}} as a {{doctrine}} of blood atonement that grants a remission of sins or confers any other benefit upon a person because his own blood is shed for sins. Let me say categorically and unequivocally that this doctrine can only operate in a day {{when there is no}} separation of Church and State and when the power to take life is vested in the ruling theocracy {{as was the case in}} the day of Moses.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{fair hearing}} may also include the rights to legal representation, to {{cross-examine}} witnesses, and to be given reasons for a decision; and a presumption in favour of an oral hearing. An applicant claiming a breach of the fair hearing requirement has {{to prove that he}} or she suffered substantial injustice since there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> in law as a technical breach of natural justice. The requirements of fair hearing depend on the circumstances of the case such as the nature of the inquiry, the rules governing the tribunal, and the subject matter being dealt with.|$|E
25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We {{need to be very}} clear about this. On the streets of London there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E
6000|$|... "How I wish," [...] sighed Tom Collins, smoking languidly, [...] "that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as reasoning. You {{would be}} a much more {{agreeable}} fellow, Ned, if you didn't argue." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Lady Barbara was not {{far from}} the truth when she told her sister [...] "that Katharine was {{perfectly}} hard and reckless; there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as making her sorry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "What {{put that}} {{question}} into your head? Christmas, I suppose; and that's {{another reason for}} wishing there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b> If I had my way, there wouldn't be." ...|$|R
