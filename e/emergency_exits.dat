5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools {{could no longer}} be considered isolated incidents, and that police and security forces had to approach them with a new perspective in the aftermath of Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more <b>emergency</b> <b>exits,</b> and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E
5|$|Either {{entrance}} can be {{the front}} entrance for this symmetric building under the elevated railway. The lobby {{on the ground floor}} greets visitors entering or exiting the building. Entering the ticketing gate, travelers can take the escalators or stairs to the waiting areas on the second floor. Two waiting areas for passengers that lead to the northbound and southbound trains are connected by an air bridge. Two escalators and one stairway take passengers to the platforms. There are ten <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> around the platforms.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated. Upgrades {{included}} new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators, {{a more powerful}} fire safety system, improved <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> and replacement of cables. The upgrade made the old section lighter, as it was previously painted in dark red, and visually similar to the new section. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration is performing a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the Oslo Tunnel. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches, switch heaters at the tunnel openings and new tracks.|$|E
40|$|How {{people react}} to a fire alarm has been studied in retrospect {{as well as in}} experiments. In the present study, the choice of exit was {{examined}} with respect to the distance to exits and open or closed <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b> The second part deals with some communication aspects regarding identification of signs. It is shown that the subjects prefer a familiar ordinary cash exit even if the distance to that exit is longer than to the nearest <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b> However, if the <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> is open and the subjects can see the outside, an <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> becomes more attractive and most of the subjects choose the <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b> The understanding of signs important in a fire evacuation situation is very good.

5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, {{including}} tracks 1 and 2 {{and the two}} original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire safety system, improved <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in dark red. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an overhead conductor rail, new switches and new tracks.|$|E
5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} <b>emergency</b> <b>exits,</b> and the hotel was also not on a hotline with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Prosecutor General's {{technical}} juridical expertise, released {{three months}} after the fire, revealed that no control of Sector 4's City Hall took place in five years. Moreover, use of incompliant, inflammable materials, lack of <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> and construction deficiencies hampering evacuation (the verge was higher by 7cm) were among the main causes of the tragedy.|$|E
25|$|In tunnels, {{a raised}} path at trains level {{facilitates}} evacuation and allows people movement without {{walking on the}} tracks. Every 15 meters, directions are indicated by illuminated yellow signs. Every 150 meters, emergency stations with telephones, power switches and fire hoses can be found. At the ventilation shafts locations in the old tunnels or every 750 meters in recent tunnels sections (Laval), <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> reach the surface.|$|E

50|$|Until 1988, the Expo Boulevard/Abbott Street {{entrance}} {{was originally}} just an open-stair <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b> However, with {{the closing of}} the entrance tunnel under Beatty Street as well as poor accessibility to Stadium station from False Creek, the <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> was redesigned and enclosed, opening up in 1989 as the second point of entrance/exit point to and from the station.|$|R
25|$|The crew {{enters the}} front {{compartment}} through two side doors. The driver {{sits on the}} right side of the vehicle while the vehicle commander sits on the left. Two additional hatches in the roof provide <b>emergency</b> <b>exits</b> for driver and commander. The gunner sits behind commander inside the weapon turret. The engine is located behind the driver, while the left side of the vehicle is fitted with weapon turret. All of the windows are bullet-proof and also further protected by armored shutters, which can be shut entirely, leaving a small observation slit for vision. An armoured hydraulic ramp door at the rear provide access to the troop compartment. Two inward-facing, benches provide seating for 5 troops each. Communications equipment include VHF / FM (anti-jamming and hopping) and GPS with night vision equipment included. <b>Emergency</b> <b>exits</b> are present on both sides of the Anoa as well as three roof hatches in the troop compartment with one rear-facing machine gun mounting on the right cupola. A video camera was also fitted at the rear of the vehicle to help driver while reversing the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The tunnels {{include a}} number of {{features}} to ensure safe use by vehicles. Safety features include electronic message boards, speed cameras, public address systems, radio sound systems, CCTV cameras, and ventilation and fire sprinkler systems. Traffic is monitored by dedicated Tunnel Operators and computerised systems. <b>Emergency</b> <b>exits</b> and telephones are installed every 150 metres {{along the length of}} each tunnel. Overheight detection systems prevent oversize vehicles entering, and on-ramp signals regulate traffic flow.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft Transport and Travel {{closed down}} in early 1921, due to {{competition}} from subsidised French airlines. In March 1921, the British government granted temporary subsidies for airline services, with the Air Council purchasing {{a number of}} modern commercial aircraft for leasing to approved firms. The three ex-A.T. DH.18s were purchased in this way and leased to Instone Air Line. A further DH.18A was built to Air Council order, as were two modified DH.18B, which had fuselages that were entirely plywood-clad and had built-in <b>emergency</b> <b>exits.</b>|$|E

In the present study, the choice of exit was {{examined}} with respect to the distance to exits and open or closed <b>emergency</b> <b>exit.</b> The second part covers the question on how the subjects think and react in a situation having a small fire in the escape route. The third part deals with some communication aspects regarding identification of signs.

A spoken message, on the other hand, has a great impact on understanding what to do and gives a better and more appropriate behaviour for the evacuation of the building. The understanding of signs, important in a fire evacuation situation, is very good for signs such as <b>emergency</b> <b>exit</b> but rather low for signs not so frequently used, such as a sign for radioactive material...|$|R
