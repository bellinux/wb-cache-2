40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated traction control strategy (ITCS) for distributed drive electric vehicles. The {{purpose of the}} proposed strategy is to improve vehicle economy and longitudinal driving stability. On high adhesion roads, economy optimization algorithm is applied to maximize motors efficiency {{by means of the}} optimized torque distribution. On low adhesion roads, a sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm is implemented to guarantee the wheel slip ratio around the optimal slip ratio point to make full use of road adhesion capacity. In order to avoid the disturbance on slip ratio calculation due to the low vehicle speed, wheel rotational speed is taken as the control variable. Since the optimal slip ratio varies according to different road conditions, Bayesian hypothesis selection is utilized to estimate the road friction coefficient. Additionally, the ITCS is designed for combining the vehicle economy and stability control through three traction allocation cases: economy-based traction allocation, pedal self-correcting traction allocation and <b>inter-axles</b> traction allocation. Finally, simulations are conducted in CarSim and Matlab/Simulink environment. The results show that the proposed strategy effectively reduces vehicle energy consumption, suppresses wheels-skid and enhances the vehicle longitudinal stability and dynamic performance.

50|$|Despite G J Rackham's scepticism {{about the}} three-axle {{double-deck}} bus, Leyland built a derivative of the Titan to cater for this market and named the Titanic. Unlike the rather short-lived Karrier and Guy six-wheelers, {{but like the}} slightly later AEC Renown, it had an <b>inter-axle</b> differential to obviate drive-line wind-up. It sold only in limited numbers from 1927 to 1939. Many of its features were shared with the Titan and the rest with the standard three-axle Leyland trolleybus line.|$|E
50|$|Bogie {{performance}} detectors monitor bogie tracking geometry, {{and hunting}} (instability) behaviour. Bogie tracking geometry includes tracking position and {{angle of attack}} on a per-axle basis, as well as rotation, shift, <b>inter-axle</b> misalignment, and tracking error on a per-bogie basis. Bogie performance detectors can provide early detection of bogie defects, and early warning of derailment risks through flange climb or rail break.Bogie performance detectors most often use optical methods, and are installed adjacent to the track with wheel sensors clamped to the rails.|$|E

50|$|The chassis is a {{full-length}} backbone tube with independent swing half axles in 4x4, 6x6 and 8x8. 4x4 models had front axle suspension via adjustable torsion bars, 6x6 and 8x8 models {{front and rear}} axles used longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs. For 4x4 configuration the rear axle was suspended via air suspension. Full-time all-wheel-drive front twin steer (6x6, 8x8) drive via homo-kinetic drive shafts, drive with the differential locks, <b>inter-axle</b> differentials with locks and planetary hub reductions on all models. Unlike many six-wheeled vehicles, which have a single front axle and tandem rear axles, 6x6 versions used twin steering front axles- as with the 8x8- and a single rear axle.|$|E
50|$|Yet again design {{continued}} with the proven central backbone tube construction and power train {{integrated into the}} central backbone tube as a modular concept in 4x4 and 6x6 configuration. A new feature was the <b>inter-axle</b> differential. The main advantages of the central load carrying backbone tube are in its high torsion and bend strength, which protects the truck body against load stresses. The secondary advantage is that it houses all important parts of the drive train {{as well as it}} enables a concept of modular construction where designers and customers can specify 4 and 6 wheel drive, as well as various length wheelbase combinations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of an AWD/4WD {{system can be}} described by describing its possible operating modes. A single vehicle may {{have the ability to}} operate in multiple modes depending on driver selection. Mohan describes the modes as follows:Two Wheel Drive (2WD) Mode - In this mode only one axle (typically the rear axle) is driven. The drive to the other axle is disconnected. The operating torque split ratio is 0:100. Four Wheel Drive (4WD) Mode - Here, depending on the nature of torque transfer to the axles, we can define three sub-modes (below).:Part-time Mode - The front and rear axle drives are rigidly coupled in the transfer case. Since the driveline does not permit any speed differentiation between the axles and would cause driveline wind-up, this mode is recommended only for ‘part-time’ use in off-road or loose surface conditions where driveline wind-up is unlikely. Up to full torque could go to either axle depending on the road condition and the weight over the axles. :Full-time Mode - Both axles are driven at all times but an <b>inter-axle</b> differential permits the axles to turn at different speeds as needed. This allows the vehicle to be driven ‘full-time’ in this mode, regardless of the road surface, without fear of driveline wind-up. With standard bevel gear differentials the torque split is 50:50. Planetary differentials can provide asymmetric torque splits as needed. A system that operates permanently in the full-time mode is sometimes called ‘All-the-Time 4WD’, 'All-Wheel-Drive' or ‘AWD’. If the <b>inter-axle</b> differential is locked out then the mode reverts to a ‘part-time mode’. :On-Demand Mode - In this mode the transfer case operates primarily in the 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on wheel slip or wheel torque, as described in the section on traction control systems.In addition to these basic modes there could be implementations that combine these modes. The system could have a clutch across the center differential, for example, capable of modulating the front axle torque from a Full-time mode with the 30:70 torque split of the center differential to the 0:100 torque split of the 2WD mode ...|$|E
5000|$|The Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle {{is built}} around a tubular-steel frame safety roll-cage which protects the {{passenger}} compartment if the vehicle turns over. This cage is covered by a heavy-gauge sheet metal. An electrical winch with a capacity of 5000 kg can be mounted {{at the front of}} the vehicle if required, and the windshield can be removed. The passenger compartment is in the center of the vehicle with the driver on the left and two passenger seats to his right. There is space for [...] of cargo behind the passenger seats. A full length skid pan protects the hull and allows the vehicle to slide over obstacles. The transmission is a Mitsubishi A-727 fully automatic with a torque converter, there are 3F and 1R gears - the Marine Multi-purpose Vehicle is in 4 x 4 drive all the time. Limited-slip clutches, in front and rear, and <b>inter-axle</b> differentials automatically distribute more torque to those wheels with the most grip. The independent suspension is of a double 'A' design with a torsion-bar spring and hydraulic telescopic shock absorber at each station. A stabilizer bar is provided for the rear suspension.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Tatra engineers, under the {{direction}} of Hans Ledwinka's son Erich and design engineer Erich Übelacker, started work on the development of a small people's car with a rear-mounted engine in a backbone frame. Ledwinka believed that a rear-mounted engine RR layout would bring with it several big advantages [...] - [...] i.e. reducing the efficiency loss, noise and vibration of the driveshaft of the FR layout. No driveshaft meant there would be a flat floor with no need for central floor tunnel so that the passengers' seating position would be lower and well forward of the rear axle, which would lead to a lower centre of gravity, more favourable <b>inter-axle</b> weight distribution, and lower overall height. Mounting the engine in the rear would mean shortening the front part of the body to make a longer tail possible, which was consistent with the laws of aerodynamics. Also, engine noise would not disturb the passengers and would not be heard when driving at a speed of over 50 km/h. Air-cooling would be simpler and more effective at coping with the extremes of temperatures during the depths of winter and height of summer, than water cooling systems of the time, considering the climate in Central-Europe. As the company was considering starting to manufacturing aeroplanes, it got experience with laws of aerodynamics and decided to apply them for the prospective car.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acceleration slip regulation (ASR) system for four-wheel drive (4 WD) electric vehicles, which {{are driven by}} {{the front and rear}} axles simultaneously. The ASR control strategy includes three control modes: average distribution of <b>inter-axle</b> torque, optimal distribution of <b>inter-axle</b> torque and independent control of optimal slip rate, respectively, which are designed based on the torque adaptive principle of <b>inter-axle</b> differential and sliding mode control theory. Furthermore, in order to accurately describe the longitudinal tyre force characteristic, a slip rate calculation formula {{in the form of a}} state equation was used for solving the numerical problem posed by the traditional way. A simulation was carried out with the MATLAB/Simulink software. The simulation results show that the proposed ASR system can fully use the road friction condition, inhibit the drive-wheels from slipping, and improve the vehicle longitudinal driving stability...|$|E
40|$|An {{articulated}} lorry was instrumented {{in order to}} measure its performance in straight-line braking. The trailer was fitted with two interchangeable tandem axle sub–chassis, one with an air suspension and the other with a steel monoleaf 4 –spring suspension. The brakes were only applied to the trailer axles, which were fitted with anti–lock braking systems (ABS), with the brake torque controlled in response to anticpated locking of the leading axle of the tandem. The vehicle with the air suspension was observed to have significantly better braking performance than the steel suspension, and to generate smaller <b>inter–axle</b> load transfer and smaller vertical dynamic tyre forces. Computer models of the two suspensions were developed, including their brakes and anti– lock systems. The models were found to reproduce most of the important features of the experimental results. It was concluded that the poor braking performance of the steel 4 – spring suspension was mainly due to interaction between the ABS and <b>inter–axle</b> load transfer effects. The effect of road roughness was investigated, and it was found that vehicle stopping distances can increase significantly with increasing road roughness. Two alternative anti–lock braking control strategies were simulated. It was found that independent sensing and actuation of the ABS system on each wheel greatly reduced the difference in stopping distances between the air and steel suspensions. A control strategy based on limiting wheel slip was least susceptible to the effects of road roughness...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} pruner serves for pruning new hopvine shoots in spring. The later yield {{depends on}} the right timing and quality of pruning. That is why hop pruning {{is one of the}} most important agrotechnical procedures. A double-disc mechanical pruner used on high trellises cannot be used on low trellises due to its large size. Abroad, for pruning hops on low trellises a specially adapted sprinkler is used (chemical pruning). With regard to the effort to minimize the chemical environmental burden, we opted for the design of the mechanical pruner. Firstly, the low trellis, mechanical pruner, and also elements used in the design of hydraulic circuit are described. Next part of the paper is devoted to the input requirements for both the hydraulic circuit and the mechanical pruner designs. Then a description of an adapted <b>inter-axle</b> carrier used for the experimental model of the hop mechanical pruner and of the effected field measurement follows, along with interpretation of the measured data. These data are depicted in clearly arranged graphs showing the dependency of pressure and hydraulic oil flow on the cutting disc rotational frequency...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{count and}} weight data plays an {{important}} role in traffic planning, weight enforcement, and pavement condition assessment. This data is primarily obtained through weigh stations and weigh-in-motion stations which are currently very expensive to install and maintain. This dissertation presents a wireless sensor-based solution that is relatively inexpensive, and uses the measured pavement vibrations to estimate weight of moving vehicles. The proposed wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of vibration sensors that report pavement acceleration and temperature; vehicle detection sensors that report a vehicle's arrival and departure times; and an access point (AP) that controls the sensors and processes the incoming sensor data. The system can enable many new applications in infrastructure monitoring and intelligent transportation. We present energy-efficient algorithms for three such applications: automatic vehicle classification for categorizing each passing vehicle based on its axle count and <b>inter-axle</b> spacings; weigh-in-motion for estimating individual axle weight and total weight of trucks while they are traveling at normal speeds; and estimating pavement displacement from measured acceleration. The wireless vibration sensor developed for this project has a high resolution (&# 8776; 400 &# 956;g) and is immune to traffic sounds that are generally picked up by MEMS accelerometers. The prototype system was deployed on real highways and results for vehicle classification, weigh- in-motion, and displacement estimation were compared against reference measurements. The system passed the accuracy standards for weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems and outperformed a nearby commercial WIM station, based on conventional technology. Since sensors are embedded directly in the pavement, the system can also enable real-time monitoring of pavement condition...|$|E
40|$|The rail {{dynamics}} {{modeling package}} NUCARS {{has been used}} extensively to model freight cars. We have found that {{it can also be}} used effectively to model freight locomotives. This thesis discusses the development of a NUCARS model to represent a six-axle freight locomotive equipped with steerable trucks. This includes separating it into a set of individual bodies, representing the suspension components as inter-body connections, and validation of the computer model. This model is then used to conduct a study of the impact on tangent track stability and curving performance of varying suspension parameters. It is found that the presence of damping in the system improves hunting stability, while increasing wheel conicity is harmful to stability and varying the flexicoiling stiffness has little effect. In curving, the clearances between the axles and truck frame are very important. Limiting these clearances in the steerable truck causes it to curve similar to a conventional straight locomotive truck and increases both the track force ratios and angles of attack. Increasing the wheel conicity increases an axle's tendency to align with the track and improves the locomotive's curving performance. The lateral stiffness of the <b>inter-axle</b> links and inter-motor links has little effect on the curving of the locomotive. iii Acknowledgments I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Mehdi Ahmadian, for his guidance and time in teaching me about rail vehicles.
