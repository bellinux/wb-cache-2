40|$|AbstractThe U. S. {{currently}} {{leads the}} world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0. 4 – 2. 5 μm) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra. The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospecting,</b> and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems...|$|E

The Hengill area is a ridge-ridge-transform triple point that contains a central volcano-fissure swarm system and a large geothermal area. A seismological study of this triple point was conducted with the main emphasis on natural earthquake studies. The aims were to study the geothermal prospect and tectonic structure and to evaluate the passive seismic method as a <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospecting</b> tool. The area exhibits continuous small magnitude earthquake activity that correlates positively with surface geothermal displays, and negatively with surface faulting. The log (cumulative frequency) magnitude relationship is linear and indicates a b value of 0. 74 ± 0. 06. Focal mechanisms for 178 events indicated both shear and tensile crack type movements, the latter being confined to the high temperature geothermal area. Teleseismic and explosion data indicate a low velocity body beneath the central volcano in the depth range 0 - 10 km, flanked by higher velocity bodies to the W and E. Two volcanic systems occupy the Hengill area : the presently active Hengill system and the extinct Grensdalur system. The ongoing seismicity of the area is attributed to contraction cracking due to the action of cool groundwater fluids on hot rook, which, in a tensile stress regime, results in tensile crack formation. The high temperature area is fuelled by two heat sources associated with the two volcanic systems and may {{be divided into two}} separate fields that exhibit contrasting reservoir characteristics.

30|$|Sustained {{regional}} convection in the Upper Rhine Graben requires elevated permeability {{not only}} in the crystalline basement but also in the overlying Permo-Triassic sediments (Magnenet et al. 2014; Pribnow and Schellschmidt 2000; Guillou-Frottier et al. 2013; Lundgren et al. 2004; Graf and Therrien 2009). The rock matrix of the Permo-Triassic sandstone overlying the Soultz-sous-Forêts geothermal reservoir is significantly more permeable than the granite matrix (Griffiths et al. 2016; Heap et al. 2017); however, despite some individual facies having relatively high matrix permeability values (Heap et al. 2017) and the fact that fluid flow may be facilitated parallel to bedding (Heap et al. 2017; Haffen et al. 2013), the Permo-Triassic sandstones as a whole do not have matrix permeability values sufficiently large to sustain regional hydrothermal convection (Graf and Therrien 2009; Magnenet et al. 2014; Kushnir et al. 2018). Instead, the permeability of this system is dependent on reservoir-scale fractures that permit persistent fluid flow over time (Graf and Therrien 2009; Genter et al. 1997; Dezayes et al. 2010; Vidal et al. 2015). Indeed, rock units with particularly low matrix permeability (e.g. metabasites—Fig.  2 a, b; samples TPDG and TAB in this study), not seen at Soultz-sous-Forêts or Rittershoffen, may hamper hydrothermal circulation locally. As a result, the ease of fracture creation and propagation in these rocks can profoundly influence the potential for efficient regional fluid circulation. However, the high strength of these materials (Table  4) is a further impediment to fracture development and thus the permeability of these rocks is likely to remain low over time. The contrast in stiffness of superposed rock units may strongly influence the ease with which fractures are able to propagate across lithological boundaries (Gudmundsson and Brenner 2001). For instance, dykes, mineral veins, and joints can become arrested at contacts in mechanically layered rocks (Gudmundsson and Brenner 2001; Gillespie et al. 2001), including at sedimentary bedding contacts (Baer 1991). Local stress conditions, however, can change which lithological layers arrest propagating fractures. For example, in systems under layer-parallel compression, stiff rock layers act as stress barriers against which fractures propagating through soft layers arrest; in tension, fractures propagate easily through stiff layers but arrest at interfaces with soft layers (Philipp et al. 2007; Gudmundsson and Brenner 2001). The granites, metagranites, dolomites, and volcanic rocks in the present study are stiffer than the sedimentary rocks (Fig.  8 d). This may introduce appreciable mechanical contrasts at the lithological interfaces between the crystalline basement and overlying sedimentary sequences, resulting in disparate fracture populations between units. For example, in systems resembling Saint Pierre Bois (Fig.  2 e), the interbedding of unlithified clays (less stiff) and sandstones (more stiff) may result in the compartmentalisation of fracture populations to either the clay or the sandstone horizons, depending on the local stress state. Ultimately, if this process is operative at depth, this may restrict fluid circulation to isolated horizons and perturb regional fluid convection. However, we emphasise that in this study we are unable to ascertain if the large-scale joints we observe in the field terminate at lithological contacts (Fig.  2 d) because of mechanical contrasts or because the overlying units were deposited after joint creation. Nevertheless, we highlight that several of the lithologies studied here are not observed at the existing geothermal centres at Soultz-sous-Forêts and Rittershoffen and that the presence of the strongest of these materials may impede the economic viability of <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospecting</b> elsewhere in the Upper Rhine Graben.|$|E

It {{can handle}} any complex, multicriterion, and multiperson {{problems}}. In AHP, {{the problems are}} decomposed into a hierarchically structure and are given the weights according to its importance. Thus, the strength with which one alternative dominates another {{with respect to a}} given criterion can be identified. The output is a priority ranking indicating the overall preference for each decision alternative. This paper describes the application of AHP to select a <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospect</b> in Sulawesi Island to be developed in the near future. The alternatives consist of three <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospects.</b> i. e., Suwawa, Pulu, and Marana. Three major criteria are used and applied into those three prospects: Geoscience, Infrastructure, and Social-culture aspects. Under each of these major criteria, there are several subcriteria. Geoscience criterion which consists of Resources, Geothermal System, and Geological Risk Subcriteria is given the highest weight with the assumption that if resources are large and can be developed commercially, then there is no reason not to be exploited; the technology and other infrastructure aspects are no longer an obstacle. The result shows that Suwawa Prospect is the best option to be developed in the near future. The second option or rank is Marana Prospect, and the third is Pulu Prospect. This result is in agreement with the future plan of the development of Sulawesi Island. If the regulation and plan of development were suddenly changed, the goal of this AHP might not be appropriate anymore, and the second or third option might replace the first rank. The benefits of using AHP are (1) the facts and reasons behind the decision are well documented, (2) able to handle quantitative and qualitative inputs, (3) able to accommodate environmental, social and other influences, and (4) able to handle subjective judgments of individuals. Lessons learned from AHP application for <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospect</b> selection could be extended into multi criterion decision making at a group level. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the population size, density, distribution, habitat utilization and biomass of large herbivores in Hell's Gate National Park and two neighbouring ranches, Kedong and Kongoni. The study further determined primary production and wildlife grazing in the Park grassland, the effects of wildlife on the vegetation around the Park's artificial water troughs {{and the effects of}} Maasai livestock and <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospecting</b> on the Park vegetation. Herbivore counts were carried out in Hell's Gate National Park and the two neighbouring ranches between February 1990 and April 1992. Kongoni, zebra and Thomson's gazelle were found to be the most abundant species. The distribution pattern exhibited by the ungulates in the three areas was neither random or regular, and appeared to be influenced by both topography and vegetation type. Dry and wet season distribution patterns of the wildlife were similar. In the three study areas, most of the herbivores were found to prefer the grassland followed by relatively open shrubland. Areas of dense vegetation and rugged terrain were not preferred. Kongoni, zebra, eland and buffalo contributed the highest proportion of the herbivore biomass. They contributed 82 % of the total herbivore biomass in the Park, 85 % in Kedong Ranch and 82 % in Kongoni Ranch. The herbivore biomass fluctuated monthly depending on population fluctuations, such that when there was a high count of the herbivores in a given month, there was a corresponding high biomass. Above-ground primary production and herbivore grazing were estimated in the Park grassland which was the main grazing area for most of the ungulates. There were two peaks of primary production which coincided with the occurence of the long and short rains, such that there was a significant linear regression between net primary production and rainfall. The monthly amount of dead and live grass biomass fluctuated in response to seasonal rainfall, such that during the dry season the amount of dead biomass increased while that of the live biomass decreased and vice versa during the wet season. There was a significant linear regression of live grass biomass on rainfall, but there was no significant correlation between rainfall and dead grass biomass. The annual productivity of the grassland was 720 g/m 2 /yr, and the total annual offtake of the grass forage by the herbivores was 12. 7 %. Therefore, most of the grass forage dried up to form dead biomass which was probably of little food value to the wildlife. The effect of both wildlife trampling on the vegetation around three artificial water troughs and illegal livestock grazing on the Park vegetation (in the Narasha area) were studied between April 1990 and April 1992. Overall, vegetation cover between the trampled and untrampled areas of the water troughs did not show any significant difference. Trampling also did not lead to any overall difference in plant species composition, diversity and abundance between the trampled and untrampled areas. Livestock grazing at Narasha did not lead to a significant difference in percentage vegetation cover and mean species diversity between the grazed and ungrazed areas. Although some plant species were only found in either the grazed or ungrazed areas, overall, grazing appeared not to lead to a significant difference in plant species composition and abundance between the two areas. It was therefore concluded that livestock grazing was not altering the Park vegetation in any significant way. The long term future of the Hell's Gate ecosystem (the Park together with the surrounding ranches) as a self sustaining unit requires that its current ecological integrity be maintained. The human activities that are taking place within it, especially expansion of agriculture, will determine its future, and if not controlled will lead to loss of wildlife habitats and a decline in the population size of the various herbivore species found within it...|$|E
40|$|Volcano-hosted {{hydrothermal}} {{systems are}} complex geological objects, whose thorough characterisation requires extensive and interdisciplinary work. Indeed, even thought geological, geochemical and geophysical observations offer highly significant but independent information, only an integrated multidisciplinary approach can yield a comprehensive characterisation of the chemical/physical structure of hydrothermal systems. Notwithstanding the extensive application of geological, geochemical and geophysical techniques in geothermal research, {{there are only}} a few examples in the literature of concurrent use of the three techniques [Finizola et al., 2002; Zlotnicki et al., 2009]; these studies overall demonstrate that only an integrated multidisciplinary approach can yield a comprehensive characterisation of the chemical/physical structure of hydrothermal systems. Ischia Island, in Southern Italy, is an active resurgent caldera [Orsi et al., 1991] that has produced intense volcanism over the past 10 ka, with the last eruption in 1302 A. D. The island is a very good example of an active volcano hosting a large hydrothermal system [Penta and Conforto, 1951]. In particular, its south western sector has long been known for pervasive hydrothermal circulation, as part of the larger hydrothermal system. Thus, this sector of the island is an ideal test site for multidisciplinary <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospecting,</b> since the complex geological and structural setting, the peculiar hydrothermal conditions favouring the formation of remarkably different water types in a relatively small area (̴ 20 km 2) [Di Napoli et al., 2009], and the poorly-known but highly contrasted resistivity structure, all contribute to make interpretation of hydrothermal processes challenging. Here, we present the results of a multidisciplinary research performed in the south-western sector of Ischia Island by using geological, geochemical (groundwater composition and soil diffuse CO 2 fluxes) and geophysical (Electrical Resistivity Tomography – ERT - and Transient Electromagnetic Method – TEM - soundings) methods. The acquired data are discussed in order to build up a hypothesis for fluid circulation in the shallowest (< 0. 5 km) part of the hydrothermal system. The combined investigations highlight that the deep hydrothermal fluid circulation is strongly dependent on the structural setting of the SW Ischia sector, composed by three distinct sectors: Extra Caldera Sector (ECS), Caldera Floor sector (CFS), and Resurgent Caldera Sector (RCS) (Figure 1 a). This peculiar tectonic/structural setting of the SW portion of Ischia Island force infiltrating waters to flow and accumulate into the structural and topographic low of the Caldera Floor Sector (CFS in Figure 1 a), in which the shallow thermal aquifer has been identified by resistivity measurements at 100 - 200 m of depth. This aquifer, hosted into the Mt. Epomeo Green Tuff (MEGT) deposits, is characterized by very low resistivity values (< 1 Ω•m), and has a mixed marine-meteoric derivation. Seawater mostly infiltrates in the SW portion of the area (close to A in Figure 1 a), whilst a prevalent contribution from cold diluted waters is evidenced in the NE portion of the study area (close to A’ in Figure 1 a), along the flanks of Mt. Epomeo relief. Geochemical investigations have evidenced that meteoric (Total Dissolved Solid content 1. 5 g/l and δ 18 O - 7 ‰) and marine (Total Dissolved Solid content 33 g/l and δ 18 O 0 ‰) waters accumulate into the aquifer hosted in the CFS and form mixed solutions. However, the collected groundwaters only partially overlap the meteoric-sea water mixing trend, claiming for the existence of additional processes. A number of samples are characterized by Mg poor (Mg down to the detection limit) and CO 2 -rich (up to 229 cm 3 /l at STP) compositions, which are indicative for a deep derivation of these fluids. Indeed, Mg-depletion is a typical features of waters produced in hydrothermal environments [Giggenbach, 1988], as a results of extended water-gas-rock interactions at high temperature, during which Mg was removed from the solution by precipitation of secondary mineral phases. As represented in the interpretative model of Figure 1, the intense network of faults and fractures in the Caldera Floor Sector, represents the preferential pathway for the ascent of both thermal waters and deep gases as CO 2, which is also extensively degassed from soil. Finally, the pervasive hydrothermal circulation determine presence of numerous surface thermal manifestations in this sector of Ischia Island.

Firstly, a porosity-depth trend is established in order to predict porosity. Subsequently, in order to predict permeability, a porosity–permeability relation is established and then refined in steps. Both one basin-wide and one local permeability model are generated. Two porosity-depth models are established. It is shown that the average permeability of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospect</b> can be modelled (predicted) using a local permeability model, i.e. a model valid for a geological province including the prospect. The local permeability model is related to a general permeability model through a constant, and the general model thus acts as a template. The applied averaging technique reduces the scatter that is normally seen in a porosity–permeability plot including all raw core analysis measurements and thus narrows the uncertainty band attached to the average permeability estimate for a reservoir layer. A “best practice” technique for predicting average porosity and permeability of <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospects</b> on the basis of core analysis data and well-logs is suggested. The porosity is primarily related to depth, whereas the permeability also depends on porosity, mineralogy and grain size, which are controlled by the depositional environment. Our results indicate that porosity and permeability assessments should be based on averaged data and not raw conventional core analysis data. The uncertainty range of permeability values is significantly lower, when average values are used.|$|R

40|$|Geological faults {{are highly}} {{developed}} in the eastern Liaoning Province in China, where Mesozoic granitic intrusions and Archean and Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks are widely distributed. Although the heat flow value in eastern Liaoning Province is generally low, the hot springs are very developed. It {{is obvious that the}} faults have significant control over the distribution of hot springs, and traditional methods of spatial data analysis such as WofE (weight of evidence) usually do {{not take into account the}} direction of the distribution of geothermal resources in the geothermal forecast process, which seriously affects the accuracy of the prediction results. To overcome the deficiency of the traditional evidence weight method, wherein it does not take the direction of evidence factor into account, this study put forward a combination of the Fry and WofE methods, Fry-WofE, based on geological observation, gravity, remote sensing, and DEM (digital elevation model) multivariate data. This study takes eastern Liaoning Province in China as an example, and the <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospect</b> was predicted respectively by the Fry-WofE and WofE methods from the statistical data on the spatial distribution of the exposed space of geothermal anomalies the surface. The result shows that the Fry-WofE method can achieve better prediction results when comparing the accuracy of these two methods. Based on the results of Fry-WofE prediction and water system extraction, 13 favorable <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospect</b> areas are delineated in eastern Liaoning Province. The Fry-WofE method is effective in study areas where the geothermal distribution area is obviously controlled by the fault. We provide not only a new method for solving the similar issue of geothermal exploration, but also a new insight into the distribution of geothermal resources in Liaoning Province...|$|R
30|$|The {{observed}} {{variation in}} permeability for a fixed porosity value (Fig.  7) {{is most likely}} related to variations in the original depositional environment when the sandstone layers were formed, expressing itself in differences in diagenetic development, lithology, grain size distribution and clay content (Table  1). These variations emphasize the need of incorporating geological data, preferably both sedimentological and palaeogeographical data, and also the need for establishing local porosity–permeability models representative of local geological provinces characterized by relatively uniform geological development. Such local permeability models are herein suggested for predicting the average permeability of <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospects.</b> In fact, access to local permeability data from wells located close to the prospect in question is essential for using our method for predicting permeability.|$|R

These resistivity data resolved the upper conductive layer and were interpreted to define the shallow extent of a possible geothermal system. A follow-up magnetotelluric (MT) survey was carried out to probe deeper than the dc resistivity survey results achieved. However, the resistive sub-stratum below the conductive layer was still poorly resolved. Possible reasons for this include a preferential channeling of the telluric current within the thick shallow very conductive layer, thus limiting the penetration depth of the magnetotelluric signals and poor resolution due to high noise levels caused by significant rain and sferics...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} of geothermal system at Mount Ciremai has been started {{since the early}} 1980 s and has just been studied carefully since the early 2000 s. Previous studies have detected the potential of geothermal system and also the groundwater mechanism feeding the system. This paper will discuss the geothermal exploration based on regional scale surface temperature analysis with Landsat image {{to have a more}} detail interpretation of the geological setting and magneto-telluric or MT survey at prospect zones, which identified by the previous method, to have a more exact and in depth local scale structural interpretation. Both methods are directed to pin point appropriate locations for geothermal pilot hole drilling and testing. We used four scenes of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper or ETM+ data to estimate the surface manifestation of a geothermal system. Temporal analysis of Land Surface Temperature or LST was applied and coupled with field temperature measurement at seven locations. By combining the TTM with NDVI threshold, the authors can identify six zones with surface temperature anomaly. Among these six zones, three zones were interpreted to have a relation with geothermal system and the other three zones were related to human activities. Then, MT survey was performed at the three <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospects</b> identified from previous remote sensing analysis, at the east flank of the volcano, to estimate the detail subsurface structures. The MT survey successfully identified four buried normal faults in the area, which positively {{are a part of the}} conduits in the geothermal system east of Mount Ciremai. From MT analysis, the author also found the locations of volcanic zone, bedrock zone, and the prospect zone. The combination of Landsat analysis on regional scale and MT measurement on a more detail scale has proven to be the reliable method to map <b>geothermal</b> <b>prospect</b> area.
