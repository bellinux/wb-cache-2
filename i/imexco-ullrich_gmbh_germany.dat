30|$|Aggregometric POCT in hirudin-anticoagulated {{whole blood}} was {{performed}} on the multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) platelet function analyser (Multiplate®; Roche Diagnostics <b>GmbH,</b> <b>Germany).</b> Test cells of this device incorporate a duplicate sensor for acceptance sampling. Platelets were stimulated in various ways: (1) via arachidonic acid (ASPI test; Roche Diagnostics <b>GmbH,</b> <b>Germany),</b> (2) the ADP receptor (ADP test, Roche Diagnostics <b>GmbH,</b> <b>Germany),</b> (3) the thrombin receptor under the use of thrombin receptor-activating peptide- 6 (TRAP test; Roche Diagnostics <b>GmbH,</b> <b>Germany)</b> and (4) via the collagen receptor (COL test, Roche Diagnostics <b>GmbH,</b> <b>Germany).</b> Once initiated, platelet aggregation was allowed to run up to 6  min, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated.|$|R
