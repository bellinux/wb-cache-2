25|$|Coordination {{compounds}} {{are also}} {{widely used in}} industry. The intense colors of many compounds render them of great use as <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments.</b> Specifically phthalocyanine complexes are an important class of dyes for fabrics. Nickel, cobalt, and copper can be extracted using hydrometallurgical processes involving complex ions. They are extracted from their ores as ammine complexes with aqueous ammonia. Metals can also be separated using the selective precipitation and solubility of complex ions, as explained in later paragraphs. Cyanide complexes are often used in electroplating.|$|E

25|$|Blue was a latecomer among colours used {{in art and}} decoration, as well as {{language}} and literature. Reds, blacks, browns, and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period, but not blue. Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red, ochre, pink and purple. This is {{probably due to the}} perennial difficulty of making good blue <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments.</b> The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants – woad in Europe, indigo in Asia and Africa, while blue pigments were made from minerals, usually either lapis lazuli or azurite.|$|E
25|$|These discoveries soon led to {{the carbon}} print, gum bichromate, and other {{photographic}} printing processes based on differential hardening. Typically, after exposure, the unhardened portion was rinsed away with warm water, leaving a thin relief that either contained a pigment included during manufacture or was subsequently stained with a dye. Some processes depended on the hardening only, {{in combination with the}} differential absorption of certain dyes by the hardened or unhardened areas. Because some of these processes allowed the use of highly stable <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments,</b> such as carbon black, prints with an extremely high degree of archival permanence and resistance to fading from prolonged exposure to light could be produced.|$|E
25|$|Discoveries {{in color}} science created new {{industries}} and drove changes in fashion and taste. The discovery in 1856 of mauveine, the first aniline dye, was a forerunner {{for the development}} of hundreds of synthetic <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments</b> like azo and diazo compounds which are the source of a wide spectrum of colors. Mauveine was discovered by an 18-year-old chemist named William Henry Perkin, who went on to exploit his discovery in industry and become wealthy. His success attracted a generation of followers, as young scientists went into organic chemistry to pursue riches. Within a few years, chemists had synthesized a substitute for madder in the production of Alizarin Crimson. By the closing decades of the 19th century, textiles, paints, and other commodities in colors such as red, crimson, blue, and purple had become affordable.|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of {{diazonium}} salts was to produce water-fast dyed fabrics by immersing the fabric in an aqueous solution of the diazonium compound, followed by immersion in a solution of the coupler (the electron-rich ring that undergoes electrophilic substitution). The major applications of diazonium compounds remains in the <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment</b> industry.|$|R
50|$|Brazilin {{was another}} popular red dye in the Middle Ages. It {{came from the}} sapanwood tree, which grew in India, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. A similar tree, brazilwood, grew {{on the coast of}} South America. The red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an {{alkaline}} solution to make <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment.</b> It {{became one of the most}} profitable exports from the New World, and gave its name to the nation of Brazil.|$|R
25|$|Spain's {{conquest of}} a New World empire in the 16th century {{introduced}} new <b>pigments</b> <b>and</b> colors to peoples {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic. Carmine, a <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment</b> derived from a parasitic insect found in Central and South America, attained great status and value in Europe. Produced from harvested, dried, and crushed cochineal insects, carmine could be, and still is, used in fabric dye, food dye, body paint, or in its solid lake form, almost any kind of paint or cosmetic.|$|R
25|$|A tattoo {{is a form}} of body {{modification}} where {{a design}} is made by inserting ink, <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments,</b> either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Brought to Europe from Polynesia in the early 19th century through naval routes, it was originally largely restricted to naval use, and was a male-only domain. By the later 20th century its use was more widespread and extended to female users. By the end of the 20th many stigmas of the tattoo culture had gone and it moved into the realm of being a fashion accessory for both men and women.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{byproducts}} {{produced in}} the processing of microalgae {{can be used in}} various applications, many of which have a longer history of production than algal biofuel. Some of the products not used in the production of biofuel include natural <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments,</b> antioxidants, and other high-value bio-active compounds. These chemicals and excess biomass have found numerous use in other industries. For example, the dyes and oils have found a place in cosmetics, commonly as thickening and water-binding agents. Discoveries within the pharmaceutical industry include antibiotics and antifungals derived from microalgae, as well as natural health products, which have been growing in popularity over the past few decades. For instance Spirulina contains numerous polyunsaturated fats (Omega 3 and 6), amino acids, and vitamins, as well as pigments that may be beneficial, such as beta-carotene and chlorophyll.|$|E
500|$|William Henry Perkin, {{a student}} of August Wilhelm von Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, unsuccessfully tried in the 1850s to {{synthesize}} quinine in a commercial process. The idea was to take two equivalents of N-allyltoluidine (...) and three atoms of oxygen to produce quinine (...) and water. Instead, Perkin's mauve was produced when attempting quinine total synthesis via the oxidation of N-allyltoluidine. Before Perkin's discovery, all <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments</b> were derived from roots, leaves, insects, or, {{in the case of}} Tyrian purple, molluscs.|$|E
5000|$|Indigo {{lake was}} {{originally}} produced from {{the leaves of}} woad, and was known in ancient Egypt. In the late Middle Ages, a fashion for woad as a textile dye led to overplanting and soil exhaustion {{in many parts of}} Europe. After trade routes opened to the east, indigo was imported from India as a substitute for woad, and the cultivation of woad became uneconomical in Europe. Today, the dark blue dye known as indigo once produced from woad and Indigofera tinctoria is largely of synthetic origin. The <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment</b> are both fugitive.|$|R
40|$|The syntheses of {{a series}} of new ketohydrazone <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment</b> lakes with a unique {{structural}} motif derived from 4 -morpholino- 2 -naphthol are described. The morpholine substituent is responsible for the hypsochromically shifted absorption maxima with significantly enhanced molar extinction coefficients of the new dyes; this conclusion is supported by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) simulations. The location of the morpholine substituent at a sterically demanding site in the pigment lake obstructs further coordination of the bridging sulfonate groups in the solid state and prevents the formation of a 1 -dimensional polymeric system, which is common for other pigment lakes...|$|R
30|$|In {{the sample}} (B 5, Fig.  2) of pink pigment from the drapery over right arm of seat, the clumps of pink {{particles}} were analysed by FTIR spectroscopy.

The presence of colorants derived from madder was confirmed by HPLC-DAD analysis, which found peaks with matching retention times to those of purpurin, pseudopurpurin/munjistin and to an unidentified component also seen in reference samples of madder <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment.</b> As in the previous sample from Terracotta A, alizarin was not detected.|$|R
500|$|Zinc {{chloride}} {{is often}} added to lumber as a fire retardant and sometimes as a wood preservative. It {{is used in}} the manufacture of other chemicals. Zinc methyl (...) is used in a number of organic syntheses. Zinc sulfide (ZnS) is used in luminescent pigments such as on the hands of clocks, X-ray and television screens, and luminous paints. Crystals of ZnS are used in lasers that operate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum. Zinc sulfate is a chemical in <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments.</b> Zinc pyrithione is used in antifouling paints.|$|E
500|$|Potassium nitrate (...) or {{saltpeter}} {{is obtained}} from natural {{sources such as}} guano and evaporites or manufactured via the Haber process; it is the oxidant in gunpowder (black powder) and an important agricultural fertilizer. Potassium cyanide (KCN) is used industrially to dissolve copper and precious metals, in particular silver and gold, by forming complexes. Its applications include gold mining, electroplating, and electroforming of these metals; it is also used in organic synthesis to make nitriles. Potassium carbonate ( [...] or potash) {{is used in the}} manufacture of glass, soap, color TV tubes, fluorescent lamps, textile <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments.</b> Potassium permanganate (...) is an oxidizing, bleaching and purification substance and is used for production of saccharin. Potassium chlorate (...) is added to matches and explosives. Potassium bromide (KBr) was formerly used as a sedative and in photography.|$|E

30|$|Analysis of {{a sample}} (A 1, Fig.  1) from an area of purple drapery above the right foot, showed the {{presence}} of pink particles, suggestive of a madder lake. The FTIR spectrum shows the lake substrate to be an amorphous hydrated alumina with characteristic features of Al-O lattice vibrations at c. 660  cm− 1 and other broad bands due to coordinated water at c. 3400 and 1650  cm− 1. The presence of colorants derived from madder was confirmed by HPLC-DAD analysis, which found peaks with matching retention times to those of purpurin, pseudopurpurin/munjistin and to an unidentified component also seen in reference samples of madder <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment.</b> Alizarin was not detected.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to smearing, gradual fading of many inks {{can be a}} problem over time. Print lifetime is highly dependent on the quality and formulation of the ink. The earliest inkjet printers, intended for home and small office applications, used dye-based inks. Even the best dye-based inks are not as durable as pigment-based inks, which are now available for many inkjet printers. Many inkjet printers now utilize pigment based inks which are highly water resistant: at least the black ink is often pigment-based. Resin or silicone protected photopaper is widely available at low cost, introducing complete water and mechanical rub resistance for <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment</b> inks. The photopaper itself must be designed for pigment or for dye inks, as pigment particles are too large to be able to penetrate through dye-only photopaper protection layer.|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} types of inks are used throughout history and today for the dyeing of the cornea. Today, Indian ink is the most commonly used, providing safe and long-lasting effects, but other dyes include metallic colors in powder form, various organic <b>dyes,</b> <b>and</b> uveal <b>pigment</b> from animal eyes. Two different methods exist: chemical dyeing with gold or platinum chloride and carbon impregnation.|$|R
2500|$|Metals only {{exist in}} {{solution}} as coordination complexes, it follows then that {{this class of}} compounds is useful {{in a wide variety}} of ways. [...] Coordination compounds are therefore found both in nature and in industry (in, especially, color-rich ways). Some common complex ions include such substances as vitamin B12, the heme group in hemoglobin and the cytochromes, and the chlorin group in chlorophyll (which are dark red or cherry colored, blood red, and green in color respectively), and some <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments.</b> One major use of coordination compounds is in homogeneous catalysis for the production of organic substances.|$|E
2500|$|Blue {{has been}} an {{important}} colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in The Renaissance, to make the pigment ultramarine, the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain, in the In the Middle Ages, European artists used it in the windows of Cathedrals. [...] Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America. [...] In the 19th century, synthetic blue <b>dyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments</b> gradually replaced mineral pigments and synthetic dyes. [...] Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits. [...] In Because blue was commonly associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union.|$|E

40|$|Microbial single-cell-protein (SCP) {{production}} from high-organic-strength industrial wastewaters {{is considered an}} attractive method for both wastewater purification and resource utilization. In the last two decades, pollutant removal-oriented yeast SCP production processes, i. e., yeast treatment processes, have attracted {{a great deal of}} attention from a variety of research groups worldwide. Different from conventional SCP production processes, yeast treatment processes are characterized by higher pollutant removal rates, lower production costs, highly adaptive yeast isolates from nature, no excess nutrient supplements, and are performed under non-sterile conditions. Furthermore, yeast treatment processes are similar to bacteria-dominated conventional activated sludge processes, which offer more choices for yeast SCP production and industrial wastewater treatment. This review discusses why highly adaptive yeast species isolated from nature are used in the yeast treatment process rather than commercial SCP producers. It also describes the application of yeast treatment processes for treating high-carboxyhydrate, oil-rich and high-salinity industrial wastewater, focusing primarily on high-strength biodegradable organic substances, which usually account for the major fraction of biochemical oxygen demand. Also discussed is the biodegradation of xenobiotics, such as color (including <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment)</b> <b>and</b> toxic substances (including phenols, chlorophenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.), present in industrial wastewater. Based on molecular information of yeast community structures and their regulation in yeast treatment systems, we also discuss how to maintain efficient yeast species in yeast biomass and how to control bacterial and mold proliferation in yeast treatment systems.

50|$|The {{red color}} of modern {{lipstick}} {{can come from}} synthetically derived pure iron oxide (common iron rust), however most leading brands use the more economical synthetic colors. In the United States, every batch of synthetic <b>dye</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigment</b> must have a sample sent to the US FDA for testing and certification that the batch is pure and its contaminants are below the levels specified by law. Synthetic colors {{are listed in the}} ingredients as a code (e.g.: F &D red no 6) and may contain up to 10 parts per million of lead / 3 parts per million of arsenic. There is some controversy over the presence of these trace ingredients, especially since makeup worn on the lips is not just absorbed through the skin, but also swallowed with drinking and eating. Since lowering these levels would make the production and sale of practically all lipstick illegal, and since the FDA has determined that the existing levels are safe, the cosmetic industry continues to produce and sell lipstick.|$|R
