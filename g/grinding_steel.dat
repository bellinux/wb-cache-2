Excessive use of nitre will corrode the smelting pot, increasing both maintenance costs and the risk of catastrophic leaks (known as run-aways, or holes in the pot through which the molten charge is lost).

50|$|Tower mills, {{often called}} {{vertical}} mills, stirred mills or regrind mills, are {{a more efficient}} means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes, {{and can be used}} after ball mills in a grinding process.

In tower mills, there is no cascading action as in standard grinding mills. Stirred mills are also common for mixing quicklime (CaO) into a lime slurry. There are several advantages to the tower mill: low noise, efficient energy usage, and low operating costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

The grinding forces produced increased with the increase of the depth of cut. In addition, too much porosity of a vitrified CBN wheel will cause the low bond strength, leading the wheel to wear rapidly.

A survey of the literature of grinding and surface texture shows the influence of dressing and wear on surfaces {{involved in the process}} and the advantages of stylus profilometry for data collection from both grinding wheels and ground surfaces. Statistical analysis is favoured for surface profile characterization and, of the various parameters used, power spectral density alone offers some prospect of effective comparison between these surfaces. Work on grinding with single crystals of natural corundum was eventually discontinued in favour of experiments with conventional bonded grinding wheels subjected to a dressing operation and some wear in <b>grinding</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces. Statistical parameters representing the surfaces are computed using data obtained from profilograms. Results in terms of power spectral density are presented showing progressive improvement following upon developments in apparatus and methods which facilitated the use of larger surface profile samples. Transfer functions are used to relate power spectra representing corresponding pairs of surfaces. The significance of power spectral density applied to surface profile characterization is discussed and, in this context, it is suggested that these should be described as variance spectra. Attention is drawn to certain disadvantages of variance spectra applied to grinding wheel and ground surface profiles. Methods designed to improve presentation of variance spectra lead to development of a proposed new and more suitable spectrum in which density of standard deviation of surface profile ordinates with respect to frequency is plotted against frequency. Transfer functions calculated from related pairs of these standard deviation spectra show a strong linear correlation with frequency and offer prospects of convenient comparison between the profiles of the various surfaces involved in grinding...|$|E

A method of capturing the increasing temperature value is by using infrared thermometer. Depth of cut and table speed are the variables parameter used in this experiment and spindle speed and mode of dressing are the parameter that constant along the experiment are running. Furthermore, by using Taguchi approached, design of experiment (DOE) will be attained and Minitab software is used to design the DOE. Two way ANOVA methods then used to make an analysis of the data attained. The temperature value are analyzed to make the conformation that table speed and silicon carbide wheel grinder will give high impact to temperature rising. This research proved that by using silicon carbide as a grinding wheel, it will give higher thermal effect to the workpiece instead using aluminium oxide grinding wheel. Silicon carbide wheel grinder, that have rough grain will produce high friction force during grinding process occur. This friction force then will produce heat and will produce higher value of temperature instead using aluminium oxide.
