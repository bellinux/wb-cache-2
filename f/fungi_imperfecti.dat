40|$|Abstract: The {{effects on}} the {{environment}} of pollution, particularly that caused by various industrial activities, {{have been responsible for}} the accelerated fluxes of organic and inorganic matter in the ecosphere. Xenobiotics such as phenol, phenolic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals, even at low concentrations, can be toxic to humans and other forms of life. Many of the remediation technologies currently being used for contaminated soil and water involve not only physical and chemical treatment, but also biological processes, where microbial activity is the responsible for pollutant removal and/or recovery. Fungi are present in aquatic sediments, terrestrial habitats and water surfaces and play a significant part in natural remediation of metal and aromatic compounds. Fungi also have advantages over bacteria since fungal hyphae can penetrate contaminated soil, reaching not only heavy metals but also xenobiotic compounds. Despite of the abundance of such fungi in wastes, penicillia in particular have received little attention in bioremediation and biodegradation studies. Additionally, several studies conducted with different strains of <b>imperfecti</b> <b>fungi,</b> Penicillium spp. have demonstrated their ability to degrade different xenobiotic compounds with low co-substrate requirements, and could be potentially interesting for the development of economically feasible processes for pollutant transformation...|$|R

5000|$|The genus Trichothecium {{is small}} and {{heterogeneous}} comprising seventy-three recorded species. This genus was first reported in 1809. [...] The main members of the genus include Trichothecium polybrochum, Trichothecium cystosporium, Trichothecium pravicovi, and Trichothecium roseum. Trichothecium roseum has morphologically different conidiophores and conidia than the other three main species, which made development of these features the center of extensive study throughout the years. Since Trichothecium fungi lack a sexual phase, systematic classification was not uniform following their discovery. These fungi were initially grouped into <b>Fungi</b> <b>imperfecti</b> under the form classification Deuteromycetes. In 1958, Tubaki expanded Hughes’ classification of soil Hyphomycetes, part of the form class of <b>Fungi</b> <b>imperfecti,</b> by adding a ninth section {{in order to accommodate}} T. roseum and its unique conidial apparatus. Trichothecium has now been classified under the class Sordariomycetes. A recent classification has placed Trichothecium under the phylum Ascomycota since they produce conidial stages that are similar to the perfect fungi.|$|E

50|$|Hyphomycetes are a form {{classification}} of Fungi, {{part of what}} has often {{been referred to as}} <b>Fungi</b> <b>imperfecti,</b> Deuteromycota, or anamorphic fungi. Hyphomycetes lack closed fruit bodies, and are often referred to as moulds (or molds). Most hyphomycetes are now assigned to the Ascomycota, on the basis of genetic connections made by life-cycle studies or by phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences; many remain unassigned phylogenetically. Identification of hyphomycetes is primarily based on microscopic morphology including: conidial morphology, especially septation, shape, size, colour and cell wall texture, the arrangement of conidia as they are borne on the conidiogenous cells (e.g. if they are solitary, arthrocatenate, blastocatenate, basocatenate, or gloiosporae), the type conidiogenous cell (e.g. non-specialized or hypha-like, phialide, annellide, or sympodial), and other additional features such as the presence of sporodochia or synnemata.|$|E
5000|$|... “Black yeasts”, {{sometimes}} also black fungi, dematiaceous fungi, microcolonial fungi or meristematic fungi is {{a diverse}} group of slow-growing microfungi which reproduce mostly asexually (<b>fungi</b> <b>imperfecti).</b> Only few genera reproduce by budding cells, while in others hyphal or meristematic (isodiametric) reproduction is preponderant. Black yeasts share some distinctive characteristics, in particular melanisation of their cell wall. Morphological plasticity, incrustation of the cell wall with melanins and presence of other protective substances like carotenoids and mycosporines represent passive physiological adaptations which enable black fungi to be highly resistant against environmental stresses. The term [...] "polyextremotolerance" [...] has been introduced to describe this phenotype, a good example of which is the species Aureobasidium pullulans. Presence of 1,8-dihydroxynaphtalene melanin in the cell wall confers to the microfungi their characteristic olivaceous to dark brown/black colour.|$|E

50|$|Chirayathumadom Venkatachalier Subramanian (1924-2016), {{popularly known}} as CVS, was an Indian mycologist, {{taxonomist}} and plant pathologist, known {{for his work on}} the classification of <b>Fungi</b> <b>imperfecti,</b> a group of fungi classified separately due to lack of specific taxonomic characteristics. He authored one monograph, Hyphomycetes: An Account of Indian Species, Except Cercosporae and three books, Hyphomycetes, taxonomy and biology, Moulds, Mushrooms and Men and Soil microfungi of Israel, besides several articles published in peer reviewed journals. He was a recipient of many honors including the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Award of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the Janaki Ammal National Award of the Government of India and seven species of fungi have been named after him. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1965, for his contributions to biological sciences.|$|E

During this period, he continued his researches and his published work, Floristic and taxonomic studies on <b>Fungi</b> <b>Imperfecti,</b> earned him the degree of DSc in 1957 from the University of Madras. A year later, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute created a new Chair in Plant Pathology and invited Subramanian to hold the position which he did till his move to the University of Rajasthan in 1960. There, he established the Department of Botany and headed the department as its founder professor till his return to Madras University in 1964 as a professor of Botany. In 1973, he succeeded his mentor, T. S. Sadasivan {{as the head of the}} Centre for Advanced Study in Botany, a position he held till his superannuation in 1985.

50|$|While {{serving as}} a senior {{lecturer}} at Madras University, Subramanian published a two-volume work in 1956 under the title, List of Indian Fungi, which listed the known species of fungi in India. Major focus of his research was on <b>Fungi</b> <b>imperfecti.</b> He was known to have conducted extensive research on Hyphomycetes and his work has been detailed in a monograph, Hyphomycetes: An Account of Indian Species, Except Cercosporae, published in 1971 and another book, Hyphomycetes, taxonomy and biology, published in 1983, where he proposed a classification based on conidium ontogenesis. He also proposed a new nomenclature protocol based on Sanskrit terminology; MycoBank, an online repository managed by the International Mycological Association has listed 384 genera of fungi named by him and Angulimaya, Dwayabeeja, Kutilakesa, Nalalanthamala, and Tharoopama are some of them. He worked on the re-assessment of Dematiaceous hyphomycetes and his work assisted in reclassifying the genus by attempting to disprove that Sporidesmium had a different ancestral species (monophyletic). Aspergillus, a genus of moulds, was another subject of his developmental taxonomical studies and his research on its teleomorphs helped in the {{better understanding of the}} fungi. His researches also explained the systematics, distribution and ecological behaviour of Fusarium and Drechslera, two plant pathogens.
