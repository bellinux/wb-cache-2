5|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle <b>Horse</b> is a <b>horse</b> breed {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky.

In 1989 the Kentucky Mountain Saddle <b>Horse</b> Association (KMSHA) was formed, and in 2002, the subsidiary Spotted Mountain <b>Horse</b> Association (SMHA) was developed to register Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses with excessive white markings and pinto patterns.

5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit <b>horse</b> in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained <b>horse</b> handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between <b>horse</b> and rider. The process of training the spade bit <b>horse</b> takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working <b>horse</b> and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the <b>horse</b> is also a factor; to become a spade bit <b>horse,</b> the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a <b>horse</b> trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E
5|$|A British {{horsewoman}} named Francesca Kelly {{founded a}} group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, {{with the goal of}} promoting and preserving the Marwari <b>horse</b> around the world.

Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses– the first in the country. The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous <b>Horse</b> Society to develop the first breed standards.|$|E
40|$|The bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} and use of recreational and sports <b>horses.</b> The recreational <b>horses</b> are mainly used for entertainment, riding or leisure (hobby) competitions whereas sports <b>horses</b> (show jumping <b>horses,</b> dressage <b>horses)</b> are used primarily for a certain discipline in which they compete. In the practical part of the thesis, occupational and leisure activities show jumping <b>horses,</b> dressage <b>horses</b> and recreational <b>horses</b> are mentioned.

The activities that the <b>horses</b> were engaged in were evaluated {{on the basis of}} the percentage distribution of each work: fieldwork, the riding area, jumping, work on the lunge, work from the ground, competitions and relaxation time of <b>horses.</b> In the detailed analysis, we can see how many hours the <b>horses</b> spent in the given activity through the period of four months. It was found that the fieldwork was the most common physical activity of recreational <b>horses</b> (11 days/horse/month).

40|$|The {{intestinal}} tract houses {{one of the}} richest and most complex microbial populations on the planet, and plays a critical role in health and a wide range of diseases.

The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the fecal microbiome of healthy <b>horses</b> and to compare the fecal microbiome of healthy <b>horses</b> to that of <b>horses</b> with undifferentiated colitis. A total of 195, 748 sequences obtained from 6 healthy <b>horses</b> and 10 <b>horses</b> affected by undifferentiated colitis were analyzed. Firmicutes predominated (68 %) among healthy <b>horses</b> followed by Bacteroidetes (14 %) and Proteobacteria (10 %).

5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} <b>horse</b> takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a <b>horse</b> completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the <b>horse</b> uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the <b>horse,</b> and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual <b>horse</b> moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the Arabian <b>horse,</b> as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and Quarter <b>Horse</b> lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian <b>horse,</b> the American Quarter <b>Horse</b> and the Thoroughbred.|$|E
