50|$|As {{with all}} benzodiazepines, <b>fludiazepam</b> is used recreationally.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fludiazepam,</b> marketed {{under the}} brand name Erispan (エリスパン) is a potent {{benzodiazepine}} and 2ʹ-fluoro derivative of diazepam, originally developed by Hoffman-La Roche in the 1960s. It is marketed in Japan and Taiwan. [...] It exerts its pharmacological properties via enhancement of GABAergic inhibition. <b>Fludiazepam</b> has 4 times more binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors than diazepam. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.|$|E
5000|$|N-Desalkylflurazepam (also {{known as}} Norflurazepam) is a {{benzodiazepine}} analog and an active metabolite {{of several other}} benzodiazepine drugs including flurazepam, flutoprazepam, <b>fludiazepam,</b> midazolam, quazepam, and ethyl loflazepate. [...] It is long-acting, prone to accumulation, and binds unselectively to the various benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. [...] It has been sold as a designer drug from 2016 onward.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{immersion}} (DI) -solid phase micro extraction (SPME) {{has been}} applied to 13 benzodiazepines spiked to human urine. Urine was mixed with distilled water and sodium chloride in a vial, and an SPME fiber was directly immersed in the sample solution during its stirring for 30 min at room temperature. Immediately after the fiber was pulled out of the vial, the fiber needle was injected into the port of a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector. Medazepam, <b>fludiazepam,</b> diazepam, midazolam, flunitrazepam, prazepam, nimetazepam and flurazepam could be extracted under the present DI-SPME conditions, and their recoveries were 1. 55 - 17. 0 %. Their calibration curves showed linearity up to 1000 ng/ml urine. The detection limit of nimetazepam was 150 ng/ml; those for medazepam, <b>fludiazepam,</b> diazepam, midazolam, flunitrazepam, prazepam and flurazepam were 10 - 20 ng/ml. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{reducing}} stress on blood pressure were investigated in 20 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. An anxiolytic, <b>fludiazepam,</b> {{was administered to}} the patients for 12 weeks and their blood pressures and State Trait Anxiety Inventory scores {{at the beginning and}} end of treatment were compared. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and trait and state anxiety scores were all significantly reduced during the treatment period. There was also a weak correlation between the extent of the improvement in the same anxiety score and the improvement in diastolic blood pressures...|$|E
40|$|Stress was {{assessed}} using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores in 40 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients, {{and the results were}} compared with those for 40 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. <b>Fludiazepam</b> was administered to the patients for 12 weeks and stress was reassessed. The Manifest Anxiety Scale score correlated with Trait (r = 0. 548, P < 0. 0001) and State (r = 0. 474, P = 0. 0001) scores, validating the latter as measurements of stress. Both Trait (43. 4 vs 35. 8, P < 0. 001) and State (41. 6 vs 33. 8, P < 0. 001) scores were significantly higher in NIDDM patients than in healthy controls. Administration of an anxiolytic, <b>fludiazepam</b> (0. 25 mg, three times daily, orally) for 12 weeks lowered Trait score (43. 5 to 36. 9, P < 0. 0001), State score (41. 6 to 35. 8, P < 0. 0002), glycosylated haemoglobin (8. 4 to 7. 3 %, P < 0. 0001), systolic blood pressure (151. 2 to 143. 4 mmHg, P < 0. 0017) and diastolic blood pressure (84. 2 to 77. 7 mmHg, P < 0. 0018). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the significant explanatory variables for the change in State score during anxiolytic administration were the changes in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B:A 1 and glycosylated haemoglobin (RZ = 0. 3224, P < 0. 0022). The results indicate that stress is detected at a higher frequency in patients with 449 at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 18, 2016 imr. sagepub. comDownloaded from NIDDM than in healthy controls, and that blood glucose and lipid metabolic factors are significant explanatory variables for this stress. This stress is correlated with glucose metabolism and blood pressure and, moreover, these factors could all be proved concomitantly by the administration of an anxiolytic...|$|E
