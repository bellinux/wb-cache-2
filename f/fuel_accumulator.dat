40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper {{is to develop a}} program, a methodology and execute vibration load tests of Common Rail fuel system components for a diesel engine. The paper contains an analysis of parameters that characterize vibration activity of research object and determine its applicability {{as a part of the}} specific mechanical system. A tests program has been developed that includes measurements of general peak values of vibration acceleration in the fuel system components, transformation of the obtained data while taking into account the fact that peak vibration acceleration values depend on crank-shaft rotation frequency and spectrum of vibration frequency, comparison of these dependences with the threshold limit values obtained in the process of component tests with the help of vibration shaker. The investigations have been carried out in one of the most stressed elements of the Common Rail fuel system that is a RDS 4. 2 -pressure sensor in a <b>fuel</b> <b>accumulator</b> manufactured by Robert Bosch GmbH and mounted on the MMZ D 245. 7 E 4 -engines. According to the test methodology measurements have been performed on an engine test bench at all fullload engine curves. Vibration measurements have resulted in time history of the peak vibration acceleration values in three directions from every accelerometer and crank-shaft rotation frequency. It has been proposed to increase a diameter of mounting spacers of the <b>fuel</b> <b>accumulator</b> and install a damping clamp on high pressure tubes from a high pressure fuel pump to the <b>fuel</b> <b>accumulator</b> that permits to reduce a maximum peak vibration acceleration value on the pressure sensor in the <b>fuel</b> <b>accumulator</b> by 400 m/s 2 and ensure its application in the given engine. </p...|$|E

50|$|After 1959, {{it served}} {{as a basis for}} the T-55K command tank which was {{equipped}} with an additional R-112 radio set, an AB-1-P/30 <b>fuel</b> powered <b>accumulator</b> charging unit, and TPN-1-22-11 night vision sight. All this additional equipment made it necessary to decrease the ammunition load for the main gun to 37 rounds and eliminate the bow machine gun. In the beginning of the 1960s, a T-55K was experimentally fitted with a Uran TV relay apparatus for battlefield surveillance. The tank was fitted with an external camera, the picture from which was relayed to a receiver in a BTR-50PU command vehicle. There was an observation camera mounted on a folding mast which was in turn mounted on a UAZ 69 car. The range within which the picture could be relayed varied between 10 and 30 km.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} CFD {{analysis of}} fuel {{flow in the}} CNG injector. The issues such a pressure drop along an injector channel, mass flow through the key sections of the injector geometry, flow rates, {{the impact of the}} needle shape on the deflection of the sprayed gas cone and the impact of the wall head are analyzed in the article. The simulation was made in the transient states conditions for full injection process, including the opening and closing of the injector. An injection time of 6 ms, velocity of 0. 33 mm/ms and a lift of 0. 5 mm were selected for opening and closing of injector based on experimental test. The simulation shows that the volume inside the injector is a kind of <b>fuel</b> <b>accumulator,</b> and the opening process of the needle influence the flow parameters in an inlet cross-section after a certain time, depending on a channel cross section. The calculations allowed to select the ratio of an injector duct cross sectional area to the aperture area of the injection capable of the reducing pressure loss. The unusual location of the injector in the socket of a glow plug in the Andoria ADCR engine makes a stream be impaired by a part of the head. This research result would be useful in developing an injector construction which will be used for an investigation of CNG addition into diesel engine...|$|E

Experiments have been completed to characterize coal-water slurry sprays generated by an electronically-controlled <b>accumulator</b> <b>fuel</b> injection system for a diesel engine. The sprays were injected into a pressurized chamber equipped with quartz windows. High speed movies, detailed data for fuel line pressures and needle lift signals were obtained as a function of time, orifice diameter, coal loading, gas density in the chamber, and <b>accumulator</b> <b>fuel</b> pressure. For the base case conditions (50 % by mass) coal loading, 0. 4 mm diameter nozzle hole, coal-water slurry pressure of 82 MPa (12, 000 psi), and a chamber density of 25 kg/m'), the break-up time was 0. 30 msec. An empirical correlation for both spray tip penetration and initial jet velocity was developed. For the base case conditions, the spray tip penetration and initial jet velocity were 15 % greater for coal water slurry than for diesel fuel or water. Results of this research and the correlation are specific to the tested coal-water slurry...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Experiments have been completed to characterize atomization of intermittent coal-water slurry sprays from an electronically controlled <b>accumulator</b> <b>fuel</b> injection system of a diesel fuel engine. A synchronized laser diffraction particle analyzer technique was used to measure the spray tip Sauter mean diameters (SMD). The Rosin-Rammler two parameter model was assumed for the droplet distribution. The measurements were made at the spray tip where laser obscuration was low and the chance of multiscattering bias was minimal. Coal-water slurry fuel with 50 % coal loading by mass containing 5 gm volume mean diameter coal particles was used. Injection pressures were ranged from 28 to II 0 MPa. Three different nozzle orifice diameters, 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mm, four axial measurement locations from 60 to 120 mm downstream of the nozzle tip were studied. Measurements were made for both pressurized (2. 07 MPa, 300 psig) and unpressurized (ambient, 0 gage) chamber conditions. The spray tip SMD showed an increase with chamber gas density, and with axial measurement location, and showed a decrease with increasing injection pressure. The effect of nozzle orifice diameter on spray tip SMDs of completely developed sprays for such high pressure injections was found to be negligible. A regression equation for CWS- 50 spray tip SMDs was determined as SMD = 0. 279 -P(inj). ? 702 r(amb) 2 ? 85 x. 521 where Pinj is the injection pressure in Mpa, r(amb) is the ambient density in kg/m 3, and x is the axial measurement location downstream of the nozzle tip in mm. The equation shows very good agreement with the measured SMD data by having a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0. 97. The results were also compared with previous SMD regression equations that were originally obtained for diesel fuel sprays...|$|R
