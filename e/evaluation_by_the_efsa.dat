The marketing of these products within the European Union falls under different legislative instruments, which establish the requirement for a risk assessment for the authorisation of the product. The present guidance describes the principles to be followed when conducting such a risk assessment, as well as the scientific information required in applications for authorisation to be evaluated by the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA GMO Panel). Products form four categories, depending on their nature and the level of scientific information required for their <b>evaluation</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> GMO Panel.

30|$|Hofmann et al. [2] {{analysed}} {{a representative}} dataset on maize pollen deposition measurements collected using a standardised method at 214 sites over 10  years from inside maize fields to 4.42  km {{from the nearest}} maize pollen source. The results significantly exceeded the deposition estimates made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> GMO Panel for distances greater than 10  m [9 – 13]. <b>The</b> <b>EFSA</b> model, which relied on extrapolation of observations that were limited to a distance of up to 7  m from field edges, resulted in a much steeper negative slope compared with measured deposition, as illustrated in Fig.  5 of [2] (see Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). Based on their empirical results, Hofmann et al. [2] confirmed the findings of previous studies [20 – 24] that isolation buffer distances in the kilometre range {{are likely to be}} required to maintain the threshold limits calculated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> Panel for effective protection of sensitive Lepidoptera.

30|$|Thus, {{the results}} from the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch study {{demonstrate}} that the buffer distances proposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> Panel would have been insufficient to prevent protected butterfly species in nature reserve areas from maize pollen exposure. In fact, Bt-maize pollen deposition and maize pollen densities on leaves up to 3000 n/cm 2 were detected within the protected area. One possible reason for these high pollen densities is that maize pollen can be lifted by thermal gusts, which occur particularly in the summer on bright and windy days. These conditions also encourage maize pollen release and dispersal by wind to farther distances [22, 26, 45 – 48].|$|R

40|$|This {{guidance}} on {{the assessment of}} dermal absorption has been developed to assist notifiers, users of test facilities and Member State authorities on critical aspects related to the setting of dermal absorption values {{to be used in}} risk assessments of active substances in Plant Protection Products (PPPs). It is based on the ‘scientific opinion on the science behind the revision of the guidance document on dermal absorption’ issued in 2011 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR). The guidance refers to <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> PPR opinion in many instances. In addition, the first version of this guidance, issued in 2012 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>EFSA</b> PPR Panel, has been revised in 2017 on the basis of new available data on human in vitro dermal absorption for PPPs and wherever clarifications were needed. Basic details of experimental design, available in the respective test guidelines and accompanying guidance for the conduct of studies, have not been addressed but recommendations specific to performing and interpreting dermal absorption studies with PPPs are given. Issues discussed include {{a brief description of the}} skin and its properties affecting dermal absorption. To facilitate use of the guidance, flow charts are included. Guidance is also provided, for example, when there are no data on dermal absorption for the product under evaluation. Elements for a tiered approach are presented including use of default values, data on closely related products, in vitro studies with human skin (regarded to provide the best estimate), data from experimental animals (rats) in vitro and in vivo, and the so called ‘triple pack’ approach. Various elements of study design and reporting that reduce experimental variation and aid consistent interpretation are presented. A proposal for reporting data for assessment reports is also provided. The issue of nanoparticles in PPPs is not addressed. Data from volunteer studies have not been discussed since their use is not allowed in EU for risk assessment of PPPs...|$|R
30|$|Daily {{means and}} {{variation}} of single values uncovered by our detailed measurements are considerably higher than previously assumed.

Because variation and total aggregation of deposited pollen on leaves have been previously underestimated, lepidopteran larvae have actually been subjected to higher and more variable exposure. Higher risks to these organisms must consequently be assumed. Our results imply that risk assessments related to the effects of Bt maize exposure under both realistic cultivation conditions and worst-case scenarios must be revised.

30|$|Neonicotinoids This {{group of}} highly {{effective}} insecticides {{have been widely}} used in the past 20  years for seed treatment (seed coatings). These “systemic” active substances are taken up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> seedling, offering protection against sucking insects and some chewing insects. In 2008, the spread of abrasion dust from coated seeds spread by pneumatic seed drilling equipment led to a massive poisoning of bee colonies in south-western Germany [16]. The importance of the airborne distribution of abrasion dust had been underestimated in the EU approval for the active substances and in PPP testing.
