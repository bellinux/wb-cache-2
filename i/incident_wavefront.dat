5000|$|Another common-path {{interferometer}} {{useful in}} lens testing and fluid flow diagnostics {{is the point}} diffraction interferometer (PDI), invented by Linnik in 1933. [...] The reference beam is generated by diffraction from a small pinhole, about half {{the diameter of the}} Airy disk, in a semitransparent plate. Fig. 1 illustrates an aberrated wavefront focused onto the pinhole. The diffracted reference beam and the transmitted test wave interfere to form fringes. The common-path design of the PDI brings to it a number of important advantages. (1) Only a single laser path is required rather than the two paths required by the Mach-Zehnder or Michelson designs. This advantage can be very important in large interferometric setups such as in wind tunnels that have long optical paths through turbulent media. (2) The common-path design uses fewer optical components than double path designs, making alignment much easier, as well as reducing cost, size, and weight, especially for large setups. (3) While the accuracy of a double path design is dependent on the precision with which the reference element is figured, careful design enables the generated reference beam of the PDI to be of guaranteed precision. A disadvantage is that the amount of light getting through the pinhole depends on how well the light can be focused onto the pinhole. If the <b>incident</b> <b>wavefront</b> is severely aberrated, very little light may get through. The PDI has seen use in various adaptive optics applications.|$|E

This difference, together with an additional difference in the equations that govern both physical systems lead to a quite different scattering in the case of surface waves, whose main characteristic is a strong asymmetry in the scattering cross section.

For large-scale implementation of quantum information processing, such as quantum simulators, boson sampling or programmable quantum logic gates, a programmable functionality {{of a large}} multichannel network is required. In this thesis, we describe and demonstrate programmable quantum interference between multiple single-photon states in massively multichannel networks. Using a theoretical analysis we first show that losses in optical networks, which are unavoidable in experiments, introduce new freedom, in that the functionality of the network, and thus also quantum interference in there, is programmable to an extent not possible with lossless networks. We introduce a method to program the functionality of general multichannel linear optical networks by phase modulation of <b>incident</b> <b>wavefronts,</b> which we apply to opaque scattering media as well as integrated optics. To demonstrate quantum interference in massively multichannel networks we require a source of multiple indistinguishable single-photon states. Therefore, we have constructed and characterized a versatile quantum light source based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion. For the first time, we demonstrate two-photon quantum interference in a massively multichannel linear optical network realized in an opaque scattering medium. Using adaptive phase-modulation of the incident photons, the scattering medium is transformed to behave as a fully programmable beam splitter that is freely tunable in functionality. Exploiting this freedom, we not only show the well-known Hong-Ou-Mandel bunching of photons, but also demonstrate that this bunching {{can be made to}} vanish, or be transformed into antibunching. Our results establish opaque scattering media as a platform for massively multichannel linear optical networks with programmable quantum correlations. Finally, the high number of available channels offered by opaque scattering media can directly be employed for authentication of secure communication.
