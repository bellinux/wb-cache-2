25|$|<b>Humidification</b> is {{commonly}} accomplished by introducing live steam into the kiln through a steam spray pipe. In order to limit {{and control the}} humidity of the air when large quantities of moisture are being rapidly evaporated from the timber, there is normally a provision for ventilation of the chamber in all types of kilns.|$|E
25|$|Specific pretreatments, {{drugs to}} prevent {{chemically}} induced lung injuries due to respiratory airway toxins, are not available. Analgesic medications, oxygen, <b>humidification,</b> and ventilator support currently constitute standard therapy. In fact, mechanical ventilation remains the therapeutic mainstay for acute inhalation injury. The cornerstone of treatment {{is to keep}} the PaO2 > 60 mmHg (8.0 kPa), without causing injury to the lungs with excessive O2 or volutrauma. Pressure control ventilation is more versatile than volume control, although breaths should be volume limited, to prevent stretch injury to the alveoli. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to improve oxygenation. Hemorrhaging, signifying substantial damage to the lining of the airways and lungs, can occur with exposure to highly corrosive chemicals and may require additional medical interventions. Corticosteroids are sometimes administered, and bronchodilators to treat bronchospasms. Drugs that reduce the inflammatory response, promote healing of tissues, and prevent the onset of pulmonary edema or secondary inflammation may be used following severe injury to prevent chronic scarring and airway narrowing.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used membrane is Nafion by Chemours, which relies on liquid water <b>humidification</b> of the membrane to transport protons. This implies {{that it is not}} feasible to use temperatures above 80 to 90°C, since the membrane would dry. Other, more recent membrane types, based on polybenzimidazole (PBI) or phosphoric acid, can reach up to 220°C without using any water management: higher temperature allow for better efficiencies, power densities, ease of cooling (because of larger allowable temperature differences), reduced sensitivity to carbon monoxide poisoning and better controllability (because of absence of water management issues in the membrane); however, these recent types are not as common. PBI can be doped with phosphoric or sulfuric acid and the conductivity scales with amount of doping and temperature. At high temperatures, it is difficult to keep Nafion hydrated, but this acid doped material does not use water as a medium for proton conduction. It also exhibits better mechanical properties, higher strength, than Nafion and is cheaper. However, acid leaching is a considerable issue and processing, mixing with catalyst to form ink, has proved tricky. Aromatic polymers, such as PEEK, are far cheaper than Teflon (PTFE and backbone of Nafion) and their polar character leads to hydration that is less temperature dependent than Nafion. However, PEEK is far less ionically conductive than Nafion and thus is a less favorable electrolyte choice. Recently, protic ionic liquids and protic organic ionic plastic crystals have been shown as promising alternative electrolyte materials for high temperature (100–200°C) PEMFCs.|$|E

They made a mistake: they measured the in-facepiece concentration by weighing, but the dust contains cement. Dust <b>humidification</b> increased its mass, and drying the in-facepiece filters can not remove moisture.

The specialists began to point to what chemical element the measured protection factors were defined.|$|E

2500|$|While some {{winemaking}} techniques {{once considered}} fraudulent are now generally accepted, a few practices {{have gone in}} the opposite direction. One {{of the most controversial}} is adding water to wine in a technique known today as <b>humidification.</b> Master of wine Jancis Robinson calls the act of adding water to [...] "stretch out" [...] or dilute wine [...] "possibly the oldest form of wine fraud in the book." [...] There is a long history of adding water to dilute wine {{in order to make it}} more palatable. The ancient Greeks thought it was [...] "barbaric" [...] to drink undiluted wine. They further believed that undiluted wine was unhealthy and that the Spartan king Cleomenes I was once driven insane after drinking wine that was not diluted with water. Today, few consumers dilute their wine as the Greeks did, but the use of water during the winemaking process is still prevalent.|$|E
2500|$|The general {{requirements}} of a good electrolyte for PEMFCs are: high proton conductivity (>10−2 S/cm for practical applications) to enable proton transport between electrodes, good chemical and thermal stability under fuel cell operating conditions (environmental humidity, variable temperatures, resistance to poisonous species, etc.), low cost, ability to be processed into thin-films, and overall compatibility with other cell components. [...] While polymeric materials are currently the preferred choice of proton-conducting membrane, they require <b>humidification</b> for adequate performance and can sometimes physically degrade due to hydrations effects, thereby causing losses of efficiency. As mentioned, Nafion is also limited by a dehydration temperature of < 100nbsp&°C, {{which can lead to}} slower reaction kinetics, poor cost efficiency, and CO poisoning of Pt electrode catalysts. Conversely, MOFs have shown encouraging proton conductivities in both low and high temperature regimes as well as over a wide range of humidity conditions. Below 100nbsp&°C and under hydration, the presence of hydrogen bonding and solvent water molecules aid in proton transport, whereas anhydrous conditions are suitable for temperatures above 100nbsp&°C. MOFs also have the distinct advantage of exhibiting proton conductivity by the framework itself in addition to the inclusion of charge carries (i.e., water, acids, etc.) into their pores.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Humidification</b> - <b>Humidification</b> is {{the process}} of adding the {{appropriate}} level of humidity to the leather, without wetting, in an effort to reshape and/or restore the object to its desired condition. During <b>humidification</b> special care should be given to ensure that the object never reaches a wet state, as well as, making certain that objects are not left in areas that may contribute to a quick change in temperature due to the shrinkage of leather and its potential damage. Because damaged leather may be more sensitive to heat, objects should avoid any exposure to heat which may be present near windows. Because leather is more susceptible to mold, it should be regularly monitored during this process. Heat treatments should always be avoided while leather is in the <b>humidification</b> process.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory gas <b>humidification</b> is {{a method}} of artificially {{conditioning}} respiratory gas for the patient during therapy, and involves <b>humidification,</b> warming, and occasionally filtration of the gas being delivered.
