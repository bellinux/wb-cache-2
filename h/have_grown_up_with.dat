Many internals <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> families modeling typical internal beliefs; these families emphasized effort, education, responsibility and thinking, and parents typically gave their children rewards they had promised them. In contrast, externals are typically associated with lower socioeconomic status. Societies experiencing social unrest increase the expectancy of being out-of-control; therefore, people in such societies become more external.|$|E

500|$|Possessing a {{love for}} Italian culture, Chase decided to make her male protagonist, Dain, a [...] "mongrel English aristocrat" [...] and half-Italian. By giving Dain Italian ancestry through his mother, Chase was able to develop his {{character}} and justify his motivations. She explains, [...] "Having Dain be half-Italian fit so many aspects of his story: his background {{as well as his}} behavior, which does get operatic at times". Chase adds that Dain's difficult childhood stemmed from his parents' inability to accept each other's cultures, which then [...] "warps him and makes him a misfit. In a loving household, he would <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a better self-image, and would have dealt with bullying at school in a different way, and thus would have grown up into someone altogether different from the man Jessica meets in that antique shop".|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{was written by}} a team of 13 writers from London aged between 17 and 22 who responded to a writing {{competition}} and attended a summer school in August 2009 as part of the BBC's new talent initiative, where they created the entire series. The summer school took place over four weeks, with the first two weeks in Theatre Royal Stratford East and the last two at the BBC centre at Elstree Studios. The writers did not know they would be writing a spin-off to EastEnders until they arrived. The writers, including Florence Vincent, Alex Oates, Kashman Harris and Emer Kenny, also wrote the ten episodes of series 2. They are from various parts of London, which Sathe said was [...] "brilliant" [...] as they represent different parts of life in London, and they <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Internet as a native medium. Santer stated that the writers created a new Walford, calling it a [...] "fresh perspective on a British classic." [...] The writers were given a day to travel around East London to listen to people talking to get ideas. Sathe commented: [...] "We created some brilliant scenes from the eavesdropping stuff." [...] After the summer school, the writers were commissioned to write the 12 episodes of series 1. Some of the scripts were allowed by be changed by the actors if they thought lines were not authentic, {{such as the use of}} London street slang. Sathe considered the use of slang to be a highlight of the series, calling it her proudest moment. Storylining and character creation for series 2 started in January 2010. The third series used mostly different writers to the first two. Each potential writer had to send in a monologue for a character they would like to see on television and the production team chose their favourites. The writers were then asked to write a scene between their character and one of the established EastEnders characters. Following this, the writers were interviewed and the most promising fifteen were selected. Kenny returned as a writer for series 3 and was joined by several of the young EastEnders cast members: Arinze Kene (Connor Stanley), Himesh Patel (Tamwar Masood) and Charlie G Hawkins (Darren Miller).|$|E

2500|$|As this {{distinction}} has been diminished, players' willingness {{to play and}} access content on different platforms has increased.

2500|$|According to biographer Janet Todd, Behn did {{not oppose}} slavery per se. She {{accepted}} {{the idea that}} powerful groups would enslave the powerless, and she would <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Oriental tales of [...] "The Turk" [...] taking European slaves. Although {{it has never been}} proven that Behn was actually married, the most likely candidate for her husband is Johan Behn, who sailed on The King David from the German imperial free city of Hamburg. This Johan Behn was a slaver whose residence in London later was probably a result of acting as a mercantile cover for Dutch trade with the English colonies under a false flag. One could argue that if Aphra Behn had been opposed to slavery as an institution, it is not very likely that she would have married a slave trader. At the same time, it is fairly clear that she was not happy in marriage, and Oroonoko, written twenty years after the death of her husband, has, among its cast of characters, no one more evil than the slave ship captain who tricks and captures Oroonoko.|$|E
2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns.

[...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for {{what is going to be}} an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed to join our cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E
60|$|Now {{we have to}} {{remember}} that the bulk of this great organization of newspapers and periodicals and all the wide distribution of books that goes on to-day are extremely recent things. This new nexus of print has grown up in the lifetime of four or five generations, and it is undergoing constant changes. We are apt to forget its extreme newness in history and to disregard the profound difference in mental conditions it makes between our own times and any former period.

60|$|At {{our very}} doors, however, {{there is a}} small nation of largely {{different}} blood and of wholly different speech from our own; a nation forming a part of our own kingdom, even more closely than the Scotch or the Irish, and yet in some respects further from us in mind and habit of life than either; a nation marked rather by the poetical and artistic, than by the mechanical and practical temperament--the ancient and noble Welsh people. It would hardly be reasonable to expect from the Welsh exactly the same kind of success in life which we often find in English workmen; the aims and ideals of the two races are so distinct, and it must be frankly confessed the advantage is not always {{on the side of the}} Englishman. The Welsh peasants, living among their own romantic hills and valleys, speaking their own soft and exquisite language, treasuring their own plaintive and melodious poetry, <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an intense love for beauty and the beautiful closely intwined into the very warp and woof of their inmost natures. They have almost always a natural refinement of manner and delicacy of speech which is unfortunately too often wanting amongst our rougher English labouring classes, especially in large towns. They are intensely musical, producing a very large proportion of the best English singers and composers. They are fond of literature, for which they have generally some natural capacity, and in which they exercise themselves to an extent unknown, probably, among people of their class in any other country. At the local meetings of bards (as they call themselves) in Wales, it is not at all uncommon to hear that the first prize for Welsh poetry has been carried off by a shepherd, and the first prize for Welsh prose composition by a domestic servant. In short, the susceptibilities of the race run rather toward art and imagination, than toward mere moneymaking and practical ingenuity.|$|E

For the righteous to {{suppress}} an evil, is sometimes harder than for others to uphold it. Humanity cries out against this vast enormity:-- not one man knows a prudent remedy. Blame not, then, the North; and wisely judge the South. Ere, as a nation, they became responsible, this thing was planted in their midst. Such roots strike deep. Place to-day those serfs in Dominora; and with them, all Vivenza's Past;-- and serfs, for many years, in Dominora, they would be. Easy is it to stand afar and rail. All men are censors who have lungs. We can say, the stars are wrongly marshaled. Blind men say the sun is blind. A thousand muscles wag our tongues; though our tongues were housed, {{that they might have}} a home. Whose is free from crime, let him cross himself--but hold his cross upon his lips. That he is not bad, is not of him. Potters' clay and wax are all, molded by hands invisible. The soil decides the man. And, ere birth, man wills not to be born here or there. These southern tribes <b>have</b> <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> this thing; bond-women were their nurses, and bondmen serve them still. Nor are all their serfs such wretches as those we saw. Some seem happy: yet not as men. Unmanned, they know not what they are. And though, of all the south, Nulli must stand almost alone in his insensate creed; yet, to all wrong-doers, custom backs the sense of wrong. And if to every Mardian, conscience be the awarder of its own doom; then, of these tribes, many shall be found exempted from the least penalty of this sin. But sin it is, no less;--a blot, foul as the crater-pool of hell; it puts out the sun at noon; it parches all fertility; and, conscience or no conscience--ere he die--let every master who wrenches bond-babe from mother, that the nipple tear; unwreathes the arms of sisters; or cuts the holy unity in twain; till apart fall man and wife, like one bleeding body cleft:--let that master thrice shrive his soul; take every sacrament; on his bended knees give up the ghost;--yet shall he die despairing; and live again, to die forever damned. The future is all hieroglyphics. Who may read? But, methinks the great laggard Time must now march up apace, and somehow befriend these thralls. It can not be, that misery is perpetually entailed; though, in a land proscribing primogeniture, the first-born and last of Hamo's tribe must still succeed to all their sires' wrongs. Yes.
