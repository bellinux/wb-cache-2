5000|$|Additional sizing agents, {{including}} resins, glue, or starch, can {{be added}} to the web to alter its characteristics. Sizing improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength. These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the <b>dry</b> <b>end</b> (surface sizing), or both. At the <b>dry</b> <b>end</b> sizing is usually applied with a size press. The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator [...] It is usually placed before the last dryer section. Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a coating of fillers such as calcium carbonate or china clay usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and styrene-butadiene latex. Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.|$|E

Being somewhat shorter than Ryde Pier, it could not be used at all points of the tide, and so offered little competition to the main Ryde to Portsmouth ferry services. When the Stokes Bay company was acquired by the London & South Western Railway in 1875, the ferry service ceased, and Victoria Pier became a pleasure pier only, with public baths at the head and a swimming platform at the <b>dry</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>dry</b> <b>end</b> of the {{papermaking}} process, {{the paper}} web is rewetted with a starch based solution. The process is called surface sizing. Starches used have been chemically, or enzymatically depolymerized {{at the paper}} mill or by the starch industry (oxidized starch). The size/starch solutions are applied to the paper web by means of various mechanical presses (size presses). Together with surface sizing agents the surface starches impart additional strength to the paper web and additionally provide water hold out or [...] "size" [...] for superior printing properties. Starch is also used in paper coatings {{as one of the}} binders for the coating formulations which include a mixture of pigments, binders and thickeners.

It is a legal non-profit entity and is overseen by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.The Museum is located in Sigri in western Lesvos, {{in the center of}} the protected area of the Petrified Forest, a protected natural monument with worldwide recognition.The exhibitions of the museum include two permanent exhibition halls. The first is dedicated to the Petrified Forest and the evolution of plants on earth, which is presented through rare fossils, from the first single-celled organisms appeared on Earth until the appearance of grown plants and the creation of the Petrified Forest. The flora of the Petrified Forest is presented with more than forty different species. Petrified pieces of trunks, branches, roots, seeds and leaves are presented in front of large graphs of the plants.In the second hall the “Evolution of the Aegean” presents through impressive models and charts geological phenomena and processes associated with the creation of the Petrified Forest and the geological history of the Aegean’s basin in the last 20 million years. Visitors are introduced to the evolutionary history of the volcanic activity in the Greek area, impressive forms of quartz minerals and rocks, skulls moulders of significant extinct primates from Greece and Lesvos, tools made of flint from the Stone Age. The visitors can watch the recording of earthquakes in real time by the Seismological Station of Sigri.The Museum is a tool for cultural, economic and social development of the region. Every year international conferences, exhibitions, lectures and various events are taking place. Furthermore at the premises of the Museum is organized the Agrotourism Festival.Particular attention has been given to the implementation of educational programs and the creation of educational materials for all levels of education. The Museum’s educational programs attract each year interest from students of Lesvos and the rest of Greece or abroad.The museum has installed an earthquake simulator that simulates earthquakes happened in the past. The earthquake simulator provides a realistic experience of earthquakes to the Museum’s visitors, in order to understand the phenomenon and to have a proper training on how to encounter seismic risk.The Museum collaborates with the Global Geoparks Network of UNESCO, the European Geoparks Network, with scientific institutions, museums, universities and research centers from Greece and abroad.This is the <b>dry</b> <b>end</b> of the island of Lesbos fairly lacking in vegetation and agriculture.
