60|$|Ichabod Crane had a {{soft and}} foolish heart towards the sex; {{and it is not}} to be {{wondered}} at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated {{on the banks of the}} Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart,--sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.|$|E

50|$|Bravery and hardwork of Bikpakpaam:The {{core values}} of Bikpakpaam include: bravery, hard work, determination, generosity, hospitality, courage, and collectivism, love {{of family life}} and support for family members. This hard working {{attribute}} evolved {{as a component of}} their culture which requires every adolescent to work hard enough to plow their own farm land and that of their parents in the same season in order to become economically independent and raise their own families. In their hay days, typical Bikpakpaam farmers will plow their own yam farm manually, boasting of 15,000-20,000 yam mounds yearly. This is evident in the fact that Bikpakpaam are the major yam producers in Ghana and Togo. In Ghana, Bikpakpaam are proud to feed the nation and even export yam through the Konkomba Yam Market in Agbogbloshie, Accra. In addition to yam farming, Bikpakpaam farmers also boast of maize, guinea corn, and millet and rice farms. Bikpakpaam women care for the men as they plow the fields, but also plow their own fields where they grow mainly vegetables and legumes (groundnuts, and beans). Women also gather fruits for economic gain namely shea nuts (used to make shea butter) and dawadawa fruits, which have a diversified use. Bikpakpaam women are also excellent in harvest and post harvest processing and marketing of foodstuff. Gathering of firewood and charcoal production for both domestic and commercial use are integral part of Bikpakpaam women duties. The brewing of a local drink known as ndamam (“red drink”) popularly known as pito is a natural gift and preserve of women.Animal rearing is also practiced by Bikpakpaam for domestic consumption and commercial purposes. Such animals include birds (fowls, <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls,</b> ducks, and doves), ruminants (mainly goats, sheep, and cattle) and pigs. In recent times, some farmers have delved into guinea pig, grasscutter and rabbit farming for commercial purposes. Bikpakpaam farmers also now boast of large plantations of fruit trees, mainly mango and cashew trees. The practice of collective solidarity in the form of communal labor termed as nkpawiin depicts hardwork, unity and collaboration among Bikpakpaam communities. Here, individuals seek help from the entire community to meet labour needs (farming, construction and other forms of work) and this occurs in turns. Bikpakpaam are swift, brave and security conscious.|$|E

Methods Qualitative and morphometric traits were recorded on 788 local chickens and 394 <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> in urban households in Tamale, Ghana. Results The results showed considerable variation of color traits and numerous major genes in local chickens, while color variations and related genotypes in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> were limited. In local chickens, white was preferred for plumage, whereas dark colors were preferred for beak and shanks. More than half of the chickens carried at least one major gene, but the contributions of single gene carriers were low. All calculated allele frequencies were significantly lower than their expected Mendelian allele frequencies. We observed higher mean body weight and larger linear body measures in male as compared to female chickens. In female chickens, we detected a small effect of major genes on body weight and chest circumference. In addition, we found some association between feather type and plumage color. In <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl,</b> seven distinct plumage colors were observed, of which pearl grey pied and pearl grey were the most prevalent. Male pearl grey pied <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> were inferior to pearl grey and white <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> in terms of body weight, body length and chest circumference; their shank length was lower than that of pearl grey fowl.

40|$|Good feeding for {{guinea fowl}} Cue: Our next report comes from Blantyre in Malawi, where Patrick Mphaka {{reports on the}} growing {{popularity}} of guinea fowl among village poultry keepers. One reason for this popularity is a reported resistance of guinea fowl in Malawi to a major poultry disease, Newcastle disease, which every year has a devastating impact on unvaccinated poultry flocks. While this reported resistance may reflect a greater hardiness in guinea fowl to some common diseases, guinea fowl are, in fact vulnerable to Newcastle disease, in common with nearly all poultry species, and those keeping guinea fowl should follow appropriate steps to keep their birds disease free. IN:		?Traditionally, popular domestic birds? OUT:		?. Newcastle which troubles our chickens. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Village headman Magombo Ngondo ending that report on a community guinea fowl project in his village. Please note that while in his experience, guinea fowl are more resistant to Newcastle disease, veterinary advice suggests that guinea fowl are, in fact, vulnerable to the disease, in common with other poultry. Transcript Mphaka	Traditionally, popular domestic birds kept by most people here are chickens. These have their advantages, and, naturally, their disadvantages. One of the most menacing problems for the poor lot of chicken keepers is the seasonal outbreak of Newcastle disease. It is a big problem for most people because though easily preventable when appropriate vaccination is supplied to the birds, most of them can not afford it. The result is death en masse of chickens once or twice each year. 		Due to this problem, most people are turning their attention to alternative birds. To this end, the introduction of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in some areas has become handy. To date, there are no locally known diseases which attack <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> This quality directly solves the problem most bird keepers have been having with chickens. Since the retail price of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> is higher than that of chickens, it has not been easy for most people to start rearing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> There are some instances, however, where Non-Governmental organizations have intervened in introducing the birds to some communities. One such community is in Magombo Ngondo village in Traditional Authority Kuntaja in Blantyre district. The community here was given some twenty birds to keep on community level and that as the birds multiply, they can start sharing amongst themselves. I paid the village headman a visit {{to learn more about the}} feeding practices, among other relevant issues. Ngondo	[Vernac] As far as feeding is concerned, we provide them with food two or three times each day within the stall before we release them to fend for themselves outside. In addition, we also ensure that the water containers which you see there are cleaned and filled with clean water each day. We feed these <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> with maize bran, sorghum, or sometimes we look for white ants, so that we are sure that when they are going to fend for themselves, they have already had enough food. Mphaka	You told me earlier that sometimes these birds are 100 % stall fed, and sometimes, like this period, they are on semi-free range. Would you elaborate on that? Ngondo	We stall feed them 100 % when we have just planted various crops in the fields. This is done to ensure that the planted seeds grow without being eaten away by the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> As you know, these birds are very notorious with seed, especially maize. Once the seedlings are of good health, and can not be destroyed anymore by the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls,</b> we then put them on semi-free range. Mphaka	These <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> belong to the community. How does the community assist you in taking care of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in terms of feeding them and other things? Ngondo	The community assists in several ways. They take turns in making sure that the inside and outside of the guinea fowl house is clean. They are also the ones who do the actual feeding of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> Mphaka	Would you like to tell me the difference in terms of production of eggs between the times when you are giving them food inside their house, and when you are allowing them to go out free range? Ngondo	They lay eggs more continuously when they are on semi-free range. We think this is because they are able to supplement on the food we give them inside the stall. Again, we think that the space and fresh air which they enjoy outside, give them more freedom which make them healthier. Mphaka	What would you say is the advantage of rearing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> over chickens? Ngondo	<b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are better than chickens when it comes to diseases. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are resistant to Newcastle which troubles our chickens. End of track.

40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the steps of}} spermiogenesis and stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in breeding guinea cocks. Sections embedded in epoxy resin were employed for {{the determination of the}} stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> Acrosomic granules aided in identifying the initial steps of spermiogenesis, whereas nuclear morphological changes facilitated the identification of subsequent stages. Eleven steps of spermiogenesis and nine stages of seminiferous epithelium were recognized in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> testis. Three spermatogonial types, namely, spermatogonial A, B and intermediate were identified in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> seminiferous epithelium. Spermatogonial A and preleptotene spermatocytes had the largest (P[*][*] 0. 05) differences were found among birds in spermatogonial A and intermediate spermatogonial nuclei diameters. Spermatogonial B, preleptotene primary spermatocyte, type I spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte in prophase I), and round spermatid nuclei diameters were, however, bigger (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in some birds than others. The classification of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was similar to that described in other birds and mammals...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{line with}} the Gifu University's {{initiative}} to map the Japanese quail genome, a total of 100 Japanese quail microsatellite markers isolated in our laboratory were evaluated in a population of 20 unrelated quails randomly sampled from a colony of wild quail origin. Ninety-eight markers were polymorphic {{with an average of}} 3. 7 alleles per locus and a mean heterozygosity of 0. 423. To determine the utility of these markers for comparative genome mapping in Phasianidae, cross-species amplification of all the markers was tested with chicken and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> DNA. Amplification products similar in size to the orthologous loci in quail were observed in 42 loci in chicken and 20 loci in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> Of the cross-reactive markers, 57. 1 % in chicken and 55. 0 % in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> were polymorphic when tested in 20 birds from their respective populations. Five of 15  markers that could cross-amplify Japanese quail, chicken, and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> DNA were polymorphic in all three species. Amplification of orthologous loci was confirmed by sequencing 10 loci each from chicken and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> and comparing with them the corresponding quail sequence. The microsatellite markers reported would serve as a useful resource base for genetic mapping in quail and comparative mapping in Phasianidae...|$|R
