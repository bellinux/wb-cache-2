50|$|The {{operating}} principle of a <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{is based on}} separation via buoyancy. Naturally, a component with a higher density would fall {{to the bottom of}} a mixture, while the less dense component would be suspended above it. A <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> increases the rate of settling through the use of continuous rotation, producing a force equivalent to between 1000 and 4000 G's. This reduces the settling time of the components by a large magnitude, whereby mixtures previously having to take hours to settle can be settled {{in a matter of seconds}} using a <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> This form of separation enables more rapid and controllable results.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{important}} design heuristics to be considered when employing <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> is {{the scale of the}} process. <b>Decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> should ideally be used in large scale processes. This is to optimise economic value, since smaller scale processes do not necessarily require such costly equipment to attain the desired product.|$|R
50|$|The main {{application}} of <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> is to separate {{large amounts of}} solids from liquids on a continuous basis. They are also used to wash and dry various solids in industry, such as polystyrene beads, clarify liquids and concentrate solids. Table 1.0 displays various examples of the utilisation of <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> in various industries.|$|R
50|$|The rapid {{development}} of the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> over the 20th century saw it expand into a vast range of over 100 industrial applications. Further development since then has seen the refinement of machine design and control methods, improving its overall performance, which allows the system to respond quickly to varying feed conditions. The newest development in <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> technology aims to achieve enhanced control of the separation process occurring inside the decanter. The way in which manufacturers aim to address this is by utilising variable mechanical devices in the rotating part of the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> To control the separation process, the operational parameters should be transferred from the rotating part to the stationary part of the decanter whilst also constantly controlling and maintaining the mechanical device inside the process region. This can be achieved using hydraulic and electronic transfer systems. A hydraulic drive motor is easily able to access the rotating area of the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{centrifuge}} is a device, {{which employs}} a high rotational speed to separate components of different densities. This becomes relevant {{in the majority}} of industrial jobs where solids, liquids and gases are merged into a single mixture and the separation of these different phases is necessary. A <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> separates solid materials from liquids in slurry and therefore {{plays an important role in}} wastewater treatment, chemical, oil and food processing industries. There are several factors that affect the performance of a <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> and some design heuristics to be followed which are dependent upon given applications. In oil well drilling fluid process, <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> is the 5th purification equipment in whole mud system.|$|E
50|$|Generally the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{has more}} {{advantages}} than disadvantages; however {{there are some}} limitations {{when compared to other}} processes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> have a clean {{appearance}} and {{have little to}} no odour problems.|$|R
50|$|The main {{types of}} <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> are the {{vertical}} orientation, horizontal orientation and Conveyor/Scroll.|$|R
50|$|<b>Decanter</b> <b>centrifuges,</b> {{in which}} there is no {{physical}} separation between the solid and liquid phase, rather an accelerated settling due to centrifugal acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{has reduced}} labour costs {{compared}} to other processes, as it requires low continuous maintenance and operator attention.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{at which}} {{sedimentation}} occurs is an important characteristic of the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> separation process. The sedimentation rate {{is influenced by the}} particle size, the shapes of the particles, their differential densities and the viscosity between the particles and the liquid. This process characteristic can be improved by utilizing flocculating agents. The sedimentation rate is also dependent on the separating factor of the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> which is related to the centrifugal force.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{is usually}} {{available}} in two arrangements, vertical and horizontal. This centrifuge {{is suitable for}} treating suspension including very high content of solids(40-60%) which makes this process much more applicable in many applications than peeler centrifuge. <b>Decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> is widely used also because {{of its ability to}} separate solids from liquid mixtures, also its decanting action can used to separate two immiscible liquids in feed with necessary baffles and outlets while continuously discharging bulky sludge.|$|E
50|$|In {{conveyor}} <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> {{the conveyor}} or scroll fits inside a rotating bowl and carries the solids settled against the wall, pushing them across a beach towards the underflow where the solids discharge. The conveyor allows {{for an increase}} in separation efficiency and feed capacity.|$|R
50|$|By 1988 Krauss-Maffei, Munich, was {{the main}} shareholder, owning 90% of Flottweg. In 1989, under license agreement, the Krauss-Maffei product line of <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> was {{procured}} by Flottweg. In the same year, Flottweg opened new sales and service offices in France and Russia, {{and in the next}} few years sales and service centers in Düsseldorf and Leipzig, Germany were opened.|$|R
50|$|Flottweg SE is a {{manufacturer}} of machines and systems for mechanical liquid-solid separation. The headquarters is located in Vilsbiburg (Bavaria), Germany. The company develops and produces <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges,</b> separators and belt presses. Flottweg has subsidiaries and branch offices with service centers in the United States (Flottweg Separation Technology, Inc.), People´s Republic of China, Russia, Italy, Poland, France, Australia and Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Compared to some {{competitive}} process such as {{the belt}} filter process, the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> has more process flexibility {{and higher levels of}} performance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> {{has high}} {{equipment}} capital costs. Hard surfacing and abrasion protection materials {{are required for}} the scroll to reduce wear and therefore reduce {{the maintenance of the}} scroll wear.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> cannot {{separate}} biological solids {{with very}} small density differences, such as cells and viruses. A competitive {{process that is}} capable of separating these difficult-to-separate solids is the tubular-bowl centrifuge.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Flottweg {{produces}} <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges,</b> {{which are}} used for continuous separation of solids from liquids, clarification of liquids, and classification of fine pigments. These are used to separate municipal and industrial wastewaters , {{in the manufacture of}} plastics, in extraction and processing of animal and vegetable raw materials, pclarification of drinks, in the mining and processing industry, and in the processing of biofuels.|$|R
30|$|Solid/liquid {{separation}} of organic slurries {{is achieved by}} screw press separators and/or <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges.</b> <b>Decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> achieve high efficiencies of solid and phosphorus {{separation of}} about 60 – 90 % for slurries and biogas digestate (Balsari et al. 2006; Lukehurst et al. 2010). According to Lukehurst et al. (2010), separation efficiency for both total solids and nutrients can be improved {{with the use of}} stable polymeric flocculants during the centrifugal process. Further treatment of the liquid phase after solid/liquid separation is mostly carried out as a process combination of a micro- or ultrafiltration step (MF, UF) followed by a reverse osmosis step (RO). In Germany, required water specifications for water discharge from biogas plants depend on the quality of receiving water bodies and are defined by the appropriate environmental agency. The requirements for effluents from wastewater treatment plants (size 5) are limited to, i.a., chemical oxygen demand[*]<[*] 75  mg L− 1, total nitrogen concentration[*]<[*] 13  mg L− 1, and phosphorus concentration[*]<[*] 1  mg L− 1 (AbwV 2005).|$|R
50|$|The Company {{established}} a broad line of centrifugal and filtration equipment for liquid/solids separation in 1932. The significant development was the patented {{design of the}} first planetary gear unit applied to centrifugal equipment. This patent was issued in June, 1934 and formed {{the foundation for the}} design utilized in the BIRD Solid Bowl and Screen Bowl Centrifuges and {{paved the way for the}} development and application of <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> into the process industry.|$|R
50|$|The {{objectives}} of post-treatment vary between different industries where {{in order to}} perform an efficient and economical process; the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> must be tailored to the task at hand. In the food manufacturing industry, decanter centrifuges are utilised in oil extraction machines. An oil extraction machine can process up to fifteen metric tonnes per hour of organic wastes and are found either within the process plant or outdoors if designed for the climate. The waste material enters the inlet chute and is softened into a sludge which is then steam heated. This mixture then enters a three-phase <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge,</b> {{also known as a}} tricanter centrifuge.|$|E
50|$|The {{separation}} {{process in a}} <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> relies on a few process characteristics such as centrifugal force or G-force, sedimentation rate and separating factor, differential speed between the conveyor and bowl, and clarity of the liquid discharge.|$|E
50|$|The beach angle at the conical {{section of}} a <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> is a design heuristic, which {{must also be taken}} into consideration. The {{slippage}} force acting on solids {{in the direction of the}} liquid pool increases by a large magnitude when solids exit the pool onto the beach. A <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> possessing a small cone angle is able to produce a lower slippage force compared to a large cone angle. A low cone angle is beneficial when solids do not compact properly and possess a soft texture. Additionally, low cone angles result in a lower wear rate on the scroll and are beneficial when being used with very compact solids requiring a large magnitude of torque to move.|$|E
40|$|Industrial <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{industries}} to separate mixtures of solids and liquids. One of the main elements of these devices is the feed accelerator, which accelerates the incoming mixture to the high rotational speed required for separation. A well-designed feed accelerator can increase product throughput, solids recovery, and liquid clarity, while a poorly designed accelerator can increase wear and reduce the overall efficiency of the machine. This article presents experimental and computational quantification of the performance of six feed accelerator designs that are currently used in <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges.</b> The experimental method allowed for the measurement of accelerator and pool speed efficiencies, and high-speed photography of the flow in the annular space between the accelerator and the rotating pool. The computational model allowed for prediction of the flow path in the annular space and the torque imparted on the fluid by the accelerator. A parametric study was conducted using the aforementioned computational model for drum and disk accelerators. It was found that several of the accelerator design parameters were critical to the overall performance, reinforcing the need for an optimised design. It was found that increasing the surface area of the port faces of the drum accelerator and increasing the discharge angle and discharge radius for the disk accelerator improved the performance of the accelerators...|$|R
50|$|A tricanter {{centrifuge}} {{operates on}} a similar principle to <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges,</b> but instead separates three phases, consisting of a suspended solids phase and two immiscible liquids. Sedimentation of the suspended solids occurs as normal where they accumulate {{on the wall of}} the bowl and are conveyed out of the centrifuge. The two liquid phases are separated using a dual discharge system where the lighter liquid phase such as oil, is separated over a ring dam via gravity, and water, which is commonly the heavier liquid phase, is discharged using a stationary impeller under pressure. Each of the three components, solid, oil and water, are distributed to different storage tanks.|$|R
5000|$|In {{horizontal}} <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges,</b> {{as shown}} in figure 1, the rotating assembly is mounted horizontally with bearings on each end to a rigid frame, which provides a good sealing surface for high-pressure applications. The feed enters through one end of the bearings, while the gearbox is attached to the other end and is operated below critical speed. Capacities range up to 40000 lb of solids per hour with liquid feed rates of up to 300 gal per minute. The horizontal machine is arranged in a way that slurry can be introduced at the centre of a rotating horizontal cylindrical bowl. The scroll discharge screw forces the solids to one end of the bowl as it is collected on the walls. This orientation is the most common design implemented in industry.|$|R
50|$|After malaxation is complete, {{the paste}} {{is sent to}} a phase separator. Nearly all {{producers}} use a <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> for this process. Traditionally the olive oil was separated from the paste using a large press that was either screwed down or weighted with rocks.|$|E
50|$|Another design {{heuristic}} to {{be considered}} is the length to diameter ratio of the <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge.</b> A length to diameter ratio of 2, 3 and 4 are commonly used. Decanter centrifuges with the same diameter but longer length would have a higher capacity for conveying solids and attain a larger suspension volume, which would enhance the settling out of fine solids.|$|E
50|$|Decanter {{centrifuges}} {{require a}} centrifugal {{force for the}} separation of the solids from the liquid. This characteristic is dependent on the radius of the centrifuge and its angular rotational speed. A <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuge</b> applies a force equivalent to several thousand gees, which reduces the settling time of the particles. It is also favoured to maintain a large G-force, which will result in an improved separation.|$|E
5000|$|In crude {{olive oil}} production, the {{traditional}} system, i.e. pressing, and the three-phase system produce a press cake and {{a considerable amount}} of waste water while the two-phase system, which is mainly used in Spain, produces a paste-like waste called [...] "alperujo" [...] or [...] "two-phase pomace" [...] that has a higher water content and is more difficult to treat than traditional solid waste. The water content of the press cake, composed of crude olive cake, pomace and husk, is about 30 percent if it is produced by traditional pressing technology and about 45-50 percent using <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges.</b> The press cake still has some oil that is normally recovered in a separate installation. The exhausted olive cake is incinerated or used as a soil conditioner in olive groves.|$|R
40|$|THE HIGH {{moisture}} content of mill mud (typically 75 – 80 % for Australian factories) results in high transportation {{costs for the}} redistribution of mud onto cane farms. The high transportation cost relative to the nutrient value of the mill mud results in many milling companies subsidising {{the cost of this}} recycle to ensure a wide distribution across the cane supply area. An average mill would generate about 100 000 t of mud (at 75 % moisture) in a crushing season. The development of mud processing facilities that will produce a low moisture mud that can be effectively incorporated into cane land with existing or modified spreading equipment will improve the cost efficiency of mud redistribution to farms; provide an economical fertiliser alternative to more farms in the supply area; and reduce the potential for adverse environmental impacts from farms. A research investigation assessing solid bowl <b>decanter</b> <b>centrifuges</b> to produce low moisture mud with low residual pol was undertaken and the results compared to the performance of existing rotary vacuum filters in factory trials. The decanters were operated on filter mud feed in parallel with the rotary vacuum filters to allo...|$|R
40|$|In this work, solvent {{recovery}} from aqueous CSSX process raffinate effluent {{was tested using}} the process diluent (Isopar{reg_sign}L). A model was developed to obtain stage efficiency for the diluent contact stages. The model was used to fit experimental data from a 19. 8 -hr {{solvent recovery}} test. Diluent-in-aqueous entrainment was measured during the test. Vacuum distillation was used to concentrate the solvent components, BOBCalixC 6 and modifier, in the diluent used in solvent recovery. Using the results, a feasibility study was performed to compare the annual cost of lost solvent under each of four solvent recovery options. These options were <b>decanter</b> tank, <b>centrifuge,</b> two-stage diluent contact using centrifugal contactor, and no solvent recovery action...|$|R
