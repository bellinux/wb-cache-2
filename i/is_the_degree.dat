25|$|Perceived {{organizational}} support (POS) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> {{to which}} employees {{believe that their}} organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being and fulfills socioemotional needs. POS is generally {{thought to be the}} organization's contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to reciprocate received rewards and favorable treatment. This idea bloomed from Eisenberger and Rhoades' organizational support theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{equation}} of the tangents at a singular point {{is given by}} the nonzero homogeneous part of lowest degree in the Taylor series of the polynomial at the singular point. When one changes the coordinates to put the singular point at the origin, the {{equation of}} the tangents at the singular point is thus the nonzero homogeneous part of lowest degree of the polynomial, and the multiplicity of the singular point <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of this homogeneous part.|$|E

25|$|Immersed plane curves have a {{well-defined}} turning number, {{which can be}} defined as the total curvature divided by 2π. This is invariant under regular homotopy, by the Whitney–Graustein theorem – topologically, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of the Gauss map, or equivalently the winding number of the unit tangent (which does not vanish) about the origin. Further, this is a complete set of invariants – any two plane curves with the same turning number are regular homotopic.|$|E
25|$|An {{especially}} difficult problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> to which any one society is an actual society or {{is simply an}} honorary designation. Phi Beta Kappa, for example, was a true secret society, until after its secrets were divulged, the society continued on. It claims today to still be an actual society that has meetings, conducts its affairs, and is a living social entity, however membership for most members consists of one evening's initiation, and no more, which would make the society completely an honorary one in most people's eyes.|$|E
25|$|The North-West Yoruba dialects {{show more}} {{linguistic}} innovation than the Southeast and Central dialects. This, {{combined with the}} fact that the latter areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date for migration into Northwestern Yorubaland. According to the Kay Williamson Scale, the following <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of relationship between Itsekiri and other Yoruboid dialects, using a compiled word list of the most common words. A similarity of 100% would mean a total overlap of two dialects, while a similarity of 0 would mean two speech areas that have absolutely no relationship.|$|E

25|$|Foreign {{investment}} in the Cuban tourism sector has increased steadily since the tourism drive. This has been made possible due to constitutional changes to Cuba's socialist command economy, {{to allow for the}} recognition of foreign held capital. By the late 1990s, twenty five joint foreign and domestic venture companies were working within Cuba's tourist industry. Foreign investors and hoteliers from market based economies have found that Cuba's centralized economy and bureaucracy has created particular staffing issues and higher costs than normal. An additional factor cited by foreign investors <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of state involvement at the executive level, which is far higher than average.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the wall <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of control it would have provided over immigration, smuggling and customs. Limites did not strictly mark the boundaries of the empire: Roman power and influence often extended beyond the walls. People within and beyond the limes travelled through it each day when conducting business, and organised check-points like those offered by Hadrian's Wall provided good opportunities for taxation. With watch towers only a short distance from gateways in the limes, patrolling legionaries could have kept track of entering and exiting natives and Roman citizens alike, charging customs dues and checking for smuggling. Another theory is of a simpler varietythat Hadrian's Wall was partly constructed to reflect the power of Rome and was used as a political point by Hadrian. Once its construction was finished, it is thought to have been covered in plaster and then whitewashed: its shining surface reflected the sunlight and was visible for miles around.|$|E
25|$|The {{color pattern}} is highly variable, {{including}} a ground color {{that may be}} olive, brown, tan, gray, yellow, or (rarely) rusty. The body markings are highly variable, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> of contrast: in some specimens the pattern is very well defined, while in others it may be virtually absent. In general, however, the body pattern consists {{of a series of}} dorsolateral blotches, rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, which extend from the first scale row {{to the middle of the}} back. These blotches may oppose or alternate across the midline, often fusing to form bands. They also have pale borders, which in some cases may be prominent, and may be invaded from below by tan or gray pigment, occasionally dividing them into pairs of ventrolateral spots. The belly may be white, cream or yellowish gray, with an increasing amount of gray to black mottling posteriorly that may fade again under the tail. The head usually does not have any markings other than a moderately wide postocular stripe that runs from behind the eye back to the angle of the mouth. The iris is gold or bronze, with varying amounts of black reticulation, while the tongue is black.|$|E
