5|$|Most notable part of Ninja Gaiden, which {{certainly}} made it famous, was its unforgiving, challenging difficulty, especially with very steep platforms, enemies that respawn upon dying {{unless they are}} close enough, aerial enemies and complicated platforming sections, all combined, make Ninja Gaiden {{one of the hardest}} games on the NES, and its difficulty setting <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> both praise and criticism.|$|E
5|$|Progress M1-5, {{which had}} {{originally}} been built to resupply and refuel either Mir or the International Space Station, was selected to perform the deorbit manoeuvre. Its mission <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the nickname Hearse. It was a Progress-M1 11F615A55 spacecraft, with the serial number 254. An uninhabited area of the southern Pacific Ocean was selected for the station to be deorbited into, as had been done with five earlier Salyut spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|All {{the scoring}} {{in the game}} came via five field goals, and Wake Forest's kicker, Sam Swank, was named the game's most {{valuable}} player. By virtue of its victory, Wake Forest earned its first ACC football championship since 1970 and was awarded a bid to the 2007 Orange Bowl. Georgia Tech's loss and second-place ACC finish <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> {{a position in the}} 2007 Gator Bowl. Following the conclusion of each team's bowl game, numerous players from both teams were selected in the 2007 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.|$|E
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E

5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E
5|$|Farsari sold many {{of these}} {{photograph}} albums, particularly to foreign residents and visitors. He employed excellent artists who each produced high-quality work at a pace {{of two or three}} hand-coloured prints per day. Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used. Accordingly, his work was expensive, yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan, even receiving a glowing reference by Rudyard Kipling following his 1889 visit to Yokohama. That same year, Farsari presented a deluxe photograph album to the King of Italy. By the 1890s, the studio's high reputation <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> exclusive rights to photograph the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the 1999 BCS {{national}} championship {{and brought the}} Seminoles' season to an end with an undefeated 120 record. By beginning the season at No.1 and ending {{it in the same}} position, Florida State became the first college football team to stay ranked No.1 for every week of the season after being ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll. Virginia Tech's loss brought it to a final record of 111, but the Hokies still completed their first 11-win season in school history. The 75total points scored in the 2000 Sugar Bowl were a Sugar Bowl record at that point in the game's history.|$|E

5|$|It {{served as}} {{the capital city of}} the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399 until 1956. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum in the 1760s and 70s when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. The Wodeyars were patrons of art and culture and contributed {{significantly}} to the cultural growth {{of the city and the}} state. The cultural ambiance and achievements of Mysore <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the sobriquet Cultural Capital of Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, and {{lived up to}} the ranking in its first game of the season. On September 7, Nebraska {{overwhelmed}} the Michigan State Spartans, 5514. After an off week, however, Nebraska fans were shocked by one of the first big national upsets of the season as Nebraska was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State, 190. The loss dropped Nebraska to No. 8 in the rankings, but as the season wore on, Nebraska rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games. Nebraska's 101 record to that point <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> a trip to the first-ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri, against the Texas Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike's {{choice of}} {{programming}} <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> a negative reputation, and Towne Cinema {{was unable to}} run the Klondike profitably. The company sought buyers for the theatre as early as 1976, asking $600,000. But, despite all of the theatre's problems under Towne Cinema, {{it is unlikely that}} it would have been returned to its original use without the money they poured into its renovation. Their efforts to restore the building are a significant reason why the Princess is a cinema today.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} {{quarters}} of the game were characterized by defense and penalties that stifled both teams' offenses. In the second half, Florida State took advantage of a punt return for a touchdown to begin a third-quarter surge. Although Virginia Tech made a late-game comeback, Florida State ran out the clock and secured a 2722 victory. Florida State's win <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the 2005 ACC Championship and a bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl against Penn State. Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the 2006 Gator Bowl against Louisville. Following that game, Tech quarterback Marcus Vick {{was released from the}} team due to repeated violations of team rules and several legal infractions.|$|E
5|$|The park's {{land was}} once home to Native Americans, {{followed}} by settlers who cleared the forests for subsistence farming and later built sawmills. The second growth forests in and surrounding Worlds End State Park are partially {{a result of}} the efforts of the young men of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. They helped overcome the clearcutting of the early 20th century, and built many of the park's facilities, including the cabins that <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> a place on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Though its offense {{performed}} well, it was Virginia Tech's {{special teams}} and defense that <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the win. Duane Brown's twin blocked kicks {{were the first}} blocks recorded in ACC Championship Game history and were the 116th and 117th blocked kicks recorded at Virginia Tech under head coach Frank Beamer. In addition to the blocks, Tech special teams excelled on punts and kickoffs. Tech punter Brent Bowden finished the day with seven punts {{for a total of}} 324yards. A 54-yard kick in the first quarter was the fourth-longest punt in ACC Championship Game history.|$|E

5|$|Urnula craterium is {{a species}} of cup fungus in the family Sarcosomataceae. It is {{parasitic}} on oak and various other hardwood species; it is also saprobic, as the fruit bodies develop on dead wood after it has fallen to the ground. Appearing in early spring, its distinctive goblet-shaped and dark-colored fruit bodies have <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> the common names devil's urn and the gray urn. The distribution of U.craterium includes eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. It produces bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of other fungi. The asexual (imperfect), or conidial stage of U.craterium is a plant pathogen known as Conoplea globosa, which causes a canker disease of oak and several other hardwood tree species.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five African Americans {{earned the}} Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, {{including}} seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen {{soldiers of the}} United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen African American men earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake {{was the first to}} actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of Honor to be awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he <b>earned</b> <b>it.</b> Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{its release}} on December 19, 1997, Titanic {{achieved}} critical and commercial success.

With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, Titanic was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's Avatar surpassed it in 2010. A 3D version of Titanic, released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, <b>earned</b> <b>it</b> an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing the film's worldwide total to $2.18 billion.
