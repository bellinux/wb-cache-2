40|$|This paper reports new geochronological and {{metamorphic}} {{data from}} Onverwacht Group greenstone remnants exposed in the granitoid-dominated terrain {{to the south}} of the Barberton greenstone belt. The greenstone remnants consist of metamorphosed mafic and ultramafic metavolcanic sequences, with minor sedimentary units that comprise thin chert and banded iron formation layers, interbanded with the (ultra) mafic volcanic units, as well as an up to 8 m-thick clastic sedimentary unit that contains well-preserved primary sedimentary features such as trough cross-bedding. Coarse-grained portions of the clastic sediments contain up to 4. 5 wt. % K 2 O and represent metamorphosed impure arkoses. SHRIMP and conventional U-Pb dating of detrital zircons reveal dates ranging between ca. 3521 and 3540 Ma, indicating that at least two protoliths for these sediments predate the formation of the bulk of the Barberton greenstone belt. A minimum age of 3431 ± 11 Ma for the formation of the metasediments is given by a trondhjemite gneiss that intrudes the greenstone remnant. Thus, these metasediments were deposited between ca. 3521 and 3431 Ma, contemporaneously with the erosion of spacially associated older, and presumably potassium-rich, granitoid rocks. Other portions of the clastic metasediments have a mafic affinity and are characterised by the peak-metamorphic mineral assemblage diopside + andesine + garnet + quartz. This assemblage, and garnet in particular, is extensively replaced by epidote. Peak-metamorphic mineral assemblages of magnesio - hornblende + andesine + quartz, and quartz + ferrosilite + magnetite + <b>grunerite</b> have been recorded from adjacent amphibolites and interlayered iron formation units, respectively. In these rocks, retrogression is marked by actinolitic rims around peak metamorphic magnesio-hornblende cores in the metamafic rocks, and by a second generation of <b>grunerite</b> that occurs as fibrous aggregates rimming orthopyroxene in the iron formation. PT calculations, using a variety of geothermometers and barometers, for the peak-metamorphic mineral assemblages in all these rock types vary between 650 and 700 °C and 8 and 11 kbar.

40|$|Summary. A {{hypothesis}} {{has previously}} been advanced {{to account for the}} termi-nation of the dehydrogenation process for the oxidation of South African crocidolite: it was postulated that the presence ofmagnesium ions would block the electronic migration required for complete oxidation of iron(II) in the temperature range 400 ~ to 500 ~ C.

40|$|Summary. When amosite (fibrous <b>grunerite,</b> F%. sMgl. sSisO~(OH) ~), {{is heated}} in argon or nitrogen, {{physically}} combined water is lost up to 500 - 700 ~C.

Under dynamic heating conditions, part of the hydroxyl water is lost as hydrogen, with concurrent oxidation of the iron. At about 1000 ~ C the pyroxene is decomposed to olivine and cristobalite; at about 1100 ~ C melting begins. In oxygen or air, physically combined water is again lost below 500 - 700 ~ C. At 350 - 1200 ~C a sequence of overlapping dehydrogenation, oxygen absorption, and dehydroxylation reactions occurs, which {{gives rise to a}} broad exotherm on the d. t. a, curve. The main products (for static heating condi-tions) are an oxyamphibole at 350 - 800 ~ C, and a spinel, hematite, a pyroxene, and X-ray amorphous material at 800 - 1100 ~C. Silica crystallizes as cristobalite at 1100 - 1350 ~ C, and as tridymite at 1450 ~ C. Most of the products in either neutral or oxidizing atmospheres are formed topotactically.

G 1 and G 3 contain fine-grained biotite tonalite and biotite granodiorite microgranular enclaves, which are darker and richer in mafic minerals than the host granodiorites. The geological, mineralogical, geochemical and Sr, Nd and O isotopic data show that tonalitic and granodioritic enclaves and host G 1 are of I-type and were related predominantly by a fractional crystallization process. Least-square analysis of major elements and modelling of trace elements indicate that granodioritic enclaves and host G 1 could be derived from the tonalitic enclave magma by fractional crystallization of plagioclase, <b>grunerite,</b> biotite and ilmenite. Granodiorite G 2 is of hybrid origin. Most variation diagrams for granodioritic enclaves and host G 3 granodiorite and their biotites show linear trends. Modelling of major and trace elements of granodioritic enclaves indicate that they result from mixing of relatively primitive granodiorite magma with magma derived from crustal melting. Tonalitic enclaves correspond to globules of a more mafic relatively primitive magma. Granite G 4 has the most pronounced crustal signature and is of S-type...|$|E
40|$|Platinum-group {{minerals}} (PGMs) {{and native}} gold {{are reported in}} association with gersdorffite and nickeline from the Thompson mine, Thompson Nickel Belt, Manitoba. Four PGM-gold bearing ore types are distinguished {{on the basis of}} mineral assemblages and host rocks: (I) irarsite in massive Ni sulfide ore hosted by metapelite; (II) gold, sudburyite, testibiopalladite-antimonian michenerite, unnamed PGM, and merenskyite in As-rich Ni sulfide ore hosted by metapelite from the T- 1 mine; (III) gold with tellurides in As-rich Ni sulfide ore hosted by metapelite from the open pit; and (IV) gold, majakite, kotulskite, merenskyite, and michenerite in As-rich Ni sulfide ore hosted by pegmatite from the T- 1 mine. Native gold is argentian (Agdollarlcub 22 rcubdollar-Agdollarlcub 32 rcubdollar), and most Ag-rich in pegmatite-hosted samples. Testibiopalladite compositions straddle the previously inferred miscibility gap with michenerite. The unnamed PGM has a composition of (Pd,Ni) dollarlcub 0. 44 rcubdollar(Te,Sb) dollarlcub 0. 56 rcubdollar, and is distinctly anisotropic. Sporadic, minor amounts of PGEs are present in gersdorffite and nickeline.;All ore types are associated with a pervasive hydrothermal alteration event that post-dates the regional amphibolite facies metamorphism (presently constrained around 600 - 700 dollar∘dollarC and 6 - 7 kbar). The alteration assemblages include: (1) biotite, muscovite, chlorite, albite, calcite, siderite, allanite, quartz and sulfide (mainly pyrite, violarite and chalcopyrite) in metapelite; (2) secondary <b>grunerite</b> and ferropyrosmalite in silicate-facies banded iron formation; (3) serpentine, tremolite, chlorite, epidote-zoisite and prehnite in skarn; (4) Fe-rich talc, serpentine, chlorite, actinolite, and hisingerite in ultramafic rocks. Spinel in metapelite and ultramafic rocks has been modified by Cr-Zn-rich fluids, and the oscillatory zonation in its composition reflects fluctuation in fluid composition. The latest hydrothermal alteration is characterized by high Cl concentrations, indicated by Cl-bearing allanite and ferropyrosmalite (up to 5. 0 wt...|$|E
40|$|The Fe-rich gneisses from {{vicinity}} of Kokava nad Rimavicou (Central Slovakia) were studied by electron microprobe {{to resolve the}} origin of the iron ore bodies. Whole-rock chemistry of the ironstones shows the lack of CaO, MgO and partly elevated P 2 O 5 contents. This, together with the mineral assemblage of almandine + magnetite + <b>grunerite</b> + ilmenite + quartz + apatite + allanite + zircon + monazite suggests an origin by metamorphism of sedimentary protolith and disproves the older idea about the formation as a skarn. The Fe-Ti oxides thermometry suggests temperatures of 360 - 420 °C, and the average oxygen fugacity of Δlog fO 2 normalized to the FMαQ is + 0. 13. The reconstructed oxygen fugacity for temperatures 500 - 600 °C (amphibolite facies) yields an interval of c. + 1 to + 3 Δ log fO 2 (FMαQ). The presence of detrital zircons, and monazites dated in this study, reveals a participation of lithologies of the pan-African orogen. The source rocks of the Devonian ironstones sedimented probably as oolitic chamosite in lagoons. The dated detrital monazites cores (612 - 400 Ma) show an affinity to source rocks formed in northern peri-Gondwana due to rifting and opening of the Rheic Ocean and separation of Avalonia and Armorica microcontinents. The majority of monazite data from the rims of detrital grains and from unzoned metamorphic grains bear an evidence of Meso-Variscan metamorphism with ages clustering between 360 and 320 Ma (342 ± 4 Ma - weighted mean ± 2 σ). The younger population with elevated Th contents (18. 0 - 20. 5 wt. %) giving the ages of 310 - 240 Ma (279 ± 2 Ma - weighted mean) is connected with the collapse of Variscan orogen and/or the onset of the early Alpine continental rifting. The Alpine ages are very rare, but a few monazites and one Th-U-Si inclusion in quartz yielded Cretaceous ages (115 - 85 Ma) ...|$|E
