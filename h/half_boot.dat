6000|$|Hilary and {{his little}} bulldog entered Hound Street from its eastern end. It was a grey street of three-storied houses, all in one style of architecture. Nearly all their doors were open, and on the doorsteps babes and {{children}} were enjoying Easter holidays. They sat in apathy, varied by sudden little slaps and bursts of noise. Nearly all were dirty; some had whole <b>boots,</b> some <b>half</b> <b>boots,</b> {{and two or three}} had none.

60|$|The {{next move}} of Jeanne {{was to ask}} her unknown friend outside to send her a {{complete}} male costume, a large blue coat, a flannel waistcoat, a pair of <b>half</b> <b>boots,</b> and a tall, round-shaped hat, with a switch. The soldier presently pushed these commodities {{through the hole in}} the wall. The chaplain next asked her to write out all her story, but Sister Martha, her custodian, would not give her writing materials, and it did not apparently occur to her to bid the soldier bring fresh supplies. Cut off from the joys of literary composition, Jeanne arranged with her unknown friend to escape on June 8. First the handy soldier, having ample leisure, was to walk for days about 'the King's garden,' disguised as a waggoner, and carrying a whip. The use of this manoeuvre is not apparent, unless Jeanne, with her switch, was to be mistaken for the familiar presence of the carter.|$|R
60|$|A lad {{was at work}} near by, and {{wondering}} what new inmate the house had gained, the neglected guest waited {{to catch a glimpse}} of the unknown face. A slender boy, in a foreign-looking blouse of grey linen; a white collar lay over a ribbon at the throat, stout <b>half</b> <b>boots</b> covered a trim pair of feet, and a broad-brimmed hat flapped low on the forehead. Whistling softly he dug with active gestures; and, having made the necessary cavity, set a shrub, filled up the hole, trod it down scientifically, and then fell back to survey the success of his labors. But something was amiss, something had been forgotten, for suddenly up came the shrub, and seizing a wheelbarrow that stood near by, away rattled the boy round the corner out of sight. Moor smiled at his impetuosity, and awaited his return with interest, suspecting from appearances that this was some protégé of Mark's employed as a model as well as gardener's boy.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Touchwood, when {{surveyed}} more at leisure, was a short, stout, active man, who, though sixty {{years of age}} and upwards, retained in his sinews and frame the elasticity of an earlier period. His countenance expressed self-confidence, and something like a contempt for those who had neither seen nor endured so much as he had himself. His short black hair was mingled with grey, but not entirely whitened by it. His eyes were jet-black, deep-set, small, and sparkling, and contributed, with a short turned-up nose, to express an irritable and choleric habit. His complexion was burnt to a brick-colour by the vicissitudes of climate, to which it had been subjected; and his face, which at the distance of a yard or two seemed hale and smooth, appeared, when closely examined, to be seamed with a million of wrinkles, crossing each other in every direction possible, but as fine as if drawn by the point of a very small needle.[I-20] His dress was a blue coat and buff waistcoat, <b>half</b> <b>boots</b> remarkably well blacked, and a silk handkerchief tied with military precision. The only antiquated part of his dress was a cocked hat of equilateral dimensions, in the button-hole of which he wore a very small cockade. Mrs. Dods, accustomed to judge of persons by their first appearance, said, that in the three steps which he made from the door to the tea-table, she recognised, without the possibility of mistake, the gait of a person who was well to pass in the world; [...] "and that," [...] she added with a wink, [...] "is what we victuallers are seldom deceived in. If a gold-laced waistcoat has an empty pouch, the plain swan's-down will be the brawer of the twa." ...|$|R

[...] We left the mail at the P. O., had lunch at the hotel, and about 1.50 set out westward {{to the place of}} tryst. This was by a little {{shrunken}} brook in a deep channel of mud {{on the far side of}} which, in a thicket of low trees, all full of moths of shadow and butterflies of sun, we lay down to await her ladyship. Whiskey and water, then a sketch of the encampment for which we all posed to Belle, passed off the time until 3.30. Then I could hold on no longer. 30 minutes late. Had the secret oozed out? Were they arrested? I got my horse, crossed the brook again, and rode hard back to the Vaea cross roads, whence I was aware of white clothes glancing in the other long straight radius of the quadrant. [...] I turned at once to return to the place of tryst; but D. overtook me, and almost bore me down, shouting 'Ride, ride!' like a hero in a ballad. Lady Margaret and he were only come to shew the place; they returned, and the rest of our party, reinforced by Captain Leigh and Lady Jersey, set on for Malie. The delay was due to D.'s infinite precautions, leading them up lanes, by back ways, and then down again to the beach road a hundred yards further on.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 March 1881, her {{father-in-law}} Alexander II of Russia, aged 62, {{was killed by a}} bomb {{on the way back to}} the Winter Palace from a military parade.

[...] Alexander II died a few hours later. Although the people were not enamoured of the new emperor, they adored Russia's new empress. As Maria's contemporaries said of her: [...] "She is truly an empress." [...] She herself was not altogether pleased with her new status. In her diary she wrote, [...] "Our happiest and serenest times are now over. My peace and calm are gone, for now I will only ever be able to worry about Sasha." [...] Despite being haunted by her father-in-law's gruesome death and her anxiety over the safety of her husband, at Alexander II's funeral, she was at least afforded the comfort of the presence of her brother-in-law and favourite sister, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the latter of whom, despite her husband's reluctance and Queen Victoria's objections, stayed on in Russia with Maria for several weeks after the funeral.|$|R

In the second quarter, the Broncos scored on a TD pass from quarterback Kellen Moore to wide receiver Austin Pettis. Michael Choate ran in the two-point conversion. Billy Winn added to Boise States first half score by tackling running back LeGarrette Blount for a safety.

40|$|Toward {{the general}} goal of preventing, ankle {{injuries}} in snowboarding accidents, {{the objective of}} this project to develop a dynamic system model of a snowboarder and assess which model parameters, particularly those attributed to the boot, most strongly influenced ankle deflections during a forward fall. To satisfy this objective, a system model was created that included the rider, the boots, the snowboard, and the snow as components. Through dynamic simulations, peak ankle deflections were computed over realistic ranges of input parameter values for each of the model components. Defining sensitivity as the total change in peak ankle deflection over the range of a particular parameter studied, results indicated that the peak ankle deflec-tion was most sensitive to the boot stiffness. Although lower, the sensitivity of the peak ankle deflection to the snow model parameters was still significant, being roughly <b>half</b> of the <b>boot</b> sensitivity. Increases in both snow stiffness and snow damping caused higher ankle deflections. Variations in both snowboard stiffness and anthropometric parameters had little effect. Due to the strong dependence of ankle deflection on boot stiffness, the potential exists for mitigating the ankle injury problem through judicious design of the boot...|$|R
6000|$|It often happens, {{that the}} slave himself has neither the power nor {{the wish to}} be free.

The Carlovingian race bred up the Merovingi as beasts; and then assigned their unworthiness as the satisfactory reason for their dethronement. Alas! the human being is more easily weaned from the habit of commanding than from that of abject obedience. The slave loses his soul when he loses his master; even as the dog that has lost himself in the street, howls and whines till he has found the house again, where he had been kicked and cudgelled, and <b>half</b> starved to <b>boot.</b> As we, however, or our ancestors must have inoculated our fellow-creature with this wasting disease of the soul, it becomes our duty to cure him; and though we cannot immediately make him free, yet we can, and ought to, put him in the way of becoming so at some future time, if not in his own person, yet in that of his children.

Gently {{releasing}} himself, and bidding the girl stand back, he moved toward the unsightly heap. Gradually it disclosed a grotesque caricature of a human figure, but so maimed and doubled up that it seemed a stuffed and fallen scarecrow. As is common in men stricken suddenly down by accident in the fullness of life, the clothes asserted themselves before all else with a hideous ludicrousness, obliterating even the majesty of death in their helpless yet ironical incongruity. The garments seemed to have never fitted the wearer, but to have been assumed in ghastly jocularity,--a <b>boot</b> <b>half</b> off the swollen foot, a ripped waistcoat thrown over the shoulder, were like the properties of some low comedian. At first the body appeared to be headless; but as Brice cleared away the debris and lifted it, he saw with horror that the head was twisted under the shoulder, and swung helplessly from the dislocated neck. But that horror {{gave way to a}} more intense and thrilling emotion as he saw the face--although strangely free from laceration or disfigurement, and impurpled and distended into the simulation of a self-complacent smile--was a face he recognized!

5000|$|The Brumbies {{finished}} {{first in the}} Australian conference with ten wins, and third on the overall table. The Reds had also won ten games, but the Brumbies had a greater points difference. They faced the Cheetahs at home in Canberra in a semi-final qualifier, and survived a last-minute scare when Riaan Smit's conversion attempt - which if successful would have forced the match into extra-time - hit the upright, the final score 15-13. The Brumbies then travelled to Pretoria to face the Bulls at Loftus Versfeld in the semi-final. The Bulls had won 22 of their previous 24 games at Loftus, including all five finals.The Brumbies started well and led at half-time 16-11. But the Bulls were determined to keep their unblemished finals record at home intact, and worked their {{way back into the}} game to lead 23-19 with 14 minutes to go. Then Bulls captain Dewald Potgieter turned down three opportunities to score penalty goals, instead opting each time to go for a try, presumably to put the game beyond the Brumbies' reach. In the 78th minute, the Brumbies seized their chance when fly-half Matt Toomua made an incisive break and passed to Tevita Kuridrani who touched down to help give the Brumbies a 26-23 lead. There was still time for one last kick-off, but the Bulls lost possession, enabling the Brumbies to kick the ball into touch and celebrate a victory which White described as [...] "the greatest the Brumbies have ever had". The Brumbies then had to travel to Hamilton where they would have to face the Chiefs in the 2013 Super Rugby Final. The Brumbies had led the match 9-0 with 20 minutes gone, however a burst of penalties saw the Chiefs even the score by the 31st minute. A try late on in the first half by Christian Lealiifano saw the Brumbies lead 16-9 at half time. Early on in the second <b>half,</b> Lealiifano <b>booted</b> a further two penalties to reach their final score of 22, with Lealiifano having scored all the points. But two tries conceded at the 63rd and 67th minute by Liam Messam and Robbie Robinson saw the home side lead 24-22 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a strong attack by the Brumbies, the Chiefs defence remained strong and the match finished 27-22.|$|R
