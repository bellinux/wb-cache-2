5|$|Fildes' children's {{bedrooms}} {{were hung}} with wallpapers designed by Morris & Co. and Walter Crane. Under Fildes' the hallway was <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> crimson and gold, and after passing through crimson curtains a visitor ascended stairs lined with brass plates, paintings from the Italian Renaissance and tapestries.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially beige, later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at {{the tips of the}} rays. The mycelial layer has a beige brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E

5|$|The spores are smooth, {{narrowly}} fusiform (fuse-shaped), {{and measure}} 7–12 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 20–28 by 6–8µm and are hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and narrowly club-shaped, with many internal oil droplets. Cystidia are fusiform, sometimes with a rounded tip, and have dimensions of 30–50 by 9–12µm. Some {{are more or}} less hyaline, while others are <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> a golden pigment. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium, an arrangement in which the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 10–17µm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E
5|$|The mature {{mycelium}} {{consists of}} thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5–3.2µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched {{at an angle}} of about 45°, with a clamp {{at the base of}} the branch. They contain amorphous granules that appear refractive when viewed under phase contrast microscopy, and their walls are often <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled cystidia with refractive, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50–85 by 6.5–8.5µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.|$|E
40|$|Megalomma vesiculosum (Giant Feather Duster Worm) has {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from Persian Gulf (Iran, Kish Island). M. vesiculosum is a polychaete worm that reaches up to 12 cm in length. It has relatively few (about 50) tentacles, each with a large eyespot at the free end. It creates a long and tough tube, which is mostly <b>encrusted</b> untidily <b>with</b> large shell fragments and small stones...|$|R
50|$|The genus {{contains}} fungi {{that produce}} small tubular or cup-shaped cyphelloid fruit bodies.

Vehicles bearing [...] provisions of many sorts load and unload before the temporary [...] warehouses. Further off, on the open land, bodies of troops are at [...] field-drill. Other bodies of soldiers, half stripped and <b>encrusted</b> [...] <b>with</b> mud, are labouring as navvies in repairing the excavations.|$|R
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E

40|$|Encrusted {{cystitis}} is {{a severe}} chronic inflammatory {{disease of the}} bladder characterized by excessively alkaline urine and calcifications within the bladder wall. A case of a 60 year-old man affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which developed encrusted cystitis due to Corynebacterium urealyticum with E. coli coinfection, shows that the treatment of <b>encrusted</b> cystitis <b>with</b> a endoscopic debulking of the encrusted stones and an antimicrobial therapy specific for C. urealyticum often is not sufficient for the complete resolution of symptoms...|$|R

25|$|Just as some prey species evolved cryptic {{colouration}} {{and patterns}} to help avoid predators, some ambush predators evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The tassled scorpionfish is an ambush predator {{that looks like}} part of a sea floor <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by. Another ambush predator is the striated frogfish (right).

The first Count of Valenciana, Antonio de Obregón y Alcocer had the San Cayetano Church (also {{known as the}} La Valenciana Church) built near the entrance of this mine. Dedicated to Saint Cajetan, it was built between 1765 and 1788. The church has a Churrigueresque portal, which {{has been compared to}} the Mexico City Cathedral and the La Santisima Church, both in Mexico City.

25|$|Smaug was {{the last}} named dragon of Middle-earth. He was slain by Bard, a {{descendant}} of Girion, Lord of Dale. A deadly winged fire-breathing dragon, he was described as red-gold in colour and his underbelly was <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> many gemstones from the treasure-pile he commonly slept upon once he had taken control of Erebor (the Lonely Mountain). The Arkenstone was buried right in the pile he slept on, but Smaug never noticed it. Smaug had only a single weakness: there was {{a hole in his}} jewel encrusted underbelly on his left breast area. Bilbo Baggins discovered this, which led to Smaug's death above Esgaroth.|$|E
25|$|Southern Māori oral {{tradition}} tells of five successively arriving peoples {{and while the}} earliest, Kahui Tipua, appear to be fairy folk modern anthropological opinion is that nevertheless they represent historical people who have become <b>encrusted</b> <b>with</b> legend. Te Rapuwai were next {{and seemed to be}} succeeded by two Waitaha tribes but it has been suggested this was really one with 'Waitaha' also being used as a catchall name for all earlier peoples by some later arrivals. 'Te Rapuwai' may perhaps also have been used like this. Nevertheless, some middens, such as those on the peninsula, have been identified traditionally with Te Rapuwai. Anderson's later, or tribal Waitaha, arrived in the south in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1945 the {{destroyer}} , carrying two high speed motorboats equipped with chariots sailed from Venice for Genoa led by Captain Chavasse SOE and Forza.
