40|$|The Great American Interchange {{resulted}} in the mixing of faunistic groups with different origins and evolutionary trajectories that underwent rapid diversification in North and South America. As a result, groups of animals of recent arrival converged into similar habits and formed ecological guilds {{with some of the}} endemics. We present a reconstruction of the evolutionary events in Aspidoderidae, a family of nematodes that infect mammals that are part of this interchange, i. e., dasypodids, opossums, and sigmodontine, geomyid, and hystricognath rodents. By treating hosts as discrete states of character and using parsimony and Bayesian inferences to optimize these traits into the phylogeny of Aspidoderidae, we reconstructed <b>Dasypodidae</b> (<b>armadillos)</b> as the synapomorphic host for the family. In addition, 4 events of host switching were detected. One consisted of the switch from dasypodids to hystricognath rodents, and subsequently to geomyid rodents. The remaining set of events consisted of a switch from dasypodids to didelphid marsupials and then to sigmodontine rodents. The reconstruction of the ancestral distribution suggests 3 events of dispersal into the Nearctic. Two of these invasions would suggest that 2 different lineages of dasypodid parasites entered the Northern Hemisphere at different times, which is consistent with the presence of 2 lineages of armadillos in Mexico...|$|E
5000|$|They {{seek shelter}} {{in places that}} offer {{thermoregulation}} and protection from predators. Treefalls are a favored site, as are debris piles, burrows (especially those of the <b>armadillo</b> (<b>Dasypodidae</b> family) and agouti (Dasyprocta species)), hollow logs, holes, and heavy vegetation cover. They generally try to find tight-fitting resting places, and will occasionally 'wedge' themselves between roots and trunks but remain otherwise exposed. Burrows and holes are often flooded and the tortoises will rest {{in the water and}} mud with just their nostrils and eyes exposed. In warmer weather, they press up against moister, cooler surfaces in shelter areas. The tortoises show personal preferences with many individuals always seeking out a specific type of shelter.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIllegal {{hunting and}} fishing {{activities}} are of great relevance to conservation policies. Few studies with regional focus of the impacts of these activities in Brazil are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize illegal {{hunting and fishing}} on a national level by collecting data from the environmental police. We analyzed reports prepared by 16 states, all of them which contained a variety of information about seized species, and showed a lack of standardization of data collection and presentation. Illegal fish seizures were predominantly of Amazonian species. Illegal hunting seizures showed the most uniform territorial distribution. <b>Armadillos</b> (<b>Dasypodidae</b> family), pacas (Cuniculus paca), and capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) were the most frequently seized species, and numerous seizures of Brazilian guinea pig (Cavia aperea) were reported in northeastern Brazil. The reports provided by environmental military police have great informative power for conservation policies, but they must be standardized among states to improve the quality of data provided and analysis...|$|R
40|$|The feeding {{ecology of}} the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) was studied from 1998 to 2002 in the Ecological Station of Itirapina, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil, {{including}} estimates of prey number and biomass consumption. A total of 325 faecal samples was collected in the area. The species is omnivorous, with a broad diet including 68 species or morphospecies of fruits and animals. <b>Armadillos</b> (<b>Dasypodidae),</b> wolf's fruit (Solanum lycocarpum) and small mammals (mostly Clyomys bishopi) were {{the bulk of the}} diet, comprising 72. 8 % of the total estimated biomass consumed (185, 323. 4 g). In terms of frequency of occurrence, on the other hand, only small mammals and other miscella-neous fruits yielded 43. 4 % of the total occurrences (N = 1, 054). Animal prey ranging from 0. 01 and 0. 1 Kg were the most captured category, resulting in 44. 2 % of 507 captured animals. The maned wolf seems to be seasonally opportunistic, at least for fruits and insects, as indicated by the variation of the consumption of these items along the year. The higher consumption of fruits and animals characteristic of savannah can be an important factor to consider in future management plans for the species...|$|R
40|$|Subsequent to {{our initial}} {{reports of the}} {{discovery}} of Deseadan fossils in southern Perú, we have obtained new data regarding the paleontology and geology of the upper member of the Moquegua Formation. These data include newly recovered fossil specimens and further analyses of those collected in our earlier field seasons. We have also obtained an ash directly from within the fossil-bearing units near the summit of Cerro Pan de Azúcar. Biotites from this Sugarloaf ash give an age estimate of 26. 25 6 0. 10 Ma, thus supporting our previous suggestion that these fossil-bearing horizons are of late Oligocene age (Deseadan South American Land Mammal ‘‘Age’’) and removing our query regarding a possible early Miocene age. Most of the fossils are of notoungulates and most of these are trachytheriine mesotheriids. Remarkably, three distinct mesotheriid taxa appear to have been present in the Moquegua fauna, none of which are referable to the common Trachytherus alloxus of the nearby and at least partly contemporaneous Salla beds of Bolivia. Other fossils documented here include postcranial elements of the notohippid notoungulate, Moqueguahippus, a macraucheniid litoptern (cf. Coniopternium), an osteoderm of an unnamed species of <b>armadillo</b> (<b>Dasypodidae,</b> cf. Dasypodinae), and a claw of a phorusrhacid bird...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} investigating the feeding practices, body condition, and faecal consistency of 26 giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), 13 aardvarks (Orycteropus afer), and 31 <b>armadillos</b> (<b>Dasypodidae</b> spp.) from 20 zoological collections in the UK. For the latter two, scores for body condition (BCS, from 1 – emaciated – to 5 – grossly obese) and faeces (Faecal Score (FS) from 1 – solid – to 5 – diarrhoea-like) were applied. The majority of the UK collections offered a ‘complete’ feed for anteaters and aardvarks {{as opposed to the}} traditional ‘gruel’ diet. Armadillos were fed mixed diets of fruits, vegetables, eggs, dog or cat food, and various other items. Grossly obese individuals (BCS > 4) were only observed in two armadillo species. The average body mass recorded for giant anteaters was above values reported for wild animals, but {{this was not the case}} in aardvarks. Anteaters received on average 75 % of the amount of dry matter offered to aardvarks, although their basal metabolism is only 60 % that of aardvarks; hence, anteaters might have been offered more food than required. The FS for anteaters were higher than for aardvarks or armadillos. Dietary ash, acid detergent fibre and acid insoluble ash (AIA) levels did not correlate with either FS or faecal dry matter (DM). However, there were negative correlations between faecal ash and AIA content with faecal DM and FS, suggesting that measures increasing AIA intake above that achieved by current diets might beneficially influence FS. Only one anteater had a patent parasite infection; this animal had an FS of 5. Results of this survey will encourage careful monitoring of body mass and diet for giant anteaters and armadillos to avoid obesity. Further studies are needed to investigate the impact of higher levels of indigestible material in anteater diets on faecal consistency, growth, and body condition...|$|R
