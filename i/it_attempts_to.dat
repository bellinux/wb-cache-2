5|$|The {{finite element}} method is an {{important}} numerical method to solve partial differential equations, widely applied in simulating complex physical systems. <b>It</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> approximate the solution to some equation by piecewise linear functions, where the pieces are chosen {{with respect to a}} sufficiently fine grid, which in turn can be recast as a matrix equation.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. <b>It</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> crawl {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that <b>it</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E

5|$|PC Magazine {{found that}} the {{firewall}} put all ports in stealth mode. The firewall blocked ten of 12 leak tests, used to see if malware can evade the firewall's control of network traffic. Previous versions did not identify the tests because none carried a malicious payload. Another test was conducted using Core Impact, which successfully exploited one vulnerability on the test computer. However, other components of Norton stopped the exploit from causing harm. The other attempts were unsuccessful either because the system was invulnerable or Norton's Intrusion Prevention System stopped <b>it.</b> <b>Attempts</b> <b>to</b> disable the firewall were unsuccessful by PC Magazine. On the contrary, PC Pro identified 15 open ports on a computer with Norton installed.|$|E
5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if <b>it</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that, if one fully understood the concept of God, one must accept his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments as those that start from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, conclude with God's existence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the virtual}} {{intelligence}} {{is kept in}} lockdown in another research station, Archers tells Shepard that he/she needs to manually override security from two other facilities {{to gain access to}} it and shut it down. Once the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked, Shepards proceeds to the main server room. Shepard eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world, but in the process the virus infects Shepard's cybernetic implants. Shepard awakens in a virtual reality, and heads to the central core room, where he finds that Archer had experimented on David in an attempt to control the geth. Shepard manages to defeat the virtual intelligence as <b>it</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> establish an upload link to the Normandy. Afterwards, David is shown in the core tied up to tubes in his arms and mouth, begging for help. Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going. Shepard is then given the option to either take David to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother.|$|E

5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as <b>it</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> shoot {{a pair of}} flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
