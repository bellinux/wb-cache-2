The VECM reveals that economic growth is influenced by inflation, domestic <b>fixed</b> <b>transport</b> investments, and real exchange rate, yet on the BVAR model it was influenced by inflation, domestic <b>fixed</b> <b>transport</b> investments, multi factor productivity, real exchange rate and second period Gross Domestic Product. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-The {{operation}} of vertical <b>transport</b> <b>installations</b> {{are based on}} cable systems with electrical adjustable operation, which ensures the technical conditions regarding time variation in speed, the current in the main actuation engines and the acceleration during start-up and breaking. The actuation electrical systems {{are part of the}} category of the fast process of the automation equipment. For the vertical <b>transport</b> <b>installation</b> the size which has to be controlled from a command is the speed, the dependent factor being the tahogram. Adjusting determines the dependence of the sizes in the process, through a default law, both in relation to the independent sizes and in relation to the dependent ones from the process, assuring the reduction of the influence of harmful sizes to the process. The stability of an automatic system can be defined in different ways. We will consider stability of an automatic system, that feature which is that when it is subjected to the action of one harmful size of the moment the system will return in the end at the stationary phase. Thus, the Balance Survey also deals with the determination of variation functions in time of the current of the main actuation motor, of speed (main electrical actuation motor rpm) when starting the vertical <b>transport</b> <b>installation,</b> as well as the study in time of the variation of speed when applying loading shock.
