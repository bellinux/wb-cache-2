Prior research has generally neglected this important development in the Chinese stock market.

These effects are particularly pronounced after the non-tradable share reform. Furthermore, in the post-reform era, portfolios with high illiquidity (i. e. high relative bid-ask spread, high Amihud illiquidity, low Amivest liquidity ratio) significantly outperform portfolios with low illiquidity, controlling for size, and book-to-market effects...|$|E
40|$|When {{there are}} three parties, {{instability}} problems {{brought about by the}} emptiness of the core of the corresponding cooperative game may cause the Coase Theorem to fail, even when other more direct impediments to bargaining are low. We show that the standard Coasean bargaining game involving three parties is strategically equivalent to an asymmetric three-player majority game. Hence, when {{there are three}} parties, instability problems will cause the Coase Theorem to fail if and only if the core of the corresponding three-player majority game is empty. We use this equivalence result to derive all instances in which the Coase Theorem will and will not hold with three parties, and show that a priori, such instability problems are likely to be rare-the Coase Theorem will actually hold most (over 80 %) of the time. We also demonstrate that it is always possible to find a set of transaction costs which, when introduced into a frictionless bargaining situation, will cause an empty core to become non-empty. In other words, transaction costs can mitigate instability problems: situations exist in which the presence of transaction costs will cause the Coase Theorem to hold when, in the absence of those <b>direct</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, it would fail to hold. When there are three parties, rather than hindering agreements, the existence of <b>direct</b> <b>transaction</b> costs can sometimes-but not always-reduce instability and encourage Coasean bargaining.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the role of}} geographical proximity in an inter-firm transaction network {{and the role of}} hub firms on geographical spread of regional impact. By using inter-firm micro transaction data of over 800 thousands firms, we found that indirect transaction is geographically dispersed mainly due to a few hub firms, although firm’s direct transactions mostly occur within geographically narrow areas. More precisely, median distance between indirect transaction partners (partners ’ partners) is 255 km, which is much larger than that between <b>direct</b> <b>transaction</b> partners (29 km). In a counterfactual transaction network without hub firms, whose transaction relations are no less than 100, median distance between indirect transaction partners is reduced to 70 km, thereby suggesting the important role of hub firms in a geographical transaction network.

In addition to the application-specific functions that services provide (different) services may also support (different) sets of protocols and formats addressing extra-functional concerns such as transaction processing and reliable messaging. This raises the need for services to complement their functional service descriptions with descriptions of extra-functional capabilities, requirements, and/or preferences, which must be matched and enforced for service interactions. In this paper, we address the problem of transactional coordination in service-oriented computing. We argue for the use of declarative policy assertions to advertise and match support for different transaction styles (<b>direct</b> <b>transaction</b> processing, queued transaction processing, and compensation-based transaction processing), and introduce the concept of and system support for transaction coupling modes as the policybased contracts guiding transactional business process execution.

40|$|This study investigates {{economic}} consequences of individual investors' home bias and portfolio churning {{in their personal}} pension accounts. The empirical analysis is carried out within a Heckman style two-stage framework to account for selection bias with respect to individuals' investment activity, and to allow for an endogenously determined home bias, portfolio churning and performance. Results indicate that home bias induces a worse risk-adjusted performance. Home-biased individuals' relatively bad performance originates in insufficient risk-reduction, {{due to a lack}} of international diversification. A higher degree of portfolio churning also deteriorates performance, despite the fact that churning is not associated with any <b>direct</b> <b>transaction</b> costs. However, home-biased individuals do not churn portfolios as often as individuals with a larger share of international asset holdings, which diminishes the negative effects of home bias on performance. Overconfidence is driven by a return-chasing behavior, where overconfident individuals favor international assets with high historical returns. Individuals with actual skill are more often men than women, are not tempted by high historical returns, and use international assets for the right reason - diversification. home bias, individual investors, portfolio churning, performance,...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{theories}} of taxes, bankruptcy costs, transactions costs, adverse selection, and agency conflicts and the related evidence and identifies {{a number of important}} empirical stylized facts. The empirical literature supports a number of generalizations that appear to be robust and particularly important for an understanding of actual leverage. To draw attention to these key facts, this chapter highlights these generalizations using the label "stylized fact. " To understand the evidence, {{it is important to recognize}} the differences among private firms, small public firms, and large public firms. Private firms use retained earnings and bank debt heavily; small public firms make active use of equity financing; and large public firms primarily use retained earnings and corporate bonds. The available evidence can be interpreted in several ways. <b>Direct</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and indirect bankruptcy costs appear to play important roles in a firm's choice of debt. The relative importance of the other factors remains open to debate. No currently available model appears capable of simultaneously accounting for all of the stylized facts. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.
