In a eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, DnaK and DnaJ {{exist as a}} stable trigonal ring complex (TDnaK⋅J complex) and the dnaK gene cluster contains a clpB gene. When substrate proteins were heated at high temperature, none of the chaperones protected them from heat inactivation, but the TDnaK⋅J complex could suppress the aggregation of proteins in an ATP- and TGrpE-dependent manner. Subsequent incubation of these heated preparations at moderate temperature after addition of TClpB resulted in the efficient reactivation of the proteins. Reactivation was also observed, even though the yield was low, if the substrate protein alone was heated and incubated at moderate temperature with the TDnaK⋅J complex, TGrpE, TClpB, and ATP. Thus, all these components were necessary for the reactivation. Further, we found that TGroEL/ES could not substitute TClpB...|$|R

Here, we report that an immunologically silent tumor determinant can be rendered immunogenic if linked with a dominant determinant of a parasite antigen, suggesting the existence of <b>functional</b> Th–Th <b>cooperation</b> in vivo. This phenomenon could be mimicked in part by signaling either through CD 40 to the antigen-presenting cells or through OX 40 to the tumor-determinant reactive T cells, with maximal effects obtained by combined anti-CD 40 and anti-OX 40 treatment in vivo. The data suggest that CD 4 T cells reactive with a dominant determinant provide help to other CD 4 T cells through up-regulating the costimulatory ability of antigen-presenting cells, {{in much the same way}} as help for CD 8 cells.

40|$|Quorum-sensing (QS) allows {{bacterial}} {{communication to}} coordinate the production of extracellular products essential for population fitness at higher cell densities. It has been generally accepted that a significant time duration is required to reach appropriate cell density to activate the relevant quiescent genes encoding these costly but beneficial public goods. Which regulatory genes are involved and how these genes control bacterial communication at the early phases are largely un-explored. By determining time-dependent expression of QS-related genes of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aerugionsa, we show that the induction of social cooperation could be critically influenced by environmental factors to optimize the density of population. In particular, small regulatory RNAs (RsmY and RsmZ) serving as early responders, can promote the expression of dependent genes (e. g. lasR) to boost the synthesis of intracellular enzymes and coordinate instant cooperative behavior in bacterial cells. These early responders, acting as a rheostat to finely modulate bacterial cooperation, which may be quickly activated under environment threats, but peter off when critical QS dependent genes are fully <b>functional</b> for <b>cooperation.</b> Our findings suggest that RsmY and RsmZ critically control the timing and levels of public goods production, which may have implications in sociomicrobiology and infection control...|$|R
50|$|The {{proliferation}} of functional international organizations has occurred without adequate reorganization and coordination efforts {{due to a}} lack of central global governance to ensure accountability of such organizations. As a result, a pattern of decentralization could be observed among functional international organizations to the present day. For example, the League of Nations’ effort to coordinate functional international organizations in the field of social and economic cooperation through establishment of UN Economic and Social Council has been futile. As a result, the idea of decentralization prevails to the present day except in cases of special cooperative relationships between Economic and Social Council and some functional organizations. Subsequently, summits such as the World Summit for Social Development in 1995, The Millennium Summit in 2000 and World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 were held to address and coordinate <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation,</b> especially regarding the social and economic aspects.|$|E

50|$|The {{objective}} of functionalism towards global peace is achieved through <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{by the work}} of international organizations (including intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations). The activities of functional international organizations involve taking actions on practical and technical problems rather than those of military and political nature. They are also non-controversial politically and involve a common interest to solve international problems that could best be tackled in a transnational manner. According to David Mitrany, dealing with functional matters provides the actors in the international community the opportunity to successfully cooperate in a non-political context, which might otherwise be harder to achieve in a political context. Further development would lead to a process called “autonomous development” towards multiplication, expansion, and deepening of functional international organizations. Ideally, this would ultimately result in an international government. Functionalists in this manner assume that cooperation in a non-political context would bring international peace. Eradication of existent non-political, non-military global problems, which Functionalists consider to be the very origin of conflict within the global community, is what they aim to pursue. However, critics point out some limitations of functionalist assumption: 1. In practice, dealing with functional matters does not nessarily and always facilitate cooperation. 2. Its simplified assumption overlooks different causes of state conflict.|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} {{of separation of}} powers, as a basic {{principle of}} a real democratic political system,concerns that state activities, powers are separated {{by the fact that}} they take place separately, distinct fromone another, each with its specific, but in the social polical reality it can be seen that there are linksbetween public authorities in terms of organizational and <b>functional,</b> namely <b>cooperation</b> and mutualdeterminations. In terms of organization, the link is given by the fact that some state bodies involved in theformation of other, and the functional aspect concerns the connection of collaborations: theconstitutionality of laws passed by Parliament is controlled by the Constitutional Court or Governmentactivity can be examined by Parliament. The modern form of the principle of separation of powers requiresautonomous public authorities, sharing their incumbent functions, establishment of means of cooperationand mutual control, all in the ambience of a genuine and real autonomy.

40|$|AbstractTo {{identify}} the <b>functional</b> contributions of <b>cooperations</b> among transcription factors on regulatory DNA {{is critical for}} understanding transcription activation. But so far {{there is a great}} lack of effective identifying methods.

In this strategy, functional profiles of protein–MIEP association and RNA synthesis are achieved through comprehensively perturbing the association of p 65, CREB or AP- 1 with MIEP and then subjected to the computational model. Consequently, the ‘real’ cooperations contributing to MIEP activation are found to comprise five but not seven types of potential cooperations. Thus, our research provides a facile systematic approach to identifying the DNA-organized cooperations among transcription factors and understanding transcription activation...|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} of vessel diameter with the radius for all SDs {{in both the}} rubberwood clones {{in this study was}} supported by the findings of Syeed Saifulazry [30] and Norul Izani and Sahri [12]. Likewise, similar observations were recorded in some other tropical hardwoods [2, 5, 25]. This kind of pattern can be directly related to cambial age in temperate species and radial growth increment in tropical species. The decrease in vessel density specifies a strong decrease in the number of distally <b>functional</b> conduits, in <b>cooperation</b> with a narrower diameter. The core reason for the changing vessel size along the width of the stem can be related to the fact that the vessels are induced by the polar movement of auxin hormones produced in young leaves. The higher hormone concentrations induces fast cell differentiation; while low levels stimulate slow differentiation, which allows more time for cell development until secondary wall deposition, consequently resulting in wider vessels [27, 31].|$|R

40|$|With the European Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union (EU) {{intensified}} <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation</b> in a {{wide range}} of sectors. This contribution investigates whether this kind of transnational exchange can trigger subtle processes of democratization. It argues that third state officials become acquainted with democratic governance by participating in transgovernmental policy networks implementing <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation</b> between state administrations of established democracies and authoritarian regimes. In this vein, it enriches the governance model of democracy promotion by adding a new level, the micro-level of democratic socialization. Empirically, the argument is tested taking two Twinning projects that the EU has set up in Morocco, that is, the projects on competition policy and on the environment. The conclusion is that in some non-politicized policy fields, such as the environment, EU transgovernmental policy networks can successfully yield processes of democratic socialization in the context of a stable authoritarian regime, like that in Morocco...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to explore the {{mechanisms}} of democracy promotion employed by the EU in its relationships with Belarus. The mechanisms of democracy promotion employed by the EU were assessed from the perspectives of leverage, linkage and governance. Putting the governance mode under a special scrutiny the study seeks to prove that activities which are not directly aimed at democracy promotion can lead to a gradual transfer of democratic norms and values. Neo-functionalist theoretical approach is used to explain potential norm transfer through <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation</b> by way of technical and expert assistance on a local level of public authorities in a case study of Belarus. The empirical part of the thesis explores to what degree participation in joint projects within Cross-Border Cooperation the EU makes Belarusian public officials aquatinted with the norms of democratic governance. In so doing, realistic evaluation research method is utilized. The results of the research corroborate the assumption that in the light of failure of traditional top-down forms of democracy promotion, the EU has intensified <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation</b> with Belarus on the bottom-up level. Analysis of the attitudes of the Belarusian officials involved and not involved in joint projects with the EU shows that public officials who have international experience are more prone to the values and principles of democratic governance. Therefore, the main finding suggests that transnational networks created for the purposes of <b>functional</b> <b>cooperation</b> can serve as channels where agents from authoritarian regimes learn democratic values and, as a result, can change their attitude and even behavior towards a more democratic model...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe phagocytes of {{the innate}} immune system, macrophages and neutrophils, {{contribute}} to antibacterial defense, but their <b>functional</b> specialization and <b>cooperation</b> is unclear. Here, {{we report that}} three distinct phagocyte subsets play highly coordinated roles in bacterial urinary tract infection. Ly 6 C− macrophages acted as tissue-resident sentinels that attracted circulating neutrophils and Ly 6 C+ macrophages. Such Ly 6 C+ macrophages played a previously undescribed helper role: once recruited {{to the site of}} infection, they produced the cytokine TNF, which caused Ly 6 C− macrophages to secrete CXCL 2. This chemokine activated matrix metalloproteinase- 9 in neutrophils, allowing their entry into the uroepithelium to combat the bacteria. In summary, the sentinel macrophages elicit the powerful antibacterial functions of neutrophils only after confirmation by the helper macrophages, reminiscent of the licensing role of helper T cells in antiviral adaptive immunity. These findings identify helper macrophages and TNF as critical regulators in innate immunity against bacterial infections in epithelia...|$|R

Drawing on the multi-level governance approach, this paper argues that the EU’s macro-regional strategies affect (1) horizontal interplay between the EU and macro-regional institutions; (2) vertical interplay within macro-regions, in particular the involvement of subnational authorities and civil society; and (3) the relationship between EU member states and non-member states. The macro-regional policy process provides the European Commission with a central role in various phases of policy-making and implementation of macro-regional strategies. The paper discusses whether ‘macro-regionalisation’ leads to a new form of EU governance and demonstrates that macro-regional strategies change existing institutions because they co-opt non-EU institutions into EU policy-making; affect the implementation of existing legislation which can be stimulated by macro-regionalisation; and transform existing funding schemes since they require an alignment of project funding through Structural Funds...|$|R
