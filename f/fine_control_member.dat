40|$|A {{common problem}} facing roboticists is the {{creation}} of <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> actions for a robot that must be interspersed with a baseline motion. We define a <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> action to be one in which small errors can make the di#erence in {{the success or failure of}} the action. A baseline motion is one that is executed repeatedly over time, such as walking straight or remaining idle. We examine the considerations that can a#ect the success of a <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> action that transitions between baseline motions. We introduce a general technique for implementing a <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> action that transitions from and to a baseline motion using the example of pushing an elevator button. We implement this technique in the area of robotic soccer. Our results demonstrate that this technique can successfully create <b>fine</b> <b>controlled</b> actions for a robot...|$|R
