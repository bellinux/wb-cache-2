25|$|The first {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of eight NSB Class 9 steam locomotives for passenger train, three NSB Class 10 units for freight trains and two NSB Class 14 locos. Passenger cars were at first 60 compartment coaches. A commuter train service was introduced from Oslo to Ljan Station from 1883, allowing {{the areas of}} Nordstrand to opened up to large-scale housing. The railway allowed for faster postal services and the trains carried markers with the weather forecast, which was announced at the stations. A direct <b>international</b> <b>train</b> service was not introduced until 1 July 1886, when a direct service to Gothenburg and Hamburg was introduced. Travel time to Copenhagen was at this time twenty and a half hours. The following year sleeper cares were introduced.|$|E
