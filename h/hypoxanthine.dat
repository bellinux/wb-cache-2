5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is <b>hypoxanthine,</b> a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
25|$|Deamination — Hydrolysis changes {{a normal}} base to an {{atypical}} base containing a keto group {{in place of}} the original amine group. Examples include C → U and A → HX (<b>hypoxanthine),</b> which can be corrected by DNA repair mechanisms; and 5MeC (5-methylcytosine) → T, which is less likely to be detected as a mutation because thymine is a normal DNA base.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} {{culture medium}} is called HAT medium {{because it contains}} <b>hypoxanthine,</b> aminopterin and thymidine. This medium is selective for fused (hybridoma) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the muscle}} {{proteins}} denature in varying degree, {{with the exception}} of the collagen and elastin of connective tissue, and rigor mortis resolves. Because of these changes, the meat is tender and pliable when cooked just after death or after the resolution of rigor, but tough when cooked during rigor. As the muscle pigment myoglobin denatures, its iron oxidates, which may cause a brown discoloration near the surface of the meat. Ongoing proteolysis also contributes to conditioning. <b>Hypoxanthine,</b> a breakdown product of ATP, contributes to the meat's flavor and odor, as do other products of the decomposition of muscle fat and protein.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of deamination seen in cpDNA. Deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. When adenine is deaminated, it becomes <b>hypoxanthine.</b> <b>Hypoxanthine</b> can bind to cytosine, and when the XC base pair is replicated, it becomes a GC (thus, an A → G base change).|$|E

2500|$|Deaminated bases: <b>hypoxanthine</b> {{formed from}} deamination of adenine. Xanthine formed from deamination of guanine. (Thymidine {{products}} following deamination of 5-methylcytosine {{are more difficult}} to recognize, but can be repaired by mismatch-specific glycosylases) ...|$|E
2500|$|The unique {{structure}} of quadruplex regions in RNA may serve different functions in a biological system. [...] Two important functions [...] are the binding potential with ligands or proteins, {{and its ability}} to stabilize the whole tertiary {{structure of}} DNA or RNA. [...] The strong structure can inhibit or modulate transcription and replication, such as in the telomeres of chromosomes and the UTR of mRNA. [...] The base identity is important towards ligand binding. [...] The G-quartet typically binds monovalent cations such as potassium, while other bases can bind numerous other ligands such as <b>hypoxanthine</b> in a U-U-C-U quadruplex.|$|E
2500|$|Hybridomas are cells {{obtained}} by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can {{be expanded to}} produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). One problem is to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the cell fusion. One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are {{obtained by}} growing the tumor cell line {{in the presence of}} thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or aminopterin that inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains <b>hypoxanthine,</b> aminopterinand thymidine. The unfused cells from the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line die because they have no source of thymidine monophosphate. The lymphocytes eventually die because they are not [...] "immortal." [...] Only the hybridomas that have [...] "immortality" [...] from their cell line ancestor and thymidine kinase from the plasma cell survive. Those that produce the desired antibody are then selected and cultured to produce the monoclonal antibody. Hybridoma cells can also be isolated using the same principle as described with respect to another gene the HGPRT, which synthesizes IMP necessary for GMP nucleotide synthesis in the salvage pathway.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{origin of}} {{hydrogen}} peroxide is {{the degradation of}} adenosine monophosphate which yields <b>hypoxanthine.</b> <b>Hypoxanthine</b> is then oxidatively catabolized first to xanthine and then to uric acid, and the reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypo{{xanthine}}</b> and xanthine {{are two of}} {{the many}} bases created through mutagen presence, both of them through deamination (replacement of the amine-group with a carbonyl-group). <b>Hypoxanthine</b> is produced from adenine, xanthine from guanine., and uracil results from deamination of cytosine.|$|E
50|$|Allopurinol is a purine analog; it is a {{structural}} isomer of <b>hypoxanthine</b> (a naturally occurring purine in the body) {{and is an}} inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase {{is responsible for the}} successive oxidation of <b>hypoxanthine</b> and xanthine, resulting in the production of uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in <b>hypoxanthine</b> and xanthine. While xanthine cannot be converted to purine ribotides, <b>hypoxanthine</b> can be salvaged to the purine ribotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribotides may cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol, therefore, decreases uric acid formation and may also inhibit purine synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypoxanthine</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring purine derivative. It is occasionally found as a constituent of nucleic acids, {{where it is}} present in the anticodon of tRNA in the form of its nucleoside inosine. It has a tautomer known as 6-hydroxypurine. <b>Hypoxanthine</b> is a necessary additive in certain cell, bacteria, and parasite cultures as a substrate and nitrogen source. For example, it is commonly a required reagent in malaria parasite cultures, since Plasmodium falciparum requires a source of <b>hypoxanthine</b> for nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism.|$|E
