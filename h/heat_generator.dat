The gas-fired outputs exhaust heat to a <b>heat</b> recovery steam <b>generator</b> (HRSG). From {{the output of the}} <b>heat</b> recovery steam <b>generator</b> it is run into a steam turbine which increases electricity production and the overall efficiency of the plant. The gas-fired turbine (GT) and the <b>heat</b> recovery steam <b>generator</b> (HRSG) technology has been in utilize in many repowering projects over the past 20 years in the United States alone. With increasing environmental regulations of the United States Government and the lower fuel prices made the usage of GT/HRSG an option in utilizing to renew many old coal heating power plants. This modern gas turbines operate with higher efficiencies and adding a <b>heat</b> recovery steam <b>generator</b> (HRSG) raises overall plant efficiency to 40 percent to 50 percent (HHV) above the range of most coal-fired plants, reducing fuel consumption and lowering plant emissions.

Existing direct-fired plants can utilize this advanced cycle concept by adding a GT and a HRSG.
