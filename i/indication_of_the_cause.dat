This dynamic propagation is essential, and thus this paper contributes not only new metrics, but also non-trivial ways of computing them. We furthermore present a set of benchmarks that exercise a wide range of AspectJ’s features, and the metrics that we measured on these benchmarks.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of {{deflection under load}} is fundamental to the assessment of road pavement strength. Many authors have described the benefits of using GPR data to enhance assessment of deflection measurements made by devices such as the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD). However while GPR investigations can be undertaken quickly, FWD and other existing deflection methods are much slower which in turn limits productivity. This paper describes a 2010 field trial comparing data from two highway speed road measurement devices: the Danish made Traffic Speed Deflectometer (TSD) and the Australian made 3 -D noise modulated ground penetrating radar (NM-GPR) system used in the `Roadscout 2 ̆ 7 vehicle. Around 350 lane-kilometers of data from these devices were compared, showing a clear correlation. The methods {{were found to be}} particularly useful when used in combination - the TSD indicating where the pavement was weak, strong or variable and the GPR providing additional information to indicate why. In many cases changes in the data from both methods coincided, providing a direct <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the change. In other instances either the TSD or GPR varied and the other method did not, indicating a different type of cause. It quickly became clear that the methods were complementary, providing two independent measurements of pavement response on which to assess current conditions. Overall the correlation between the NM-GPR and TSD data from this trial indicates great promise for using these methods in combination in the future. These methods provide key data needed to achieve rapid, large scale road pavement investigations, collected without public disruption at highway speeds...|$|E

40|$|The {{compression}} {{strength of a}} stitched and a toughened matrix graphite/epoxy composite was determined and compared to a baseline unstitched untoughened composite. Two different layups {{with a variety of}} test lengths were tested under both ambient and hot/wet conditions. No significant difference in strength was seen for the different materials when the gage lengths of the specimens were long enough to lead to a buckling failure. For shorter specimens, a 30 % reduction in strength from the baseline was seen due to stitching for both a 48 -ply quasi-isotropic and a (0 / 45 / 0 /- 45 / 90 /- 45 / 0 / 45 / 0) s laminate. Analysis of the results suggested that the decrease in strength was due to increased fiber misalignment due to the stitches. An observed increasing strength with decreasing gage length, which was seen for all materials, was explained with a size effect model. The model assumed a random distribution of flaws (misaligned fibers). The toughened material showed a small increase in strength over the baseline material for both laminates presumably due to the compensating effects of a more compliant matrix and straighter fibers in the toughened material. The hot/wet strength of the stitched and baseline material fell 30 % below their ambient strengths for shorter, non-buckling specimen, while the strength of the toughened matrix material only fell 20 %. Video images of the failing specimen were recorded and showed local failures prior to global collapse of the specimen. These images support the theory of a random distribution of flaws controlling composite failure.

40|$|Railway track {{substructure}} {{maintenance management}} {{is the process}} of utilizing railroad resources to maintain and upgrade the track substructure. The process begins with a measure of the track condition to evaluate the substructure performance, determine locations along the track that require maintenance, and identify appropriate solutions. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been proposed as a potentially valuable tool for this purpose. The objective of the research was to develop GPR testing and data interpretation techniques suitable for use by railroad personnel in this application. ^ The principle of GPR operation is the transmission of short electromagnetic waves into the subsurface and recording the resulting signal of the reflected waves. Electromagnetic waves are influenced most significantly by the dielectric constant of the soil. The dielectric constant is most affected by moisture content making GPR a valuable tool for locating trapped water that will cause increased track deterioration rates. GPR has the potential to evaluate the thicknesses and properties of the substructure layers on a continuous, non-destructive basis to improve the process of diagnosing substructure causes of track performance deterioration. ^ GPR railroad research at UMass started with the construction of a test track. Different track structure components were tested to determine their effects on the GPR data. Approximately 200 tests were conducted. Subsequently, about 275 miles of data were collected on several U. S. railroads including Amtrak, Conrail, New England Central, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and in England on AMEC Rail. ^ The data were studied to determine how well GPR can define substructure conditions, identify track problem areas, and provide an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the problem. The analysis included comparison of the GPR data to track geometry, subsurface stratigraphy, and ballast condition (fouling and moisture). GPR processing techniques were developed to simplify interpretation of the data. The results showed that GPR could locate zones of increased substructure degradation at over 75 % of the sites. ...|$|E
40|$|The work {{undertaken}} {{in this thesis}} addresses the use of individual anode current measurements for stat and parameter estimation and fault detection in aluminium electrolysis cells. The work has focused on different methods where measurements of anode current distribution {{could be used to}} infer major changes in alumina concentration, and possibly detect abnormal process conditions like faulty feeding  equipment and oncoming  anode effects. Two main approaches have been pursued, a physical model based approach and a pure data driven approach.   The main part of the work has focused on the model based approach. Based on physical principles and empirical correlations from the literature, several models have been developed that use measurements of current through the individual anodes in a cell as input and estimate cell voltage and distribution of alumina concentration in the electrolyte. The models are implemented in Extended Kalman Filters allowing states and a number of process parameters to be updated based on measured cell voltage.   Experimental data from real aluminium electrolysis cells are used to validate the models and estimate the unknown model parameters. The Extended Kalman Filter estimates are compared to measured outputs, and turning and robustness of the estimator for different operating conditions are discussed. In general the estimates of alumina concentration and cell voltage fit the measurements reasonably well for the available measurement data. The performance and robustness of the Kalman Filter depend on how well the Kalman Filter gain matrix is tuned to blen model and measurement information, as well as the identifiable and observability of the parameters and the states given the available input and measurement data. All states and parameters can rarely be estimated simultaneously, an in practice we must determine what states and / or parameters to estimate based on the available data.   The experimental data typically involve some manipulation of feed rate to excite the concentration of the raw material alumina outside of the normal operating fange, and provoke an abnormal condition known as anode effect. The data have been used to study the performance of the Kalman Filter in situations where the actual feed rate of alumina in the cell is different from what is assumed by the process control system. When the inout feed rate to the model is faulty, updating the model states or a few chosen model parameters from the measured cell voltage (or cell resistance) can significantly improve the estimates of alumina concentration. This can be used to detect faulty input feed rate and abnormal changes in alumina concentration distribution in the cell. The results suggest that using the Kalman Filter to generate faults, anode effects in the experimental data could be detected 10 - 20 minutes ahead.   Detection of anode effects and abnormal distribution of alumina concentration has also been studied using the data based fault detection method Principle Component Analysis. This method also shows some potential for improved detection of anode effect, but in general, detection is closer to the oncoming anode effect than for the model based approach. A weakness of data based methods is that they in general cannot explain variation in the data not represented by the training data, and therefore the frequency of false alarms can be high. An advantage with the model based approach is that this method can relate the abnormal situation directly to a specific parameter or state (s), thereby giving a better <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the fault. Only faults related to abnormal feed rates are evaluated here, and further work are necessary to assess the robustness and performance for the two methods with other common operating conditions and faults in the data.

40|$|Synthetisch hergestelltes Siliziumdioxid (SiO 2) im Submikro- und Nanopartikelmaßstab findet bereits in Farben und Lacken, sowie in Kunst- und Klebstoffen Einsatz, um deren Brillanz, Kratz- und Kohäsionsfestigkeit zu verbessern. Die gute Verfügbarkeit und der geringe Preis des SiO 2 machen es für viele Anwendungen zu einem interessanten Füllstoff. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, durch werkstoffwissenschaftliche, grundlagenorientierte Betrachtungen ein tieferes Verständnis für die Funktionsmechanismen von modifizierten SiO 2 -Partikeln in einer EP-Matrix zu erlangen und eine Verbesserung der tribologischen Eigenschaften (Reibungskoeffizient und Verschleißrate) der Komposite zu erreichen. Der erste Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Herstellung und Charakterisierung von modifizierten Siliziumdioxid-Partikeln mittels eines modifizierten Stöberprozess. Es wurden die Katalysatoren Ammoniak, Tetramethylammoniumhydroxid (TMAH) und Tetramethylethylendiamin (TMED) getestet. Als Referenz wurden kommerziell erhältliche SiO 2 -Nanopartikel (Aerosil 200) sowie ein ebenfalls kommerziell erhältliches Partikelgemisch (NanoVit) als Füllstoffe getestet. Zur Ermittlung der tribologischen Eigenschaften wurde an den Kompositen eine Gleitverschleißuntersuchung (Stift-auf-Scheibe (PoD)) mit unterschiedlichen Parametervarianten (Geschwindigkeit-/Druckvariationen) durchgeführt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die modifizierten SiO 2 -Partikel einen positiven Einfluss auf die tribologischen Eigenschaften der EP-Komposite haben. Weiter konnte bewiesen werden, dass durch die Zugabe der neu synthetisierten SiO 2 -Partikel auf eine Zugabe von Graphit als Schmiermittel verzichtet werden kann. Auch wurde festgestellt, dass durch das Eleminieren des Graphites sich ein sehr dünner Gleitfilm auf dem Gegenkörper ausbildete, der als ein Indiz für die Ursache der Verbesserung des Reibwertes gelten kann. Ein Prozess für dieses Kompositverhalten wurde in dieser Arbeit postuliert. resins (EP), are {{increasingly}} being used as templates {{for the development of}} anti-wear coatings and composites. An improvement in the tribological properties of EP composite materials is thus of great importance. As a basic functionalization for high performance EP composites micro scale short carbon fibers (SCFs) and micro scale graphite are being utilized. In the last years the use of nanomaterials as fillers in polymer matrices has started to increase. A common way to produce nanoreinforced polymer composites is to purchase microagglomerates with a primary particle size on the nanoscale directly from the market, to transfer those particles into the respective polymer matrix and to destroy those microagglomerates by the application of various “milling techniques”. In case of thermosets e. g. epoxy resins dissolver techniques like a torus mill are applied, in case of thermoplastics a twin screw extruder will be used. At the end of the “milling process” a broad distribution of nanoparticles as well as remaining microagglomerates are present in the respective polymer matrix. Therefore an exactly controlled synthesis of defined and homogenously controlled particle sizes is not given. In order to obtain such nano- or submicroparticles respectively the so called bottom-up method has to be applied. The basis of this method are molecules e. g. tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) which will be condensed in alkaline medium to aggregates with a defined particle size by using stabilizing agents and temperature control. Nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2), silicium dioxide (SiO 2), zinc oxide (ZnO) or molybdeniumdisulfide (MoS 2) are now an important part of industrial materials. Silicon dioxide (quartz) is caused by dehydration of silicic acid {{and is one of the}} hardest natural materials. To synthesize this material as nanoparticles, to use it as fillers in composites, offers a high potential for the creation of new nanomaterial composites. The good availability and low price of silica make it attractive for many applications. Synthetically produced SiO 2 in the sub-micron and nano-scale can already be found in paints and varnishes, plastics and adhesives to use boost their brilliance, as well as to improve scratch resistance and cohesive strength. Depending on the desired particle properties and production rates, a suitable production method must be selected from the large number of possible processes to generate the perfect nanoparticles. One challenge is the transfer of these manufacturing processes from the laboratory to an industrial scale. Here the sol-gel process takes an attractive position for synthesizing innovative nanoscale SiO 2 particles. The aim of this work is to stabilize the Stöber process for producing SiO 2 nanoparticles, so that it allows a scale-up in the industrial scale, without significant changes in the SiO 2 particles quality. The SiO 2 particles are controlled during the synthesis in terms of their shape and size. For this purpose, SiO 2 particles with two different stabilizers, Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMED) are manufactured. A SiO 2 particle growth law is defined by which carefully coordinated synthesis parameters (concentration, temperature and pH) homogeneous, monodispersed particles can be produced with a defined particle size between 50 nm and 700 nm (± 10 nm). These particles are characterized by analytical methods (IR spectroscopy, DLS analysis, SEM images, NMR spectroscopy and BET measurements). The SiO 2 particles, which have been produced with the aid of the stabilizer TMAH, show a higher concentration of silanol groups in their structure. After ensuring the controlled SiO 2 - manufacturing process, the particles thus produced are used as filling material for EP composites. With the modified Stöber SiO 2 particles in combination with SCF and graphite, the tribological properties (coefficient of friction and wear) of the EP- composites should be improved. After the production of the SiO 2 particles, these are introduced, differentiated by their different size in an EP- matrix. In addition to provide a reference the fillers SCF and graphite can be tested in an EP matrix as well. These composites are now being analyzed by the tribological pin-on-ring method in terms of wear values. In the next step EP composites are produced which include the best SiO 2 particle sizes from the previous chapter together with SCF and graphite as filler materials to create better tribological properties. After this they were characterized by the pin-on-disc method with respect to their wear rate and coefficient of friction. A commercially available SiO 2 nanoparticle (Aerosil 200) as filler is used in an EP composites in the next chapter as a reference. This composite is compared to two other composites containing the self-produced SiO 2 particles, wherein both types differ by the choice of the stabilizer used during the synthesis. In the last section of this work a composite in which a commercially available filler mix (NanoVit) is included were tested, compared with a composite with the best previously determined fillers. It is shown that the modified SiO 2 particles have a positive effect on the tribological characteristics of the EP-composites. They produce a lower coefficient of friction and improved wear performance. It is also proven that by adding the newly synthesized SiO 2 particles the addition of graphite as a lubricant is no longer relevant. Furthermore, it is proven that by eliminating the graphite a very thin film of lubricant on the counter body is formed which is an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of improving the coefficient of friction. A process for this behavior is postulated. ...|$|E

The historical sources, primarily <b>the</b> Chronicle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Priest <b>of</b> Dioclea, give no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> this conflict, nor do they explain why Byzantium {{found it necessary to}} intervene {{from time to time in}} Dioclea or Rascia. Although <b>the</b> family relations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rasican and Dioclean dynasties frequently provoked one state to interfere into <b>the</b> internal affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, they were certainly not <b>the</b> main generator <b>of</b> this century-long conflict. Since it was a process of long duration, it is quite likely that <b>the</b> main <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war between Rascia and Dioclea had to do with economic considerations, and the paper discusses this possibility. <b>The</b> rulers <b>of</b> Dioclea wanted to secure the raw materials for the maritime towns, primarily Cataro, which they had acquired around <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eleventh century, and they sought to achieve that by conquest and <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> their influence in the inland regions — in Travounia, Bosnia and Rascia. On the other hand, Serbia had become rapidly more powerful in the early twelfth century, and its rulers sought to impose their control on these maritime towns as nearest centres of commerce and production. During this contest, Byzantium interfered only when the geostrategic stability in <b>the</b> broader territory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balkan Peninsula seemed to be brought into question and when Dioclea or Rascia established closer links with the Venetians, Hungarians or Normans, thus jeopardizing its interests. Byzantium looked upon Rascia and Dioclea as its western outposts and was therefore anxious to have a reliable ruler in Rascia, so that it could control the Niš — Braničevo — Belgrade route to Hungary. Similarly, a dependable ruler in Doclea was a guarantor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> Dyrrachion and of unimpeded communication with the remaining Byzantine possessions in <b>the</b> middle part <b>of</b> Dalmatia...|$|R

40|$|For many failure cases, {{macroscopic}} examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fracture surface permits discrimination of fatigue fractures from overload fractures. For clarifying fatigue fractures, <b>the</b> practical significance <b>of</b> microfractography {{is limited to}} an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack initiation areas. Scanning electron microscopy is successfully used in tracing local material abnormalities that act as fatigue crack initiators. The task for the scanning electron microscope, however, is much more substantial in failure analysis of overload fractures, especially for steels. By revealing specific fractographic characteristics, complemented by information about the material and the loading conditions, scanning electron microscopy provides a strong <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probable <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> failure. A complete dimple fracture is indicative of acceptable bulk material properties; overloading, by subdimensioning or excessive external loading, has to be verified. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> cleavage fracture makes the material properties questionable if external conditions causing embrittlement are absent. Intergranular brittle fracture requires verification of grain-boundary weakening conditions-a sensitized structure, whether or not combined with a local stress state or a specific environment. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> scanning electron microscopy in failure analysis is illustrated by case histories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned fracture types.

40|$|Motivation: Increasingly, cost {{effective}} high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies are being utilized to sequence human pedigrees {{in order to}} elucidate <b>the</b> genetic <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{a wide variety of}} human diseases. While numerous tools exist for variant prioritization within a single genome, the ability to concurrently analyze variants within pedigrees remains a challenge, especially should there be no prior <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying genetic <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. Here we present a tool, Variant Analysis of Sequenced Pedigrees (VASP), a flexible data integration environment capable of producing a summary of pedigree variation, providing relevant information such as compound heterozygosity, genome phasing, and disease inher-itance patterns. Designed to aggregate data across a sequenced pedigree, VASP allows both powerful filtering and custom prioritiza-tion of both SNVs and small indels. Hence, clinical and research users with prior knowledge of a disease are able to dramatically reduce the variant search space based {{on a wide variety of}} custom prioritization criteria.

40|$|Abstract Random contentions {{occur in}} optical burst-switched (OBS) {{networks}} because of one-way signaling {{and lack of}} optical buffers. These contentions can occur at low loads and are not necessarily an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> congestion. <b>The</b> loss <b>caused</b> by them, however, <b>causes</b> TCP at <b>the</b> transport layer to reduce its send rate drastically, which is unnecessary and reduces overall performance. In this paper, we propose forward segment redundancy (FSR), a proactive technique to prevent data loss during random contentions in the optical core. With FSR, redundant TCP segments are appended to each burst at the edge and redundant burst segmentation (RBS) is implemented in the core so that when a contention occurs, primarily redundant data is dropped. We develop an analytical throughput model for TCP over OBS with FSR and perform extensive simulations.

40|$|Textile {{plants are}} {{important}} sources of toxic discharges in the receiving ecosystems. Their effluents may contain or-ganic and inorganic substances that are potentially toxic to aquatic biota, and their identification involves expensive and complex analytical techniques (Gómez et al. 2001). In complex effluents, {{like those of}} textile industry, interac-tions among several pollutants might be synergistic, an-tagonistic, or simply additive. Consequently, complex mixtures {{can be considered as}} non-toxic when some sub-stances are investigated individually but toxic when those mixtures are analysed. Many toxicological investigations involve <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> a single pollutant, which may give a clearer picture of toxicological effects than studies of com-plex chemical matrix such as textile effluents. However, in natural ecosystems, the biota is usually exposed to a com-plex and unknown combination of several pollutants (Abel 1998). Therefore, whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests can be more realistic than <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> individual pollutants (Juvonen et al. 2000, Mitchell et al. 2002, Araújo et al. 2005) and are recognized as practical and effective tools for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> combined effects of toxic substances on aquatic ecosystems (Gómez et al. 2001). Though WET tests do not provide <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>cause(s)</b> <b>of</b> toxicity, they can contribute to address the overall effects that a mixture of pollutants might produce on the aquatic environment (EPA 2000, Nieto 2000, Rodriguez et al. 2006).

40|$|Fear {{and anxiety}} are {{adaptive}} responses but if left unregulated, or inappropriately regulated, they become biologically and socially maladaptive. Dysregulated emotions are manifest {{in a wide}} variety of psychiatric and neurological conditions but the external expression gives little <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying <b>causes,</b> which are inevitably multi-determined. To go beyond the overt phenotype and begin to understand the causal mechanisms leading to conditions characterized by anxiety and disorders of mood, it is necessary to identify the base psychological processes that have become dysregulated, and map them on to their associated neural substrates. So far, attention has been focused primarily on <b>the</b> medial regions <b>of</b> prefrontal cortex (PFC) and in particular their contribution to the expression and extinction of conditioned fear. However, functional neuroimaging studies have shown that <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> influence within <b>the</b> PFC is not restricted to its medial regions, but extends into dorsal, ventrolateral (vlPFC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) regions too; although <b>the</b> causal role <b>of</b> these other areas in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> fear and anxiety remains to be determined and in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OFC, existing findings are conflicting.

40|$|Degradation of Lithium-ion {{batteries}} is {{a complex}} process that {{is caused by a}} variety of mechanisms. For simplicity, ageing mechanisms are often grouped into three degradation modes (DMs) : conductivity loss (CL), loss of active material (LAM) and loss of lithium inventory (LLI). State of Health (SoH) is typically the parameter used by the Battery Management System (BMS) to quantify battery degradation based on the decrease in capacity and the increase in resistance. However, <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> SoH within a BMS does not currently include an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying DMs <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> degradation.

For an experimental case of parallelized cells aged differently, the effects due to LAM and LLI were found to be the most pertinent, outlining that both techniques are correlated. This approach can be further implemented within a BMS to quantify <b>the</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> battery ageing which would support battery lifetime control strategies and future battery designs. ...|$|R
