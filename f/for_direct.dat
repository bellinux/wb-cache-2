50|$|The Directors Guild of America Award for Feature Film has {{traditionally}} been a near perfect barometer for the Academy Award for Best Director. Only seven times since the DGA Award's inception has the DGA Award winner not won the Academy Award; in 1968 (Carol Reed won the Oscar <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Oliver!); 1972 (Bob Fosse won the Oscar <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Cabaret); 1985 (Sydney Pollack won the Oscar <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Out of Africa, as Steven Spielberg was not nominated <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> The Color Purple); 1995 (Mel Gibson won <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Braveheart, as Ron Howard was not nominated <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Apollo 13); 2000 (Steven Soderbergh won the Oscar <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Traffic); 2002 (Roman Polanski won the Oscar <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> The Pianist); and 2012 (Ang Lee won the Oscar <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Life of Pi as Ben Affleck was not nominated <b>for</b> <b>directing</b> Argo). This does not count 1948-49, when the DGA used a non-calendar award year (unlike the Academy Awards); both 1948 and 1949 DGA winners competed for the 1949 Academy Award for Best Director, which went to the 1948 DGA winner (Joseph L. Mankiewicz for A Letter to Three Wives).|$|R

5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E

5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific trade or skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL.

His preference <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E

5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges.

In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> observation.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies vehicle routing {{problems}} on asymmetric metrics. Our {{starting point is}} the directed k -TSP problem: given an asymmetric metric (V,d), a root r[*]∈[*]V and a target k[*]≤[*]|V|, compute the minimum length tour that contains r and at least k other vertices. We present a polynomial time O(log 2 n·logk) -approximation algorithm for this problem. We use this algorithm <b>for</b> <b>directed</b> k-TSP to obtain an O(log 2 n) -approximation algorithm <b>for</b> the <b>directed</b> orienteering problem. This answers positively, the question of poly-logarithmic approximability of directed orienteering, an open problem from Blum et al. [2]. The previously best known results were quasi-polynomial time algorithms with approximation guarantees of O(log 2 k) <b>for</b> <b>directed</b> k-TSP, and O(logn) <b>for</b> <b>directed</b> orienteering (Chekuri 2 ̆ 6 Pal [4]). Using the algorithm <b>for</b> <b>directed</b> orienteering {{within the framework of}} Blum et al. [2] and Bansal et al. [1], we also obtain poly-logarithmic approximation algorithms <b>for</b> the <b>directed</b> versions of discounted-reward TSP and the vehicle routing problem with time-windows...|$|R

5|$|The {{presence}} of T. cruzi is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It {{can be detected}} by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> visualization of parasites. Microscopically, T. cruzi can be confused with Trypanosoma rangeli, which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of T. cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by xenodiagnosis, where uninfected Reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} {{approximately}} 16,000 German citizens {{fought in the}} Civil War, mostly as pilots, ground crew, artillery men, tank crew, and as military advisers and instructors. About 10,000 Germans was the maximum strength at any one time. Approximately 300 Germans were killed. During {{the course of the}} war, Germany sent 732 combat aircraft and 110 trainer aircraft to Spain. German aid to the Nationalists amounted to approximately £43,000,000 ($215,000,000) in 1939 prices. This was broken down in expenditure to: 15.5% used for salaries and expenses, 21.9% used <b>for</b> <b>direct</b> delivery of supplies to Spain, and 62.6% expended on the Condor Legion. No detailed list of German supplies furnished to Spain has been found. Franco had also agreed to sign over the output of six mines to help pay for German aid.|$|E
