5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem <b>films</b> <b>such</b> Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932).

Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
