40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the technical efficiency and economic viability of the implementation and use of four cattle identification methods allowed by the Brazilian traceability system. The {{study was conducted in}} a beef cattle production system located in the State of Mato Grosso, from January to June 2012. Four identification methods (treatments) were compared: T 1 : ear tag in one ear and ear button in the other ear (eabu); T 2 : ear tag and iron brand on the right leg (eaib); T 3 : ear tag in one ear and tattoo on the other ear (eata); and T 4 : ear tag in one ear and <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> (eael) on the other. Each treatment was applied to 60 Nelore animals, totaling 240 animals, divided equally into three life stages (calves, young cattle, adult cattle). The study had two phases: implementation (phase 1) and reading and transfer of identification numbers to an electronic database (phase 2). All operating expenses related to the two phases of the study were determined. The database was constructed, and the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS® 17. 0 software. Regarding the time spent on implementation (phase 1), conventional ear tags and electronic ear tags produced similar results, which were lower than those of hot iron and tattoo methods, which differed from each other. Regarding the time required for reading the numbers on animals and their transcription into a database (phase 2), electronic ear-tagging was the fastest method, followed by conventional ear tag, hot iron and tattoo. Among the methods analyzed, the <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> had the highest technical efficiency because it required less time to implement identifiers and to complete the process of reading and transcription to an electronic database and because it did not exhibit any errors.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of metal-tipped, plastic-tipped, and electronic ear tags on the likelihood of infection using infrared thermography and to evaluate the effect on welfare by examining the behavioral responses of the lambs. Ninety lambs with an average age of 6  months were used in this study. Before the application of the ear tags, infrared images of the right and left ears of the lambs were taken with the thermal camera and the infrared temperatures were recorded. Measurements were repeated on days 1, 4, 10, and 30 after the ear tag application. The mean of infrared ear temperatures on days 0, 1, 4, 10, and 30 were found to be 14. 60, 23. 20, 23. 77, 20. 36, and 17. 61  °C for the metal-tipped ear tag group; 15. 69, 21. 50, 20. 42, 18. 00, and 16. 39  °C for the plastic-tipped ear tag group; and 15. 17, 29. 47, 27. 49, 25. 93, and 20. 61  °C for the <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> group. The infrared temperatures on days 1, 4, and 10 in the control and experimental groups were significantly different from each other (P  <  0. 001). The plastic-tipped ear tags caused fewer problems and are preferred to the traditional ear tags with metal tips. The electronic ear tags caused more inflammatory reactions compared to metal- or plastic-tipped ear tags.

30|$|Because of the {{socio-economic}} {{importance of}} livestock in the country, the sector is arguably {{one of the}} most protected (Jefferis 2005) as all international trade in beef and cattle is prohibited as outlined in the Control of Livestock Industry Act (1968), except when routed through the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC). Traditionally, Batswana pastoral households used a wealth of knowledge acquired and refined over time to identify their animals by the use of marking techniques such as hot iron branding or ear marks and skin colour. While these are useful in identifying the owner of the animal(s), the system cannot adequately identify individual animals and hence the introduction of other techniques like ear tag numbers and lately the use of digital reticular bolus identification technology implemented under the Livestock Identification and Trace-back System. The latter is mostly compliance to regulatory requirements by Botswana’s ‘lucrative’ European Union (EU) beef export market, which emphasizes stringent international standards for food quality and safety as well as disease control. The use of the bolus for curbing livestock theft was therefore an offshoot or by-product of the EU beef traceability requirement and is restricted only to cattle. The reticular bolus, however, was to be replaced with an <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> coupled with an analogue ear tag as an identification device effective the year 2013. Some farmers ingeniously use plastic ear tags to write down their contact details, usually mobile phone numbers, so that any of their lost animals which have been rounded up may be traced back to them through a simple phone call. All the preceding measures coupled with enforcement of the Stock Theft Act (1996) and other pertinent legislation have greatly eliminated commercialization of cattle raiding/rustling in Botswana, in contrast to other regions of Africa (Hendrickson et al. 1996; Kaimba et al. 2011), where the practice is widespread, sophisticated, more violent and destructive (Mkutu 2010; Schilling et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} first {{results in}} the development of a machine vision system that estimates the liveweight of cattle based on objective body measurements (i. e. body length and area). The apparatus has potential use in pasture and feedlot situations with application to automated drafting. A trial conducted at Bengalla Station (42 km east of Goondiwindi, Queensland) consisted of video collection for thirty pasture-fed Bos indicus steers for one day in August 2009. Video apparatus was installed in a laneway enclosed in a shed through which the animals walked enroute to a watering point. Video recording was motion-triggered and indexed by cattle identifications from an <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> reader at the entry of the laneway. The animals were stationary-weighed the day before the video collection occurred. The video apparatus comprised a single camera view of the laneway. The laneway was backlit with nearinfrared (NIR) floodlights such that a silhouetted side view of the animal was acquired as the animal walked through the laneway. A camera fitted with a NIR optical filter logged video to a personal computer. NIR wavelengths were used so the floodlights could be powered on and off automatically without disturbing the animals. Image processing algorithms were written to automatically extract body length and area from the images. Firstly, dark pixels in the image were assigned as animal pixels and light pixels were assigned as the background. Body length was estimated as the distance between the approximate tailhead and shoulder positions in imagery. Body area was estimated using the body height and length. Body length and area measured by the developed method was linearly related to body weight with coefficients of correlation of 0. 52 and 0. 53, respectively. The results agree with the finding of Wanderstock and Salisbury (1946) that body length is correlated with liveweight. Further work includes improving the weight estimation by incorporating other body measurements and camera views, extending the system to estimate condition score and trialing different breeds...|$|E

The researcher placed <b>electronic</b> identification (EID) <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> in 4 -H animals at time of county livestock enrollment. A total of 428 beef, 457 sheep and 885 swine were tagged at individual county enrollment days. During weigh-in at the county fair, a total of 302 beef, 360 sheep and 829 swine were evaluated to determine the readability of their EID <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> An <b>electronic</b> wand, called a LightningROD, was used to read the EID tags of animals that were to be exhibited at the county fair. The time lapse between <b>ear</b> <b>tagging</b> the livestock and reading the <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> at the county fair, varied from two days to six months based on animal specie and the participating county. ^ The results showed that 98. 4 % of beef cattle retained their <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tags,</b> 96. 3 % of sheep retained their <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> and swine had a 99. 1 % retention rate.

40|$|An {{expert system}} (RestiMATE) was {{designed}} that assists veterinary practitioners {{in assessing the}} respiratory health status of a pig farm. RestiMATE uses classification rules to identify patterns of environmental risk factors for respiratory diseases and to select optimal management interventions to control and prevent respiratory diseases. The classification rules are based on expert interviews and on empirical data collected in New Zealand. Recursive partitioning and neural network techniques have been applied for rule induction. These methods were compared with logistic regression {{and appeared to be}} similarly efficient in terms of classification while providing additional insight into the structure of a data set. Non-parametric analytical methods appear to be particularly suitable when analysing complex data sets and for exploratory data analysis. EpiMAN-SF is an advanced decision-support system designed to manage and analyse data accumulated during an African swine fever or classical swine fever emergency. EpiMAN-SF offers state-of-the-art technology for managing data related to a swine fever epidemic, including laboratory results. An expert system was developed to support rapid classification of contacts between pig farms in terms of the risk of virus transmission. These classifications are used to set priorities in visiting farms for laboratory investigations. The validation of the expert system showed that its evaluation was more consistent and generally more risk-averse than that of human experts. A stochastic simulation model was developed to investigate the spread of swine fever infection within a farm and a second model (INTERSPREAD-SF) was designed to forecast the dynamics of the epidemic within a region and to evaluate control strategies. INTERSPREAD-SF has been validated using real outbreak data from Germany and was shown to be capable of realistically replicating the behaviour of classical swine fever. However, {{more research is needed to}} complete our knowledge about the detailed epidemiological processes during a swine fever epidemic. A prerequisite for efficient disease control in pig populations is reliable animal identification. A series of trials was conducted in order to compare <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> and implantable identification chips with visual <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> It was shown that the difficulties with respect to implants are loss rates of up to 18. 1 % within 4 weeks after implantation while <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> were lost or damaged by processing at the abattoir in up to 23. 4 % of pigs.

Losses, breakages and readability of the identification devices were recorded to evaluate their efficiency. Forty-eight piglets were observed continuously for 5 min after identification. Behavioural indica-tors of pain, discomfort or ease were recorded in terms of duration of occurrence or frequen-cy.

5000|$|An <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> usually {{carries an}} Animal Identification Number (AIN) or code for the animal, or for its herd or flock. Non <b>electronic</b> <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> may be simply {{handwritten}} {{for the convenience}} of the farmer (these are known as [...] "management tags"). Alternatively this identification number (ID) may be assigned by an organisation, such as the Meat and Livestock Association (MLA), which is a not-for-profit organisation owned by cattle, sheep and goat producers; funded by a levy on livestock sales with Federal Government input. Electronic tags may also show other information about the animal, including other related identification numbers; such as the Property Identiﬁcation Code (PIC) for the properties the animals have been located. In the case of MLA's NLIS the movement of certain species of livestock (primarily cattle, goats and sheep) must be recorded in the online database within 24 hours of the movement; and include the PICs of the properties the animals are travelling between. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) of Australia regulations require that all cattle be fitted with a RFID device {{in the form of an}} <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> or rumen bolus (a cylindrical object placed in the rumen) before movement from the property and that the movement be reported to the NLIS. However, if animals are tagged for internal purposes in a herd or farm, IDs need not be unique in larger scales. The NLIS now also requires sheep and goats to use an <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> that has the Property Identiﬁcation Code inscribed on it. These <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> and boluses are complemented by transport documents supplied by vendors that are used for identification and tracking. A similar system is used for cattle in the European Union (EU), each bovine animal having a passport document and <b>tag</b> in each <b>ear</b> carrying the same number (see British Cattle Movement Service). Sheep and goats in the EU have a tag in one or both ears carrying the official number of their flock and also for breeding stock an individual number for each animal; one of these tags (usually the left) must have a RFID chip (or the chip may instead be carried in a rumen bolus or on an anklet).|$|R

In consultation with representatives of pig farmers, breeding institutions, traders, slaughterhouses and governments a list of requirements for the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> has been set up. After initial interest for prototyping nine manufacturers have been visited and the requirements were discussed. Ultimately, six of the manufacturers produced a total of 13 prototypes for testing. Prototypes were subjected to a visual test and a test in two different slaughterhouses. Only four of the 13 prototypes met the established slaughterhouse criteria (loss rate < 5 %). These four were then tested on three pig farms. The infections, irritations and inflammation depend on husbandry conditions and the type of <b>ear</b> <b>tag.</b> The on farm loss rate of <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> prototypes was less than 2 %. The readability of the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> on the farms is not problematic. Retagging after loss was possible for one person using the existing hole but resulted in slight discomfort for the animal. During transport of the animals there were no losses. In the following slaughterhouse test no physical losses occurred. However, the functional loss rate in the slaughterhouse was above 5 %. Practical implementation of the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> was studied by interviews with several stakeholders. Focus in the interviews was on the regulations, the attachment of the combined <b>ear</b> <b>tags,</b> the process of transporting pigs to the slaughterhouse, including transport, assembly and export, the need to renumber pigs, the service of the slaughterhouses for blood sampling, and the I&R in relation to the needed documentation and forms during transport.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electronic}} identification of {{sheep and goats}} has been obligatory in the European Union since 2010 by means of low-frequency radio-frequency identification systems. The identification of pigs and cattle is currently based on a visual <b>ear</b> <b>tag,</b> but <b>electronic</b> animal identification is gaining in importance. The European Union already offers the additional use of {{electronic identification}} systems for cattle in their council regulation. Besides the low-frequency radio-frequency identification, an ultra-high-frequency <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> is a possibility for electronic animal identification. The benefits of the latter frequency band are the high range, the possibility of quasi-simultaneous reading and a high data transmission rate. First systematic laboratory tests were carried out before testing the <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> in practice. Therefore, a dynamic test bench was built. The aim of the experiments presented {{in this study was}} to compare different <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> under standardised conditions and select the most suitable for practical use. The influence of different parameters was tested and a standard test procedure to evaluate the quality of the transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> was developed. The experiments showed that neither the transponder holder material (polyvinyl chloride vs. extruded polystyrene) nor the reader settings examined (triggered read vs. presence sensing) had a significant influence on the average of readings of the different transponder types. The parameter ‘number of rounds’ (10 vs. 15 vs. 20) did not show a significant effect either. However, significant differences between speed (1. 5 ms− 1, 3. 0 ms− 1), transponder orientation and the fourteen transponder types were found. The two most suitable transponder <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> for cattle and pigs have been determined by comparison...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} two infections with Clostridium tetani (C. tetani). One outbreak {{occurred after}} dehorning of calves, the second infection happened after <b>ear</b> <b>tagging</b> of a goat. In {{the first case}} 3 young Holstein Friesian calves showed generalized stiffness, severe lock-jaw and bloat two weeks after dehorning. The thermal dehorning wounds were identified as the infection sites of C. tetani by bacterial culture and PCR. The second case was a three-year old male castrated goat, with generalized stiffness. The animal had been <b>ear</b> <b>tagged</b> one week prior to {{the onset of the}} symptoms. C. tetani could be cultured from pus on the <b>ear</b> <b>tag.</b> Treatment was attempted in two calves and the goat. Wounds were debrided and disinfected, penicillin and anti-tetanus serum were administered and polyionic perfusions provided. In addition, the goat was vaccinated against tetanus. The goat and one calf fully recovered after 36 and 8 days respectively. To the authors' knowledge a tetanus outbreak in association with thermal dehorning has not been described previously. Also <b>ear</b> <b>tagging</b> as a possible cause for C. tetani infection has not been described in goats...|$|R
50|$|Livestock—-especially cattle—-may be branded to {{indicate}} ownership and age, but in modern farming, identification {{is more likely}} to be indicated by means of <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> and <b>electronic</b> identification, instead. Sheep are also frequently marked by means of ear marks and/or <b>ear</b> <b>tags.</b> As fears of BSE and other epidemic illnesses mount, the use of implants to monitor and trace animals in the food production system is increasingly common, and sometimes required by government regulations.|$|R
50|$|Very small <b>ear</b> <b>tags</b> are {{available}} for laboratory animals such as mice and rats. They are usually sold with a device that pierces the animal's ear and installs the tag at the same time. Lab animals can also be identified by other methods such as ear punching or marking (also used for livestock; see below), implanted RFID tags (mice {{are too small to}} wear an <b>ear</b> <b>tag</b> containing an RFID chip), and dye.|$|R
