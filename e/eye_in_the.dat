5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|In the post-classic era, a {{significant}} trend in noir crossovers has involved science fiction. In Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965), Lemmy Caution {{is the name}} of the old-school private <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of tomorrow. The Groundstar Conspiracy (1972) centers on another implacable investigator and an amnesiac named Welles. Soylent Green (1973), the first major American example, portrays a dystopian, near-future world via a self-evidently noir detection plot; starring Charlton Heston (the lead in Touch of Evil), it also features classic noir standbys Joseph Cotten, Edward G. Robinson, and Whit Bissell. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, who two decades before had directed several strong B noirs, including Armored Car Robbery (1950) and The Narrow Margin (1952).|$|E
5|$|Living chelicerates {{have both}} {{compound}} eyes (only in horseshoe crabs, as the compound <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other clades {{has been reduced}} to a cluster of no more than five pairs of ocelli), mounted {{on the sides of the}} head, plus pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), mounted in the middle. These median ocelli-type eyes in chelicerates are assumed to be homologous with the crustacean nauplius eyes and the insect ocelli. The eyes of horseshoe crabs can detect movement but not form images. At the other extreme, jumping spiders have a very wide field of vision, and their main eyes are ten times as acute as those of dragonflies and is able to see in both colors and UV-light.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the degree of}} reunion <b>in</b> rabbit <b>eyes</b> of <b>the</b> superior oblique tendon after several surgical weakening procedures. Methods: A total of 32 rabbits (64 <b>eyes)</b> were used <b>in</b> this study. <b>The</b> rabbits {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups, eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenotomy group, eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenectomy group, eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> disinsertion group and eight rabbits (16 <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recession group. The degree of reunion or reattachment of the superior oblique tendon on the globe were examined on four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> each group at postoperative weeks two, four, six and eight. Results: At eight weeks, the newly created insertion site remained at <b>the</b> same site <b>in</b> all <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recession group, and the distal end of the superior oblique tendon was reattached at the medial border of the superior rectus muscle <b>in</b> all four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenotomy and disinsertion groups, and in three of four <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tenectomy group. Conclusions: From this experimental study, it was speculated that superior oblique recession is more effective than other superior oblique weakening procedures. This result could be helpful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prediction of time of recurrence for superior oblique overaction after superior oblique weakening procedures...|$|R

40|$|Tessellated fundus {{is found}} as common and early-phase {{characteristic}} of myopic eyes and their locations are varied among patients. However, {{the relationship between}} their locations and morphological parameters of the eyes is still unknown. The purpose is {{this study is to}} determine the locations of <b>the</b> tessellations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocular fundus of young healthy eyes, and to determine relationships between their locations and morphological parameters of the eyes. This is a prospective observational cross sectional study of 126 eyes of 126 healthy volunteers (mean age 26. 0 ± 4. 1 years). The eyes were classified into eight groups based on the location of the tessellations; no tessellation, temporal, infra-temporal, inferior, nasal, peripapillary, whole retina, and unclassified tessellations. The degree of optic disc tilt was quantified using a sine curve fitting program on the optical coherence tomographic circle scan images. The correlations between each tessellation location and the axial length, area of the optic disc plus conus (AOC), and optic disc tilt were determined. Forty-four <b>eyes</b> were place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> no tessellation group, 12 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temporal, 21 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infra-temporal, 9 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inferior, 8 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nasal, 15 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> peripapillary, 11 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole, and 6 <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unclassified groups. <b>The</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> axial lengths between the no tessellation group and the infra-temporal groups were significant. A significant difference was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> AOC between the no tessellation and the inferior, infra-temporal, and peripapilalry groups. A significant difference was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> optic disc tilt between the no tessellation and infra-temporal groups (P< 0. 05). The tessellations are located at specific sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fundus of young healthy eyes with the infra-temporal location most frequent.

5|$|On December6 the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} south and southwest. As it did so, Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear. After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large and distinct <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration. However, late on December7, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system, displacing the convection from the center and causing the eye to dissipate. After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920mi (1480km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 India cyclone was a {{tropical}} cyclone that struck southeastern India which later spawned a rare snowstorm in Nepal, triggering the deadliest mountain trekking {{incident in the}} country's history in November 1995. The storm originated from the monsoon trough on November7 in the Bay of Bengal, east of India, becoming the penultimate storm of the 1995 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Moving northwestward, the system gradually intensified while moving toward land, eventually developing an <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the convection. Reaching peak winds of at least 120km/h (75mph), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified {{the system as a}} very severe cyclonic storm on November8, in line with intensity estimates from the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). On November9, the cyclone made landfall near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Atypical for most November storms, the system continued to the north and dissipated over Nepal on November11.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded supernova, SN 185, {{was viewed}} by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. The brightest recorded supernova was SN 1006, which occurred in 1006 AD and {{was described in}} detail by Chinese and Islamic astronomers. The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula. Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest to be observed with the naked <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way galaxy, had notable effects {{on the development of}} astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging. Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on October 17, 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later. It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation (after SN 1572 seen by Tycho Brahe in Cassiopeia).|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a named storm, Leon turned {{more to the}} west-southwest, due to a trough weakening the ridge to the south. The storm developed increased convective banding, aided by decreasing wind shear, and quickly intensified. Early on February5, the PTCWC upgraded Leon to a Category3 on the Australian scale, estimating 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). At 22:00UTC that day, the agency estimated an initial peak of 140km/h (85mph). On February6, the cyclone developed an <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center of the convection that was only visible on Special sensor microwave/imager, not on satellite imagery. On the same day, the JTWC upgraded Leon to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane, estimating 1‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). A trough passing to the south increased wind shear, causing the storm to weaken. Around that time, Leon passed about 510km (315mi) south of the Cocos Islands, while turning more to the west after the ridge strengthened to the south. By February8, the circulation was exposed from the rapidly dwindling thunderstorms. At 18:00UTC that day, Leon crossed 90°E into the south-west Indian Ocean, and as result was renamed Eline by the Mauritius Meteorological Service. By that time, Météo-France (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 65km/h (40mph).|$|E

5|$|Ando rapidly {{intensified}} after forming and attained {{tropical cyclone}} status early on January4, developing an <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{center of the}} thunderstorms and outflow to the east. A tropical low over the southern Mozambique Channel weakened the ridge, causing Ando to turn more to the southwest. Late on January4, the storm intensified further into an intense tropical cyclone, and early the next day passed about 120km (75mi) northeast of Tromelin Island. According to the JTWC, however, Ando attained peak 1minute winds of 220km/h (140mph) late on January5. In contrast, the MFR assessed Ando as weakening due to the becoming larger and less defined, while still maintaining a small cloud diameter of about 400km (250mi). However, the eye re-organized, and Ando attained peak 10minute winds of 195km/h (120mph) on January6, with a 60km (35mi) eye at the time. Continuing around the ridge, the cyclone passed about 205km (125mi) west of Réunion that day before starting to weaken due to increased wind shear. On January8, Ando weakened below tropical cyclone status, and the convection increasingly separated from the circulation while turning to the southeast. On January10, the storm became extratropical, although the remnants {{turned back to the}} northwest due to the ridge, dissipating on January13.|$|E
5|$|Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Megh is {{regarded}} as the worst tropical cyclone to ever strike the Yemeni island of Socotra, causing additional destruction there after Cyclone Chapala hit the same island. Megh formed on November5, 2015, in the eastern Arabian Sea, and followed a path similar to Chapala. After moving northward, the cyclone turned to the west, and fueled by warm water temperatures, it quickly intensified. On November7, the storm developed an <b>eye</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center and began to rapidly intensify into a mature cyclone. By the next day, the India Meteorological Department estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph), and the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated 1minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone brushed the northern coast of Socotra. The storm steadily weakened thereafter, especially after it skirted the northern Somalia coast. After entering the Gulf of Aden, Megh turned to the west-northwest and struck southwestern Yemen on 10November as a deep depression, dissipating shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, 2000, he was {{scheduled}} to fight in a unification card against Fernando Vargas, the International Boxing Federation's junior middleweight champion. The fight began in a fast pace with Trinidad connecting a solid combination that led to his opponent being knocked down. Vargas was able to stand up, but another combination injured him a second time and led to another knockdown. Early in the second round Trinidad was in the offensive but Vargas connected a solid combination at the round's closing moments which opened a cut over Trinidad's right <b>eye.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fourth round's opening seconds one of Vargas' punches connected on Trinidad's jaw and he fell, marking the eighth knockdown in his career. In the fifth round Vargas was in control of the fight's offensive, connecting combinations to Trinidads' body. In the sixth round Trinidad regained control of the fight's tempo that lasted throughout the contest, connecting punches on Vargas' head and left jabs to the ribs. In the eighth, Vargas displayed signs of exhaustion which slowed his offensive while Trinidad then pursued the offense with combinations to the body. This pattern continued throughout the ninth, tenth and eleventh rounds. Opening the final round Vargas was on the offensive, connecting a solid left hook. Trinidad countered the attack with a left hook that made Vargas collapse; Vargas was able to stand up, but was subsequently knocked down for a second time. With Vargas injured, Trinidad continued connecting combinations, until the referee stopped the fight by technical knockout.|$|E
