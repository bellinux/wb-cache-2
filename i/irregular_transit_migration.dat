The main question guiding this research is: How to study and define the Transit Migration phenomenon from its specific context, considering its conditions and consequences? This implies also to respond three more questions: How do migrants perceive their irregular transit through Mexico?

40|$|Improving EU and US Im{{migration}} Systems' Capacity for Responding to Global Challenges: Learning from experiencesOver {{the last}} decade while a shift from migrantion control to migration management has {{become an integral part}} of the EU-based political discources and policy practices relating to irregular migration, the issues of transit migration and readmission agreements seem to be high on the agenda. Within this context, the debate over <b>irregular</b> <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> from Turkey to the EU is a perfect case study for analyzing how the phenomenon of irregular migration is affecting the European migration and border regimes. It is also an interesting case for analyzing the interplay between the migration-related issues and the EU-Turkey membership negotiations in which the whole notion of “migration management” turns into a type of conditionality measure for the progress and completion of the membership talks. This essay aims at elaborating the recent status of irregular migratory flows from Turkey to Europe referring to their changing volumes, trends and patterns. It also aims at relating the irregular migration through Turkey to the recently negotiated Readmission Agreement between the EU and Turkey which targets the return of apprehended irregular transit migrants in the EU member states to Turkey. In doing so, this essay intends to elaborate the ways in which the <b>irregular</b> <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> in Turkey has impact on the European migration and border regimes...|$|E

40|$|CARIM-India is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Union. The {{phenomenon}} of <b>irregular</b> <b>transit,</b> or step-by-step, <b>migration</b> {{is not a}} new trend as it has been increasingly witnessed {{in many parts of the}} world in the last three decades. For instance, at the surrounding regions of Europe, countries like Turkey, Morocco and Ukraine are subject to flows of irregular migrants who come from the third countries and intend to enter Europe from these peripheral territories. While the nature, dynamics and mechanisms of these flows are relatively well-documented in recent related literature, there are limited number of studies which focus on the particular cases of migrant groups. This essay tends to fill in this void, by focusing on the cases of <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> in Turkey who come from the Indian sub-continent mainly with the intention of going to Europe. While the essay elaborates on Bangladeshi, Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan transit migrants in general, special emphasis is mainly on Indians. In the lack of comprehensive and reliable data, the paper is an exploratory study rather than an explanatory one, which attempts to map out a relatively new migratory form and process from India to Europe that develops as a step-by-step, or <b>transit,</b> <b>migration</b> through various countries: the case of Turkey, as a transit country, has provided us with a unique setting which has a relatively long-established tradition of being a transit country towards Europe for thousands of transit migrants mostly from the Middle-East, and is now also increasingly becoming functional for transit migrants who come from the Indian subcontinent and try to enter Europe.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the prospects for}} a 'Mediterranean Solution' to address European Union (EU) concerns with <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> from Sub-Saharan Africa via the Maghreb states and the Southern Mediterranean. It highlights how, in focusing almost exclusively on exclusion and interdiction, the current transit country-focused proposals and approaches of the EU fail to address the underlying causes of <b>transit</b> <b>migration.</b> Furthermore, the existing Maghreb-focused approaches of the EU have exacerbated trafficking and smuggling, and led to human rights abuses and the refoulement of refugees. The article argues that in order to reconcile the EU's concern to reduce 'irregular migration' with ensuring access to protection for refugees and respect for the human rights of other categories of migrants, a comprehensive approach is required that engages with the underlying causes of irregular migration. Drawing upon the existing empirical research on <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> via the Maghreb, which indicates which migrants are coming from where and why, the article attempts to sketch the elements of a comprehensive 'Mediterranean Solution'.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{focuses on the}} efforts that the Mexican government has made for the regulation of illegal immigration in transit through the country. This study explores the origins and trends of Central American migration, the complexity of Mexico’s southern border, {{and the reasons for}} the failure of plans and programs implemented by three different administrations to regulate and protect migration flows. It finds that those plans and programs failed because Mexico did not perceive the control of Central American illegal immigration as an end; instead, it has been used to foster foreign policy objectives or to respond to second-order effects produced by the war against organized crime. Since 2000, Mexican administrations have faced different realities, both domestic and international, which have shaped their response for border management and the regulation of illegal immigration. Security and the reordering of regional migration flows have been the priorities, relegating <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> to a second plane. Mexico has accomplished important advances to give certainty and protection to illegal immigrants, but an integral and effective framework to regulate migration is lacking. Processes of planning, implementation, and evaluation of migration policies are barely defined, and the implementation of plans and programs is ineffective due to institutional weaknesses.

40|$|Through {{presenting}} {{the cases of}} Tijuana in Mexico and Istanbul in Turkey this chapter explores the local processes triggered by the discourse on <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> and the dispositif (Foucault, 1980) it activated at the urban level in two so called ‘transit countries’. Although the presence of foreign residents is hardly acknowledged and the challenges it poses to existing urban social, spatial and economic assets are not problematized, both cities multiplied their efforts to fight irregular immigration by introducing repressive measures and tight controls. By enlarging the picture to the two macro-regional contexts, i. e. US-Mexico and EU-neighboring countries, the chapter read such contradiction as a consequence and side-effect of the politicization of <b>transit</b> <b>migration,</b> to be thus considered as not just an important feature of modern human mobility but rather a political construction designed to frame the issue according to western countries {{point of view and}} aimed at leading the so called ‘transit countries’ to collaborate in a global strategy of repressive migration management. It concludes that international geopolitical interests are affecting the way in which cities of the so called ‘transit countries’ frame and govern the presence of international migrants and, as a consequence, the emergence of unconventional modes of incorporation and belonging into the urban socio-economic and spatial fabric which mainly occur within the informal spheres...|$|R

40|$|<b>Transit</b> <b>migration</b> {{is today}} a main geopolitical issue. The closed-doors {{policies}} pursued in Western Europe and the United States are having deep {{impacts on the}} migration situation in neighbouring countries of global South {{that are part of}} the migration chain. While political and academic discourse on <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> mainly focuses on the challenges for, and responsibilities of, those labelled as “transit countries”, very little reference is made to the physical nodes of transit routes, the strategic hubs where a multitude of networks converge and intersect facilitating mobility, namely “transit cities”. These urban areas, are indeed the principal loci of international migration systems, used by migrants as antechambers and switching points where getting useful information on how to migrate further, finding anonymous accommodation, income opportunities, and the social support needed to recover from their previous travel and organize their onward journey. However their stopover is frequently longer than expected and, stranded at the borders of “fortress Europe” or of their “American dream”, many end up becoming permanent residents by default, with tangible impacts on the economic, social and spatial settings of supposedly “transit” cities. These migrants often have scarce economic resources and cultural, social and religious backgrounds quite different from that of local residents. Therefore the management of their urban inclusion, when foreseen, is difficult and marked by conflict, while their living conditions are increasingly characterized by alarming levels of marginalisation and vulnerability. With particular reference to the situation of Tijuana in Mexico and Istanbul in Turkey, where the author has recently carried out field research, this paper aims at exploring the challenges faced by the many cities that per se would not be main attraction poles, but are indeed confronted with growing migration inflows prompted by exogenous factors...|$|R

We next expose the limits of such a construction in the light of African migrant experiences in Turkey.

40|$|This study aims to draw {{attention}} to the stories of Afghan unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in Sweden; their reasons to leave Afghanistan and to migrate to Sweden, the way that they migrate, and the problems they face during their journey to Sweden are investigated. In order to achieve the aims of this study, a qualitative method is used based on semi-structured interviews. Altogether, eight people are interviewed of which six are Afghan male unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, one is a legal guardian and one is an assistant (behandlingsassistent). Theories such as push and pull factors, <b>migration</b> industry theory, <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> theory, and social network theory help to understand better the stories of Afghan unaccompanied children while analyzing the data. The data obtained from interviews shows that the children who were leaving Afghanistan had mixed motivations. Factors such as lack of security, violence, threats, individual risks associated with their ethnicity, forced recruitment, economic hardship and political reasons push them to leave Afghanistan. My findings show that the main reason for the children to leave Afghanistan is the harassment and violence against the ethnic group Hazara. Moreover, the data demonstrates that traveling with smugglers and crossing borders, by land or by sea, is a multiple-step procedure for Afghan unaccompanied children. They have many stops along the way and spend lots of time in different transit countries. The journey is full of risks for them. My interviews reveal that <b>transit</b> <b>migration</b> creates a number of problems for these children. In addition, this study indicates that the role of social networks is of great importance for these children. The smugglers create strong incentives for their decision to claim asylum in Sweden. Moreover, co-migrants and friends of friend who live in Europe play a significant role in their decision-making. Furthermore, restrictive legislations as well as lack of protection in transit countries make onward migration inevitable. Other factors, such as the probability of getting a residence permit and family reunification, are important for Afghan unaccompanied children to choose Sweden as a destination country...|$|R

This study examines the legal and bureaucratic arenas that are organised {{through the process of}} the implementation of the European Union’s (EU) key asylum instruments: the qualification directive, the procedures directive, the reception directive, and the Dublin regulation at three policy-making levels: the EU, the Polish government, and the grassroots; and that enable certain types of social interaction that emphasise policy learning, and information and knowledge sharing. The evolution of this multi-level institutional and social milieu produces policy deficiencies that provide the setting for the discursive construction of ‘transitness’. The research is grounded in a meta-theoretical method that seeks to bridge rational and constructivist variants of institutional analysis.
