5|$|Biden became ranking {{minority}} {{member of}} the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1981. In 1984, he was Democratic <b>floor</b> <b>manager</b> for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act; civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the Act's provisions, {{and it was his}} most important legislative accomplishment at that point in time. He first considered running for president in that year, after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's <b>floor</b> <b>manager,</b> William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|On Why Don't You?, Davies took on varying jobs, {{including}} researcher, director, illustrator, assistant <b>floor</b> <b>manager</b> and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He {{was offered}} his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office {{to collect his}} wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the Why Don't You? protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter Ben Slade, were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.|$|E

At {{the site of the}} alleged foxfire, the agents find the ground burnt and a witch's peg staked into the ground. Arens, the local sheriff, arrives and disclaims anything unusual occurring in Dudley. After visiting Kearns' wife, Doris, the agents discover {{that he was about to}} recommend a local chicken plant, Chaco Chicken, to be closed down for several health violations. While giving the agents a tour of the plant, <b>floor</b> <b>manager</b> Jess Harold claims that Kearns held a vendetta against Chaco Chicken. After hearing this, a hallucinatory Paula, who works at the plant, grabs and holds Harold at knife point. Mulder and Scully attempt to reason with Paula until she is shot and killed by Sheriff Arens. The plant's physician, Dr. Vance Randolph, later claims that Paula was suffering from consistent headaches, which Kearns had also reported.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would {{have a good chance}} of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant <b>floor</b> <b>manager</b> for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that it would turn to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E

500|$|Persons [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] are {{entitled}} to equal protection from a state. Largely because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, the Supreme Court has rarely construed the phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] in relation to natural persons. In Plyler v. Doe (1982), where the Court held that aliens illegally present in a state are within its jurisdiction and may thus raise equal protection claims the Court explicated {{the meaning of the}} phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] as follows: [...] "se of the phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a State's territory."

Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm <b>floor</b> <b>manager</b> himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top.

These unpredictable risks not only involve stringent requirements regarding the replenishment of materials but also increase the difficulty in preparing material stock. In this paper, a real-time production operations decision support system (RPODS) is proposed for solving stochastic production material demand problems. Based on Poon et al. (2009), three additional tests are proposed to evaluate RFID reading performance. Besides, by using RPODS, the real-time status of production and warehouse operations are monitored by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, and a genetic algorithm (GA) technique is applied to formulate feasible solutions for tackling these stochastic production demand problems. The capability of the RPODS is demonstrated in a mould manufacturing company. Through the case study, the objectives of reducing the effect of stochastic production demand problems and enhancing productivity both {{on the shop floor}} and in the warehouse are achieved.
