40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} spatial and {{temporal}} variability of the climatic parameters and their consequence on the <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> of streams Bô and Débo and on the refill of the ground-water sheet in Soubré area. Methodology used is articulated around {{the study of the}} hydrological assessment according to Thornthwaite in the two catchments, the study of the seasonal and interannual variability of the climatic variables and the study of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> by the determination of the coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> and the mobilized volumes as well as their evolution. The hydrological assessment reveals that evapotranspiration is very active in the area of Soubré and has particularly contributed to reduce water resources of the area. Indeed, on the totality of rainfall, only 5. 24 % joined the underground network to refill the groundwater. The evolution of the curves of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> reveals that, in Débo and Bô catchments, <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> lasts in general between 30 and 160 days. The coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> in the both watersheds knew a rise of 1983 to 1991. Since 1991 there has been a relative decline in these coefficients. Thus, the coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> continued to increase in recent years inversely with volumes participating in the reduction of water resources in the area and affecting in a pejorative way the groundwater refill...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all <b>dried</b> <b>up</b> over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

At {{the time it was}} rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money <b>dried</b> <b>up</b> in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E

American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.|$|E

5|$|Temple-building {{continued}} into the third centuryAD, but as the empire weakened, imperial donations to the temple cults <b>dried</b> <b>up.</b> Cult activities continued, relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities. In the following centuries, Christian emperors issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples. Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the Serapeum and other temples in Alexandria in AD 391 or 392. Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuriesAD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.|$|E
