5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and <b>duplicatus.</b> Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, <b>duplicatus</b> (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is {{sometimes}} found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrus <b>duplicatus</b> is {{a variety}} of cirrus cloud. The name cirrus <b>duplicatus</b> is derived from Latin, meaning [...] "double". The <b>duplicatus</b> variety of cirrus clouds occurs when {{there are at least}} two layers of cirrus clouds. Most of the time, occurrences of cirrus {{fibratus}} and cirrus uncinus are in the <b>duplicatus</b> form. Like stratus clouds, cirrus clouds are often seen in the <b>duplicatus</b> form.|$|E
50|$|Stratocumulus <b>Duplicatus</b> clouds {{appear as}} {{stratocumulus}} clouds {{with two or}} more layers or sheets. Stratocumulus <b>duplicatus</b> is common on species lenticularis or lenticular cloud.|$|E

5000|$|Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus (arranged in {{parallel}} bands) is sometimes {{seen with the}} stratformis and castellanus species. Altocumulus stratiformis radiatus of any opacity is coded CM5 if it is increasing in amount. The <b>duplicatus</b> or undulatus varieties are occasionally seen with the stratiformis and lenticularis species. [...] Altocumulus stratiformis <b>duplicatus</b> is coded CM7 {{if it is not}} overridden by another coding of higher importance. Lacunosus is very occasionally associated with altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, or floccus.|$|E
50|$|The {{species name}} {{is derived from}} the Latin <b>duplicatus</b> (meaning repeat, double), in {{reference}} to the characteristic dual lobes of the male gnathos.|$|E
50|$|Astropecten <b>duplicatus,</b> the two-spined sea star, is a starfish in {{the family}} Astropectinidae. It {{is found in the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Astropecten <b>duplicatus</b> {{normally}} {{has five}} long slender, tapering arms which are flattened dorso-ventrally. The aboral (upper) surface {{has a single}} row of large marginal plates {{around the edges of}} the arms. These are granular, and the two that are closest to the disc each bear a conical spine, although this is often worn away. Other marginal plates and the plates on the oral (lower) surface bear many fine blunt spinules. The tube feet are pointed and have no suckers. Astropecten <b>duplicatus</b> grows to about 20 cm in diameter. The aboral surface is pale grey or reddish-brown and the oral surface is pale brown or orange.|$|E
50|$|Astropecten <b>duplicatus</b> {{spends the}} day semi-immersed in the {{sediment}} on the seabed. It is a carnivore {{and at night}} it hunts for bivalve molluscs and gastropods. It transfers its prey to its mouth with its arms, and swallows it whole, later regurgitating any undigested fragments.|$|E
50|$|Phallus <b>duplicatus</b> is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and fruit}} bodies grow singly {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} woods, gardens, and landscaped areas. The smelly gleba coating the cap attracts flies and other insects that consume it and help to disperse the spores.|$|E
50|$|Astropecten <b>duplicatus</b> is {{native to}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Its range extends from Cape Hatteras, Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas to Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Guyana. It is found on sand or other soft sediments and in {{seagrass}} meadows at depths down to about 500 m.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} from Asia (China and Japan), eastern North America, and South America (Brazil). The species was {{featured}} in a Paraguayan postage stamp in 1986. Although it has been widely recorded from Europe, some of these may be misidentifications with the similar Phallus impudicus var. togatus. Phallus <b>duplicatus</b> is Red Listed in the Ukraine.|$|E
5000|$|Varieties: Cirrostratus {{species have}} no opacity-based {{varieties}} {{as they are}} always translucent. Two pattern-based varieties are sometimes seen with the species fibratus. These are the closely spaced <b>duplicatus</b> and wavy undulatus types similar to those seen with cirrus fibratus. [...] Pattern-based varieties are not commonly associated with the species nebulosus due to its lack of features.|$|E
5000|$|A {{different}} {{variety of}} cirrus spissatus also forms from phenomena {{that have nothing}} to do with cumulonimbus blow-off or dissipating cumulonimbus cells needed [...] When dense cirrus is formed by means other than by cumulonimbus blow-off or dissipating cumulonimbus clouds, it will frequently be seen as many dense patches at different levels (cirrus spissatus <b>duplicatus),</b> often mixed with thin cirrus filamentsneeded. Another variety, cirrus spissatus intortus, is sometimes described as looking like [...] "entangled sheaves" [...] of cirrus clouds. When viewed toward the sun, the denser patches often have gray bases.|$|E
5000|$|Phallus <b>duplicatus</b> (common name, netted stinkhorn or wood witch) is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family. The {{bell-shaped}} to oval cap is green-brown, the cylindrical stalk is white. When mature the cap becomes sticky with a slimy green coating that attracts flies that disperse its spores, {{and it has a}} distinct, [...] "netted" [...] universal veil. The fungus is edible when still in the [...] "egg" [...] stage, before the fruit body has expanded. It grows often in public lawns, and can also be found in meadows.|$|E
50|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and <b>duplicatus.</b> Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body.

Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5000|$|Phallus {{multicolor}} {{is similar}} in overall appearance, {{but it has a}} more brightly coloured cap, stem and indusium, and it is usually smaller. It is found in Australia, Guam, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Zaire, and Tobago [...] as well as Hawaii. The cap of the Indo-Pacific species P. merulinus appears smooth when covered with gleba, and is pale and wrinkled once the gleba has worn off. In contrast, the cap surface of P. indusiatus tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under the gleba. Also, the indusium of P. merulinus is more delicate and shorter than that of P. indusiatus, and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight. Common in eastern North America and Japan, and widely recorded in Europe, the species P. <b>duplicatus</b> has a smaller indusium that hangs 3 - 6 cm {{from the bottom of the}} cap, and sometimes collapses against the stalk.|$|E
50|$|Another variety, <b>duplicatus</b> (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is {{sometimes}} found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.CombinationsIt is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based and the other is pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: Ips <b>duplicatus</b> and I. typographus are two serious pests of spruce in Europe. They {{have similar}} bionomics {{and are likely}} to occur andmeet on the same host trees. One could hypothesize that the two species support similar levels of similar pathogens, but Larssoniella duplicati is species-specific for I. <b>duplicatus.</b> Materials and Methods: To test this hypothesis, we {{collected}} mature beetles fromtwo felled s pruce trees and determined their pathogen infection levels. Results and Conclusions: In total, 857 mature I. <b>duplicatus</b> beetles and 349 I. typographus were dissected. Two microsporidian pathogens were detected. Chytridiopsis typographi was found in both species of bark beetles, while Larssoniella duplicati was found only in Ips <b>duplicatus.</b> Therefore, itmay still be considered that L. duplicati is species-specific for I. <b>duplicatus.</b> There {{were no significant differences between}} sample trees in pathogen infection levels in bark beetles...|$|E

40|$|Ips <b>duplicatus</b> with I. typographus co-inhabiting Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) {{would benefit}} from a {{pheromone}} blend distinct {{from that of the}} larger competitor I. typographus. GC-MS analysis showed that I. <b>duplicatus</b> males feeding in the host produced ipsdienol (Id), cis-verbenol (cV), trans-verbenol (tV), myrtenol (Mt), and E-myrcenol (EM) and traces of 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 - 01 (MB). I. <b>duplicatus</b> produced Id in approximately racemic form (48. 9 - 54. 5 % (+) -(S) -isomer). The amounts of Id and EM released over a 9 day period had a maximum of 250 and 5 ng/h/male, respectively, on day 2. Exposure of I. <b>duplicatus</b> males to myrcene and a-pinene resulted in the production of small amounts of Id, cV, tV, Mt, and trans-pinocarveol, but not of EM.

40|$|During an {{outbreak}} {{in the second}} half of the 1990 s, the infestation pattern of I. <b>duplicatus</b> on standing trees in the Silesian Upland (southern Poland), was seen to be different from the pattern observed in the north-eastern spruce range. The "southern" type can be characterised by (i) the abundance of I. <b>duplicatus</b> galleries in lower parts of stems (including the basal parts of stems), and (ii) co-occurrence and high spatial competition with I. typographus. The "southern" type of infestation seems to be temporal in nature, related to the high abundance of I. <b>duplicatus</b> during the progradation and culmination phase of its outbreak.

40|$|The double-spined spruce {{engraver}} Ips <b>duplicatus</b> is {{not present}} in Belgium and France. In summer 2003, several adult Ips <b>duplicatus</b> beetles were caught near quays in Herstal (Liege) during a survey. Large volumes of spruce logs, from Russia and the Baltic countries, had been imported to the immediate locality where the beetles had been caught. Thus, it is most likely that the capture specimens were introduced with these consignments. FLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ips <b>duplicatus</b> is an {{important}} pest of Norway spruce (Picea abies) planted outside of its natural range. This species uses olfactory signals to identify the spruce trees favourable for colonisation. The knowledge of the beetlesâ€™ response to these stimuli is important for managing this pest. Therefore, the response of Ips <b>duplicatus</b> to a specific synthetic pheromone was investigated under some natural sources of volatile emissions characteristic of Norway spruce. The pheromone traps were installed in two types of forests: one with fresh and large Norway spruce stumps and piles of branches, releasing large amounts of host volatile substances (terpenes and alcohols) and one without such fresh material. The experiment was repeated in three pairs of sites located in plantations out of the natural range of Norway spruce. Finally {{it was found that}} Ips <b>duplicatus</b> beetles, regardless of sex, have been concentrated in areas where large amounts of fresh material were available, confirming that Ips <b>duplicatus</b> beetles are using both natural pheromones and specific host volatiles as olfactory stimuli in searching for breeding material...|$|E
40|$|Ips <b>duplicatus</b> {{adults were}} sampled with pheromone-baited black window-slot traps (Theysohn) in 70 - to 100 -year old Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands between 280 and 650 m a. s. l. {{in the eastern}} Czech Republic and {{southern}} Poland during 2000 â€“ 2010. Sets of 5 â€“ 12 traps were placed about 20 m {{from the edge of}} the infested forest. Each trap was baited with a standard synthetic pheromone lure (ID Ecolure), and was setup 1. 5 â€“ 2. 0 m above the ground. The objectives were to determine the relationship between the numbers of adults trapped in the overwintered generation and those in the offspring generation. According to data from 135 traps, the numbers of overwintered beetles captured in spring (Aprilâ€“June) were significantly higher than the numbers captured in summer (Julyâ€“August), but the numbers of offspring beetles captured in summer were significantly correlated with the numbers overwintered beetles captured in spring. The spring captures can be used to estimate the threat caused by I. <b>duplicatus</b> during the whole vegetation season. The traps installed in summer should be used to determine the peaks in the bark beetle flight activity, thus enabling early identification of trees infested by I. <b>duplicatus,</b> especially inside stands.
