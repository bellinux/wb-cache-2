25|$|Iron {{deficiency}} anemia, {{which increases}} in prevalence as kidney function decreases, is especially prevalent in those requiring <b>haemodialysis.</b> It is multifactoral in cause, but includes increased inflammation, reduction in erythropoietin, and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression.|$|E
25|$|When using 2HRZ/4HR in {{patients}} on dialysis, the drugs {{should be given}} daily during the initial high-intensity phase. In the continuation phase, the drugs should be given {{at the end of}} each <b>haemodialysis</b> session and no dose should be taken on non-dialysis days.|$|E
25|$|The UD {{method was}} firstly {{introduced}} in 1995. It was extensively {{used to measure}} flow and volumes with extracorporeal circuit conditions, such as ECMO and <b>Haemodialysis,</b> leading more than 150 peer reviewed publications. UD has now been adapted to intensive care units (ICU) as the COstatus device.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on <b>haemodialysis.</b> Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E
25|$|Like other TCAs, doxepin {{is highly}} toxic {{in cases of}} overdose. Mild {{symptoms}} include drowsiness, stupor, blurred vision, and excessive dryness of mouth. More serious adverse effects include respiratory depression, hypotension, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Urinary retention, decreased gastrointestinal motility (paralytic ileus), hyperthermia (or hypothermia), hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperactive reflexes are other possible symptoms of doxepin overdose. Management of overdose is mostly supportive and symptomatic, and can include the administration of a gastric lavage so as to reduce absorption of the doxepin. Supportive measures to prevent respiratory aspiration is also advisable. Antiarrhythmic agents may be an appropriate measure to treat cardiac arrhythmias resulting from doxepin overdose. Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine may reverse some of the toxic effects of overdose such as anticholinergic effects. <b>Haemodialysis</b> is not recommended due to {{the high degree of}} protein binding with doxepin. ECG monitoring is recommended for several days after doxepin overdose due to the potential for cardiac conduction abnormalities.|$|E
2500|$|Pyrazinamide is {{routinely}} used in pregnancy in the UK {{and the rest}} of the world; [...] the WHO recommend its use in pregnancy; and there is extensive clinical experience to show that it is safe. [...] In the U.S., pyrazinamide is not used in pregnancy, citing insufficient evidence of safety. [...] Pyrazinamide is removed by <b>haemodialysis</b> and therefore doses should always be given at the end of a dialysis session.|$|E

2500|$|Ingestion of Roundup {{ranging from}} 85 to 200 ml (of 41% solution) has {{resulted}} in death within hours of ingestion, although {{it has also been}} ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. Consumption of over 85 ml of concentrated product are likely to cause serious symptoms in adults including burns due to corrosive effects as well as kidney and liver damage. More severe cases cause [...] "respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, renal failure requiring <b>haemodialysis,</b> metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia" [...] and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias.|$|E
2500|$|Plasma level {{monitoring}} of vancomycin is necessary {{due to the}} drug's biexponential distribution, intermediate hydrophilicity, and potential for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in populations with poor renal function and/or increased propensity to bacterial infection. Vancomycin activity {{is considered to be}} time-dependent; that is, antimicrobial activity depends on the duration that the serum drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [...] of the target organism. Thus, peak serum levels have not been shown to correlate with efficacy or toxicity; indeed, concentration monitoring is unnecessary in most cases. Circumstances in which therapeutic drug monitoring [...] is warranted include: patients receiving concomitant aminoglycoside therapy, patients with (potentially) altered pharmacokinetic parameters, patients on <b>haemodialysis,</b> patients administered high-dose or prolonged treatment, and patients with impaired renal function. In such cases, trough concentrations are measured.|$|E
