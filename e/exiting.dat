5|$|East of the mall, {{the route}} passes through {{increasingly}} rural areas, {{with the exception}} of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY250 and the Wayne County line. NY31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural town of Macedon to the village of the same name. Prior to <b>exiting</b> the village, NY31 meets the southern terminus of NY350 and the eastern terminus of NY31F. The highway continues on, <b>exiting</b> the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In Palmyra, NY31 joins NY21 through the center of the village.|$|E

50|$|<b>Exits</b> {{are well}} indicated, with signs {{far ahead of}} <b>exits.</b> There are {{frequent}} signs that announce the next three <b>exits.</b> At each <b>exit,</b> there is a sign with {{the distance to the}} next <b>exit.</b> <b>Exit</b> signs are also posted 3000 m, 2000 m, 1000 m, and 500 m ahead of the <b>exit,</b> immediately before the <b>exit,</b> and at the <b>exit</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|In Alameda County, {{the freeway}} {{begins in the}} city of Fremont, where it intersects SR 262, which was {{unsigned}} until 2000. Continuing through the city, it meets Mission Boulevard at SR 238 before <b>exiting</b> the city. Prior to 2002, two ghost ramps existed here, remains of an abandoned freeway project replacing Mission Blvd. Amid Alameda County, it abruptly turns northeastward and enters a hilly area, where it crosses over Mission Pass, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it runs concurrently with SR 84 for a short while. Afterwards, it enters Pleasanton and intersects with I-580, currently California's longest auxiliary interstate providing access to Oakland and the Central Valley. It enters Dublin for a short segment before <b>exiting</b> the county and entering Contra Costa County.|$|E

50|$|Although I-345 {{uses its}} own mileposts, the <b>exit</b> {{numbering}} is not consistent. The <b>exit</b> {{numbers on the}} northbound stretch count upwards from the I-45 numbers (the <b>exit</b> for Spur 366 being labeled as <b>exit</b> 286A), while on the southbound stretch the Spur 366 <b>exit</b> is numbered <b>exit</b> 1A, followed by the <b>exit</b> for Ross Avenue numbered <b>exit</b> 285.|$|R

50|$|There is no <b>exit</b> zero. If {{there is}} an <b>exit</b> within 1.499 km of the origin, <b>Exit</b> 1 is used. <b>Exit</b> 2 would be between 1.500 and 2.499 km of the origin. Subsequent 'exit zones' are at 1 km intervals. Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, or where two or more <b>exits</b> exist within the same <b>exit</b> zone. For example, State Highway 1 (Southern Motorway) has an <b>Exit</b> 429A (Symonds St), <b>Exit</b> 429B (Wellesley St) and <b>Exit</b> 429C (Port). Instead of {{replacing}} existing ramp and link signs, the <b>exit</b> numbers were added as supplementary information. Thus drivers can navigate either by <b>exit</b> number or name. <b>Exit</b> numbers are only used for <b>exits</b> {{that may be used}} by all vehicle types. Bus- or emergency vehicle-only <b>exits</b> would not be numbered.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} <b>exits,</b> the East <b>Exit,</b> which leads to <b>Exit</b> 2 and <b>Exit</b> 3, and the West <b>Exit,</b> which leads to <b>Exit</b> 1 and <b>Exit</b> 4. <b>Exit</b> 1 and 4 are closed after 11 pm and before 6 am. The East <b>Exit</b> two up {{escalator}}s, one for each platform, but only the escalator for <b>Exit</b> 3 supports wheelchairs. The West <b>Exit</b> has two escalators, one for each platform, and they both support wheelchairs. The two platforms are Platform 1, with trains bound for Nagoya Station, Sakae Station, and Fujigaoka Station, and Platform 2, with trains bound for Nakamura Koen Station and Takabata Station. There are station staff {{at the gates of}} the East <b>Exit.</b> There is currently no elevator but one is under construction, and because of that, <b>Exit</b> 4 has been closed since December 1st of 2001 and is planned to re-open on March 15th of 2011. There are bathrooms near <b>Exit</b> 2. Both the East <b>Exit</b> and West <b>Exit</b> have a public telephone.|$|R
50|$|The {{main road}} of the New Jersey Turnpike splits from I-295 in Carneys Point Township and runs a {{north-northeast}} route to Ridgefield Park, {{where the road}} continues as I-95. It is designated Route 700, an unsigned route, from <b>exit</b> 1 (Delaware Memorial Bridge) to <b>exit</b> 6, and as I-95 from <b>exit</b> 6 (Mansfield Township) to <b>exit</b> 18 (Secaucus/Carlstadt). The number of lanes ranges from 4 lanes south of <b>exit</b> 4 (Mount Laurel Township), 6 lanes between <b>exit</b> 4 and <b>exit</b> 6 (Mansfield Township), 12 lanes between <b>exit</b> 6 and <b>exit</b> 11 (Woodbridge Township), and 14 lanes between <b>exit</b> 11 and <b>exit</b> 14 (Newark).|$|R

5|$|Upon <b>exiting</b> Lackawanna County, Spring Brook enters Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It {{receives}} the tributary Monument Creek {{from the left}} and turns north-northwest for a few miles, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 502. On this stretch, it leaves behind the hills that it flows through, crosses Pennsylvania Route 502, and exits Luzerne County. Upon <b>exiting</b> Luzerne County, the stream enters Moosic, Lackawanna County and continues flowing north-northwest and {{receives the}} tributary Covey Swamp Creek from the right. The stream then turns west-southwest for a short distance before turning south and then west, crossing Interstate 81. It then turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing US Route 11 before reaching its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|As well as this, {{an entire}} {{sequence}} involving Tremble {{going to the}} front for the underground James Bond training school (which {{turns out to be}} under Harrods, of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble <b>exiting</b> the lift into the training school.|$|E
