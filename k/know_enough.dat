However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict.

25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, {{but most}} voters {{said they did}} not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|E
25|$|While the Champenois {{and their}} French clients {{preferred}} their Champagne to be pale and still, the British were developing {{a taste for}} the unique bubbly wine. The sparkling version of Champagne continued to grow in popularity, especially among the wealthy and royal. Following the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715, the court of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans made the sparkling version of Champagne a favorite among the French nobility. More Champenois wine makers attempted to make their wines sparkle deliberately, but didn't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about how to control the process or how to make wine bottles strong enough to withstand the pressure.|$|E

500|$|Film {{critic and}} {{director}} François Truffaut wrote that [...] "Before Kane, nobody in Hollywood {{knew how to}} set music properly in movies. Kane was the first, in fact the only, great film that uses radio techniques.... A lot of filmmakers <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> to follow Auguste Renoir's advice to fill the eyes with images at all costs, but only Orson Welles understood that the sound track had to be filled in the same way." [...] Cedric Belfrage of The Clipper wrote [...] "of all of the delectable flavours that linger on the palate after seeing Kane, the use of sound is the strongest." ...|$|E

Christophe Beck, a regular {{composer}} for the series, filled in the overture and coda and composed [...] "Dawn's Ballet". Whedon is a fan of Stephen Sondheim, and used him as the inspiration for much of the music, particularly with the episode's ambiguous ending. Cast member James Marsters (Spike) said, [...] "Some of Joss' music is surprisingly complicated. Maybe it's a Beatles thing. He doesn't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> to know what he can't do and he's smashing rules." ...|$|E

500|$|Lynch {{wrote in}} 1977 that The Homosexual Matrix [...] "had been widely criticized for many reasons", {{including}} for largely ignoring {{the gay rights}} movement and for expressing a negative view of women. According to Lynch, Tripp stated {{in an interview with}} Keith Howes in Gay News that he had not written about the gay liberation movement because he did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about it to be able to discuss the subject, that he was amazed at the accusation of sexism directed against his book, and that he believed the [...] "gay press" [...] had reacted with embarrassment to it, while Howes suggested that Tripp was hurt by the negative reaction to his book from some gay people.|$|E
500|$|Maria Theresa {{found herself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. She did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about [...] matters of state and she {{was unaware of the}} weakness of her father's ministers. She decided to rely on her father's advice to retain his councillors and defer to her husband, whom she considered to be more experienced, on other matters. Both decisions, though natural, later gave cause for regret. Ten years later, Maria Theresa recalled in her Political Testament the circumstances under which she had ascended: [...] "I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them at first wanted to wait and see how things would develop." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{criticism}} of Vrba {{stems from the}} tension between what Ruth Linn calls survivor and expert discourse. Bauer referred to Vrba's memoir as [...] "not a memoir in the usual sense", alleging that it [...] "contains excerpts of conversations of {{which there is no}} chance that they are accurate and it has elements of a second-hand story that does not necessarily correspond with reality". When writing about himself and his personal experiences, Vrba's account is an important and true one, Bauer wrote, but he argued that Vrba was not justified in seeing himself as an expert on Holocaust history. Vrba often dismissed the opinion of historians. Regarding the numbers killed at Auschwitz, he said that Bauer and historian Raul Hilberg did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about the history of Auschwitz.|$|E

500|$|The safety {{concerns}} regarding the LHC collisions have attracted widespread media attention. Various widely circulated newspapers have reported doomsday fears {{in connection with}} the collider, including The Times, The Guardian, The Independent, The Sydney Morning Herald, and Time. Among other media sources, CNN mentioned that [...] "Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise," [...] but it assured its readers with comments from scientists like John Huth, who said that it was [...] "baloney". MSNBC said that, [...] "there are more serious things to worry about" [...] and allayed fears that [...] "the atom-smasher might set off earthquakes or other dangerous rumblings". The results of an online survey it conducted [...] "indicate that a lot of [...] <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> not to panic". The BBC stated, [...] "the scientific consensus appears to be on the side of CERN's theorists" [...] who say the LHC poses [...] "no conceivable danger". Brian Greene in the New York Times reassured readers by saying, [...] "If a black hole is produced under Geneva, might it swallow Switzerland and continue on a ravenous rampage until the Earth is devoured? It’s a reasonable question with a definite answer: no." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} it on behalf of Tor.com, comparing it to [...] "The Naked Time" [...] and stating that [...] "there's nothing in this episode as entertaining as Sulu bare-chested with an epee, and Wesley being nerdy in the engine room is nowhere near as much fun as Riley singing." [...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about these people for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate The Next Generation found plenty" [...] while [...] "viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching," [...] and gave it a score of D+.|$|E
500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more negative. The same poll showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated that they did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> about the lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the owners and players. Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity. Stern said that he had made concessions in the agreement, while Hunter said that the parties [...] "both blinked." ...|$|E
