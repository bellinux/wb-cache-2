40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to investigate the}} bending stress in aerospace-quality spiral bevel gears was performed. Tests were conducted in the NASA Lewis Spiral Bevel Gear Test Facility. Multiple teeth on the spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> were instrumented with strain gages and tests were conducted from static (slow roll) to 14400 RPM at power levels to 540 kW (720 hp). Effects of changing speed and load on the bending stress were measured. Experimental results are compared to those found by three-dimensional finite element analysis...|$|R

50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown wheel (ring gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{resulting from}} a cracked spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> was recorded and analyzed using existing Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) techniques. A tooth on the input pinion to a Bell OH- 58 main rotor gearbox was notched and run {{for an extended period}} at severe over-torque condition to facilitate a tooth fracture. Thirteen vibration-based diagnostic metrics were calculated throughout the run. After 101. 41 hours of run time, some of the metrics indicated damage. At that point a visual inspection did not reveal any damage. The pinion was then run for another 12 minutes until a proximity probe indicated that a tooth had fractured. This paper discusses the damage detection effectiveness of the different metrics and a comparison of effects of the different accelerometer locations...|$|R

5000|$|An Eland's gearbox has one reverse and six forward gears. It is crosswise, {{coupled to}} {{both sides of the}} <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion.</b> Drive is {{transmitted}} from the gearbox to two lateral transfer boxes via pinions to the rear wheels and drive shafts that follow the hull to the front wheels. The shafts have extra universal joints beneath the turret. Each shaft drives a second cam type differential which bar either of the two wheel pairs from exerting a speed radically different from the other. In this respect Elands are less likely to experience transmission fouls and tyre wear than other armoured cars with a single central differential. The Panhard electric clutch, a major stumbling block for inexperienced drivers, [...] {{has been replaced by a}} more concurrent hydraulic system for easier maintenance and reduced crew training time.|$|R
40|$|A {{diagnostic}} tool {{was developed for}} detecting fatigue damage to rolling element bearings in an OH- 58 main rotor transmission. Two different monitoring technologies, oil debris analysis and vibration, were integrated using data fusion into a health monitoring system for detecting bearing surface fatigue pitting damage. This integrated system showed improved detection and decision-making capabilities as compared to using individual monitoring technologies. This {{diagnostic tool}} was evaluated by collecting vibration and oil debris data from tests performed in the NASA Glenn 500 hp Helicopter Transmission Test Stand. Data was collected during experiments performed in this test rig when two unanticipated bearing failures occurred. Results show that combining the vibration and oil debris measurement technologies improves the detection of pitting damage on spiral bevel gears duplex ball bearings and spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> triplex ball bearings in a main rotor transmission...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper synthesizes a {{whole of}} work {{carried out on}} the spiral bevel gears from {{quasi-static}} and dynamic models viewpoint. A sophisticated quasi-static model {{makes it possible to}} calculate the tooth loads, the pressures, the instant mesh stiffness, and the deflections on the flanks of spiral bevel gears. Based on these results, two three-dimensional lumped parameter dynamic models are presented. The mechanical system under consideration comprises: a spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> and gear connected by a time-varying non-linear mesh stiffness function, and mounted on two shafts simulated by Timoshenko's beams supported by bearings. Two variants are considered which rely on different contact stiffness simulations: (a) using an averaged mesh stiffness function acting at the centroid of the loaded areas on tooth flanks and (b) a more local approach based on a discrete distribution of the local mesh stiffness, elements over the contact areas. A number of results are presented and commented which illustrate the interest of these dynamic models...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part, the {{alternative}} {{formulation of the}} theory of gearing presented in [F. Di Puccio, M. Gabiccini, M. Guiggiani, Alternative formulation {{of the theory of}} gearing, Mechanism and Machine Theory 40 (5) (2005) 613 â€“ 637] is generalized to cope with the case of modified roll and translating axes of the mating surfaces, that is with a setting typical of some computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine. The peculiarity of the proposed approach is that it always deals with vectors as such, thus avoiding the need of a chain of reference systems, necessary when components are used as in the traditional method. It results in a more compact and clearer formulation. In the second part the proposed approach is applied to obtain the normal curvatures and geodesic torsions of two conjugate surfaces in a way that fully exploits the rigid-body relative motions involved in gear generation. In order to prove the ease of use and effectiveness of the proposed approach, the curvature analysis of a spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> generated on a CNC face-milling machine is performed...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{right angle}} gear drive design where helical and spiral bevel gears are being used. Because of the high speed ratio (1800 / 18, input/output), three {{reductions}} were applied. Two helical gear sets {{were used in the}} first and second reductions (one each), and a spiral bevel set was used at the final reduction. The gears were mounted on four shafts, with the first and last shafts (output and input shafts) carrying one gear each straddle mounted, and the second and third shafts carrying two gears each, overhung mounted. The design was based on a criterion that was set for every element and was carried out in sequence; i. e. gears, shafts, bearings and housing. The high speed shaft and the <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> shaft were made one piece with the pinions. The housing was made out of three parts: The main housing, which is to house the bevel gear set and to hold the oil; the high speed housing, which is to house the high speed helical gear set and support the high speed bearings; and the rear cover, which is to house the intermediate gear set (second reduction) ...|$|R
50|$|Hypoid gears {{resemble}} {{spiral bevel}} gears except the shaft axes do not intersect. The pitch surfaces appear conical but, {{to compensate for the}} offset shaft, are in fact hyperboloids of revolution. Hypoid gears are almost always designed to operate with shafts at 90 degrees. Depending on which side the shaft is offset to, relative to the angling of the teeth, contact between hypoid gear teeth may be even smoother and more gradual than with spiral bevel gear teeth, but also have a sliding action along the meshing teeth as it rotates and therefore usually require some of the most viscous types of gear oil to avoid it being extruded from the mating tooth faces, the oil is normally designated HP (for hypoid) followed by a number denoting the viscosity. Also, the pinion can be designed with fewer teeth than a spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion,</b> with the result that gear ratios of 60:1 and higher are feasible using a single set of hypoid gears. This style of gear is most common in motor vehicle drive trains, in concert with a differential. Whereas a regular (nonhypoid) ring-and-pinion gear set is suitable for many applications, it is not ideal for vehicle drive trains because it generates more noise and vibration than a hypoid does. Bringing hypoid gears to market for mass-production applications was an engineering improvement of the 1920s.|$|R
40|$|This project investigates {{computational}} {{modeling of}} fatigue crack growth in spiral bevel gears. Current {{work is a}} continuation of the previous efforts made to use the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to simulate tooth-bending fatigue failure in spiral bevel gears. This report summarizes new results predicting crack trajectory and fatigue life for a spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>pinion</b> using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Predicting crack trajectories is important in determining the failure mode of a gear. Cracks propagating through the rim may result in catastrophic failure, whereas the gear may remain intact if one tooth fails and this may allow for early detection of failure. Being able to predict crack trajectories is insightful for the designer. However, predicting growth of three-dimensional arbitrary cracks is complicated due to the difficulty of creating three-dimensional models, the computing power required, and absence of closed- form solutions of the problem. Another focus of this project was performing three-dimensional contact analysis of a spiral bevel gear set incorporating cracks. These analyses were significant in determining the influence of change of tooth flexibility due to crack growth on the magnitude and location of contact loads. This is an important concern since change in contact loads might lead to differences in SIFs and therefore result in alteration of the crack trajectory. Contact analyses performed in this report showed the expected trend of decreasing tooth loads carried by the cracked tooth with increasing crack length. Decrease in tooth loads lead to differences between SIFs extracted from finite element contact analysis and finite element analysis with Hertz contact loads. This effect became more pronounced as the crack grew...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{machining}} {{spiral bevel}} gear (SBGs) on Numerical Control (NC) machine tools has attracted much research attention. This paper presents a new precise SBGs CAD/CAM model with Loop subdivision algorithm. The involute surfaces for spiral <b>bevel</b> gears and <b>pinions</b> are first modelled with parametric surfaces. From them {{and a set of}} parameters, an initial mesh model is created for gear surfaces. This mesh model is then used as a base for a subdivision surface. The precision of subdivision surfaces can be exactly controlled by a subdivision process which can generate enough machining points on the designed tooth surface model. As a result, all meshing points of the tooth surface for a pair of gear and pinion can be applied on NC machines for higher-precision surface manufacturing. This novel SBGs CAD/CAM modelling method has been evaluated with precision. The precise model could be extended to hypoid gear and other complex surface design...|$|R
40|$|Fractography is {{a science}} of {{studying}} fracture surface characteristics. When engineering structure/component fails it leaves certain signatures on its surface. The study of these signatures {{with the help of}} Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) provides valuable information to (a) understand the failure process i. e. crack initiation and propagation directions (b) existence of loading conditions at the time of failure (c) underpin the causes of failure etc. In this paper, a few failure cases viz., failure of LPTR blade of aero engine, failure of engine of an aircraft, failure of roller shaft and input shaft of power steering, failure of <b>bevel</b> gear and <b>pinion</b> of engine gearbox were presented. The failure case studies amply show that fractographic study is inevitable for conducting successful failure analysis and accident investigation. Further, a typical fractographic features observed in CFRP composite laminates failed under different loading conditions were presented. This fractographic data obtained from laboratory control specimens extends SEM role in the analysis of composite material failures...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to find and develop methods that enhance and support the creation of evolvable master process plans with possibilities to challenge productivity and meet changing design requirements. The condition for achieving this is primarily that both the fundamental thinking and the results behind a process plan can be described. How should this be done? The focus is laid on process planning of gear transmission parts for heavy vehicles like trucks and coaches. Process planning is the activity where design and manufacturing are brought together with the common target to achieve both a competitive product and production process. There are many factors that influence the process planner when a new product or process shall be introduced for production. Process planning is, in most cases, performed by an experienced, skilled person but without any defined methodology or way of working. Much of the process planning {{is based on the}} retrieval of solutions already used. Much research effort has been devoted to developing systems for computer-aided process planning (CAPP). Yet CAPP systems have not been accepted and spread over a wide front within the manufacturing industry, much because of the functional incompleteness combined with the difficulties of adopting knowledge and changing requests. A method for systematic process planning is proposed as a way to perform and describe the procedure of creating a process plan. The method facilitates the interpretation and understanding of the plan, not only immediately for the process planner responsible, but also for designers, engineers, researchers and other interest groups involved in a manufacturing process. In the last chapter is a case study regarding manufacturing of a <b>bevel</b> gear <b>pinion</b> presented to exemplify use of the proposed method for systematic process planning. KUG...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} show a {{detailed}} analysis of the vibration signal from the destructive testing of a spiral <b>bevel</b> gear and <b>pinion</b> pair containing seeded faults. The vibration signal is analyzed in the time domain, frequency domain and with four time-frequency transforms: the Short Time Frequency Transform (STFT), the Wigner-Ville Distribution with the Choi-Williams kernel (WV-CW), the Continuous Wavelet' Transform (CWT) and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Vibration data of bevel gear tooth fatigue cracks, under a variety of operating load levels and damage conditions, are analyzed using these methods. A new metric for automatic anomaly detection is developed and can be produced from any systematic numerical representation of the vibration signals. This new metric reveals indications of gear damage with all of the time-frequency transforms, as well as time and frequency representations, on this data set. Analysis with the CWT detects changes in the signal at low torque levels not found with the other transforms. The WV-CW and CWT use considerably more resources than the STFT and the DWT. More testing of the new metric is needed to determine its value for automatic anomaly detection and to develop fault detection methods for the metric...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Roinson, H. J. The {{mechanical}} efficiency of a sweep horse power. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1897. Introduction: The {{mechanical efficiency}} of any machine or {{power is the}} useful work obtained, or in other words it is the work left after {{the function of the}} machine parts has been over come. It has become important at this day and age to know the efficiency of machines and powers, because those that are called for are the ones that will do the greatest amount of work with the least friction possible. The object of determining the efficiency of a sweep horse power was to find what percent of the work put into the power was lost by the gearing and bearings of the power. A one horse sweep power was secured and a series of tests made. The power selected was simple in construction, consisting of a master wheel or large bevel gear, which drove a small <b>bevel</b> gear or <b>pinion</b> to which a tumbling rod was attached. The object of the tumbling rod was to transmit the energy to some suitable place where it could be used. A dynamometer was attached to the sweep or lever arm of the power, and the horse allowed to pull on the dynamometer. A dynamometer is a device for measuring the power or force of any motor...|$|R
