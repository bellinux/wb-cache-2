5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA, Canada) {{began its}} Standard Offer Program, a {{precursor}} to the Green Energy Act, and the first in North America for distributed renewable projects of less than 10MW. The <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> guaranteed a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh {{over a period of}} twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced was sold to the OPA at the given rate.|$|E
5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project, in the United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff.</b>|$|E
50|$|Australia is a {{federation}} {{of states and}} territories. Each state has different laws regarding <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs.</b> The states {{have a range of}} policies from no <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs</b> to <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs</b> at more than double the normal consumer price of electricity. Some states are considering <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs</b> but have not yet enacted relevant legislation, or the legislation has not yet come into effect.

5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E
25|$|Experience has {{demonstrated}} that a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> is both the least expensive and {{the most effective means}} of developing solar power. Investors need certainty, which they receive from a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff.</b> California enacted a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> which began on February 14, 2008. Washington state has a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> of 15¢/kWh which increases to 54¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. Hawaii, Michigan, and Vermont also have feed in tariffs.|$|E
25|$|An SREC {{program is}} an {{alternative}} to the <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> model popular in Europe. The key difference between the two models is the market-based mechanism that drives the value of the SRECs, and therefore the value of the subsidy for solar. In a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> model, the government sets the value for the electricity produced by a solar facility. If the level is higher, more solar power is built and the program is more costly. If the <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> is set lower, less solar power is built and the program is ineffective. The problem with SRECs is a lack of certainty for investors. A <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> provides a known return on investment, while an SREC program provides a possible return on investment.|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of subsidies {{in the form of}} <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs</b> to foster the di¤usion of photovoltaics is recently being rediscussed in several countries. However, the difficulty to target tariffs may create a misalignment between protability and installed capacity of panels. Our analysis tackles this issue. First, we set a discrete choice investment model with <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs.</b> Second, on the basis of that microeconomic model, we calculate optimal trajectories of <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs</b> and installed capacity that minimize subsidy costs for the government. The model is calibrated to study the diffusion process of photovoltaics in Germany and to simulate its future developments, showing distortions with respect to the optimal deplyoment path in terms of <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariffs,</b> installed capacity and cost trajectories...|$|R
30|$|<b>Feed-in</b> <b>tariffs</b> are {{uncertain}} variables determined by government policies because policy-related variables are {{very hard to}} forecast.

25|$|The process only breaks long {{molecular}} chains into shorter ones, {{so small}} molecules such as carbon dioxide or methane cannot {{be converted to}} oil through this process. However, the methane in the feedstock is recovered and burned to heat the water that {{is an essential part}} of the process. In addition, the gas can be burned in a combined heat and power plant, consisting of a gas turbine which drives a generator to create electricity, and a heat exchanger to heat the process input water from the exhaust gas. The electricity can be sold to the power grid, for example under a <b>feed-in</b> <b>tariff</b> scheme. This also increases the overall efficiency of the process (already said to be over 85% of feedstock energy content).|$|E
