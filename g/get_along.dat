5|$|A {{mostly white}} breed {{with either a}} smooth, rough or broken coat, it {{conforms}} to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell.

It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.|$|E
5|$|Discontent {{against the}} king grew, however, and {{eventually}} affected also Edmund. The antagonism was largely caused by Edward's preference {{for his new}} favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father. In 1326, Edmund joined a rebellion led by Queen Isabella and Roger Mortimer, whereby Edward II was deposed. Edmund failed to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with the new administration, and in 1330 he was caught planning a new rebellion, and executed.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow {{never made it to}} America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The Horse of the Desert, still considered {{to be one of the}} best works written about the Arabian horse.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Evans was {{occasionally}} {{replaced by}} the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. Evans did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with Laughlin, which {{also contributed to the}} band's ill feeling toward Evans. By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.|$|E

50|$|The English Foxhound is a pack hound, therefore, it <b>gets</b> <b>along</b> {{well with}} other dogs and enjoys human companionship. It <b>gets</b> <b>along</b> with horses, children, and other pets, {{as it is}} a gentle, social, and {{tolerant}} breed. It is an active breed that enjoys tracking foxes and has the stamina to run all day with few breaks.|$|R
50|$|Jughead's {{other friends}} include Dilton Doiley and Moose Mason. Other than Dilton, Jughead {{probably}} <b>gets</b> <b>along</b> with Moose {{better than the}} other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose's girlfriend Midge). Jughead’s nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he <b>gets</b> <b>along</b> with Dilton.|$|R
5|$|The next morning, Ann fears {{she made}} out with {{someone at the}} party but cannot remember. She {{eventually}} learns she made out with Chris, who shows a romantic interest in her. Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two <b>get</b> <b>along</b> and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start to <b>get</b> <b>along,</b> Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's budget crisis was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E
5|$|The pilots' smaller stories {{actually}} make a bigger point, {{which is that}} we're all {{together in the same}} robot … Either we <b>get</b> <b>along</b> or we die. I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E
5|$|They can be playful {{with other}} dogs, and <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with horses. The breed {{standard}} requires that shyness {{be treated as}} a fault, although it states that this {{should not be confused with}} submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.|$|E

However, because of the strike, Thornton's business is in trouble, and he is forced to close the mill.|$|E
5|$|With a good {{level of}} {{socialisation}} {{at an early}} age, an American Cocker can <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed {{seems to have a}} perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.|$|E
5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it. When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not <b>get</b> <b>along.</b> This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's problems on the tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E

Though the pair had different personalities, Jack felt that Bobby began to drift away from the Charlton family following his marriage to Norma, who did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with their mother. Bobby did not see his mother after 1992 until her death on 25 March 1996 {{as a result of the}} feud, though he and Norma did attend her funeral. Though the two brothers remained distant, Jack presented Bobby with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement Award on 14 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training.

5|$|Irwin's {{major league}} career {{began when the}} Ruby Legs moved into the National League (NL) in 1880. He {{led the league in}} assists in his rookie season, and {{remained}} with the team through 1882, when it folded due to poor attendance. Irwin spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not <b>get</b> <b>along</b> well, and Sweeney left the team {{in the middle of the}} season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885.|$|E
5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset. Roger {{attended}} the Council of Reims in 1148 with Theobald, John of Salisbury, and possibly Thomas Becket. This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. While it was later recalled that Roger and Becket did not <b>get</b> <b>along,</b> {{there is no evidence}} of hatred between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{probably}} {{remained in}} the service of Louis XII until 1503, when Duke Ercole I of Ferrara hired him for the chapel there. One of the rare mentions of Josquin's personality survives from this time. Prior to hiring Josquin, one of Duke Ercole's assistants recommended that he hire Heinrich Isaac instead, since Isaac was easier to <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with, more companionable, was more willing to compose on demand, and would cost significantly less (120 ducats vs. 200). Ercole, however, chose Josquin.|$|E
