500|$|The band's {{third major}} {{overseas}} performance came in 1915 {{when it was}} engaged to appear at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Its reputation by then well-secured in the United States, the band remained stationed in California for nearly a year, during which time it performed 115 public concerts. During this time it again met John Philip Sousa, who on one occasion guest conducted the band and afterwards commented, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I {{thought it was the}} United States Marine Band." ...|$|E
500|$|When he said Jesus again I couldn't take it, and for {{the only}} time in my life I was discourteous, which I regret to this day. I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1902 Loving {{was tapped}} to {{organize}} the Philippine Constabulary Band {{on the recommendation of}} Governor-General of the Philippines William Howard Taft, who had earlier heard Loving's 45th regimental band perform. Loving, who had learned both Spanish and Tagalog during his brief time in the Philippines, developed an instant rapport with his bandsmen. During the period in which Loving led the Philippine Constabulary Band it established a reputation for excellence both in the Philippines and the United States. The U.S. military periodical Army and Navy Life described the band as [...] "one of the finest of all military bands in the world," [...] while the Pacific Coast Musical Review, opined that [...] "the Philippine Constabulary Band is in a class by itself." [...] During a 1915 performance in San Francisco, California, John Philip Sousa was invited to guest conduct the group, afterwards commenting that, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, I thought it was the United States Marine Band." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] Jon Pareles for The New York Times wrote that Carey [...] "coos" [...] the lyrics [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon" [...] and [...] "That woman-child inside was on the verge of fading/ Thankfully I woke up in time." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Phoenix {{starred in}} the James Mangold {{directed}} film Walk the Line, a Johnny Cash biopic, after Cash himself approved of Phoenix. All of Cash's vocal tracks in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack are played and sung by Phoenix. The film was released on November 18, 2005, eventually grossing $186 million. Phoenix's performance received rave reviews from critics and it inspired film critic Roger Ebert to write, [...] "Knowing Johnny Cash's albums more or less by heart, <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> eyes {{to focus on the}} soundtrack and decided that, yes, that was the voice of Johnny Cash I was listening to. The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked". For his portrayal of [...] Johnny Cash, Phoenix was nominated for his second Academy Award, in the category of Best Actor as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media for the film's soundtrack. Earlier that year, he narrated Earthlings (2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse in factory farms, pet mills and for scientific research. He was awarded the Humanitarian Award at the San Diego Film Festival in 2005, for his work and contribution to Earthlings.|$|E

2500|$|I mounted, therefore, unbidden, the Bed stead – & M. Dubois placed me {{upon the}} Mattress, & spread a cambric {{handkerchief}} upon my face.

I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision – & I almost marvel that it rings not in my Ears still? so excruciating was the agony. When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. I concluded the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it! ...|$|E
