50|$|Another AGA study <b>was</b> used <b>in</b> {{assessing}} the cultural adaption of Filipinos who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Navy.

The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function {{of time spent in}} the host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy 11-25 years).|$|R
