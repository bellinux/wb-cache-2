40|$|The {{correlation}} of northwest (NW) Pacific climate anomalies during summer with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{in the preceding}} winter strengthens in the mid- 1970 s and remains high. This study investigates {{the hypothesis that the}} tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) response to ENSO is key to this interdecadal change, using a 21 -member ensemble simulation with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM 3) forced by the observed history of sea surface temperature (SST) for 1950 – 2000. In the model hindcast, the TIO influence on the summer NW Pacific strengthens in the mid- 1970 s, and the strengthened TIO teleconnection coincides with an intensification of summer SST variability over the TIO. This result is corroborated by the fact the model’s skills in simulating NW Pacific climate anomalies during summer increase after the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift.</b> During late spring to early summer, El Niño–induced TIO warming decays rapidly for the epoch prior to the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> but grows and persists through summer for the epoch occurring after it. This difference {{in the evolution of the}} TIO warming determines the strength of the TIO teleconnection to the NW Pacific in the subsequent summer. An antisymmetric wind pattern develops in spring across the equator over the TIO, and the associated northeasterly anomalies aid the summer warming over the north Indian Ocean by opposing the prevailing southwest monsoon. In the model, this antisymmetric spring wind pattern is well developed after but absent before the 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{applications}} of a Si nanocrystals (nc-Si) {{embedded in a}} Si O 2 matrix is {{in the area of}} nonvolatile memory devices based on the charge storage in the material system. However, whether the charge trapping mainly occurs at the nc-SiSi O 2 interface or in the nc-Si is still unclear. In this work, by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy analysis of the Si 2 p peaks, the concentrations of both the nc-Si and the Si suboxides that exist at the nc-SiSi O 2 interface are determined as a function of thermal annealing, and the charging effect is also measured by monitoring the shift of the surface C 1 s peak. It is observed that the annealing-caused reduction of the total concentration of the interfacial suboxides is much faster than that of both the C 1 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> and the nc-Si concentration. In addition, the trend of the C 1 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> coincides with that of the nc-Si concentration.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an update on}} research in the relatively new and fast-moving field of decadal climate prediction, and addresses the use of decadal climate predictions not only for potential users of such information but also for improving our understanding of processes in the climate system. External forcing influences the predictions throughout, but their contributions to predictive skill become dominant after most of the improved skill from initialization with observations vanishes after about 6 – 9 years. Recent multimodel results {{suggest that there is}} relatively more decadal predictive skill in the North Atlantic, western Pacific, and Indian Oceans than in other regions of the world oceans. Aspects of decadal variability of SSTs, like the mid- 1970 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> in the Pacific, the mid- 1990 <b>s</b> <b>shift</b> in the northern North Atlantic and western Pacific, and the early- 2000 s hiatus, are better represented in initialized hindcasts compared to uninitialized simulations. There is evidence of higher skill in initialized multimodel ensemble decadal hindcasts than in single model results, with multimodel initialized predictions for near-term climate showing somewhat less global warming than uninitialized simulations. Some decadal hindcasts have shown statistically reliable predictions of surface temperature over various land and ocean regions for lead times of up to 6 – 9 years, but this needs to be investigated in a wider set of models. As {{in the early days of}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction, improvements to models will reduce the need for bias adjustment, and increase the reliability, and thus usefulness, of decadal climate predictions in the future...|$|R
