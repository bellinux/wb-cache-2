The NK cell cDNA {{differs from the}} neutrophil Fc gamma RIII cDNA {{by a number of}} point mutations and encodes an additional 21 amino acids at its C-terminus. When transiently expressed neutrophil and NK cell Fc gamma RIII were digested with N-glycanase, deglycosylated neutrophil Fc gamma RIII had a more rapid electrophoretic mobility than NK cell Fc gamma RIII, as is observed for the human Fc gamma RIII isoforms on normal cells. The neutrophil and NK cell Fc gamma RIII isoforms apparently result from cell-type specific expression of different forms of Fc gamma RIII mRNA. A TaqI RFLP was also found for human Fc gamma RIII. Monoclonal antibodies which have been used to distinguish the neutrophil and NK cell Fc gamma RIII isoforms and the NA 1 and NA 2 alleles of human neutrophil Fc gamma RIII were employed to study the expression of two Fc gamma RIII cDNA clones derived from neutrophils and NK cells.

Here, we constructed a nonimmunogenic, noncytolytic and flexible <b>hybrid</b> <b>Fc</b> (hyFc) consisting of IgD and IgG 4, and tested its function using erythropoietin (EPO) conjugate, EPO-hyFc. Despite low amino acid homology (20. 5 %) between IgD Fc and IgG 4 Fc, EPO-hyFc retained "Y-shaped" structure and repeated intravenous administrations of EPO-hyFc into monkeys did not generate EPO-hyFc-specific antibody responses. Furthermore, EPO-hyFc could not bind to FcγR I and C 1 q in contrast to EPO-IgG 1 Fc. In addition, EPO-hyFc exhibited better in vitro bioactivity and in vivo bioactivity in rats than EPO-IgG 1 Fc, presumably due to the high flexibility of IgD. Moreover, the mean serum half-life of EPO-hyFc(H), a high sialic acid content form of EPO-hyFc, was approximately 2 -fold longer {{than that of the}} heavily glycosylated EPO, darbepoetin alfa, in rats. More importantly, subcutaneous injection of EPO-hyFc(H) not only induced a significantly greater elevation of serum hemoglobin levels than darbepoetin alfa in both normal rats and cisplatin-induced anemic rats, but also displayed a delayed time to maximal serum level and twice final area-under-the-curve (AUC(last)). Taken together, hyFc might be a more attractive Fc conjugate for agonistic proteins/peptides than IgG 1 Fc due to its capability to elongate their half-lives without inducing host effector functions and hindering bioactivity of fused molecules.

40|$|Abstract—Fuel cell (FC) is {{a viable}} {{alternative}} power source for portable applications; it has higher energy density than traditional Li-ion battery and thus can achieve longer lifetime for the same weight or volume. However, because of its limited power density, it can hardly track fast fluctuations in the load current of digital systems. A hybrid power source, which consists of a FC and a Li-ion battery, has the advantages of long lifetime and good load following capabilities. In this work, we consider the problem of extending the lifetime of a fuel-cell-based hybrid source {{that is used to}} provide power to an embedded system which supports DVS (dynamic voltage scaling). We propose an energy-based optimization framework that considers the characteristics of both the energy consumer (the embedded system) and the energy provider (the hybrid power source). We use this framework to develop algorithms that determine the output power level of the FC and the scaling factor of the DVS processor during task scheduling. Simulations on task traces based on a real-application (Path Finder) and a randomized version demonstrate significant superiority of our algorithms with respect to a conventional DVS algorithm which only considers energy minimization of the embedded system.

40|$|PEMFCs are {{the most}} popular type of Fuel Cells (FCs) and {{traditionally}} use hydrogen as the fuel. One FC problem is its relative slow dynamics caused by the time constant of the hydrogen and oxygen supply systems that can be in the range of several seconds. In this sense, supercapacitors (SCs) respond faster than FC to a fast increase or decrease in power demand. Thus, using SCs together with FCs improves FC life and performance by absorbing faster load changes and preventing fuel starvation of the FC. Therefore, it becomes necessary to study structures of power conditioners with their respective control systems that can mitigate the disadvantages mentioned of the FC itself. Several researches have studied the different topologies with their respective control proposals to operate FC and SC.

The present paper analyzes the contributions of the FC system to CO 2 emission reduction in three application fields. In the mobile application field, the direct methanol FC system has little or no influence on CO 2 emission reduction. The benefit of the FC in CO 2 emission reduction in the transportation field is directly dependant on the H 2 production method. Pre-combustion technology (with carbon capture) represents one of the best mid-term solutions for H 2 production. If FC vehicles (FCVs) use the H 2 produced by this process, the CO 2 emissions in this field could be decreased to 70 - 80 % of the traditional CO 2 emissions. In the stationary application field, the FC system can be effectively operated as the distributed generation (DG) in terms of CO 2 emission reduction. Among the various types of <b>FC</b> or <b>FC</b> <b>hybrid</b> system used for DG, the solid oxide <b>FC</b> (SOFC) <b>hybrid</b> system with a CO 2 capture unit is the best option as it doubled the electricity efficiency compared to the traditional combustion cycle and decreases the CO 2 emission to 13. 4 % of the traditional CO 2 emission.

40|$|Flow Classification (FC) at {{the network}} access points (NAPs) is {{necessary}} in today's Internet services, such as routing, rate management, access-control in firewalls, policy-based networking, and differentiated services, etc. Flow Classifiers examine packets to determine which flow they belong to. A flow is defined by {Fi},which is a subset of fields in the packet's header. A policy {{is a pair of}} ({Fi}, "action"), and "action" is services this flow,{Fi}, should receive. Since policies are configured manually by network administrator, they can be overlapped and a flow may match more than one policy. Furthermore, each field within policies has its own characteristics; therefore solving FC problem with a hybrid scheme is in place. Three performance criteria are used: (1) Storage Requirements, (2) Query Time, and (3) Updating Overhead. Some factors are effective to Storage Requirements, such as the number of policies and fields, distribution in policy sets, and characteristics on each field. However, Query Time should not be damaged by these factors. Moreover, for On-Line Update, rebuilding the major parts of the data structure for every Incremental Update is prohibitive and any scheme should satisfy this requirement. In this thesis, we propose several schemes that are suitable for classification of fields with different characteristics. With the <b>hybrid</b> scheme for <b>FC</b> on multiple fields, with 450 policies, adding one more field with 32 -bit length costs less than 700 KBytes. The Performance of this novel hybrid scheme is evaluated with a sample network in Chapter 5. With parallel processing, time per query is measured by the component that needs memory access (which is about 2 Hash + 1 memory access). In particular, Query Time is independent of the number of policies and Incremental Updating can be done within constant time. Therefore, this scheme is a good candidate {{to be used in the}} Flow Classification on multiple fields. 未來可預見的網際網路服務，如路由演算、速度管理、防火牆的存取控制、政策性網路(Policy-Based Networking) 、服務區分(Differentiated Service) 等都需要在網路節點上提供資料流分類(Flow Classification) 的機制。所謂Flow Classification是指決定一個packet屬於哪一個資料流。我們用{Fi}來定義一個資料流，{Fi}是packet header中某幾個的欄位(fields) 所形成的集合。數對({Fi}, "action") 則被稱作是一個政策(policy) 。其中"action" 是對符合{Fi}的資料流所給予的services。由於網路管理者所制訂的policies 彼此涵蓋範圍可能會有重疊，這使得一個資料流可能同時滿足多個policies。更因為policy中所牽涉到的欄位特性各異，所以必須採用混合的架構(Hybrid Scheme) 來處理。評量的因素有三個：(1) Storage Requirements，(2) Query Time，及(3) Updating Overhead。Policy的總數與分佈、相關的欄位數與欄位特性都會影響Storage Requirements；但是不希望它們對Query Time造成太大的影響，所以對於Query Time我們關心worst case更甚於average case。Updating Overhead與基本架構的設計有關，Incremental Update進行時不允許資料結構的主體被更動，以滿足On-Line Update的要求。 本文主要是針對適合各種欄位特性的方法作探討及模擬，針對以上三個因素的trade-off作分析；同時提出一種可能的Hybrid Scheme來達成在多維度(multi-dimension) 上的Flow Classification。以 450 個policies而言，每增加一個 32 -bit維度所產生的storage requirement少於 700 KByte。而利用平行處理的架構，每次query所需要的時間取決於各元件中memory access次數最多者(約 2 次Hash+ 1 次memory access) ，而且與policy的總數無關，同時並能提供固定時間內完成Incremental Update，是一種在多維度上進行資料流分類的可行機制。論文摘要 2 Abstract 3 目錄 4 圖表目錄 6 第一章簡介 7 第二章相關研究 10 2. 1 Ternary CAM 10 2. 2 Grid of Tries 10 2. 3 Bit-Level Parallelism 11 2. 4 Recursive Flow Classification 12 2. 5 與Classification 複雜度有關的研究 12 第三章基本架構 15 3. 1 Trie-Base Method 15 3. 2 Hash-Base Method 17 3. 3 Search using Segmentation 19 3. 4 總結 22 第四章基本架構之改良 23 4. 1 Wildcards 對Trie-base Method的影響 23 4. 2 Segmentation with the clustering argument 24 4. 3 Segmentation with Incremental Update Support 25 4. 4 總結 32 第五章Hybrid Scheme 33 5. 1 A Sample Network 34 5. 2 總結 48 第六章Simulation Result 51 第七章結論與未來展望 56 參考文獻 5...|$|R

The output-voltage characteristic in a PEMFC is limited by the mechanical devices which are used for regulating the air flow in its cathode, the hydrogen flow in its anode, its inner temperature, and the humidity of the air supplied to it. Usually, the FC time constants are dominated by the fuel delivery system, in particular by the slow dynamics of the compressor responsible for supplying the oxygen. As a consequence, a fast load transient demand could cause a high voltage drop in a short time known as oxygen starvation phenomenon that is harmful for the FC. Thus, FCs are considered as a slow dynamic response equipment with respect to the load transient requirements. Therefore, batteries, ultracapacitors or other auxiliary power sources are needed to support the operation of the FC in order to ensure a fast response to any load power transient. The resulting systems, known as <b>FC</b> <b>hybrid</b> systems, can limit the slope of the current or the power generated by the FC with the use of current-controlled dc-dc converters. In this way, the reactant gas starvation phenomena can be avoided and the system can operate with higher efficiency. The purpose of this thesis is the design of a DC-DC converter suitable to interconnect all the different elements in a PEMFC-hybrid 48 -V DC bus. Since the converter could be placed between elements with very different voltage levels, a buck-boost structure has been selected. Especially to fulfill the low ripple requirements of the PEMFCs, but also those of the auxiliary storage elements and loads, our structure has inductors in series at both its input and its output. Magnetically coupling these inductors and adding a damping network to its intermediate capacitor we have designed an easily controllable converter with second-order-buck-like dominant dynamics. This new proposed topology has high efficiency and wide bandwidth acting either as a voltage or as a current regulator. The magnetic coupling allows to control with similar performances the input or the output inductor currents. This characteristic is very useful because the designed current-controlled converter is able to withstand shortcircuits at its output and, when connected to the FC, it facilitates to regulate the current extracted from the FC to avoid the oxygen starvation phenomenon. Testing in a safe way the converter connected to the FC required to build an FC simulator that was subsequently improved by developing an emulator that offered real-time processing and oxygen-starvation indication. To study the developed converters and emulators with different brands of PEMFCs it was necessary to reactivate long-time inactive Palcan FCs. Since the results provided by the manual reactivation procedure were unsatisfactory, an automatic reactivation system has been developed as a complementary study of the thesis.
