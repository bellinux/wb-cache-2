50|$|An Italian rule limited name ‘chocolate’ to {{products}} without vegetable fats. Those {{with vegetable}} fats, mainly British, Irish, and Danish chocolate, {{were made to}} label themselves ‘chocolate substitutes’. The Commission argued this breached Directive 73/241, passed under what is now article 115 TFEU, where article 1 said cocoa and chocolate products mean those in Annex 1, within minimum cocoa content to be described as chocolate. It also argued it infringed TFEU article 34, as the word ‘substitute’ devalued the good. Italy, under point 7(a) of the Annex said the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> <b>clause</b> only applied to products without vegetable fats.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Justice {{held that}} the {{requirement}} was contrary to article 34. Under the Directive, the UK, Ireland, Denmark could authorised manufacturers to add vegetable fats to chocolate made there, but it could not benefit from the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> <b>clause.</b> TFEU article 34 applied to obstacles to marketing products. The Italian rule would make British producers adjust their products and incur additional packaging costs. The Italian law had to be justified by a mandatory requirement, and steps must be proportionate. On the facts, the addition of vegetable fat did not substantially modify the product. So a ‘neutral and objective statement’ informing consumers would be enough. Obliging a change of the sale name was going further than necessary to protect consumers.|$|E
40|$|Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) {{concluded}} by the EU Member States contain substantially similar <b>clauses,</b> including <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> {{of capital}} and investor-to-state dispute resolution. Article 307 EC provides for the primacy of pre-accession treaties over the EC Treaty and simultaneously requires the Member States to eliminate their mutual incompatibilities. The European Court of Justice has declared that <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of capital <b>clauses</b> of Austrian and Swedish pre-accession extra-EU BITs are incompatible with the EC Treaty as they will impede any restrictions on the movement of capital imposed as future Community legislation. A similar ‘free <b>movement</b> of capital’ <b>clause</b> is present in all extra-EU BITs of the Member States, whether pre- or post-accession. Article 307, however, {{does not apply to}} the post-accession treaties which are equally capable of contriving the same consequences of impeding the application of the EC Treaty. In addition, the application of intra-EU BITs provides investors from BIT party states access to the investor-to-state dispute resolution which is not available to investors from the Member States who do not have BITs with those Member States. This is discrimination and may distort the principle of equal treatment within the EU. Furthermore, the newly acceding EU States are facing extensive arbitral claims for carrying out the BIT-EU conflicting obligations within their respective territories...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{three important}} developments in EU <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> law {{from the perspective}} of the structure of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> law. Each of these developments – market access, horizontal direct effect and the assimilation of justifications – is caused by structural changes in the application of the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> provisions. Firstly, the Court of Justice of the European Union has used 'backwards reasoning', which means that the Court no longer maintains the consecutive order of the structure. Moreover, the Court has increasingly merged what were previously distinct stages of inquiry in <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> cases. The result is that the proportionality test has become the most likely tool to solve <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> cases. This process of centralisation can be explained by the Court's aim to guarantee the effet utile of the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> provisions. However, the centralisation of proportionality has a number of important consequences. Ultimately, the (almost) exclusive reliance on proportionality to solve <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> cases does not improve the functioning of the internal market. Therefore, the Court should also develop and rely on the other pillars of the structure of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> law...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. There {{are four}} {{fundamental}} freedoms which {{lay the foundation}} of the European Union. Those are the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of goods, <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of capital, <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of services and <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of persons. They guarantee the existence and effective functioning of an area without internal borders within which goods, capital, services and people move freely. Despite the pivotal importance of these freedoms, there are cases where some freedoms can be partially or fully restricted within the territory of some member states or the Union as a whole. This thesis is going to analyze the restrictions of one of these freedoms: the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of persons, resulting from the arrangements applying to new member states. The focus will be the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers from new to old member states for a transitional period following the date of accession...|$|R

40|$|The {{creation}} of common market {{was based on}} four fundamental freedoms. These freedoms have re-mained the central issue of the EU, although their perception has significantly changed since the Treaty of Paris. The principle of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers, {{as a part of}} <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of persons, facilitates the mobility of workers within the EU, as any citizen of EU member states is allowed to go to another member state for work, having the same workplace rights as the nationals. The principle of free move- ment of workers is associated with the lack of any discrimination between workers based on national- ity, which is guaranteed by EU legislation. For these reasons, that principle at the same time {{remains one of the most}} controversial issues of the European integration. It is so because from the beginning of its existence, its realisation has required the necessity to reconcile – sometimes different – national interests for the sake of common market. Due to the significant disparities between member states regarding their economic status and standard of living, the principle of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers is often associated by the highly developed countries with the inflow of cheap labour force from the poorer member states that poses a real threat for its national labour markets and welfare systems. Considering the above mentioned facts, the article solves the research problem: to determine the place of the principle of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers in the process of {{creation of}} the European common market. The aim of this paper is to present the decisive stages in changing the perception of the principle of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers through the process of European integration. To achieve this aim, the main tasks are: to present <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers at the beginning of Euro- pean integration, the perception of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers at the struggle to implement the idea of EU citizenship, the perception of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers at the time of EU enlargements and the impact of the economic crisis of 2008 + on the realisation of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers. The paper presents a combination of several research methods: comparative analysis of international sci- entific works; comparative analysis and interpretation of the EU legal documents, strategies and practical papers as well as the analysis of the CJEU decisions in cases that involve the <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers. The results of the article are: explanation of the emergence of the idea of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers at the beginning of European integration, presentation of the development of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers due to the implementation of the idea of EU citizenship, indication of the manner of implementation of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers for new member states, the way of realisation of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> of workers at the time of economic crisis of 2008 +...|$|R
30|$|The third {{combination}} seems {{perhaps the}} most unlikely one. The goals of democratic self-government and individual freedom of migration can be pursued simultaneously if we regard <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> as a citizenship right instead of a human right. 4 This would mean that democratic states commit to promoting international mobility opportunities of their own citizens through concluding <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> arrangements with other states. In this view, <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> presupposes certain levels of democratic stability and economic development.|$|R
40|$|Publication {{based on}} {{research}} {{carried out in the}} framework of the European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO) of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, European University Institute. There is a tension between a liberal ideal of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> and democratic concerns about the integrity of citizenship. This text proposes first to break down the problem by introducing a typology of <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> regimes based on their personal and territorial scopes. Second, it argues that the tension can be partially overcome through supranational integration, toleration of multiple citizenship and international agreements on reciprocal <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> rights. Taken together, these three strategies can greatly expand <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> rights that are not in conflict with democratic 3 citizenship since they rely on an expanded conception of such citizenship. The analysis concludes, however, that even the best possible <b>free</b> <b>movement</b> regimes that can be imagined under present circumstances cannot fully overcome discriminatory features of immigrant admission policies...|$|R
