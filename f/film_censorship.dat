5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of <b>film</b> <b>censorship</b> and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were seen to be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E
5|$|Later discoveries {{turned up}} {{a large number of}} excised clips, held by {{interested}} parties as proof of the edits. In October 1996, Australian Doctor Who fans Damian Shanahan and Ellen Parry discovered a collection in the records of the National Archives of Australia, provided as evidence by the Commonwealth <b>Film</b> <b>Censorship</b> Board (now the Classification Board). These clips include The Smugglers, episodes 1, 3-4; The Highlanders, episode 1; The Underwater Menace, episodes 2, 4; The Macra Terror, episode 3; Fury From The Deep, episodes 2, 4-5; and The Wheel In Space, episode 4.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{broadcast}} on China's national TV station, China Central Television (CCTV) on December 16, 2012 completely uncensored, surprising many viewers. While many {{believed that the}} government had banned the film, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stated that it was not aware of a ban; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films. Liu Shanying, {{a political scientist at the}} Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese <b>film</b> <b>censorship</b> might be being loosened.|$|E

The film was downgraded to a 15 certificate for [...] "moderate bloody violence".

50|$|The channel, {{launched}} in November 1982, hoped {{to gain a}} reputation as a relatively avant-garde alternative to the existing terrestrial stations. It compiled a list of provocative films, generally art-house and mostly in another language, and entered into negotiation with independent TV regulator the IBA with an eye to showing them. The films, all of which had been theatrically exhibited under British Board of <b>Film</b> <b>Censorship's</b> 'X' (or later '18') certificates, had never been shown on British television before. Their content transcended that which had hitherto been permitted by the UK's TV censors.|$|R

5|$|On February 19, 1930, Variety {{published}} the entire {{contents of the}} Code and predicted that state <b>film</b> <b>censorship</b> boards would soon become obsolete. However, the men obligated to enforce the code — Jason Joy, who {{was the head of}} the Committee until 1932, and his successor, Dr. James Wingate — were seen as generally ineffective. The very first film the office reviewed, The Blue Angel, which was passed by Joy without revision, was considered indecent by a California censor. Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films, and there were indeed definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it to the screen.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} studies on the issue of <b>film</b> <b>censorship</b> in Turkey is Alim Şerif Onaran's Sinematografik Hürriyet (Cinematic Freedom), published in 1968 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but written in 1963 and being the first study in Turkey which received a PhD for a topic related to film. This study is still the most important -if not only- study on the film evaluation methods applied in Turkey before the 1950s. Onaran himself being active {{as a member of the}} Film Rating Commission in his younger years, was a true expert on the topic, and his research also includes examples of the late Ottoman Period. Ironically, Onaran became one {{of the most}} important intellectuals on film in Turkey, owing his wealth of knowledge on early world film history to the years he spent watching the films he was enrolled to evaluate as a committee member.|$|E

500|$|The Prince of Egypt {{was banned}} in two {{countries}} where the population is predominantly Muslim: the Maldives and Malaysia, {{on the grounds that}} the depiction in the media of Islamic prophets (which includes Moses) is forbidden in Islam. The Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs in the Maldives stated: [...] "All prophets and messengers of God are revered in Islam, and therefore cannot be portrayed". Following this ruling, the censor board banned the film in January 1999. In the same month, the <b>Film</b> <b>Censorship</b> Board of Malaysia banned the film [...] "so as not to offend the country's majority Muslim population." [...] The board's secretary said that the censor body ruled the film was [...] "insensitive for religious and moral reasons".|$|E
500|$|There are {{currently}} no Singaporean cases which have specifically discussed {{the meaning of}} morality. However, legislation such as the Films Act, which establishes <b>film</b> <b>censorship</b> and classification regimes; and the Undesirable Publications Act, under which obscene or otherwise objectionable publications may be banned, {{can be regarded as}} restrictions on free expression pursuant to this ground. In Rathinam Ramesh v. Public Prosecutor (2010), where the issue was the sentence that should be imposed on a person convicted of distributing uncertified films contrary to the Films Act, the High Court held that [...] "the control of film distribution under the Films Act was for the purpose of maintaining public order and morality" [...] and the accused had not undermined public morality since the films he had been distributing were not obscene.|$|E
500|$|Freedom {{of speech}} and {{expression}} may also be restricted {{in the interest of}} friendly relations with other countries. This ground of restriction has not yet been considered by local courts, but might have justified the withdrawal by the Board of Film Censors (BFC) of a certificate issued for the film Zoolander (2001) with effect from 8 February 2002. The film, a comedy about a male model played by Ben Stiller who is brainwashed into attempting to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia, had earlier been condemned by the Malaysian <b>Film</b> <b>Censorship</b> Board as [...] "definitely unsuitable", though it did not impose a ban as it expected film distributors to exercise discretion. The BFC stated only that the film had been banned [...] "in view of controversial elements gathered from feedback". The ban was lifted at the beginning of 2006, which enabled the film to be released on DVD.|$|E
