500|$|The {{assassination}} {{was reportedly}} {{carried out by}} Majid Jamali Fashi, who said in his televised confession (confirmed as genuine by Western intelligence officials) {{that he had been}} trained by Mossad in Tel Aviv. [...] "I woke up at 4 and made a call, the plan had not changed. I parked the motorbike near the tree," [...] Fashi said in his confession. Alimohammadi's wife said, [...] "I heard the explosion <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> closed the door." [...] Mossad officials also reportedly concluded that the attacks were [...] "too dangerous" [...] for valuable intelligence operatives in Iran. The organisation has since reportedly instructed its Iranian spy network to concentrate on finding evidence of Iranian breaches of its nuclear-restriction agreements.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make {{love to me}} when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't let me go / Make love to me when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
2500|$|Sarkozy was {{a likely}} {{candidate}} for the presidency in 2007; in an oft-repeated comment made on television channel France 2, when asked by a journalist whether {{he thought about the}} presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, [...] "Not <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> shave".|$|E

2500|$|She {{would also}} later state that these events delayed her career by about ten years, as [...] "it {{seemed like an}} eternity in which I was the punch line to every late-night {{monologue}} ... Joan Rivers, whom I adored and met on The Tonight Show during my reign, was particularly relentless. <b>Just</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> figured she'd exhausted every possible Vanessa Williams joke, she'd have a whole new slew of them." [...] Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because [...] "the wife of lyricist Ira Gershwin decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show.' [...] " [...] In addition, her parents experienced [...] "an incredible amount of shame and humiliation" [...] and were equally the subject of harassment at the time.|$|E
2500|$|From January 1798 to March 1799, Zach {{was chief}} of staff of the Armee von Italien. He assumed the chief of staff role again from July 1799 to June 1800. On 9 June 1799 he {{received}} promotion to General-major. In a private letter to the Russian ambassador that was opened by the Austrian government, the army commander Alexander Suvorov described Zach as [...] "sound, discreet and professional, but a great deviser of Unterkunft (logistics) <b>just</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> want to burst into flaming action." [...] Though Suvorov used Unterkunft as a pejorative, Zach was tickled rather than insulted when shown the letter. Zach performed capably at the Battle of Novi on 15 August. For his actions, a grateful emperor awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 13 October 1799. A skilled mathematician, Zach was more at home in the field of military engineering than he was at combat leadership or in an operational role.|$|E
