5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E

After quite a bit of trouble convincing the crew of a {{whaleboat}} to take him to Ford Island, his normal duty station, he finally got to the island. There, {{during the middle of the}} first wave’s attack, he fired up the only flyable Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter on the island. A ground crew member crawled up on the wing telling him, “You can’t take this airplane!” “The heck I can’t, <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> wing!” Arnold replied. “But it doesn’t have any ammunition!” came the response.|$|E

She added that the expanded album would contain three newly recorded songs and four additional remixes to supplement the standard edition of the original album. [...] "It was an incredible honor to tie [...] Billboard Hot 100 record, but I'm moving forward and had a few things left to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> chest," [...] she said.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} {{was met with}} polarized reviews. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph named it [...] "inarguably another fantastic display of showbiz shock and awe from a mistress of the form." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times named it [...] "the show's blasphemy quota", while Michael Hamersly of Miami Herald called it an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance. Lindsay Zoladz of Vulture opined that it was [...] "ne of the most disappointing moments of the night". Jordan Zivitz of The Montreal Gazette opined: [...] "Twenty-six years after 'Like a Prayer' video scandalized the Vatican and parents who relied on MTV as a cheap babysitter, the sight of dancers twisting down steel crucifixes while Madonna snapped 'bitch, <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> pole' in 'Holy Water' was hopefully intended to be comical".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{recorded}} a demo {{of the track}} that leaked in full on December 30, 2010. The song was rumored to be a leftover cut from her Teenage Dream recording sessions, and fans speculated that the track might be included in an as-yet-unconfirmed re-release of the LP. This re-release was confirmed in January 2012, when Perry announced through her official website that the album would contain all twelve songs from the original album, plus three new songs and a remix, and would be released on March 26, 2012. Perry's press release stated: [...] "This is the complete story of Teenage Dream. It was an incredible honor to tie the King of Pop's Billboard Hot 100 record, but I'm moving forward and had a few things left to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> chest. So this is the complete special edition of my album for my fans." ...|$|E

[...] On [...] "Palace", ASAP Rocky demonstrates alliterative lyricism and [...] cadence and flow. His flow patterns have been compared by writers to those of Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times writes that [...] "his reserved, steely delivery owes equal debts to Houston's syrup daze and Dipset's uptown intensity". He addresses his rapping style on [...] "Purple Swag": [...] "I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow". On [...] "Leaf", he addresses hip-hoppers' criticism of his style: [...] "They say I sound like André / mixed with Kanye / {{a little bit of}} Max / a little bit of Wiz / {{a little bit of that}} / a little bit of this / <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> dick".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Hendrix {{received a}} phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Madonna sells the song, due to [...] "the bass gurgles that remind of classic Massive Attack or the {{reference}} to 'Vogue.'" [...] PopMatterss Evan Sawdey enjoyed the sense of dirty fun that permeates [...] "Holy Water", writing that [...] "Madonna sounds very much at home with aggressive sentiments like 'Bitch, <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> pole' and 'Yeezus loves my pussy best', blatantly toying around with religious iconography while having a bit of provocative fun." [...] He also found the [...] "Vogue" [...] sample [...] "a rare case of Madonna acknowledging her own legacy." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song is [...] "a welcome bit of percolating electronica". Cinquemani commended {{the inclusion of the}} word [...] "genuflect" [...] in a pop song, but also felt that [...] "Madonna's Catholic baiting [...] like a reflex at this point". The reviewer believed that Madonna deliberately included provocative lyrics in the song, either to bring back her persona Dita Parlo from her 1992 studio album Erotica, or just to make a statement [...] "about women of a certain age unapologetically flexing their libidos".|$|E

The band [...] "worked incredibly hard" [...] to make an album that reaches high standards set by other artists' albums that Hopeless have released. Rock Sound contributor Rob Sayce noted that the album was influenced by All Time Low's Nothing Personal (2009). Sayce wrote that the band [...] "gave British pop-punk a shot in the arm, drawing on the production sheen of 'Nothing Personal.'" [...] "Losing Teeth" [...] is about how Barlow and his friends were pursuing careers that would take them away from their hometown. Barlow said it wasn't [...] "about the end of our youth, as such, but definitely the end of us being kids, and reflecting on that." [...] "Growing Pains" [...] was the band's first attempt at [...] "diversity we have tried to implement", according to Thorpe-Evans. Thorpe-Evans mentioned that the group felt the song [...] "has a flair of originality and uniqueness" [...] when compared to the previous output.
