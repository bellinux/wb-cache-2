By introducing a second, parallel path, the HN would have greater flexibility in how it uses its <b>deck</b> <b>officers.</b> Additionally, a second career path might benefit officers who have special skills, allowing them to progress through the ranks based on different criteria, such as technical expertise.

40|$|The term “good seamanship” {{is often}} used to {{describe}} the behaviour of <b>deck</b> <b>officers</b> who navigate according to a commonly accepted set of norms. Even though these norms offer a certain flexibility, most of them are covered by laws and regulations. The navigation performance of <b>deck</b> <b>officers</b> is also of interest, and {{it could be argued that}} there is a connection between the terms. For training and evaluation of <b>deck</b> <b>officers</b> an objective assessment of performance is also of great advantage. The scope of the paper is to analyse how different measures can be used to describe navigation performance, and the relationship between these in different collision situations. During an extended simulator study with 50 <b>deck</b> <b>officers,</b> navigation performance was assessed while participants spent one complete week in navigation simulators. Their task was a realistic 24 / 7 voyage through the English Channel, and each participant spent 64 or 90 hours in the simulator...|$|R

60|$|Well {{aware of}} his {{deficiency}} in some things, Selvagee never took the trumpet--which is the badge of the <b>deck</b> <b>officer</b> for the time--without a tremulous movement of the lip, and an earnest inquiring eye to the windward. He encouraged those old Tritons, the Quarter-masters, to discourse with him concerning {{the likelihood of a}} squall; and often followed their advice as to taking in, or making sail. The smallest favours in that way were thankfully received. Sometimes, when all the North looked unusually lowering, by many conversational blandishments, he would endeavour to prolong his predecessor's stay on deck, after that officer's watch had expired. But in fine, steady weather, when the Captain would emerge from his cabin, Selvagee might be seen, pacing the poop with long, bold, indefatigable strides, and casting his eye up aloft with the most ostentatious fidelity.|$|E
60|$|This {{inspection}} is thus performed: The boat being descried by the quarter-master {{from the}} poop, she {{is reported to}} the <b>deck</b> <b>officer,</b> who thereupon summons the master-at-arms, the ship's chief of police. This functionary now stations himself at the gangway, and as the boat's crew, one by one, come up the side, he personally overhauls them, making them take off their hats, and then, placing both hands upon their heads, draws his palms slowly down to their feet, carefully feeling all unusual protuberances. If nothing suspicious is felt, the man is let pass; and so on, till the whole boat's crew, averaging about sixteen men, are examined. The chief of police then descends into the boat, and walks from stem to stern, eyeing it all over, and poking his long rattan into every nook and cranny. This operation concluded, and nothing found, he mounts the ladder, touches his hat to the deck-officer, and reports the boat clean; whereupon she is hauled out to the booms.|$|E
