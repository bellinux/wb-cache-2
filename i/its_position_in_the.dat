5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium {{is the first}} transuranic element. <b>Its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 is {{widespread}} in the biosphere, including in human tissues, because of <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays {{through a series of}} solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive noble gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earth's surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable lead-206.|$|E

The fact that this 1810 {{proposal}} had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before {{the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E

5|$|The high European {{demand for}} the product enabled Zahir to grow wealthy and finance his {{autonomous}} sheikhdom.

The Spanish declaration of war on Great Britain forced the British Mediterranean Fleet to abandon the Mediterranean Sea entirely, retreating to ports at Gibraltar and Lisbon. This force now concentrated against the Spanish Navy, most of which was stationed at the main fleet base of CÃ¡diz in Southern Spain. A British blockade fleet won a significant victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, dissuading the Spanish fleet from playing {{a significant role in the}} ongoing war.|$|E

In 1978, after his return to Memphis, the first two Big Star albums were released together in the UK as a double album, drawing enthusiastic reviews and interest from fans. Soon afterwards Big Star's recognition grew further when, four years after its completion, the third album too was released in both the US and the UK. By now, the hitherto untitled Third/Sister Lovers had become known by several unofficial names including Third (reflecting <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discography), Beale Street Green (acknowledging the legendary site nearby, once {{a focal point for}} Memphis blues musicians) and Sister Lovers (because during the album's recording sessions, Chilton and Stephens were dating sisters Lesa and Holliday Aldridge).|$|E
5|$|Skopje {{economic}} life greatly benefited from <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of Turkish Europe. Until the 17th century, Skopje experienced a long golden age. Around 1650, {{the number of}} inhabitants in Skopje was between 30,000 and 60,000 and the city contained more than 10,000 houses. It was {{then one of the}} only big cities on the territory of future Yugoslavia, together with Belgrade and Sarajevo. At that time, Dubrovnik, which was a busy harbour, had not even 7,000 inhabitants. Following the Ottoman conquest, the city population changed. Christians were forcibly converted to Islam or were replaced by Turks and Jews. At that time, Christians of Skopje were mostly non converted Slavs and Albanians, but also Ragusan and Armenian tradesmen. Ottoman Turks drastically changed the appearance of the city. They organised the Bazaar with its caravanserais, mosques and baths.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} season by posting their first winning April since 2003.

The Phillies' performance declined in late June, but they improved after the All-Star break, going 96 immediately following the midseason hiatus. Closer Brad Lidge earned eight saves in those games, and did not blow a save throughout the season and the postseason. Philadelphia traded sweeps with the Los Angeles Dodgers in August and went 133 in their last 16games, {{taking advantage of a}} late swoon by the New York Mets {{for the second year in}} a row to capture the division crown.
