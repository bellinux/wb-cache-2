5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E

In terms of tremor amplitude reduction, it is just as effective as propranolol, reducing it by 50%. Both drugs are well studied for this condition, unlike other therapies, and are recommended for initial treatment. 25mg/day (low-dose therapy) is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> 75mg/day (high-dose therapy).|$|E

500|$|Anstey did {{not agree}} that Latin was as unpliable as Gray {{suggests}} and had no difficulty in finding ways of including all these references, although other Latin translators found different solutions, especially in regard to inclusion of the beetle. He similarly ignored Gray’s suggestion in the same letter, referring {{back to his own}} alternative versions in earlier drafts of his poem: “Might not the English characters here be romanized? Virgil is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> Milton, and Cæsar as Cromwell, but who shall be Hampden?” Again, however, other Latin translators, especially those from outside Britain, found Gray’s suggested alternative more appealing.|$|E
500|$|During the 1975 season, Bell {{was asked}} {{how he felt about}} all the {{publicity}} being received by Griffin. [...] He replied: [...] "All of the publicity in the world doesn't help you win. [...] I don't feel slighted because Archie is in our conference. [...] I feel I'm <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> he is." [...] Bell later recalled: [...] "Those two games against Ohio State were my biggest, and I consider the second game a personal victory. [...] I outrushed Archie, but he had a great public relations guy in Woody Hayes[...] [...] [...] He wasn't {{the best player in the}} conference so how can he be the best player in the country?" ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} women jockeys, she views the primary {{challenge}} {{to be the}} difficulty of horse racing itself. [...] She describes races as [...] "every man for himself (sic)." [...] She does not ask for any breaks from male jockeys, and has explained that horse racing is a sport where women simply have to be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> men. [...] She speaks well of other successful women jockeys, and expresses {{a lot of respect}} in particular for Julie Krone, to whom she is often compared. But she also said in a 2011 interview, [...] "a lot of young female riders are just girls who love horses, but they just don't have the strength and toughness, and they're not cut out to be jockeys. You've got to deliver the goods to get over that hump." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1905, Bill Armour {{took over}} as Tiger manager and Lowe stayed on as a {{part-time}} player. He was a utility player {{for the next three}} seasons, playing all four infield positions and in the outfield. In August 1906, he sustained a broken nose and a fractured jaw after being struck by a foul tip from his own bat during a game in Philadelphia. After the injury, Lowe missed the remainder of the 1906 season and appeared in only 17 games (with 37 at bats) in 1907, his final year in the major leagues. After that season, The Detroit News wrote that Lowe at age 42 [...] "has not lost his batting eye nor his speed. His arm is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> ever and he is a much stronger ball player than many who held down regular jobs in the league this past season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{changes that}} {{were made to the}} series' cast, setting, {{creative}} teams and even production values from series to series have meant that opinions differ greatly between fans and critics alike as to the quality of certain series. In the [...] "Great Red Dwarf Debate", published in volume 2 issue 3 of the Red Dwarf Smegazine, science-fiction writers Steve Lyons and Joe Nazzaro both argued on {{the pros and cons of}} the early series against the later series. Lyons stated that what the show [...] "once had was a unique balance of sci-fi comedy, which worked magnificently." [...] Nazarro agreed that [...] "the first two series are very original and very funny", but went on to say that [...] "it wasn't until series III that the show hit its stride." [...] Series VI is regarded as a continuation of the [...] "Monster of the week" [...] philosophy of series V, which was nevertheless considered to be visually impressive. Discussions revolve around the quality of series VI, seen by viewers as <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the earlier series', but has been criticised as a descent into formulaic comedy with an unwelcome change of setting.|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Alain Lieury, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany, indicates that working on exercises with a pencil and paper is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> Brain Age 2 at stimulating the memory. After evaluating ten-year-old children, the survey found [...] "no evidence to support claims in Nintendo's advertising campaign, featuring Nicole Kidman, that users can test and rejuvenate their grey cells". Lieury finds Brain Age 2 acceptable as a game, but considers it charlatanism for Nintendo to claim it as a scientific test, countering the company's assertions that its edutainment products such as Big Brain Academy and Brain Age 2 can improve {{blood flow to the}} brain and supposedly improving [...] "practical intelligence". Regarding whether or not brain training games are effective, Graham Lawton of New Scientist wrote, [...] "All things considered, it's hard not to conclude that brain training has been proven to work—under certain circumstances. [...] It's also worth pointing out that no study has shown that brain training makes cognitive abilities any worse." [...] Lawton notes that Nintendo avoids providing evidence that its Brain Age series actually leads to noticeable improvements in brain functions, and that it instead [...] "is careful not to claim that Brain Age is scientifically validated, merely stating that it is an entertainment product 'inspired' by [...] work." ...|$|E

500|$|A maltsters' and brewers' guild {{existed in}} the town in 1601. [...] The guild created a {{monopoly}} {{on the right to}} produce malted grain and beer for sale, and kept it {{in the hands of a}} select few families, strictly controlled by the guilds. It also implemented rules and regulations on the production of the beer that was designed to protect the quality and reputation of the beer. [...] A system of quality control was put in place; each barrel of beer that was produced was subjected to a beer tasting by the mayor of the town and a council of elders who evaluated its quality and strength and approved the beer for sale or export with a distinctive stamp. [...] Brewers who attempted to cheat the system of quality control were permanently stripped of their right to produce the beer. [...] The guild also organized the production of beer by the major breweries, which shared the Old Market well. [...] In 1843 and 1844, there were two breweries in Grodzisk that shared the well. [...] By 1866, the city had begun taxing the breweries for their use of the municipal wells. [...] Two private breweries built their own wells, and found that the water was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the water from the Old Market. [...] Following this discovery, all of breweries eventually built their own wells.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviewer}} from NME {{considered that}} the song sashays along with sass, while still remaining charming, {{and said that}} though it doesn't mark Allen out as excellent dating material, as a soundtrack to the summer, [...] "it’s a dead fackin’ cert". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters called [...] "Smile" [...] <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> [...] "LDN", [...] "its loose reggae arrangement augmented by the clever sample of Jackie Mittoo’s piano from the Soul Brothers’ 60s rocksteady tune [...] "Free Soul", as Allen sings bitterly about her ex, with {{just a hint of}} vulnerability at first, before going to her friends for reassurance, and confronting the guy during the chorus with a mean-spirited confidence that has us cheering inside". While John Murphy of MusicOMH praised the song and its [...] "gently lilting reggae rhythm", Priya Elan from NME considered that the Althea & Donna groove of [...] "Smile" [...] is what made fans [...] "fall for her in the first place". The former argued that [...] "even people who profess to hate pop music will secretly be tapping a foot to it and claiming it is just downright perfect pop for lolling around during the lazy warm, guaranteed to cheer the listeners up, no matter how down they're feeling". Other reviews came from The Guardian reporter Sophie Heawood, who didn't consider the song as Allen's greatest effort, but still thought she was far better than being called [...] "the female Mike Skinner".|$|E
500|$|In 1947, Feller {{announced}} that he would pitch in the Cuban winter league during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba. Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund: [...] "I want to prove I'm not going to Cuba for any selfish interest but because there is a principle involved and that is the right of any ball player to work at his chosen profession". Feller also believed it was [...] "grossly unfair" [...] that major leaguers who were U.S. citizens could not play in winter leagues but Latin Americans were permitted. Indians owner and president Bill Veeck said, [...] "I have no comment on Bob's outside activities. I don't know whether they've hurt him or not. But I do know this. The great majority of the people of Cleveland think they've hurt him." [...] Feller's barnstorming business savvy and endorsement details {{made him one of the}} wealthiest players of his time but he claimed his off-season exhibitions and barnstorming were necessary to pay for increased medical expenses for his family. His first wife developed anemia after giving birth to their second child when she was given the wrong type of blood during transfusions; she subsequently became addicted to the prescribed medication for her condition. Feller was trying to make up lost earnings as a result, since he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy; he missed more than three major league seasons. Feller's biographer John Sickels suggested: [...] "They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> the Major League players." ...|$|E

2500|$|Commenting in {{an article}} in The Guardian on a National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) study (draft) debunking homeopathy, FSM co-founder John Dwyer {{stressed}} an area that was not investigated; the use of homeopathy for protection. Dwyer told The Guardian, [...] "the most serious issue was the spreading of the concept that homeopathic vaccinations were harmless and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> orthodox vaccinations. People who believe that are not protecting themselves and their children." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruner sees a {{homosexual}} conspiracy {{in early childhood}} education programs (such as federally funded pre-kindergarten), stating in April 2016 that [...] "GLBTQ agenda {{is one of the}} big reasons liberals want 3-year-old and 4-year-old children to attend public school Pre-K programs" [...] and that pre-K programs teach children that [...] "{{a homosexual}} marriage is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> a marriage with a father and a mother." [...] Bruner claimed that children receiving this [...] "indoctrination" [...] will [...] "become confused about their sexuality" [...] and are [...] "told their parents are bigoted because they do not accept Islam and gay marriage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mary Adeline Williams was a {{longtime}} friend of the Eakins family, a best friend to Eakins' younger sister Margaret, and a distant relation through marriage; she would later say that Thomas Eakins [...] "was like a big brother to me." [...] As early as 1867 Eakins took a protective interest in her, writing to his sister Fanny: [...] "She is a pretty little girl & I guess <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> she is pretty, or she belies her blood.

2500|$|In {{the field}} of psychology, {{confirmation}} bias is the mental phenomenon that confirms the validity of a person's self-accepted beliefs, ideals, and values, to create emotional hostility (anti-intellectualism) towards and mistrust of other beliefs, ideals, and value systems to which the anti-intellectual person has not been exposed; thus, confirmation bias {{is a symptom of}} anti-intellectualism. The writer Isaac Asimov, said that “There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> your knowledge.’ ” ...|$|E
2500|$|The R-1 won the 1932 Thompson Trophy [...] race, piloted by Jimmy Doolittle. [...] He {{also set}} a new world landplane speed record of 476km/h (296mph) in the Shell Speed Dash. The {{distinction}} of a landplane record was noteworthy because, at that time, specialized speed seaplanes outran landplanes, e.g. the Macchi M.C.72 with over 700km/h. The Springfield Union of September 6, 1932 quoted Doolittle as saying, [...] "She is the sweetest ship I've ever flown. She is perfect in every respect and the motor is <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> {{it was a week}} ago. It never missed a beat and has lots of stuff in it yet.

In 1927, said Wisden, he [...] "seemed <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> when last in England, his swerve and accurate length invariably troubling batsmen, especially when a new ball was in use". In the season as a whole, he took 77 wickets at an average of 20.64. His best figures of the season came in a match against a very weak Worcestershire side at Stourbridge: he bowled 43.3 overs in the match and took 10 wickets for 43 runs as Somerset won by an innings despite making only 178.|$|E
