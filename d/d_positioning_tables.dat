40|$|A {{manufacturing}} machine at the engineering company Sandvik Coromant has a <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> which {{task is to}} move an item linearly. The <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> has a linear motor capable of high velocity and acceleration. This {{makes it possible to}} achieve short cycle times and a more profitable production. The purpose of this thesis is to bring forward a new concept which is more adapted to the requirements of the <b>positioning</b> <b>table.</b> The reason is that the current <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> provides an unnecessarily positioning accuracy of 0. 01 mm, while the requirement for the positioning accuracy is just 0. 1 mm. The goal is to reduce manufacturing and component costs. To develop a suitable solution an approach for the concept development process has been performed. The concept development process has been decomposed thoroughly to the <b>positioning</b> <b>table’s</b> basic functions where critical sub-problems have been identified. The information has been retrieved both internally and externally through interviews, literature, benchmarking, discussions and observations. A brainstorming has been performed where the different sub-problems were discussed. The brainstorming was used to create different ideas through sketches. This resulted in eight concepts. The developed concepts were later evaluated in a concept evaluation method called Concept scoring to select the best concept. Calculations were performed on the force caused by the surrounding equipment of the <b>positioning</b> <b>table.</b> The calculations were used as a basis when designing the different concepts. The best concept was found based on the Concept scoring and refined to meet all the requirements of the <b>positioning</b> <b>table.</b> The selected concept has a more compact solution with a shorter length and fewer components. This means that the installation of the new <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> becomes easier. The new concept has a considerably simpler design than the current <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> leading to a much cheaper solution. The current <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> has a cost of 155 000 SEK while the new concept will cost about 60 000 SEK, a reduction of 61 %.

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effects}} of single polar residues at the a and the <b>d</b> <b>positions</b> of a reference coiled coil, GCN 4 -pVL. The reference coiled coil is very stable in solution and exists as a mixture of dimers and trimers. The placement of single polar residues in the otherwise hydrophobic core of GCN 4 -pVL has dramatic effects on both stability and oligomeric specificity. The effects vary with regard to both the identity and the <b>position</b> (a vs <b>d</b> <b>position)</b> of the polar substitution. The <b>d</b> <b>position</b> is more sensitive to polar residues. Two residues, asparagine and glutamine, were found to be much more destabilizing when placed at <b>d</b> <b>positions</b> than any residues at the a positions. In addition to the known ability of a single asparagine at the a position to specify coiled-coil dimers, it was found that a single threonine at the d postion can specify a coiled-coil trimer. The crystal structures of four coiled coils, with either a single serine or threonine at either the a or the <b>d</b> <b>position,</b> were determined. These structures show that threonine residues tend to form intra-helical hydrogen bonds when packed in the coiled-coil core. Serine residues tend to show more variability in their packing when placed in the core positions. Polar residues can affect the local coiled-coil geometry. The most dramatic effect was as a result of serine residues at the <b>d</b> <b>position</b> in which in a local decrease in the supercoil radius of 0. 5 A centered around the buried serine position was observed. by David L.

40|$|In this paper, a new robust {{adaptive}} control scheme for nonlinear motorized <b>positioning</b> <b>tables</b> is presented. The proposed scheme can effectively handle the nonlinearities and time-varying uncertainties. By using the proposed controller {{to deal with}} the flexibility in the coupler and nonlinearity in the ball-screw system, a completely closed-loop system for a <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> can be achieved with the signal from the linear encoder in the mounting plate instead of from the rotatory encoder, as in conventional control approaches. As a result, a good tracking performance can be achieved. Unlike the traditional robust adaptive schemes, the proposed scheme is based on a new direct dynamics identification approach. This new approach facilitates the on-line implementation because it simplifies the conventional modeling in n states parameters to only one time parameter. Therefore, system dynamics can be obtained on-line with respect to time from the past known control activities. The dynamics identification procedure, adaptive scheme design and controller synthesis are presented in this paper. The experimental results for a <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> are included to illustrate of the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme...|$|R

A controller incorporating both acceleration feedforward and robust friction compensation is theoretically analyzed under various operating conditions and model uncertainties.

40|$|Coiled-coil motifs are {{ubiquitous}} mediators {{of specific}} protein-protein interactions through {{the formation of}} interlocking hydrophobic seams between α-helical chains. Residues that form these seams occur at the first (a) and fourth (<b>d)</b> <b>positions</b> of a characteristic 7 -aa repeat and are primarily aliphatic.

40|$|In this paper, a new {{control scheme}} for a {{nonlinear}} motorized <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> is presented. The proposed controller directly feeds the signal {{back from the}} linear encoder in the mounting plate instead of from the rotatory encoder, as in conventional control approaches. As a result, a completely closed-loop is achieved which yields high positioning accuracy. The reason for the nonlinear <b>positioning</b> <b>table</b> can be completely closed in the control loop without making it unstable is that the proposed controller identifies the system dynamics on-line and cancels out the nonlinearities and uncertainties in real time. Hence, the closed-loop system behaves as a first-order dominated system plus a small residual. By adding a robust part into the controller {{to deal with the}} small residual, asymptotic stability and better performance can be achieved. The details of the controller design, stability and performance analysis of the closed-loop system are presented in the paper.

5000|$|The general {{problem of}} {{deciding}} on the folded {{structure of a}} protein when given the amino acid sequence (the so-called protein folding problem) has not been solved. However, the coiled coil {{is one of a}} relatively small number of folding motifs for which the relationships between the sequence and the final folded structure are comparatively well understood. Harbury et al. performed a landmark study using an archetypal coiled coil, GCN4, in which rules that govern the way that peptide sequence affects the oligomeric state (that is, the number of alpha-helices in the final assembly) were established. The GCN4 coiled coil is a 31-amino-acid (which equates to just over four heptads) parallel, dimeric (i.e., consisting of two alpha-helices) coiled coil and has a repeated isoleucine (or I, in single-letter code) and leucine (L) at the a and <b>d</b> <b>positions,</b> respectively, and forms a dimeric coiled coil. When the amino acids in the a and <b>d</b> <b>positions</b> were changed from I at a and L at d to L at a and I at d, a trimeric (three alpha-helices) coiled coil was formed. Furthermore, mutating the a and <b>d</b> <b>positions</b> both to L resulted in the formation of a tetrameric (four alpha-helices) coiled coil. These represent a set of rules for the determination of coiled coil oligomeric states and allows scientists to effectively [...] "dial-in" [...] the oligomerization behavior. Another aspect of coiled coil assembly that is relatively well understood, at least in the case of dimeric coiled coils, is that placing a polar residue (in particular asparagine, N) at opposing a positions forces parallel assembly of the coiled coil. This effect is due to a self-complementary hydrogen bonding between these residues, which would go unsatisfied if an N were paired with, for instance, an L on the opposing helix.|$|R
