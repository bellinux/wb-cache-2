5|$|Kesselring {{endorsed}} Hitler's {{order that}} deserters should be hanged {{from the nearest}} tree. When a staff officer sought to make him aware of the hopelessness of the situation, Kesselring told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> driven through the entire army rear area and not seen a single hanged man.|$|E
5|$|His friend George Gray, {{himself a}} {{champion}} shooter, told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty-four {{in three months}} in sixty battalions; by his reckoning, this meant that Hesketh-Prichard had saved over 3,500 lives. He was promoted to major in November 1916. By {{this time in the}} war, his contributions to sniping had been such that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed.|$|E
5|$|Olmstead won {{two more}} Stanley Cups in the 1956–57 and 1957–58 seasons. After the {{conclusion}} of the 1957–58 seasons, doctors informed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no strength left in his knees, and that he should contemplate retirement. As a result of this prognosis, the Canadiens left Olmstead unprotected in the Intra-League Draft, and he was claimed by Billy Reay, the head coach of the Canadiens' chief rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E

5|$|Beshear and Abramson easily {{defeated}} Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Days later, the Lexington Herald-Leader {{reported that}} Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams {{confirmed that the}} woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had been}} put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E

5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|Though Taylor's {{friendship}} and partnership with Clough had been strong, their relationship had sometimes become strained on occasion. While at Derby in 1971, Taylor was riled {{when he learned}} that Clough had failed to disclose to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received a pay rise of £5,000 from chairman Sam Longson. He was also annoyed that Clough was often away earning extra money from media work while he was left to do a larger share of the work with the players. The relationship worsened in the autumn of 1980 when Taylor published With Clough, by Taylor, an autobiography which was largely based on Taylor's work with Clough. Taylor had not told Clough that he was writing the book and did not give him a share of the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Captain Mends on Arethusa, {{casualties}} were severe on both sides. Amethyst had eight killed and 37 wounded from {{a crew of}} 222, while the French ship lost 47 killed and 73 wounded from a crew of 339. Recriminations among the British officers began within minutes of the French surrender: Mends took possession of Niémen and sent a note to Seymour informing <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seized the valuable French nautical charts and the French captain's personal stores. The note also requested that Seymour send back Arethusas surgeon, who had gone aboard Amethyst {{to assist with the}} wounded, so that Mends could be ready to leave without notice. Seymour, who was still effecting hasty repairs and dealing with his casualties, responded angrily, forcing Mends to back down and return the stores. Seymour was also annoyed by Mends' late arrival, which meant that Arethusa was entitled to half the prize money from the captured frigate without having done any of the fighting. Repairs were completed on 7 April, and Amethyst and Niémen limped back to Plymouth, arriving on 13 April.|$|E

5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum, Hippesley {{initially}} {{continued as}} captain of Sandgate, {{until he was}} replaced in 1653, resulting in complaints from <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been unfairly treated {{and that he was}} owed money by Parliament. During this period the garrison was increased to include a governor, two corporals, twenty soldiers and three gunners. When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Sandgate and the other Device Forts initially remained {{at the heart of the}} south coast defences, but by now their design was antiquated. The garrison was cut back to its pre-war levels, and then reduced further in 1682 to only ten men. Sandgate had fallen into a poor condition, and £200 was assigned in 1663 for the repair of the castle, to be met partially from the proceeds of lands around Sandgate confiscated from former supporters of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Fatima Jinnah {{joined her}} brother in England. From then on, Muhammad Jinnah would receive {{personal}} care {{and support from}} her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him. She lived and travelled with him, and became a close advisor. Muhammad Jinnah's daughter, Dina, was educated in England and India. Jinnah later became estranged from Dina after she decided to marry a Christian, Neville Wadia from a prominent Parsi business family. When Jinnah urged Dina to marry a Muslim, she reminded <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> married a woman not raised in his faith. Jinnah continued to correspond cordially with his daughter, but their personal relationship was strained, {{and she did not}} come to Pakistan in his lifetime, but only for his funeral.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February 1918 Dyer {{was awarded}} a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston, which he {{followed}} up with another win this time over Terry Brooks. At {{the start of the}} Brooks fight, as Dyer was getting into the ring, he was handed a telegram informing <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee. Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces {{during the rest of the}} war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments. Dyer also continued his charity work, singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Poppaea now plans some deceit of her own, in {{an effort}} to divert Claudius's wrath from Otho with whom she has now reconciled. She hides Otho in her bedroom with {{instructions}} to listen carefully. Soon Nero arrives to press his love on her ("Coll'ardor del tuo bel core"), but she tricks him into hiding as well. Then Claudius enters; Poppaea tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> earlier misunderstood her: it was not Otho but Nero who had ordered her to reject Claudius. To prove her point she asks Claudius to pretend to leave, then she summons Nero who, thinking Claudius has gone, resumes his passionate wooing of Poppaea. Claudius suddenly reappears and angrily dismisses the crestfallen Nero. After Claudius departs, Poppaea brings Otho out of hiding and the two express their everlasting love in separate arias.|$|E
5|$|She {{was elected}} {{national}} senator in the 1995 general elections. She opposed most bills proposed by Menem, {{such as a}} treaty with Chilean president Patricio Aylwin that benefited Chile {{in a dispute over}} the Argentina–Chile border. The Minister of Defense Oscar Camilión was questioned in Congress about the Argentine arms trafficking scandal; Kirchner told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to resign, which he refused to do. As a result, she made a name for herself as a troublemaker. She was removed from the PJ bloc in the Congress in 1997 for misconduct. She resigned her senatorial seat that year and ran for national deputy in the 1997 midterm elections instead. Menem ended his term of office in 1999 and was replaced by Fernando de la Rúa. Kirchner took part in a commission to investigate money laundering with fellow legislator Elisa Carrió, and got into conflicts with her. She ran again for senator in the 2001 midterm elections.|$|E

50|$|Jack Thomas {{has grown}} up in the belief <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an orphan. His {{guardian}} tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an elder brother (Frank Tomasulo) and a dying father. They are both in the liquor business prohibition era.|$|R
5|$|Vermigli {{was summoned}} to a Chapter Extraordinary of the Lateran Congregation, and his friends warned <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{powerful}} adversaries. These increasingly foreboding events contributed to his decision to ignore the summons and flee, but he was finally persuaded by his conscience against the Masses he was bound to perform. Vermigli fled Lucca for Pisa on 12 August 1542 by horse with three of his canons. There he celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist for the first time. When he stopped in Florence, staying in Badia Fiesolana where he had entered religious life, Vermigli learned that Bernardino Ochino had arrived there. Vermigli convinced Ochino, a popular preacher with Protestant leanings, to flee Italy as well. On 25 August Vermigli left for Zürich by way of Ferrara and Verona.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{spent his}} exile in Mercia, where {{he enjoyed the}} staunch support of King Æthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a council at Austerfield, on the {{southern}} border of Northumbria, which was attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid's return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by the bishops. According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but the bishops reminded <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> promised Wilfrid safe-conduct. After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was excommunicated by his enemies among the bishops. He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to Pope John VI. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.|$|E
5|$|With {{funding from}} the Office of Naval Research, Rainwater built a synchrotron, which became {{operational}} in 1950, at the Nevis Laboratories, on an estate on the Hudson River at Irvington, New York, willed to Columbia University by the DuPont family. He became a full professor in 1952 and {{was the director of}} Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961. He worked with his student Val Fitch on studies of muonic atoms, atoms where an electron is replaced by a muon. After 1965, he worked on turning the Nevis synchrotron into a meson facility. When a reporter rang in 1975 to inform <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his was for his work on atomic structure, the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson.|$|E
