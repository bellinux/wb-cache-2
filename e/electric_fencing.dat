25|$|Due to {{the loss}} of habitat, more and more species of fauna have started to venture into human {{habitation}} causing a conflict between humans and fauna. A typical species affected by this is the elephant which ventures out of the forest into human cultivations thereby eating or destroying the crops. In some cases, the elephants have also caused human deaths like an incident that happened in Hassan district where a villager was trampled to death. Precautionary measures (sometimes illegally) taken up by humans to prevent such mishaps like <b>electric</b> <b>fencing</b> have also led to disastrous consequences like electrocution of fauna.|$|E

50|$|Security <b>Electric</b> <b>Fences</b> are <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> {{constructed}} using {{specialised equipment}} and built for perimeter security {{as opposed to}} animal management. Security <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> consist of wires that carry pulses of electric current to provide a non-lethal shock to deter potential intruders. Tampering with the fence also results in an alarm that is logged by the security <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> energiser, and can also trigger a siren, strobe, and/or notifications to a control room or directly to the owner via email or phone.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} an <b>Electric</b> <b>Fence</b> Monitoring System (EFMS) which detects and announciates fence malfunctions indicating operational ineffectiveness. The EFMS consists of a master unit and up to sixteen slave units. Each slave unit monitors a single remote point on the fence. Slave units gain their power from the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> pulse itself. They use a unique transmission algorithm to transmit the peak <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> voltage, to the master unit. The <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> wire is used to convey this transmission. The master unit uses a non-linear switched capacitor filter with variable gain control, to detect the slave unit transmissions. This unit displays the peak voltage at each monitored point and allows the setting of alarm trigger points. This thesis includes modelling of the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> energiser and typical <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> line, and the detailed design of the two units that makeup the EFMS...|$|R

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} contact through fences at cervid farms {{with only a}} single perimeter fence {{may play a role}} in transmission of diseases such as chronic wasting disease or bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis). We report a case study examining effectiveness of a baited <b>electric</b> <b>fence,</b> as an addition to an existing single woven-wire fence (2. 4 m high), for altering behavior and reducing fence-line contact between elk (Cervus elaphus). We used a video-surveillance system to monitor one 20 -m-long test fence at an elk ranch in north-central Colorado, USA from 2006 to 2007. We conducted 26 trials (11 without <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> during 48. 2 total cumulative days and 15 with <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> during 63. 7 days) with different levels of motivation for contact between groups of elk separated by the test fence. We documented 426 contacts between elk (direct transmission risk) or the woven-wire fence (indirect transmission risk) during trials without the <b>electric</b> <b>fence.</b> We documented 0 contacts between adult elk or the woven-wire fence during trials when the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> was in place. During our case study, 24 of 25 elk exposed to the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> were completely deterred. We emphasize that our approach targets behavior modification of farmed elk routinely exposed to the <b>electric</b> <b>fence,</b> not wild elk that may occasionally approach from the outside. Our results suggest that adding a baited <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> inside an existing woven-wire–fenced enclosure has potential to provide a cost-effective means to minimize contacts between farmed and wild elk...|$|R
