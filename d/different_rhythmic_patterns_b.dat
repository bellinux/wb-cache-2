The world's first electronic rhythm machine, with a photoreceptor-based sound production system proposed by Cowell (not a theremin-like system, as some sources incorrectly state), it could produce up to sixteen <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> simultaneously, complete with optional syncopation. Cowell wrote several original compositions for the instrument, including an orchestrated concerto, and Theremin built two more models. Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept.|$|R

The proposed neuronal circuit includes two fast- and two slowly-spiking cells which are interconnected by means of dynamical synapses. On the individual level, each neuron is modeled by FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. Three basic <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> are observed: gamma-rhythm in which the fast neurons are uniformly spiking, theta-rhythm {{in which the individual}} spikes are separated by quiet epochs, and theta/gamma rhythm with repeated patches of spikes. We analyze the influence of asymmetry of synaptic strengths on the synchronization in the network and demonstrate that strong asymmetry reduces the variety of available dynamical states. The model network exhibits multistability; this results in occurrence of hysteresis in dependence on the conductances of individual connections.

50|$|All {{meditation}} {{methods are}} effective in reducing stress, but they do so in different ways. The method of HRM involves conscious breathing, use of the full lung capacity, a concentration on the heart (both the physical heart and the emotional or poetic heart) and an intervention in the breath to make it rhythmic, through the coordination of the breath and heartbeat. Several <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> are used, including making {{the length of the}} inhale even with the length of the exhale, for example, 8 beats in, 8 beats out; this is called “The Swinging Breath”. Another pattern involves a longer holding of the breath, so that the holding period equals the breathing period, for example, 8 beats in, 16 beats hold, 8 beats out; this is called “The Square Breath”. This square breath has a great stabiliizing quality and is very helpful for anxiety or feelings of panic. The method of HRM never involves holding the breath after an exhalation, only after an inhalation.|$|R

However, research focused on the effect of rhythm, notably on the various type of <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> have not fully discovered yet, hence this research attempts to fill the gap in the literature, by testing <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> on verbal memory of the recall of ten digit numbers and whether {{there is a difference between}} music and non-music major undergraduate students. Methodology included a recall test with 6 sets of 10 digit number and two attempts were given for each rhythmic pattern: no <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> dotted rhythm, inverted dotted rhythm, long short rhythm, short long rhythm and triplets rhythm. Sixty undergraduate students were recruited for this study; thirty musicians from music faculty and thirty non-musicians from non-music faculty. Meanwhile, data were analyzed using SPANOVA. Results revealed that there was a significant difference in 10 digit number recall when the digit is presented with dotted rhythm on 1 st attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 104. 47, p <. 05) ] and 2 nd attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 127. 27, p <. 05) ], inverted dotted rhythm on 1 st attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 19. 66, p <. 05) ] and 2 nd attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 75. 73, p <. 05) ], long short rhythm on 1 st attempt [F (df = 1, 118 p <. 05) = 34. 04] and 2 nd attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 56. 13, p <. 05) ], short long rhythm on 1 st attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 21. 98, p <. 05) ] and 2 nd attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 55. 81, p <. 05) ], triplet rhythm on 1 st attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 9. 63 p <. 05) ] and 2 nd attempt [F (df = 1, 118) = 16. 54, p <. 05) ]. Furthermore, There was a significant difference in 10 digit numbers recall between musicians and non-musicians on their short term memory with the aid of <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> on 1 st attempt [F (df = 3. 6, 206. 92) = 5. 68, p <. 05) ] and 2 nd attempt [F (df = 1, 58,) = 2. 78, p <. 05].

40|$|As {{the engine}} behind many life phenomena, motor {{information}} {{generated by the}} central nervous system (CNS) plays a critical role in the activities of all animals. In this work, a novel, macroscopic and model-independent approach is presented for creating different patterns of coupled neural oscillations observed in biological central pattern generators (CPG) during the control of legged locomotion. Based on a simple distributed state machine, which consists of two nodes sharing pre-defined number of resources, the concept of oscillatory building blocks (OBBs) is summarised for the production of elaborated <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Various types of OBBs can be designed to construct a motion joint of one degree-of-freedom (DOF) with adjustable oscillatory frequencies and duty cycles. An OBBs network can thus be potentially built to generate a full range of locomotion patterns of a legged animal with controlled transitions between <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns.</b> It is shown that gait pattern transition can be achieved by simply changing a single parameter of an OBB module. Essentially this simple mechanism allows for the consolidation of a methodology for the construction of artificial CPG architectures behaving as an asymmetric Hopfield neural network. Moreover, the proposed CPG model introduced here is amenable to analogue and/or digital circuit integration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we propose the new {{conception}} of Harmony Search (HS) algorithm for scientific workflow scheduling called Polyrhythmic Harmony Search (PHS). The main idea of Harmony search {{is based on the}} artificial phenomenon found in jazz musical performance, namely the process of searching for better harmony. As it well known, jazz is characterized by the presence of several complex musical structures, such as polyrhythm, where a few <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> are played in the same time. According to technology of virtualization, which allows to divide physical computing resources into virtual machines, the main idea of the proposed algorithm is in the use of two heterogeneous harmonies – task scheduling on the computing environment and optimization of the computing environment for the tasks – as two different rhythms, which can be played in jazz. This algorithm is compared to several metaheuristic algorithms. Experimental results of PHS evaluation showed that proposed algorithm allows to find an optimal solution on a par with Genetic algorithm and with a greater convergence speed in terms of scheduling execution time...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin:acetyl {{coenzyme}} A N-acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 5) Activity in pineal gland was assayed in rats {{which were}} born and raised under diurnal lighting conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N-Acetyltransferase activity in the pups raised under diurnal lighting showed a <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> with high enzyme activity during dark period. The pups raised in continuous darkness also showed a <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern,</b> the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr in 7 -week-old pups; the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase began in the evening in 12 -day-old pups and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every week. The pups raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic phase was delayed by 3 hr every week. When the mother rats were coupled in darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after the pups were born, their pups again showed a <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern.</b> These observations indicate that the biological clock for N-acetyltransferase is generated independently of environmental lighting. When mothers were coupled under reversed lighting conditions and transferred into darkness or light, the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> in their pups was inverted 180 degrees from that of pups born of diurnal mothers. When the pups were raised in darkness, the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase in the pups {{was similar to that}} of their mothers.

When pups were reared by a foster mother with a <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern</b> from that of their original mother, the rhythmic phase in the pups was closer to that of the original mother, suggesting that the original mother plays the predominant role setting the rhythm of the pups...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this chapter}} we follow this "economy of means" way to present several vari- eties of CCP calculi, {{starting}} {{from a very}} basic one and building from it by adding new features. A fundamental one for music applications {{is the ability to}} represent temporal behavior. This can be introduced within the context of determinate (tcc, utcc) or non-determinate (ntcc) computation. For the determinate case, we show how the addition of a process abstraction feature (utcc) allows to model dynamic musical structures in a very simple way. In particular, we model a dynamic version of interactive scores ([ALL 07]). For the nondeterminate case, we use the possibility of defining many alternative computational paths to model an agent following <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> constructed from a given basic one. We then go on to consider a more "metrical" notion of time (rtcc) based on uniform ticks used by processes to define their time of execution in a more fine-grained way, or to cause preemption of other processes at more precisely defined points in time. We use these new "real-time" features to describe a simple model of a basic form of musical dissonances...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we aim to capture <b>rhythmic</b> and melodic <b>patterning</b> in speech and singing {{directed}} to infants. We address this issue by exploring the acoustic features that best predict different classification problems. We built a database composed by infant-directed speech from two Portuguese variants (European vs Brazilian Portuguese) and infant-directed singing from the two cultures, comprising 977 tokens. Machine learning experiments were conducted in order to automatically discriminate between language variants for speech, vocal songs and between interaction contexts. Descriptors related with rhythm exhibited strong predictive ability for both speech and singing language variants’ discrimination tasks, presenting <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterning</b> for each variant. Common features {{could be used by}} a classifier to discriminate speech and singing, indicating that the processing of speech and singing may share the analysis of the same stimulus properties. With respect to discriminating interaction contexts, pitch-related descriptors showed better performance. We conclude that prosodic cues present in the surrounding sonic environment of an infant are rich sources of information not only to make distinctions between different communicative contexts through melodic cues, but also to provide specific cues about the rhythmic identity of their mother tongue. These prosodic differences may lead to further research on their influence {{in the development of the}} infant’s musical representations...|$|R

(Shay 2008) Another attraction for the dancer, especially in certain Greek American events like church-sponsored festivals and in the taverna, the Greek equivalent of a night club, is that conviviality rules and as such the music and dance is accompanied by delicious food, drink, engaging light-hearted conversation, compelling music, and appealing dances—a far cry from the bland American popular music and food with which I grew up...|$|R

It aimed to qualitatively review similarities between growing up in music, bodily participation in music performances, rhythmic structures, polyrhythms, hemiola and syncopation and flow as elements of music and success of East African distance runners. Results of the review in general, suggest that East African music reflects the rhythm of life and performs a crucial function by integrating rhythm and human movement, including distance running as specific manifestation of human movement. It seems if East African runners perceive the function of rhythm differently than western runners and could {{have the ability to}} weave complex rhythms together in their running by interlocking and crossing <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> and structures. Because East-African runners grow up with and within rhythm through their music traditions and bodily participation in music performances, they most likely succeed to “live” rhythm in their distance running as opposed to western athletes who often deconstruct the running motion into different elements and implement a “learn to run” approach. Experience in and exposure to the polyrhythms of drumming as significant element of East African music could contribute to the distance runners being able to experience “flow” in their running. The broad findings of this conceptual review could have several significant implications for distance training in western countries as well as sport coach education syllabi. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{consists of}} a series of 9 large-scale cotton rag prints, printed from digital files, and a sound and picture animation on DVD composed of drawings, sound, analogue and digital photographs, and Super 8 footage. The exhibition represents the artist’s experience of Singapore during her residency. Source imagery was gathered from photographs taken at the Bukit Brown abandoned Chinese Cemetery in Singapore, and Australian native gardens in Parkville Melbourne. Historical sources include re-photographed Singapore 19 th and early 20 th century postcard images. The works use analogue, hand-drawn and digital imaging, still and animated, to explore the digital interface’s ability to combine mixed media. This practice stems from the digital imaging practice of layering, using various media editing software. The work is innovative in that it stretches the idea of the layer composition in a single image by setting each layer into motion using animation techniques. This creates a multitude of permutations and combinations as the two layers move in <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns.</b> The work also represents an innovative collaboration between the photographic practitioner and a sound composer, Duncan King-Smith, who designed sound for the animation based on concepts of trance, repetition and abstraction.

2500|$|As the yet unnamed genre evolved, {{the use of}} sampled funk breakbeats became {{increasingly}} complex. Most notable and widely spread is the Amen break taken from a b-side funk track [...] "Amen, Brother" [...] by the Winston Brothers (The Winstons). During this time producers began cutting apart loops and using the component drum sounds to create new rhythms. [...] To match the complex drum lines, basslines which had less {{in common with the}} patterns of house and techno music than with the phrasings of dub and hip hop began to be used. As the beat-per-minute range rose above 165, the emerging drum and bass sound became incompatible for straightforward DJ mixing with house and techno, which typically range dozens of beats-per-minute less (making it impossible to play the tracks at the same speed on club equipment). This sonic identity became highly distinctive for both the depth of its bass and the increasingly complex, rapid-fire breakbeat percussion. [...] Vastly <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> were distinctively being used, as well as new types of sampling, synthesis and effects processing techniques, resulting in a greater focus on the intricacies of sampling/synthesis production and rhythm.

(ii) What are the mechanisms underlying the coexistence of robustness and flexibility in the observed <b>rhythmic</b> spatio-temporal <b>patterns?</b> One common view is that particular bursting neurons provide the rhythmogenic component while the connections between different neurons {{are responsible for the}} regularisation and synchronisation of groups of neurons and for specific phase relationships in multi-phasic patterns. We have examined the spatio-temporal <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> in computer-simulated motif networks of HH neurons connected by slow inhibitory synapses with a non-symmetric pattern of coupling strengths. We demonstrate that the interplay between intrinsic and network dynamics features either cooperation or competition, depending on three basic control parameters identified in our model: the shape of intrinsic bursts, the strength of the coupling and its degree of asymmetry. The cooperation of intrinsic dynamics and network mechanisms is shown to correlate with bistability, i. e., the coexistence of two different attractors in the phase space of the system corresponding to <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> spatio-temporal <b>patterns.</b> Conversely, if the network mechanism of rhythmogenesis dominates, monostability is observed with a typical pattern of winnerless competition between neurons.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a collection of}} results in computational geometry that are inspired from music theory literature. The {{solutions to the problems}} discussed are based on a representation of musical rhythms where pulses are viewed as points equally spaced around the circumference of a circle and onsets are a subset of the pulses. All our results for rhythms apply equally well to scales, and many of the problems we explore are interesting in their own right as distance geometry problems on the circle. In this thesis, we characterize two families of rhythms called deep and Euclidean. We describe three algorithms that generate the unique Euclidean rhythm for a given number of onsets and pulses, and show that Euclidean rhythms are formed of repeating patterns of a Euclidean rhythm with fewer onsets, followed possibly by a <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> <b>pattern.</b> We then study the conditions under which we can transform one Euclidean rhythm to another through five different operations. In the context of measuring rhythmic similarity, we discuss the necklace alignment problem where the goal is to find rotations of two rhythms and a perfect matching between the onsets that minimizes some norm of the circular distance between the matched points. We provide o (n 2) -time algorithms to this problem using each of the ℓ 1, ℓ 2, and ℓinfinity norms as distance measures. Finally, we give a polynomial-time solution to the labeled beltway problem where we are given the ordering of a set of points around the circumference of a circle and a labeling of all distances defined by pairs of points, and we want to construct a rhythm such that two distances with a common onset as endpoint have the same length if and only if they have the same label...|$|R

The fact that there are many proverbs and sayings on the topic of rocks also shows their importance. They were a source of very interesting, although scarce, games for our grandfathers and grandmothers in their childhood. And children have not changed much to this day. Stones still make them enthusiastic and they love to hide them in their pockets. In the theoretical part of my thesis I wrote about formation and classification of rocks.

In the empirical part I tried to establish the level of pre-knowledge that four-year-olds have about rocks. I questioned nineteen four-year-old children individually.

Auditory <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> were repeated cyclically, and participants first synchronized with each pattern and then reproduced it 10 times on a MIDI keyboard, which yielded measures of the timing and velocities of key depression and release. Experiment 1 used strongly and weakly metrical patterns from Povel and Essens (1985). Experiment 2 varied metrical structure independently of grouping structure by adding an explicit beat in <b>different</b> phases to <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Strongly metrical sequences were produced with more precise and less variable timing (Exp. 1), and syncopation had some unexpected effects on timing (Exp. 2). However, metrically accented taps were similar in most respects to unaccented taps; only key release velocities tended to be faster for accented taps (Exp. 2). By contrast, grouping structure had strong effects on all movement parameters. The results suggest that, unlike rhythmic grouping, metrical structure (and metrical accentuation in particular) is not necessarily reflected in action. Repp & Saltzman: Meter and grouping...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} twenty years, the quality of {{synthesized}} speech has improved greatly {{with the emergence of}} corpus-based speech synthesis systems. Yet the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> obtained do not always sound very natural. The aim of the paper is to investigate the reason for the lack of naturalness by comparing the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> observed in natural speech and in synthesized speech for three distinct literary forms (poetry, rhymes and fairy tales). The comparison has been done by automatically computing <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> correlates (%V, !V, !C, VarcoV, VarcoC, rPVI, nPVI and CCI), and by analyzing manually the segmentation in prosodic words and the durational patterns observed at this level of phrasing...|$|R
40|$|Background in Music Psychology. Previous {{research}} on simple synthetic <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> revealed the categorical structure of rhythm perception in music [1]. However, {{further research is}} needed to investigate complex rhythmic structures. This paper investigates rhythmic similarity in terms of mathematical measures and psychological measures. This study focuses on flamenco music, which is characterized by hand-clapping patterns whose underlying meter is composed of a pattern of soft and accented claps. Background in Computer Science. A mathematical analysis of the five 12 / 8 <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> used in flamenco music was recently conducted to establish several musicological hypotheses [2], and specifically confirmed the existence of an ancestral rhythm for flamenco music. This analysis relied on the similarity between the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Such similarity was measured with two <b>different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> similarity measures: the chronotonic distance and the directed swap distance. Aims. Presented in this paper are the results of a listening test conducted to evaluate the perceived similarity of the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> used in flamenco music (5 basic patterns + ancestral rhythm). The psychological ratings of similarity are then compared with the mathematical measures proposed in [2]. The goal of this experiment is compare mathematical measures of rhythmic similarit...|$|R
50|$|Patayani thappu is Indian frame drum with {{a wooden}} rim (formed with three parts) covered with leather on one side. It is played with the hands, as opposed to parai thappu, that is played with sticks. Thappu {{is used in the}} ritual art of Kerala known as Padayani, in which the drum accompanies stylized dance {{movements}} and provides percussive music in a rhythmic ensemble. Some of the <b>rhythmic</b> <b>patterns</b> performed are Champa, Kaarika, Kumba, Adantha and Marma. In devotional music it is usually accompanied by traditional cymbals called elathalam. <b>Different</b> <b>rhythmic</b> ensembles can be produced by blending thappu with chenda drum.|$|R
