This variety of architectures and interfaces creates software development, maintenance, and portability problems for application programs. The Virtual <b>Frame</b> Buffer <b>Interface</b> program makes all frame buffers {{appear as a}} generic frame buffer with a specified set of characteristics, allowing programmers to write code which will run unmodified on all supported hardware. The Virtual <b>Frame</b> Buffer <b>Interface</b> converts generic commands to actual device commands. The virtual frame buffer consists of a definition of capabilities and FORTRAN subroutines that are called by application programs. The virtual frame buffer routines may be treated as subroutines, logical functions, or integer functions by the application program. Routines are included that allocate and manage hardware resources such as frame buffers, monitors, video switches, trackballs, tablets and joysticks; access image memory planes; and perform alphanumeric font or text generation. The subroutines for the various "real" frame buffers are in separate VAX/VMS shared libraries allowing modification, correction or enhancement of the virtual interface without affecting application programs. The Virtual <b>Frame</b> Buffer <b>Interface</b> program was developed in FORTRAN 77 for a DEC VAX 11 / 780 or a DEC VAX 11 / 750 under VMS 4. X.

40|$|Abstract—An attempt {{has been}} made to {{evaluate}} the performance of ACB masonry in-filled RC frame under cyclic in-plane lateral load. The frame itself was detailed with reinforcement conforming to ductile detailing as per the Indian standards. The specimen tested was a geometrically half-scale model and constructed as per conventional construction practice adopted in India. This means that the RC frame was cast initially, and later the masonry in-fill was provided without making any efforts to induce any structural connection between MI and RC <b>frame</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Obviously, the top of the masonry in-fill and the soffit of the beam remains the first plane of weakness. This also means that the popular diagonal strut action may not be mobilized fully. This should set the guiding principle for any attempt to develop an analytical model for the estimation of failure load. The details of the experimental set-up, the cracking and failure mode of the system and the significance of the experimental response are presented in detail.

I present several experiments administered in virtual environment which tested the process of accessing two discrete spatial reference frames: allocentric landmark-centred and object-centred. The research tries to answer whether these reference <b>frames</b> <b>interface</b> during the learning phase and whether their access is sim- ultaneous or sequential. Data from my experiment are partially concordant with previous research and imply that the two representations exist inde- pendent of each other.

But the data also suggest that the switch from the object-centred reference frame does not occur prior to the task itself, which is conflicting with previous studies.

40|$|Abstract. Two studies {{examine the}} effect of the {{geometric}} forms of nodes of a concept map, presented prior to reading a text, on its comprehension. In the first study we varied the map interface. 162 students received a concept map to study. The map was presented in one of five interfaces: two bi-form interfaces (ellipses for content and rectangles for structure concepts, and vice versa), two uniform interfaces (ellipses or rectangles node frames), or a concept map without frames. Then a text was given to study without the map, and a comprehension test followed. Three texts were studied. The results indicated no comprehension differences between the two bi-form groups and neither between the two uniform groups. The comprehension scores were higher for the bi-form compared with the uniform <b>interface.</b> The no <b>frame</b> <b>interface</b> received the lowest scores. Before and after studying the texts, the students ranked their preferences for the various map interfaces. The preferences were in concordance to the overall comprehension results, regardless to the group conditions. In the second study we also compared an incongruent biform map to the other conditions using the same procedure. Incongruence hindered comprehension and was least preferred. ...|$|R

The behavior protocols are used on three levels: <b>interface,</b> <b>frame,</b> and architecture.

40|$|Interfacial {{delamination}} {{has become}} one of the key reliability issues in the microelectronic industry and therefore is getting more and more attention. The analysis of delamination of a laminate structure with a crack along the interface is central to the characterization of interfacial toughness. Due to the mismatch in mechanical properties of the materials adjacent to the interface and also possible asymmetry of loading and geometry, usually the crack propagates under mixed mode conditions. In this study, the interface delamination toughness of an epoxy molding compound and copper lead <b>frame</b> <b>interface</b> is characterized. The test specimen is directly obtained from a production process line. As a consequence, the specimen dimensions are relatively small and therefore a dedicated small-size test set-up was designed and fabricated. The test setup is suitable for actualizing both pure mode I DCB (double cantilever beam) loading and pure mode II ENF (end notched flexure) loa ding and allows transferring two separated loadings (mode I and mode II) on a single specimen. The setup is flexible and adjustable for measuring specimens with various dimensions. For measurements under various temperatures and moisture conditions, a special climate chamber is designed. The "current crack length" is required for the interpretation of measurement results through FEM-fracture mechanics simulations. Therefore, during testing the "current crack length" is captured using a CCD camera. The critical fracture properties are obtained by interpreting the experimental results through dedicated finite element modeling. As input parameters, the material properties are both experimentally and numerically characterized as functions of temperature of moisture. In order to get more accurate interfacial toughness, the influence of residual stress in the sample is considered...|$|R

Over an eight-month period (August 1994 - March 1995), two 15 -cell MCSA solar array 'mini' panel test articles were simultaneously put through 24, 000 thermal cycles (+ 80 C to - 100 C), equivalent to four years on-orbit.

40|$|Typical CoFeB/MgO <b>frames</b> {{ensuring}} <b>interface</b> perpendicular {{magnetic anisotropy}} (PMA) features {{are one of}} the most reliable building blocks to meet the demand of PMA-based memory devices. However, employing the CoFeB/MgO frame with a Ta buffer layer has been restricted by the rapid PMA degradation that occurs during annealing at temperatures greater than 300 °C and the need of an ultrathin CoFeB layer of approximately 1. 3 nm. Thus, the ability to enhance thermally strong PMA characteristics is still a key step toward extending their use. Here, we examine the effect of W layers on PMA features through both W buffer/CoFeB/MgO and MgO/CeFeB/W capping frames at various annealing temperatures. Highly stable PMA was achieved up to 450 °C at a specific W thickness, along with the presence of the dominant PMA properties at a relatively thick CoFeB greater than 1. 3 nm and the achievement of a high Keff of approximately 5 Merg/cc.
