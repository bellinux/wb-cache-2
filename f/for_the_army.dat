5|$|A {{fresh look}} at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the {{construction}} of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HIBEX. This proved interesting enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered defending bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept.|$|E

5|$|After their victory, Alcibiades and Thrasybulus {{began the}} siege of Chalcedon in 409 BC with about 190 ships. Although unable to attain a decisive victory or induce the city to surrender, Alcibiades was able to win a small {{tactical}} land battle outside of the city gates and Theramenes concluded {{an agreement with the}} Chalcedonians. Afterwards they concluded a temporary alliance with Pharnabazus which secured some much needed immediate cash <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>army,</b> but despite this Alcibiades was still forced to depart in search for more booty to pay the soldiers and oarsmen of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>army</b> of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945 the Australian Army {{suffered}} from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to design and build a heavy lift ship <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army.</b> Steele personally designed the ship, which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies. He deliberately underestimated the project's cost {{in order to gain}} approval for the ship's design and construction.|$|E
5|$|Following the Richmond Depot, other depots {{started up}} {{throughout}} the South to supply their respective regional forces. Major depots were in Columbus, Athens and Atlanta, Georgia <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> of Tennessee and Houston, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana for the Trans-Mississippi forces. The {{use of the}} depot system meant that army-wide uniformity was impossible, as different depots had unique uniforms (Columbus Depot Jackets for instance, had breast pockets, whilst Richmond Depot Jackets did not). This resulted in a varied set of uniforms worn by different Confederate units.|$|E

5|$|From September 1939 to March 1940, Madgwick {{designed}} and managed an adult education scheme for the Sydney University Regiment, based at Menangle. As Australia in 1940 became increasingly involved in World War II and expanded its military forces, Madgwick and colleagues David Drummond, C.E.W. Bean, (Sir) Robert W. Wallace (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney), Richard Charles Mills, W.G.K. Duncan, Alf A.J. Conlon, and others began to publicly {{call for the}} Australian Army to install an adult education program to combat illiteracy among its members and educate them in the political history of Australia. Beginning in May 1940 and culminating in a special conference on 20 August 1940, Madgwick and the others cooperatively drafted an adult education scheme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army.</b>|$|E
5|$|Garrett was {{concerned}} {{not only with}} changing the Army's organisation but with upgrading its equipment; by the early 1960s the Army would acquire the FN 7.62mm rifle, the M60 machine gun, the M101 105mm howitzer, the M113 armoured personnel carrier, and new mortars and radios. He also advocated strongly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army</b> to operate its own helicopters and light aircraft; the Australian Army Aviation Corps was eventually established in July 1968. Garrett was scheduled to retire from the Army on his sixtieth birthday in February 1960 but the government extended his term. He retired on 30 June 1960 and was succeeded by Lieutenant General Reg Pollard, whom Garrett had recommended for the post {{in the face of}} opposition from the Minister <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Army,</b> John Cramer, who had attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer. Although Garrett's proposed reorganisation of the Army along pentropic lines went ahead under Pollard, it proved short-lived. The US Army abandoned the system in June 1961, and the Australian Army returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, in October 1964.|$|E
