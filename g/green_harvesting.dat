5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
25|$|Carignan is a late budding {{and late}} {{ripening}} variety {{that is often}} {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by winter pruning or <b>green</b> <b>harvesting</b> during the growing season. The late ripening nature of the grape means that it rarely achieves full ripeness unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California.|$|E

The vine also responds adversely to water stress which may require some irrigation in regions where the practice is permitted. In order to limit yields, Agiorgitiko is often densely planted in poor vineyard soils but growers need {{to be mindful of}} the variety's sensitivity to potassium deficiency.|$|E

50|$|A <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> is {{the removal}} of {{immature}} grape bunches, typically {{for the purpose of}} decreasing yield. The removal of the bunches while they are still green induces the vine to put all its energy into developing the remaining grapes.

In the absence of a <b>green</b> <b>harvest,</b> a healthy, vigorous vine can produce dilute, unripe grapes.|$|R

2500|$|While closely related, {{the terms}} trellising, pruning and vine {{training}} {{are often used}} interchangeably even though they refer to different things. Technically speaking, the trellis refers to the actual stakes, posts, wires or other structures that the grapevine is attached to. Some vines are allowed to grow free standing without any attachment to a trellising structure. Part of the confusion between trellising and vine training systems {{stems from the fact}} that vine training systems will often take on the name of the particular type of trellising involved. [...] Pruning refers to the cutting and shaping of the cordon or [...] "arms" [...] of the grapevine in winter which will determine the number of buds that are allowed to become grape clusters. In some wine regions, such as France, the exact number of buds is outlined by Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulations. During the summer growing season, pruning can involve removing young plant shoots or excess bunches of grapes with <b>green</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Vine training systems utilize the practice of trellising and pruning in order to dictate and control a grape vine's canopy which will influence not only the potential yield of that year's crop but also the quality of the grapes due to the access of air and sunlight needed for the grapes to ripen fully and for preventing various grape diseases.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sugarcane}} <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> system, {{characterized by}} mechanized harvesting {{and the absence}} of crop burning, affects soil quality by increasing crop residue on the soil surface after harvest; thus, it contributes to improving the physical, chemical, and microbiological properties and influences the soil carbon content and CO 2 flux (FCO 2). This study aimed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of soil FCO 2 in sugarcane <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> systems. The experiment was conducted in two areas of sugarcane in São Paulo, Brazil: the first had a 5 -year history of sugarcane <b>green</b> <b>harvest</b> (SG- 5) and the second had a longer history of 10 years (SG- 10). The temporal FCO 2 were evaluated in the dry and rainy periods, and spatial variability in the dry period, and related to soil chemical and physical properties, including organic C porosity, bulk density, soil penetration resistance, mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, clay, P, S, Ca, Mg and Fe. The temporal variability indicated no differences between the dry and rainy periods in SG- 10, while in SG- 5 soil moisture was increased by 33 % in the rainy period. The spatial variability indicated a different pattern from the temporal one, where FCO 2 in SG- 10 was correlated with soil temperature, air-filled pore space, total porosity, soil moisture, and the Ca and Mg contents; in the SG- 5 area, FCO 2 was correlated with soil mean weight diameter of soil aggregates and the sulfur content...|$|R
40|$|The <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting</b> {{represented}} {{a significant change}} in sugarcane ecosystem due to the presence of straw left on the soil and to the absence of fire. These two factors may affect the populations of pests and their natural enemies. Among the pests benefit from the <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting</b> stand out the spittlebug, Mahanarva fimbriolata, the curculionid Sphenophorus levis and sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis. In areas of <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting,</b> the population of these species grew faster than in areas of burnt cane. On the other hand, there are virtually no records of attacks by lesser cornstalk borers in areas of <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting.</b> Populations of plant parasitic nematodes and the beetles Migdolus fryanus, very important pests of sugarcane, were apparently not affected by the <b>green</b> cane <b>harvesting.</b> Despite the absence of more consistent information, it appears that populations of ants and the giant borer Telchin licus can increase in green cane areas, due primarily to the difficulty of pest control. The partial or total removal of straw from the field represents an additional change to the ecosystem that could alter the status of pests and nematodes. It is likely that spittlebug, the curculionid S. levis and sugarcane borer populations decrease if a portion of the straw is removed from the field. However, the pest populations in areas where the straw is collected will not return to their original conditions at the time of burnt cane harvesting because the absence of fire will be maintained...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the economic feasibility of small scale organic production of rice, common bean and maize in Goias State, Brazil. During 2004 / 05 and 2005 / 06 growing seasons, rice, common bean and maize were produced at the organic farm of Embrapa Rice and Beans in five mulching systems (fallow, Crotalaria juncea, Cajanus cajan, Mucuna aterrima and Sorghum bicolor), with and without tillage. Soil tillage consisted of heavy disc harrowing followed by light disc harrowing. All operations and used inputs were recorded. Based on those records, the production costs for each crop were estimated for each cropping season. The costs included operations like sowing, ploughing, harrowing, spraying, fertilizer broadcasting and harvesting, as well as inputs like seeds, inoculant strains of Rhizobium, neem oil and organic fertilizers. The benefits include the gross revenue obtained by multiplying the production amount with the market price for non-organic products. For the purpose of analysis of competitiveness of organic production in comparison to conventional farming the market prices assumed were those of conventional production. In the analysis, the costs of certification were not considered yet due to lack of certifiers in the region. For comparison between traits, net revenue, the benefit-cost-ratio (BCR) and the break even point were used. In 2004 / 05 growing season the BCR varied from 0. 27 for common bean on S. bicolor mulch system with tillage up to 4. 05 for <b>green</b> <b>harvested</b> maize produced after C. juncea in no tillage system.
