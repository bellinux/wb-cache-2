The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything else in his career.|$|E
5|$|Jalaja {{reveals the}} love story of Malliswari and Nagaraju to Tirumaladevi. She also reveals that Malliswari denied {{any help from}} her and instead chose to die along with Nagaraju. The next morning, the hanging nooses are kept ready and the duo meet Krishnadevaraya before killing them. When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends his action and reminds Nagaraju that {{it was he who}} <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to send Malliswari to Rani Vasam. Krishnadevaraya forgives both Nagaraju and Malliswari, and their {{marriage}} is conducted in a grand manner at the palace.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted {{by most of the}} princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also {{believed that}} he would {{be in a position to}} ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E

5|$|On 4 August Thorpe, {{along with}} Holmes {{and two of}} Holmes's associates, were charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Scott. Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, {{on the basis of}} his alleged 1968 discussions with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party's leaders who <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to stay away.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, 2014, Jones {{signed with}} the Cleveland Cavaliers. LeBron James, Jones's {{teammate}} with the Heat, <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to come join him in Cleveland. The Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference championship and advanced to the NBA Finals. Facing the Golden State Warriors, the Cavaliers lost the series in six games. Jones played in 57 games, starting 2, for the Cavaliers during the 2014–15 season while averaging 4.4 points, 1.1 rebounds and 11.7 minutes a game. He was a DNP-CD for 25 games.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had {{made it clear that he}} favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Lombard's death, Gable, who was inconsolable and {{devastated by}} his loss, joined the United States Army Air Forces. Lombard <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{to do that}} {{numerous}} times after the United States had entered World War II. After officer training, Gable headed a six-man motion picture unit attached to a B-17 bomb group in England to film aerial gunners in combat, flying five missions himself. In December 1943, the United States Maritime Commission announced that a Liberty ship named after Carole Lombard would be launched. Gable attended {{the launch of the}} SS Carole Lombard on January 15, 1944, the two-year anniversary of Lombard's record-breaking war bond drive. The ship was involved in rescuing hundreds of survivors from sunken ships in the Pacific and returning them to safety.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Test in Sydney, Johnson and Miller {{were both}} {{unavailable}} due to injury; Morris {{led the team}} for the second and final time in Tests. The Australian Board of Control made the surprising move of appointing the young and inexperienced Richie Benaud as Morris' vice-captain for the match. Benaud, selected as a batsman, had scored just 195 runs at 13.92 in ten Test matches and was not a regular member of the team. Benaud noted that the situation was embarrassing and that Morris <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> not to be offended if he sought advice from veteran players Ray Lindwall and Harvey, who had been Test regulars for seven years. Morris won the toss and elected to bat on a green pitch, in a match marred by time-wasting. Although Australia took a first innings lead, they lost the low-scoring match by 38 runs after a batting collapse {{in the face of}} a Tyson pace barrage on the final day. Aided by a powerful tailwind, Tyson bowled at extreme pace and the slips cordon stood 45m away from the wicket. Morris had a poor personal performance, scores of 12 and 10, a disappointment amidst his team's defeat. He failed to pass 25 in either of the following Tests as Australia fell 3–1 behind with a hat-trick of losses and he was dropped for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 223 runs at 31.86. Aside from the First Test century, Morris struggled throughout the entire season, passing fifty on only one other occasion and managing only 382 runs at 31.83.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the average}} {{duration}} of a Central Committee meeting decreased, and fewer meetings were held, many Central Committee members {{were unable to}} speak. Some members consulted the leadership beforehand, to ask to speak during meetings.

The majority of speakers at Central Committee plenums were high-standing officials.|$|E
