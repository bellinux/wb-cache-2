40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a surge in {{interest}} in coupling ensemble-based data assimilation methods with variational methods (commonly referred to as 4 DVar). Here we discuss a number of important differences between ensemble-based and variational methods that ought to be considered when attempting to fuse these methods. We note that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) of the posterior mean over a data assimilation window can only be delivered <b>by</b> <b>data</b> assimilation <b>schemes</b> that utilise the 4 -dimensional (4 D) forecast covariance of a prior distribution of non-linear forecasts across the data assimilation window. An ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) may be viewed as a BLUE approximating data assimilation scheme.

Since 4 DVar schemes have the required structural framework to identify posterior modes, in contrast to the EnKS, they may be viewed as mode approximating data assimilation schemes. Hence, when aspects of the EnKS and 4 DVar data assimilation schemes are blended together in a hybrid, one {{would like to be able}} to understand how such changes would affect the mode- or mean-finding abilities of the data assimilation schemes.

METHOD: This was a cross sectional study conducted in the clinical and research laboratory of Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan from October 2007 to September 2008. Non-duplicate 86 (65 AKUH and 21 non-AKUH) VRE strains were included.

40|$|Abstract. A {{potentially}} {{serious problem}} with current digital signature schemes {{is that their}} underlying hard problems from number theory may be solved by an innovative technique or {{a new generation of}} computing devices such as quantum computers. Therefore while these signature schemes represent an efficient solution to the short term integrity (unforgeability and non-repudiation) of digital data, they provide no confidence on the long term (say of 20 years) integrity of <b>data</b> signed <b>by</b> these <b>schemes.</b> In this work, we focus on signature schemes whose security does not rely on any unproven assumption. More specifically, we establish a model for unconditionally secure digital signatures in a group, and demonstrate practical schemes in that model. An added advantage of the schemes is that they allow unlimited transfer of signatures without compromising the security of the schemes. Our scheme represents the first unconditionally secure signature that admits provably secure transfer of signatures. ...|$|R

However, the existing work on spatial-temporal data gathering using compressive sensing only considers either multi-hop relaying based or multiple random walks based approaches.

The experiment consisted of turbulence measurements in an open channel flow. Specifically, five trash rack assemblies, composed of regular grids, divided a 5 Â m long flume into four sequential, identical pools. This set-up established a globally stationary flow, with each pool generating a controlled amount of turbulence that is reset at every trash rack. TPIV measurements were taken in the central pool. To eliminate the vibration from the measurements, three vibration correction regimes are proposed and compared to a global volume self-calibration (Wieneke 2008 Exp. Fluids 45 549 â 56), a now standard calibration procedure in TPIV. As the amplitude of the vibrations was small, it was possible to extract acceptable reconstruction re-projection qualities (Q IÂ >Â  75 %) and velocity fields from the standard treatment.
