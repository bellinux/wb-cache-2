5|$|By 1880 {{the estate}} {{had been broken}} up into fifteen smaller farms. The rough {{northern}} meadows adjacent to the Moselle were used for beef farming, whilst the southern fields, known as Grainger's Farm, were used as <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> The {{western edge of the}} estate was by this time occupied by the Great Eastern Railway's Palace Gates Line and Green Lanes railway station, opened in 1878.|$|E
5|$|In the Maasai Mara game reserve, {{there is}} a {{non-migratory}} population of blue wildebeest which had dwindled from about 119,000 animals in 1977 to about 22,000 in 1997. The reason for the decline {{is thought to be}} the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> as a result of changes in agricultural practices, and possibly fluctuations in rainfall.|$|E
30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in total percent of root length colonization between the two exclosure types (Table  4). However, exclosures had significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) higher total AMF root colonization than terraces. Besides, exclosures and terraces had significantly (P[*]<[*] 0.05) higher total AMF colonization than non-conserved communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> (Table  4). Total root colonization by AMF was in the order of exclosures[*]+[*]terraces[*]>[*]exclosures alone[*]>[*]terraces[*]>[*]non-conserved <b>grazing</b> <b>lands.</b> The presence of high organic carbon and lower disturbance in exclosures (Table  1) could resulted in high AMF root colonization compared to terraces and non-conserved <b>grazing</b> <b>lands.</b>|$|R
40|$|Communal <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> are {{important}} sources of livestock feed {{in developing countries}} (ILRI, 1998). In the presence of sufficient demand for livestock or livestock products, unrestricted access to the <b>grazing</b> <b>lands</b> will result in overexploitation of the resource and the scarcity rent of the resource remains unappropriated. Each individual user of the resource enjoys the full benefit of her use of the resource but bears only a fractional part of the cost. As a result, the traditional uncontrolled and free grazing system {{in many developing countries}} has caused severe degradation of the <b>grazing</b> <b>lands...</b>|$|R

5|$|Free-roaming horses could once {{be found}} {{throughout}} much of the American frontier west of the Mississippi River, and may have numbered as many as two million around 1850. However, no comprehensive estimate of free-roaming horse numbers was done until 1971, and thus early estimates are speculative. Horse numbers were in decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources. Ranchers shot horses to leave more <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> for other livestock, other horses were captured off the range for human use, and some were rounded up for slaughter.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden, {{and they}} were {{responsible}} for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil. The slaughter of a fattened ox was also {{a central part of}} an offering ritual. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period. Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period. There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of <b>grazing</b> <b>land.</b> Dogs, cats, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as Sub-Saharan African lions, were reserved for royalty. Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses. During the Predynastic and Late periods, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were bred in large numbers on farms for the purpose of ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Namib Desert Horse is unclear, though several {{theories}} have been put forward. Genetic tests have been performed, although none to date have completely verified their origin. The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses, many from German breeding programs, released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century, especially during World War I. Whatever their origin, the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains, near Aus, Namibia, {{the location of a}} man-made water source. They were generally ignored by humans, except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat, until the 1980s. In 1984, the first aerial survey of the population was made, and in 1986, their traditional <b>grazing</b> <b>land</b> was incorporated into the Namib-Naukluft Park. At several points, some horses have been removed from the herd, including the removal and sale of over one-third of the population in 1992. Since the early 1990s, close records of the population have been kept, and studies have been performed to determine the horses' effect on their environment. Despite being considered an exotic species within the park, they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country's history and draw as a tourist attraction.|$|E
