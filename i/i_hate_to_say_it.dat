My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance.

500|$|Urlacher dislocated {{his wrist}} in the 2009 season opener against the Packers. He {{underwent}} surgery, {{and went on}} to miss the remainder of the season. [...] Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve. Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury. The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense. As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the guy is a winner, and that formula worked for us. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E

40|$|Is delayed {{bleeding}} after a colonoscopic polypectomy inevitable? Frankly speaking, I {{would answer}} ‘Yes’. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this, but <b>I</b> {{have to admit}} that delayed bleeding after a polypectomy is the stern reality that has been encountered by the endoscopists ever since they first started to perform endoscopic polypectomies.
