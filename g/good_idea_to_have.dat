500|$|In 1967 {{during a}} meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes {{launched}} a project consisting {{of a series of}} biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called Los Padres de la Patria (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in Patriotic Gore, Fuentes recounts, [...] "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, {{we thought it would be}} a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators." [...] Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odría, Jorge Edwards about José Manuel Balmaceda, José Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cortázar about Eva Perón. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E
500|$|Jenna's storyline in {{the episode}} {{received}} mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical, while Sepinwall reported {{it did not}} work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with Scott Adsit's 30 Rock character, Pete Hornberger, as in this episode, [...] "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character. As with Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but [...] "it just went on too long and got tedious and silly." [...] He believed {{it would be a}} <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined [...] "The Ones" [...] did not choose that path. Tom O'Neil from the Los Angeles Times, in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on 30 Rock, but felt that [...] "The Ones" [...] would not be the episode for which she'd win the Outstanding Supporting Actress award.|$|E
500|$|Considered {{rare for}} Disney animals, Pascal and Maximus do not speak. The idea to make Pascal and Maximus mute was {{inspired}} by the performances of actors Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton in Silent films. Identifying themselves as [...] "huge fans" [...] of Chaplin, Greno and Howard suggested {{that it would be a}} <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a character like the actor featured in the film. Additionally, the directors explained in an interview with Orange that Pascal and Maximus' silence was also inspired by the roles of Princess Aurora's animal friends in Disney's Sleeping Beauty (1959), following the film's rules and guidelines that even though they do not talk, they remain [...] "very expressive" [...] nonetheless and [...] "act and understand without words." [...] Maximus particularly [...] "belongs to the grand tradition of Disney creatures that are full of personality even though they don't talk." [...] One film critic observed that Pascal and Maximus [...] "have personalities all their own, making use of techniques harkening back to the silent era". Howard explained that [...] "Pantomime acting is a great challenge for our animators" [...] because, according to animator Jin Kim, Pascal and Maximus both [...] "had to be funny without speech", forcing the animators to exaggerate their emotions and facial expressions. The Chicago Sun-Times observed that [...] "Pascal ... doesn't speak, but manages to convey himself with eye rolls and changes of color." [...] Both animals' sound effects are provided by American actor Frank Welker.|$|E

5000|$|Bishop Valentine {{was only}} 55 in 1982 when he retired.

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's not a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a lot of people around}} because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E
2500|$|Marr and {{his wife}} Angie have been {{together}} since 1979, before the Smiths formed. They have two children, Sonny and Nile Marr; Nile is also a musician, {{best known as the}} frontman of the band Man Made. Having resided in Portland, Oregon, for more than five years, the family returned to Britain for Marr to record his solo album in Manchester. Marr initially gave up meat around 1985 in solidarity with Morrissey and Angie. He stated: [...] "It's not a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a number one album called Meat Is Murder and be seen eating a bacon sarnie." [...] After hanging out with American rap group Naughty By Nature, he was inspired by their philosophy of strength through health, and soon after quit drinking, smoking and converted to veganism. Marr is a keen runner, and completed the 2010 New York Marathon in a time of 3:54:18. He is a supporter of Manchester City football club and has been seen attending games.|$|E

5000|$|Greenwood's first South Carolina Festival of Flowers {{was held}} in the summer of 1968 to {{coincide}} with the 100th anniversary celebration of George W. Park Seed Company. The festival was the brainchild of what was known then as the Tourist and Conventions Committee of the Greenwood Chamber of Commerce. Chamber Director Al Parker and committee members recognized that Park Seed Company hosted [...] "grower days" [...] each year and that hundreds of professional flower growers would come to Greenwood to meander through Park Seed's famous trial gardens. The committee {{thought it would be a}} <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> capitalize on <b>having</b> those visitors see other venues in Greenwood.|$|R
500|$|The {{release of}} the films saw a surge of {{interest}} in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture. It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with Christopher Tolkien and his son Simon Tolkien feuding {{over whether or not}} it was a <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> <b>to</b> adapt. Christopher <b>has</b> since denied these claims, saying, [...] "My own position is that The Lord of the Rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, even to the extent of thinking ill of those with whom I may differ, are wholly without foundation." [...] He added that he had never [...] "expressed any such feeling". In 2012, however, he described the films as having [...] "eviscerated" [...] the book, and criticized the resulting [...] "commercialisation" [...] of his father's work.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for the album has been generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 77, based on 40 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". AllMusic critic and senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated: [...] "Hesitation Marks makes {{it quite clear}} that Trent Reznor {{is no longer an}} angry young man but rather a restless, inventive artist who is at peace with himself, and the result is a record that provides real, lasting nourishment." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press described the album as [...] "both business as usual and remarkably prescient." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian wrote: [...] "Hesitation Marks is a very different beast to an intense industrial classic such as 1994's The Downward Spiral, but the darkness remains in lyrics that address self-doubt and the struggle for identity with honesty and candour." [...] Writing for Kerrang!, George Garner inferred that [...] "Hesitation Marks would provide Nine Inch Nails with a future every bit as promising as their illustrious past." [...] NME critic Louis Pattison stated: [...] "This is the sound of a cleaner, smoother Nine Inch Nails, one that delights in complexities of rhythm more than caustic blasts of rage." [...] Stuart Berman of Pitchfork wrote that the album is [...] "much more in tune with the spartan grooves of the xx and the elastic electro of the Knife than his Reznor's usual arena-rattling influences." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the album as [...] "one of Reznor's best", stating that [...] "it combines the textural exploration on the 1999 double CD The Fragile, and the tighter fury of his 1994 master blast, The Downward Spiral." [...] Christopher R. Weingarten of Spin regarded the album as [...] "the most important artistic statement from NIN leader Trent Reznor since the late '90s." [...] Nevertheless, Philip Cosores was mixed in his assessment of the album and thought: [...] "For the album itself, the <b>good</b> <b>ideas</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been wasted on trying to revive something that killed itself years ago." ...|$|R
