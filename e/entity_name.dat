2500|$|DLM was disbanded when Prem Rawat renounced {{the trappings}} of Indian culture and religion, making his teachings {{independent}} of culture, beliefs and lifestyles."In the early 1980s, Maharaj Ji moved to disband the Divine Light Mission and he personally renounced {{the trappings of}} Indian culture and religion, disbanding the mission, he founded Elan Vital, an organization to support his future role as teacher." [...] Maharaji had made every attempt to abandon the traditional Indian religious trappings in which the techniques originated and to make his presentation acceptable to all the various cultural settings in which followers live. He sees his teachings as independent of culture, religion, beliefs, or lifestyles, and regularly addresses audiences in places as culturally diverse as India, Japan, Taiwan, the Ivory Coast, Slovenia, Mauritius and Venezuela, as well as North America, Europe and the South Pacific. The DLM in the United States {{changed its name to}} Elan Vital in 1983, by filing an <b>entity</b> <b>name</b> change. Elan Vital became the name shared by several organizations supporting the work of Rawat. Independent Elan Vital organizations in several countries engaged in raising funds, organising speaking engagements by Rawat and in some cases broadcast his public addresses. Elan Vital no longer connected to its originally Hindu or Sikh religious background. Elan Vital, Inc. in the U.S. is registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It has been labelled a [...] "church" [...] in reference to its tax status. Its 2005 articles of incorporation described its purpose as performing [...] "religious, charitable and educational activities". The Elan Vital website states that Elan Vital ceased operations in 2010, and has been succeeded by new entities such as Words of Peace International, Inc.|$|E

In this paper we present an unsupervised vocabulary adaptation method for morph-based speech recognition. Foreign word candidates are detected automatically from in-domain text {{through the use of}} letter n-gram perplexity. Over-segmented foreign <b>entity</b> <b>names</b> are restored to their base forms in the morph-segmented in-domain text for easier and more reliable modeling and recognition. The adapted pronunciation rules are finally generated with a trainable grapheme-tophoneme converter. In ASR performance the unsupervised method almost matches the ability of supervised adaptation in correctly recognizing foreign <b>entity</b> <b>names.</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|In natural {{language}} processing, <b>entity</b> linking, <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> linking (NEL), <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> disambiguation (NED), <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> recognition and disambiguation (NERD) or <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> normalization (NEN) {{is the task}} of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text. For example, given the sentence [...] "Paris is the capital of France", {{the idea is to}} determine that [...] "Paris" [...] refers to the city of Paris and not to Paris Hilton or any other entity that could be referred as [...] "Paris". NED is different from <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> recognition (NER) in that NER identifies the occurrence or mention of a <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> in text but it does not identify which specific entity it is.|$|R
