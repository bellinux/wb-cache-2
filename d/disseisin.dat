5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where they were used to establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where they were used to determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel <b>disseisin,</b> mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

The justices could find no precedent for such a thing in English law, nor in the Magna Carta, nor in Roman Law (in iure scripto), therefore, they adjoined (delayed) their decision. In Bracton's time, it had been determined that the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was deemed to be a subject of the King of England while in England: Ricardus Rex Alemanniae (Rex Romanorum semper augustus) was impleaded for novel <b>disseisin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cokayne's {{involvement}} with Cromwell then drew {{him into the}} affairs of Lincolnshire. Walter Tailboys, a neighbour and client of Cromwell, together {{with some of his}} relatives and friends, had initiated an assize of novel <b>disseisin.</b> Eight plaintiffs and four defendants were named, although others were involved, and a number of tenements were at stake on or close to the Lincolnshire coast, at Theddlethorpe, Mablethorpe, Saltfleetby, Strubby, Carlton, Gayton and Withern, suggesting a contest between groups of property speculators. The plaintiffs had triumphed at the initial hearing and the defendants had decided to come to terms. They promised to accept the judgement and make a quitclaim, but wanted to limit their losses. Both sides seem to have recruited guarantors among serving MPs: the 1431 parliament, which was Cokayne's tenth, was assembling as the legal process continued. The defendants obtained recognizances to guarantee their quitclaim from John Culpepper, just elected MP for Rutland, and from Thomas Strange, a Midlands landowner. Cokayne agreed to enter into a recognizance of £1000 in Derbyshire to guarantee that Tailboys would press the issue no further after the judgement had been affirmed. This was matched by Sir Richard Stanhope, then serving as MP for Nottinghamshire, whose wife Maud was Lord Cromwell's daughter. It was later alleged that about this time Cromwell had illegally tried to recruit Cokayne, Vernon and others into his affinity by offering them his livery.|$|E
500|$|The tort of {{nuisance}} {{has existed}} since {{the reign of}} Henry III, with few changes, {{and most of them}} merely technical. It originally came from the Latin nocumentum, and then the French nuisance, with Henry de Bracton initially defining the tort of nuisance as an infringement of easements. The tort was in line with the economic status quo of the time, protecting claimants against their neighbours' rights to develop land, and thus has been described as [...] "rural, agricultural, and conservative". There were initially four remedies for nuisance; the assize of nuisance, similar to the assize of novel <b>disseisin,</b> which was limited to situations where the defendant's actions interfered with the claimant's seisin; the action guod permittat prosternere, where the land in question was alienated; the writ of trespass; and the [...] "action upon the case for nuisance", which became the main remedy. This was because it was far faster than the other writs and actions, and unlike them did not require that both parties be freeholders. It was, however, limited to damages, and unlike the other remedies did not allow for abatement.|$|E
500|$|The {{administration}} of justice was of particular importance to John. Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including novel <b>disseisin</b> and mort d'ancestor. These processes meant the royal courts had a more significant role in local law cases, which had previously been dealt with only by regional or local lords. John increased the professionalism of local sergeants and bailiffs, and extended the system of coroners first introduced by Hubert Walter in 1194, creating {{a new class of}} borough coroners. John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, by fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself. John continued to try relatively minor cases, even during military crises. Viewed positively, Lewis Warren considers that John discharged [...] "his royal duty of providing justice... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted". Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population. Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could bypass the barons, against whom such cases were often brought. John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice.|$|E
2500|$|After the Norman Conquest, fines {{were paid}} only to courts or the king, and {{quickly became a}} revenue source. A wrong became known as a tort or trespass, and there arose a {{division}} between civil pleas and pleas of the crown. The petty assizes (i.e. of novel <b>disseisin,</b> of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment) were established in 1166 as a remedy for interference with possession of freehold land. The trespass action was an early civil plea in which damages were paid to the victim; if no payment was made, the defendant was imprisoned. The plea arose in local courts for slander, breach of contract, or interference with land, goods, or persons. Although the details of its exact origin are unclear, it became popular in royal courts {{so that in the}} 1250s the writ of trespass was created and made de cursu (available by right, not fee); however, it was restricted to interference with land and forcible breaches of the king's peace. It may have arisen either out of the [...] "appeal of felony", or assize of novel <b>disseisin,</b> or replevin. Later, after the Statute of Westminster 1285, in the 1360s, the [...] "trespass on the case" [...] action arose for when the defendant did not direct force. As its scope increased, it became simply [...] "action on the case". The English Judicature Act passed 1873 through 1875 abolished the separate actions of trespass and trespass on the case.|$|E
2500|$|Burley {{was closely}} {{involved}} in a particularly protracted and complex feud at Shrewsbury, involving the politicians Nicholas Gerard and Urian St Pierre. This began in 1407 with St Pierre buying from feoffees property, mainly valuable urban plots in Abbey Foregate and elsewhere, that Gerard was hoping to inherit from his grandfather. It led to three assizes of novel <b>disseisin</b> and a violent attack by Gerard on his opponent on Castle Street. Finally they compromised, with St Pierre handing over the property, but Gerard compensating him by resigning in his favour the constableship of Shrewsbury Castle – a post he finally acquired on 15 February 1413. The legal costs to the borough, including fees to Burley, the serjeant-at-law and the attorney, came to [...] £2 10s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1232 John Devereux was {{identified}} in the royal book of fines as paying the 20 pounds required by law. [...] The refusal of the Justiciars of Ireland to implement certain royal orders, though, caused John to still be seeking seisin of his lands in the Decies in 1233. On 27 April 1233 the king commanded that he be granted full seisin of his lands. A portion of his lands had been retained by Richard de Burgh when Justiciar. It was this <b>disseisin</b> which the King referred to {{in his letter to}} [...] Maurice fitzGelrald, Justiciar of Ireland, on 8 August 1233 instructing him to give seisin of the lands that the King had disseised John, and which he had subsequently granted to him by charter. Specifically, the lands included Galles, Bellibrannyn, Arda, Lisnaan, Gurbetha, and Culma.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was early}} {{provided}} that, {{in seeking to}} remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege <b>disseisin</b> (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a writ of entry. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right {{under the protection of}} the Crown if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, Parliament provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a [...] "writ for right" [...] package known as a form of action. However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if {{there was not a single}} form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King.|$|E

50|$|Baker married Joan by 1395. He was {{apparently}} ‘of Whitford’, six miles from Lyme Regis. He had several run-ins with the law, in 1408 for 'illegal <b>disseisin</b> of land at Colyford, Devon' and in July 1405, for 'fornication with Alice Benet'. He confessed and was fined, but in 1408, was being investigated for this same offence.|$|E

5000|$|Henry {{therefore}} promulgated various assizes (i.e. {{courts that}} convened {{in a town}} periodically, rather than being permanently established). The primary and most general one, the Assize of Clarendon was issued in 1166. Others, the [...] "petty" [...] assizes known respectively as the assize of novel <b>disseisin,</b> of mort d'ancestor, and of darrein presentment gave more specific relief. The most popular one became the assize of novel <b>disseisin,</b> which in Law French meant something close to the [...] "assize of recent dispossession". Those who had been recently put out of their lands could recover the beneficial use of them by resort to this assize, {{which led to a}} then innovative method of trial. Twelve [...] "of the more lawful men" [...] of the locality were summoned by the king's sheriff to determine, upon their own knowledge, who was entitled to the property. This innovative method of proceeding, the origin of the civil petit jury at common law, was aimed at the chaos introduced into property rights by crusade and civil war.|$|E
50|$|In English law, the Assize {{of novel}} <b>disseisin</b> ("recent dispossession") was an action to recover lands {{of which the}} {{plaintiff}} had been disseised, or dispossessed. The action became extremely popular due to its expediency. Rather than dealing {{with the issue of}} lawful possession, it simply asked whether a dispossession had taken place, in which case the property was restored to the plaintiff, and the question of true ownership was dealt with later.|$|E
50|$|Robert was a King's {{clerk and}} royal {{justice in the}} reign of Henry II. Some of the cases {{in which he was}} {{involved}} are known. For example, on 11 February 1189 Robert was one of the justiciars who helped settle a suit precipitated by an assize of novel <b>disseisin</b> concerning Lilleshall Abbey over disputed land at Hencott, north of Shrewsbury. A year or two later, he was a justiciar in a long-running case involving land at Longford.|$|E
50|$|Following William Devereux’s {{marriage}} to Maud de Giffard about 1258, Lady Sibyl de Giffard transferred the wardship of Robert de Beysin to him. In October 1258 John Chete sued William Devereux and others about damaging his fish-pond and stealing his fish in Brosely, county Salop. A {{few months later}} Ralph de Coven and Roger de Eyton sued William (and his wife Maud), and the Bishop of Hereford over the advowson of the Church of Broseley. On 10 July 1260 Robert de Beysin’s had a suit of novel <b>disseisin</b> against William Devereux and his wife, Matilda, concerning the manor of Billingsly. Robert de Beysin {{took advantage of the}} political upheavel occurring in England during this time to use armed men to seize and hold the manor of Billingsly, which remained in the custody of William Devereux, and on 20 March 1261 the king commanded the sheriff of Shropshire to remove Robert and restore the manor to Devereux. Beysin came of age in 1263, and on 22 September an Inquiry Post-mortem was made into his father, Adam de Beysin’s estates which identified his wardship with William Devereux. In 1284 Maud de Giffard, now a widow, pursued a suit of novel <b>disseisin</b> against Robert’s heir, Walter de Beysin, concerning a tenement in Billingsly.|$|E
