50|$|A replica glass kiln {{was made}} in 2001 as an {{experiment}} in 17th century glass production methods, it has since be removed. The kiln was built to 17th century designs, with a double fire box and <b>double</b> <b>drawing</b> points. The structure is built of two walls of modern building bricks, the inner layer {{on top of a}} layer of firebricks. The gap between the layers is filled with vermiculite and the outside is coated with a layer of lime-based daub and painted. Temperatures achieved from wood firing only are around 1300 degrees Celsius. Lead glass cullet from the nearby Dartington Crystal is generally used for experimenting when the kiln is fired.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house has}} {{significance}} to the UK Rastafari movement because it was bought in 1936 by Haile Selassie I {{after the death of}} the previous owner Mrs Campbell-White, following a short stay at the Bath Spa Hotel, while the house was renovated. He lived in the house with his family and staff for five years. The renovation provided a large <b>double</b> <b>drawing</b> room with two fireplaces, and a dining room with pantry. The rooms for Haile Selassie to meet contacts and supporters included a 'telephone room' or small office and the morning room. There were five 'principal' bedrooms with rooms in the attic for servants. There are numerous accounts of [...] "Haile Selassie I was my next door neighbour" [...] amongst people who were children in the Bath area during his residence.|$|E
50|$|On June 28, 2007, Biggio {{became the}} 27th {{player in the}} history of Major League Baseball to join the 3,000 hit club, with a single against Colorado Rockies pitcher Aaron Cook. Though Biggio was tagged out on the play {{attempting}} to stretch it into a <b>double,</b> <b>drawing</b> the throw allowed a run to score. The game action paused while Biggio shared the moment with his wife and children. Longtime friend and former teammate Jeff Bagwell emerged from the Astros clubhouse to congratulate him. Biggio became the first player in Astros history to accumulate 3,000 hits. It was Biggio's third hit of the game, and he went on to accumulate two more later in the game, one in the ninth inning and one in the eleventh inning. Interestingly enough, Biggio's 3,000 hit came {{on the same day that}} Frank Thomas hit his milestone 500th career home run, both marks which are considered to guarantee one's induction into the Hall of Fame.|$|E

40|$|Positioned {{within a}} hybrid of the human and technology, {{professional}} nursing practice has always occupied a space {{that is more than}} human. In nursing education, technology is central in providing tools with which practice knowledge is mobilized so that students can safely engage with simulated human patients without causing harm to real people. However, while there is an increased emphasis on deploying these simulated humans as emissaries from person-centred care to demonstrate {{what it is like to}} care for real humans, the nature of what is really going on in simulation—what is real and what is simulated—is very rarely discussed and poorly understood. This paper explores how elements of postcolonial critical thought can aid in understanding the challenges of educating nurses to provide person-centred care within a healthcare culture that is increasingly reliant on technology. Because nursing education is itself {{a hybrid of}} real and simulated practice, it provides an appropriate case study to explore the philosophical question of technology in healthcare discourse, particularly as it relates to the relationship between the human patient and its uncanny simulated <b>double.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on postcolonial elements such as the uncanny, diaspora, hybridity, andcréolité, the hybrid conditions of nursing education are examined in order to open up new possibilities of thinking about how learning to care is entangled with this technological space to assist in shaping professional knowledge of person-centred care. Considering these issues through a postcolonial lens opens up questions about the nature of the difficulty in using simulated human technologies in clinical education, particularly with the paradoxical aim of providing person-centred care within a climate that increasingly characterized as posthuman...|$|E
