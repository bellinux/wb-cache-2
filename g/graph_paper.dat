5|$|In {{the story}} group, monsters {{were the first}} thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full {{drawings}} rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in <b>graph</b> <b>paper,</b> staff wrote both two in 5mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organization; their manuscript thickness is 15cm.|$|E

25|$|Consider a {{periodic}} tiling by unit squares (it looks like infinite <b>graph</b> <b>paper).</b> Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E

50|$|Early mesonets {{operated}} {{differently from}} modern mesonets. Each constituent {{instrument of the}} weather station was purely mechanical and fairly independent of the other sensors. Data were recorded continuously by an inked stylus that pivoted about a point onto a rotating drum covered by a sheath of <b>graphed</b> <b>paper</b> called a trace chart, much like a traditional seismograph station. Data analysis could occur only after the trace charts from the various instruments were collected.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{method of}} creating {{an image of a}} waveform was through a laborious and painstaking process of measuring the voltage or current of a spinning rotor at specific points around the axis of the rotor, and noting the measurements taken with a galvanometer. By slowly advancing around the rotor, a general standing wave can be drawn on <b>graphing</b> <b>paper</b> by recording the degrees of rotation and the meter strength at each position.|$|R
25|$|Intuitively, then, the {{stereographic}} projection {{is a way}} of picturing the sphere as the plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the {{stereographic projection}}; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of <b>graph</b> <b>paper</b> called a stereographic net, shortened to stereonet, or Wulff net.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} interesting {{patterns in}} the Game of Life were discovered {{without the use of}} computers. The simplest static patterns ("still lifes") and repeating patterns ("oscillators"—a superset of still lifes) were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using <b>graph</b> <b>paper,</b> blackboards, physical game boards (such as Go) and the like. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-pentomino failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has fired six escaping gliders (these were the first gliders ever discovered).|$|E

His closest friend was Joel Spingarn– a white man– but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first name basis. Du Bois was something of a dandy– he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.|$|E
500|$|Fish created pixel art in Photoshop {{for each}} tiled side ("trile") of the 3D trixel that Bédard's custom {{software}} compiled into 3D game assets, which Fish would extrude as surfaces in Fezzer to build levels. Fish found the level design process [...] "overwhelming", and Bédard {{has said he}} was relieved {{that it was not}} his job. Fish compared his design process to playing with Lego blocks, and planned the more involved levels in <b>graph</b> <b>paper</b> to first visualize the 2D views before building the levels in the 3D software. The levels and puzzles were not preordained in a design document, and many of the drafts levels scrapped in 2008 resurfaced to be used later in the production process. So as to fit the rotation mechanic, the levels were made tall instead of wide, and {{the first part of the}} game was designed to acclimate the player to 2D controls before introducing the 3D element. As they worked, Fish first proposed ideas that Bédard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition—they worked well together.|$|E

500|$|As with Zippo Games' {{previous}} projects, {{the concept}} art was drawn on paper. The graphics were then drawn with Deluxe Paint and then translated into the ROM manually, sprite-by-sprite, as the NES hardware required precision in sprite placements; {{this was different}} from what Rare did, which was to place each pixel of the graphics sprites on <b>graph</b> <b>paper</b> with marker pens and then tasked people to type the code into the ROM. Ste Pickford said that while Rare's sprite-drawing method was easier, his method, while time-consuming, was more efficient. Most everything from the previous Wizards & Warriors games were removed, except for the main protagonist, Kuros, and the game's main antagonist, Malkil.
