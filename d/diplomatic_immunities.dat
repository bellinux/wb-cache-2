40|$|General {{customary}} {{international law}} contains rules, norms, and principles that seem applicable to any state and not to a particular state or an exclusive grouping of states. For example, norms relating to the high seas, to airspace and outer space, to <b>diplomatic</b> <b>immunities,</b> {{to the rules of}} warfare, and so forth, apply equally to all states having occasion to be concerned with these areas. Similarly, the facts of a given case may suggest exclusively the application of general custom—such as cases concerning collision on the high seas between ships of different countries, cases involving general principles of international law, cases turning on the construction of treaties under general customary canons of construction, and in general cases where the plaintiff and defendant states could theoretically be interchanged with any other states without affecting the content of the rules of law cited by either side in the dispute. By contrast, special {{customary international law}} deals with non-generalizable topics such as title to or rights in specific portions of world real estate (e. g., cases of acquisitive prescription, boundary disputes, and so-called international servitudes), or with rules expressly limited to countries of a certain region (such as the law of asylum in Latin America). The line separating general from special custom is similar to that in English common law, where a particular custom 2 ̆ 2 must apply to a definitely limited though indeterminate class of persons 2 ̆ 2 and to a limited geographic area; if the usage is laid in too wide a geographic area, for example, it is taken out of the realm of custom and must be pleaded as an ordinary claim at law...|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} interplay between labour law and {{international}} law {{in the context of}} the diplomatic employment relationship. The overriding effect of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 as supreme law to protect the labour rights of employees is weighed against the effect of various binding international legal instruments aimed at protecting diplomats' right to immunity. In view of the competing rights of employees and diplomatic employers, the question in this regard is to what extent employees in a diplomatic employment relationship can rely on their right to "fair labour practices" in the broad sense and the overall protection afforded to employees whose rights are infringed. In view of the perception that diplomatic employers can hide behind a veil of diplomatic immunity and in the absence of judgments by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and the Labour Court, answers and guidelines were sought from various international courts and legal instruments. However, it is pointed out that the application of labour law and international law to protect the interests of individuals against a state is an exceptionally sensitive and controversial issue. It is suggested that the international relationship between two states be used as a holistic framework, but it is cautioned that international law limits the diplomat employer's liability both in terms of the Bill of Rights and South African labour laws. The author shows that protection is afforded to diplomats/consular agents by international law. Moreover, the <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Immunities</b> and Privileges Act (DIPA) of 2001 is discussed. It is submitted that employees are not prevented from taking legal action against a diplomat/consular employer in South Africa in terms of the Labour Relations Act (LRA) or the DIPA. The author suggests that diplomatic employees and employers should be made aware of their rights and obligations in this regard. In essence what really matters to any labour lawyer is how it can be justified that a group of vulnerable employees (diplomatic employees) is left without a remedy while the employer as the stronger bargaining party is protected in terms of international law. The author submits that employees should have access to compulsory private arbitration in terms of an amendment to the DIPA or in terms of a treaty. This must bind a diplomat/consular employer from South Africa (as the sending state) in a foreign state, and a foreign diplomat/consular employer in South Africa (as the receiving state) to protect employees. It is suggested that such a provision should be included in diplomatic contracts of employment after ratification of a treaty, even before it is enacted into relevant laws in South Africa. In view of the sensitivity and international consequences of labour disputes for states, it is suggested that private arbitration could serve as a useful dispute resolution procedure and an acceptable alternative to the general options available in terms of the CCMA, the labour court and the high court. It is suggested that the full protection of diplomatic employees' labour rights cannot be based on the status of their employers. Finally the author argues that lifting the veil of diplomatic immunity could provide a satisfactory interplay between labour law and international law to support the interests and rights of both parties to the diplomatic employment relationship. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} Thesis is to uncover, characterize, analyze, {{describe}} and define selected contemporary rules of etiquette, international business and diplomatic protocol in international business and diplomatic practice and point out the greatest deficiencies witnessed in practice. The research subject of this Thesis is, thus, the formal aspect of international business and diplomatic cooperation. Its output consists of recommendation on how to correctly apply these rules in practice. I would also like my paper to significantly contribute to the general knowledge of this fascinating and commonly useful knowledge. The structure of the Thesis as it was drawn up in context of its goals consists of three main chapters, introduction and conclusion. The {{first part of the}} Thesis deals with Social Etiquette. This part is not conceived as general rules of social intercourse. Instead, it concentrates mainly on the elaboration of contemporary general rules of social intercourse and etiquette to in the context of business and entrepreneurial activities, i. e. Business Protocol. The Thesis would also like to provide answers to the following questions: What is the current standard of social intercourse in the Czech Republic? What are the contemporary rules of social intercourse in the Czech Republic and how do they differ from the etiquette abroad? Can we claim that these rules are being observed? What leads our managers, businessman, diplomats etc. to observing these rules? In my Thesis I strive to evaluate contemporary rules applicable to social, business and diplomatic events as well as in written communication and to draw attention the lack of their knowledge. Another partial goal of the Thesis consists of using carried out analyses, evaluations, inquiries via questionnaires and comparative analyses to point out the differences in the rules of social intercourse, conduct and negotiation in different territories. The working hypothesis of this part of the paper is to indicate {{on the basis of the}} above mentioned allegations the relationship between the behaviour and conduct of managers of different provenience and the fact that they have different cultural background. Culture is learned not inherited. It is derived from the social environment not from genes and it must be clearly distinguished from human character and the character of individual people. Significant attention is, therefore, paid to the study of international customs and conventions, especially those of the countries which the representatives of Czech firms, enterprises and institutions most come into contact with. The presented Thesis does not have the ambition to come up with a definitive cookbook as to how to conduct oneself in a given situation within a given territory; it merely strives to point out the pitfalls, misunderstandings and blunders in conduct and barriers in communication and in business or any other professional negotiations. Unlike legal acts the rules of Etiquette are not binding. Laws apply to all and the state prosecutes their infringement. Unlike laws, the rules of Etiquette are not enforceable. Their only form of enforcement is the social pressure which the society effectuates on the individual. Thus, the standards of social conduct only apply to those willing to abide by them. The presented paper is an aggregate of the rules and its author's views. Another author's standpoint may differ. The second part of the Thesis concentrates on the sphere of Diplomatic Protocol in international business and diplomatic practice. The presented paper aims at describing the existing system of Foreign Service and diplomatic activities, presenting the diplomatic representations, consulates, missions and other representatives abroad, their functioning as well as their immunities and privileges. Diplomatic Protocol concerns the formal, not the material, content of international relations. Formal rules of social conduct in intercourse with diplomatic representatives of other countries, the etiquette and the ceremonies applied to the intercourse with these representatives form an integral part of the Diplomatic Protocol. In the initial part I define the very term Diplomatic Protocol and I strive to specify is subject. Successively I address individual respective parts of Diplomatic Protocol and diplomatic practice, such as the methods of establishing diplomatic relationships, the roles of diplomatic missions, ranks of diplomatic representatives and their immunities and privileges, the procedure related to the conferment of agrément and the termination of activity of the head of a diplomatic mission, official visits of foreign guests, organisation of international conferences, diplomatic correspondence, consular activities etc. In the course of its elaboration the presented Thesis should also offer answers to the following questions: What is the current international form, role and significance of the Diplomatic Protocol? What leads states to observing signed conventions? Which <b>diplomatic</b> <b>immunities</b> and privileges are at the moment among the most abused or violated? For the accomplishment of the goals set out in this Thesis I shall strive to outline the scale of theoretic approaches and based on the effective layout and international practice express my own conclusions. Among others, the paper also aims at promoting the development of skills of the current diplomat and acquainting them with the norms of diplomatic correspondence. The aforementioned part of the Thesis also sets out another rather easily attained objective: due to the inexistence of comprehensive publications on this topic to become a handbook and reference manual not only for the young adepts of this profession but for all who for some reason take interest in Diplomacy. It was an ambition of the author to assemble and explain terms, which those interested in the practical aspects of Foreign Service, may be confronted with. The paper reflects current diplomatic practice and takes into account Czech circumstances. The author is endeavouring to mediate the information and knowledge she gained through years of practice at representative offices abroad gained during her practical experience at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and through more than 20 years of practice in academic research and instruction of this area...|$|E
