25|$|According to a 2009 {{article by}} US {{political}} scientist Jessica Barnes, while water scarcity in Syria is usually {{presented as a}} result of population growth, it actually is a consequence of the ruling Ba'ath party’s promotion of water-intensive agriculture. This support for the agricultural sector is motivated in part by a desire for <b>food</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> and growth through an expansion in irrigated agriculture. It is also linked to the rural roots of the Ba'ath party and the influential Peasants Union. Although much of the ruling class in Syria is now urban, the symbolic links between the party and the rural sector continue. This political context may explain why the government is reluctant to take drastic steps to reduce the pumping of groundwater from private wells for irrigation in the Ghouta near Damascus.|$|E

The oilseed crops have been validated as alternative crops on several target locations of different agro-ecological zones [PARC (1990) ]; but the success of this validation work in terms of their dissemination is very limited. The possibility of including these crops in well established systems needed to be well conceived. The selection of farming systems, which have the potential to adopt such crops, is a prerequisite to investigate the problems and prospects of oilseed crops. The emphasis of the study is, therefore, on the identification of typical farm situations where the oilseed crops can be evaluated for their potential inclusion in the cropping plans. A real decision-making environment in agriculture involves several objectives along with their explicit targets. ...|$|R

A survey of the different greenhouse space concepts and terrestrial test facilities is presented, drawing a list of meas-urable factors (e. g. growth area, power consumption, human activity index, etc.) for the eval-uation of greenhouse modules. These factors include tangible and intangible parameters that have been used in the development of an evaluation method on greenhouse concepts as a subsystem of planetary habitats...|$|R

However, under {{the condition of the}} economic globalization, there are different arguments on whether China’s food security should be based on basic domestic self-sufficiency or it should be substituted by import. This paper will state that adherence to the food security strategy of “satisfying basic domestic self-sufficiency ” is a necessary choice, by taking the serious situation of the global food crisis that has happened in the past two to three years as a background and from the three perspectives of the importance and specialty of food goods, the serious situation of international food supply and China’s special national situation. Meanwhile, it will put forward the basic thoughts and policies on ensuring the <b>food’s</b> basic <b>self-sufficiency...</b>|$|R

However, if the entire production process were considered, the import of fertilizers, equipment, and labor have made the Kingdom even more dependent on foreign inputs to bring food to the average Saudi household.|$|R
