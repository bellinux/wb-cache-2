The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain an {{understanding}} of the experiences and perceptions of male <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquents</b> from a multidimensional perspective in order to provide guidelines for effective service delivery. The motivation for this study is the current trend in South Africa regarding youth, crime and families and the necessity to have a multidimensional view on these phenomenas. The contribution that this study can make towards crime prevention and rehabilitation of male youth offenders is a further motivation for this study. The research was done based on an extensive literature study, which firstly focused on the conceptualisation of a multidimensional perspective as framework from which the family experiences and perceptions of male <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquents</b> could be described. This conceptual framework was put together through the compilation of the systems-, ecological-, ethnic-sensitive- and strength perspectives. Subsequently both male <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquents</b> and their families were described from a multidimensional perspective. The empirical investigation of the study gave a description of the family experiences and perceptions of male <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquents</b> from a multidimensional perspective. From this multidimensional description of the experiences and perceptions of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquents,</b> findings of the literature study was confirmed namely that the experiences and perceptions of the <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquents</b> was influenced by various factors on the micro-, meso- and macro levels of functioning. In light of the findings derived from the literature study and empirical research, conclusions and recommendations were made concerning the phenomena under investigation.

500|$|The {{election}} of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) in 1932 quelled the public affection for dictators. As the country became increasingly enthralled with FDR, who {{was featured in}} countless newsreels, it exhibited less desire for alternative forms of government. Many Hollywood films reflected this new optimism. Heroes for Sale, despite being a tremendously bleak and at times anti-American film, ends {{on a positive note}} as the New Deal appears as a sign of optimism. When Wild Boys of the Road (1933), directed by William Wellman, reaches its conclusion, a dispossessed <b>juvenile</b> <b>delinquent</b> is in court expecting a jail sentence. However the judge lets the boy go free, revealing to him the symbol of the New Deal behind his desk, and tells him [...] "hings are going to be better here now, not only here in New York, but all over the country." [...] A box-office casualty of this hopefulness was Gabriel Over the White House, which entered production during the Hoover era malaise and sought to capitalize on it. By the time the film was released on March 31, 1933, FDR's election had produced a level of hopefulness in America that rendered the film's message obsolete.*Black, pg. 144.|$|E
