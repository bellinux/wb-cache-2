40|$|Issue: All wood acts abrasively on {{processing}} equipment. Recovered {{wood waste}} is especially abrasive {{because of the}} presence of non-wood contaminants within it. The abrasive characteristics of wood waste cause short- and long-term equipment maintenance problems. These maintenance problems include excessive wear on size-reduction equipment and material-handling equipment. Overall, the abrasiveness of the wood itself leads to long-term equipment wear problems, although normal wear on sensitive pieces like chipper blades requires regular sharpening. The non-wood contaminants, however, will sometimes lead to short-term, or even catastrophic, equipment wear problems. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends implementing several techniques at wood-waste processing facilities that minimize wear in size-reduction equipment and material-handling equipment. Wear-Minimizing Methods Fines Removal. Fine sawdust, dirt, and grit are especially abrasive materials common at wood-waste processing facilities. These small particles can find their way into every mechanical system and cause extensive equipment wear problems. Every effort should be made to screen these fines and all small wood from the large pieces of wood waste early in the process. The screened fines can be designated for lowvalue <b>hogged</b> <b>fuel</b> or mulch products...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} CORRIM Phase I research, {{this study}} {{completed}} a full gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory {{for the production of}} glued-laminated timbers (glulam) produced in two regions of the United States—the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Southeast (SE). Data collected from surveys of manufacturers are presented for energy requirements, raw materials use, and emissions to land, water, and air allocated for one cubic meter and 1000 cubic feet of glulam. The glulam manufacturers surveyed represented 70 and 43 % of the region’s total glulam production for the PNW and SE, respectively. From both regions, 82 % of the raw material and energy inputs and emission outputs were allocated to the glulam product, leaving the remaining 18 % allocated to co-products. Contributions to the glulam process included impacts for the inputs of lumber and adhesives. Results show that wood drying and adhesive manufacturing make major environmental contributions to the glulam process. In addition, fuel sources, either biomass or fossil-based, have significantly different emission impacts to the environment. Wood fuel representing wood waste and <b>hogged</b> <b>fuel</b> accounted for nearly 50 % of the cumulative energy consumed, while for wood fuel used for heat energy to dry lumber represented 65 % and 100 % for the PNW and SE glulam models.

40|$|Issue: At certain {{sources that}} {{generate}} wood waste, particularly demolition projects, processors {{must realize that}} the wood-waste stream potentially contains hazardous contaminants such as lead paint and asbestos. Delivered wood waste that contains hazardous contaminants present challenges to operators at processing facilities. First, these hazardous contaminants could violate the facility’s regulatory permits because wood-waste processors, generally, do not acquire licenses to receive, process, or transfer hazardous wastes. Second, the hazardous contaminants present an occupational safety concern because facility workers are vulnerable to any exposure because hazardous contaminants inevitably become airborne during the handling and size-reduction processes. Next, {{the presence of a}} hazardous contaminants could create product problems and potential product liability issues, depending upon the intended end-product. Finally, the presence of hazardous contaminants in wood-waste products creates lower market values for the processor. Following are examples of end-product problems caused by asbestos and lead-paint contamination: • The health risks of airborne asbestos make it an unacceptable component of any end-product. • Mulch, compost or other land application end-markets must avoid the presence of lead because of the potential for soil contamination. • <b>Hogged</b> <b>fuel</b> customers cannot tolerate the presence of lead contaminants because of air emission and residual ash quality concerns without adequate regulatory permits and pollution control systems. • Manufacturing feedstock applications (e. g., composite panel-board, pulp and paper, etc.) cannot tolerate hazardous contaminants because of occupational safety and product quality concerns. Some processors decide to obtain the appropriate regulatory permits that are required when handling wood contaminated with lead-based paint. These processors must secure a market for the leadcontaminated product or dispose of any residual material containing lead in approved hazardous waste disposal sites. Then, they must carefully implement measures to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory agencies and protect the health of employees...|$|R

40|$|Impurities in {{harvested}} stumps are {{a quality}} problem because {{high levels of}} mineral contaminants decrease the effective heating value of the stump wood, and can also affect ash melting behaviour during combustion, leading to sintering and drift problems. The aim of this case study was to clarify the productivity and screening efficiency of the Kompetech Crambo 6000 low-speed double-shaft grinder equipped with a Komptech star screen, in the integrated grinding and screening of Norway spruce and Scots pine stumps for fuel at a roadside landing, when using two different sieve sizes (250 x 320 mm and 180 x 180 mm screen baskets). Furthermore, we studied the fuel consumption of the Crambo 6000 grinder, ash content and particle size distribution of ground stump wood, and ash content and particle size distribution of the screening reject. In addition, the heating value of the produced <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> and screening reject were analysed. During {{the time of the}} studies, both the grinder and star screen were operating well and there were no delays due to machine breakdowns. The mobile Crambo 6000 grinder was also capable of operating well in constricted roadside landings. The quality of the produced <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> was high, due to low ash content (0. 4 – 2. 3 %), and this highlights the significance of screening to guarantee sufficient quality when processing stump fuel. The ash content of the screening reject was 32. 4 – 74. 7 %, and the effective heating value was 5. 2 – 13. 4 MJ/kg. The effective heating value of the produced <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> was 17. 9 – 19. 9 MJ/kg.

40|$|Issue: Hogged fuel is {{typically}} purchased by volume, unless the user has installed scales for weighing. Due to the <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> combustion process {{used by the}} end user, the size and BTU value of the wood waste will be the determining factor of the purchase price. Depending upon the type of boiler being utilized, wood waste high in fines may not be acceptable. Also, material high in moisture {{may lead to a}} reduction in the price paid for the feedstock. Most <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> fired systems include their own screening and shredding system to assure a quality control step in sizing the material before it is introduced into the interim storage/surge bin feed system. Best Practice: This best practice recommends that processors and end users come to a clear, written understanding of quality requirements. Written specifications for acceptable wood waste feedstocks should be developed and mutually agreed upon. A means to test for compliance with these specifications should also be agreed upon. Feedstock specifications will vary from end user to end user. These differences are due to differences in processing equipment and handling techniques. Wood waste processors should develop specifications for each individual customer they will supply, and these specifications should be made part of a written contract or letter of agreement that stipulates other important conditions (price, volume, etc.). Provided below are general specifications which are intended to provide a starting point for negotiations between processors and end users. The limits shown can also be used by a processing facility to examine the feasibility of achieving the specifications for this type of market, although the final determination of marketability should rest on a more detailed local analysis of end users and their specifications...|$|E

40|$|Current {{forestry}} practice in North America is to transport pulpwood and logs from the harvest site to the mill with the bark on the wood.

40|$|A techno-economic {{analysis}} was conducted to assess the feasibility of using forestry residues with different bark contents for bioethanol production. A proposed cellulosic ethanol biorefinery in Sweden was simulated with Aspen Plus. The plant was assumed to convert different forestry assortments (sawdust and shavings, fuel logs, early thinnings, tops and branches, <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> and pulpwood) to ethanol, pellets, biogas and electricity. The intention was not to obtain absolute ethanol production costs for future facilities, but to assess and compare the future potential of utilizing different forestry residues for bioethanol production. The same plant design and operating conditions were assumed in all cases, {{and the effect of}} including bark on the whole conversion process, especially how it influenced the ethanol production cost, was studied. While the energy efficiency (not including district heating) obtained for the whole process was between 67 and 69 % regardless of the raw material used, the ethanol production cost differed considerably; the minimum ethanol selling price ranging from 0. 77 to 1. 52 USD/L. Under the basic assumptions, all the forestry residues apart from sawdust and shavings exhibited a negative net present value at current market prices.

Five different horizontal and three rotary screening devices were tested using five different screen hole diameters (3. 15, 8, 16, 45, 63 mm, round holes). These systems are compared to a commercially available continuously measuring image analysis equipment. The results show that among the devices of a measuring principle—horizontal and rotary screening—the results are quite comparable, {{while there is a}} severe incompatibility when distributions are determined by different measuring principles. Highest conformity with the reference values is given for measurements with an image analysis system, whereas for all machines with horizontal screens the median value of the size distribution only reached between one-third to half of the reference median value for the particle length distribution. These deviations can be attributed to a higher particle misplacement, which is particularly found in the larger fractions. Such differences decrease when the particle’s shape is more roundish (i. e. sphericity closer to one).

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} gate-to-gate life cycle {{inventory}} for the production of framing lumber from logs in western Oregon and Washington. Dimension lumber and studs are used in the framing of residential structures. A large portion of this type of lumber is Douglas-fir or hemlock. The functional unit is the sawmill complex which produces planed dry lumber from logs. This includes log handling, sawing, drying, planing, and generating steam for the dryer. The system boundary begins with the logs entering the mill complex and ends with products (lumber) or co-products (chips, sawdust, shavings, bark, <b>hog</b> <b>fuel)</b> leaving the mill complex. The burdens for all substances and energy are allocated among the products and co-products based on dry mass. This report is intended for use in developing life cycle inventories for various construction practices in residential housing. Four mills which produced dimension lumber as a primary product were surveyed according to the CORRIM research guidelines. One of these produced only green lumber, one produced only dry lumber, and the other two produced a combination. The annual total production from these mills was 13 percent of the stud and dimension lumber volume produced in the survey region. The mills provided detailed data about the inputs and outputs to their operations for either calendar year 1999 or 2000. Over 99. 5 % of the material inputs and outputs were collected as primary data. An additional ten mills in the region were sampled to obtain steam production and drying data only.

40|$|This Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) Year 2 Biomass Utilization Final Technical Report {{summarizes}} multiple {{projects in}} biopower or bioenergy, transportation biofuels, and bioproducts. A prototype {{of a novel}} advanced power system, termed the high-temperature air furnace (HITAF), was tested for performance while converting biomass and coal blends to energy. Three biomass fuels [...] wood residue or <b>hog</b> <b>fuel,</b> corn stover, and switchgrass [...] and Wyoming subbituminous coal were acquired for combustion tests in the 3 -million-Btu/hr system. Blend levels were 20 % biomass [...] 80 % coal on a heat basis. <b>Hog</b> <b>fuel</b> was prepared for the upcoming combustion test by air-drying and processing through a hammer mill and screen. A K-Tron biomass feeder capable of operating in both gravimetric and volumetric modes {{was selected as the}} HITAF feed system. Two oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloys that would be used in the HITAF high-temperature heat exchanger were tested for slag corrosion rates. An alumina layer formed on one particular alloy, which was more corrosion-resistant than a chromia layer that formed on the other alloy. Research activities were completed in the development of an atmospheric pressure, fluidized-bed pyrolysis-type system called the controlled spontaneous reactor (CSR), which is used to process and condition biomass. Tree trimmings were physically and chemically altered by the CSR process, resulting in a fuel that was very suitable for feeding into a coal combustion or gasification system with little or no feed system modifications required. Experimental procedures were successful for producing hydrogen from biomass using the bacteria Thermotoga, a deep-ocean thermal vent organism. Analytical procedures for hydrogen were evaluated, a gas chromatography (GC) method was derived for measuring hydrogen yields, and adaptation culturing and protocols for mutagenesis were initiated to better develop strains that can use biomass cellulose. Fly ash derived from cofiring coal with waste paper, sunflower hulls, and wood waste showed a broad spectrum of chemical and physical characteristics, according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 618 procedures. Higher-than-normal levels of magnesium, sodium, and potassium oxide were observed for the biomass-coal fly ash, which may impact utilization in cement replacement in concrete under ASTM requirements. Other niche markets for biomass-derived fly ash were explored. Research was conducted to develop/optimize a catalytic partial oxidation-based concept for a simple, low-cost fuel processor (reformer). Work progressed to evaluate the effects of temperature and denaturant on ethanol catalytic partial oxidation. A catalyst was isolated that had a yield of 24 mole percent, with catalyst coking limited to less than 15 % over a period of 2 hours. In biodiesel research, conversion of vegetable oils to biodiesel using an alternative alkaline catalyst was demonstrated without the need for subsequent water washing. In work related to biorefinery technologies, a continuous-flow reactor was used to react ethanol with lactic acid prepared from an ammonium lactate concentrate produced in fermentations conducted at the EERC. Good yields of ester were obtained even though the concentration of lactic acid in the feed was low with respect to the amount of water present. Esterification gave lower yields of ester, owing to the lowered lactic acid content of the feed. All lactic acid fermentation from amylose hydrolysate test trials was completed. Management activities included a decision to extend several projects to December 31, 2003, because of delays in receiving biomass feedstocks for testing and acquisition of commercial matching funds. In strategic studies, methods for producing acetate esters for high-value fibers, fuel additives, solvents, and chemical intermediates were discussed with several commercial entities. Commercial industries have an interest in efficient biomass gasification designs but are waiting for economic incentives.

40|$|Vegetation {{management}} practices {{have become an}} integral component of forest management. Economics of alternative vegetation management treatments were analyzed in this thesis {{on the basis of}} two journal papers. Six research sites established and managed by Vegetation Management Alternatives Program of Ontario were the sources of data. In the first paper, differences in stem quality, and volume and value of fibre produced by planted white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss] 16 years after vegetation management treatments in northwestern Ontario were examined. Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVSOntario) was used to pro-ject the total and merchantable volume to age 70 and BUCK- 2 was used to opti-mize the resulting product mix. Projected value was based on 2009 prices for <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> and SPF (spruce-pine-fir) eastern green lumber prices. At 16 years post-treat-ment, gross total volumes in herbicide-treated and mechanically cut plots were significantly higher (120 - 165 % and 94 - 98 %, respectively) than that in control plots (14. 73 m 3 ha- 1). Based on height, diameter, and taper criteria, observed tree quality did not differ among treatments. The projected value of the fibre produced was 36 to 53 % higher in herbicide-treated plots and 24 to 37 % higher in mechanically cut plots than in control plots ($ 18, 486. 76 ha- 1). Second paper presents the stand-level benefit-cost analyses of 12 vegeta-tion management treatments applied at six study sites in northern Ontario. Net present value (NPV), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and internal rate of return (IRR) for crop and all species in each treatment and site were calculated and compared using 2009 constant dollars and variable real discount rates. Aerial herbicide treatments produced the highest NPV, BCR, and IRR. Internal rates of return of 4. 32 % for aerial herbicide, 2. 90 % for manual brush cutting, 2. 82 % for ground ap-plied herbicide, and 2. 50 % for brush cutting plus herbicide treatments indicated that all of the vegetation management alternatives evaluated are economically viable...|$|E
40|$|Liquid manure lagoons {{are known}} to be sources of odor and {{environmentally}} damaging gas emissions. Land application of the manure slurry after storage can lead to detrimental nutrient runoff and leaching. Floating lagoon covers (biocovers) are one option for reducing emissions, but to date they have only been used to address odors and emissions but not {{to address the problem of}} nutrient loss. This study evaluated the potential of floating biochar covers to reduce odor and gas emissions while simultaneously capturing nutrients from liquid dairy manure. The unique physical and chemical properties of biochars make them promising materials for odor, gas, and nutrient sorption. This new approach has the potential to mitigate multiple environmental problems. Two biochars were used to test this approach: one made from Douglas-fir chips under a low oxygen combustion environment at 650 °C (FC 650), and the other made from Douglas-fir <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> pyrolyzed at 600 °C (HF 600). The HF 600 biocover reduced mean headspace ammonia (NH 3) concentration by 7. 5 to 13. 6 μL/L. No significant reduction was found with the FC 650 biocover. These biochars were able to sorb and hold nutrients while floating on the surface. Nutrient uptake by the two biochars ranged from 0. 21 to 4. 88 mg nitrogen g biochar- 1 and 0. 64 to 2. 70 mg phosphorus g biochar- 1. Potassium ranged from a loss of 4. 52 to a gain of 2. 65 mg g biochar- 1. The biochars also sorbed calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, aluminum, manganese, and silicon. In a separate experiment, a panel of judges evaluated the odor offensiveness (- 10 to 10 scale) and odor threshold (1 to 10 scale) of five cover treatments including four biochars. Mean odor offensiveness ranged from - 0. 4 to - 1. 4 vs. - 2. 1 for the control. Mean odor threshold ranged from 1. 6 to 2. 1 vs. 2. 6 for the control. These results show that biochar covers hold promise as an effective means for reducing odor and gas emissions while sorbing nutrients from liquid dairy manure. More research is needed to determine optimal biochar feedstock, production temperature, pH, and particle size distribution for use as a biocover material...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{less than}} one percent of the private and {{industrial}} timberlands in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) are managed for hardwood production. In order to provide an incentive to manage the hardwood resource actively, hardwood stumpage prices must be consistently competitive with conifer stumpage prices, although this has generally not been the case in the PNW. A variety of factors could contribute to hardwoods being more actively promoted in the timberland manager’s portfolio. For example, species diversity provides stability in a cyclical market, improves soil fertility, and promotes biodiversity in forest stands. The hardwood industry in the PNW, largely red alder, has experienced surprising success over the past decade in both domestic and international markets. This success is of interest considering that commercial hardwood species in the PNW have traditionally been considered a low value by-product of the softwood inventory. While PNW hardwoods have enjoyed increased market acceptance, little market research has been done to characterize the hardwood industry or identify the factors that have contributed to its success. The objectives of this research were to: 1) explore the competitive conditions of the hardwood industry, 2) identify the range of products currently manufactured from hardwoods, 3) analyze current hardwood markets (domestic and international), 4) identify the factors that are perceived to restrict the growth of the hardwood industry in the PNW, and 5) assess future market and product opportunities for PNW hardwood products. Since the number of firms involved in hardwood lumber production in the PNW is relatively small (less than 15), a census of the hardwood industry was conducted. The PNW region, for the purpose of this research, consists of western Washington, western Oregon, and northern California. The survey was administered via fax to each firm in the sample frame. Thirteen hardwood manufacturers were contacted. Of the firms contacted, 10 completed and returned the survey, an effective response rate of 76. 9 %. Results The PNW hardwood lumber industry directly employs approximately 2, 000 workers. Collectively, the hardwood lumber manufacturers surveyed in this study produced approximately 450 mmbf of lumber, with exports totaling approximately 126 mmbf or 28 % of total production. The range of products manufactured included kiln dried and green lumber, pallet stock, veneer, plywood, agricultural boxes and crates, and chips. Hardwood chips represent the primary by-product and all of the chips produced are sold to pulp and paper manufacturers. Approximately half of the slabs and sawdust generated are sold (as chips and mulch, respectively) with the remainder being burned as <b>hog</b> <b>fuel.</b> Similarly, approximately one-third of the planer shavings and bark are sold for livestock bedding and landscaping bark, respectively, with the remainder being burned as <b>hog</b> <b>fuel.</b> While both large and small hardwood lumber manufacturers sell a substantial percentage of their production direct to the end-user, large manufacturers tend to rely on wholesalers to the exclusion of brokers. In the case of small manufacturers, the opposite is true and they tend to favor brokers while minimizing their use of wholesalers. Problems and Threats to the Hardwood Industry: The problems confronting manufacturers in the hardwood industry were categorized into three areas: domestic regulatory issues, domestic resource issues, and international regulatory issues. Survey respondents were asked to indicate the impact of each factor on the competitiveness of their firm. Respondents utilized a seven-point scale ranging from a value of 1 (Strong Negative Impact) to 7 (Strong Positive Impact). Domestic Regulatory Factors: The range of domestic regulatory factors identified in the survey included: federal harvest regulations, state forest practice regulations, and state taxes. Survey respondents indicated that all three domestic regulatory factors had a negative impact on the competitiveness of their firms. The mean scores for the three factors (state taxes, federal regulations, and state forest practice regulations) were 2. 6, 2. 8, and 2. 9, respectively. Domestic Resource Factors: The specific hardwood resource factors examined in the survey included rising raw material prices, rapid price fluctuations (i. e., price volatility), labor quality, resource availability, and resource quality. Rapid price fluctuations and increasing raw material prices were perceived as having the most negative impact on competitiveness, receiving an average score of 2. 8 and 3. 1 respectively. Quality of labor (4. 1) and resource quality (4. 3) were each generally perceived to have relatively little impact on the overall competitiveness of the respondents’ firms. It is interesting to note that resource availability, with a mean score of 4. 6, had a slightly positive impact on overall competitiveness. International Regulatory Factors: The international regulatory factors included in the survey were: regional trade agreements, tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers, and sustainable forest certification. The survey results suggest that environmental certification of wood products (3. 4) and tariff barriers (3. 4) were perceived to have a more negative impact on the competitiveness of hardwood manufacturers than were non-tariff barriers (3. 6) and regional trade agreements (3. 7), although the difference in score was small. Further analysis of the survey data showed that hardwood firms exporting to Europe perceived environmental certification as having a more adverse effect on their competitiveness than did firms exporting to Asia and North America. Marketing Variables: Survey respondents were asked to evaluate the importance of each variable to the competitiveness of their firm using a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (Not Important) to 7 (Very Important). The importance ratings for the individual marketing variables indicate that a firm’s reputation within the hardwood industry was identified as the single most important marketing variable, receiving a mean score of 6. 7. Communicating regularly with customers, product quality control, and providing on time delivery all received relatively high mean scores of 6. 3, suggesting that these variables are also very important. Efficient operation of production facilities, with a mean score of 6. 1, and procuring raw material, with a mean score of 5. 7, were also perceived to be highly important. It is interesting to note that virtually all of the marketing variables associated with innovation received relatively low importance ratings from survey respondents: developing new products (3. 9), manufacturing specialty products (3. 9), utilizing new marketing techniques (3. 8), conducting market research (3. 0), and performing promotional and advertising activities (2. 5). Only a single marketing variable associated with innovation, product branding (5. 2), was viewed as being relatively important. However, given the low level of importance attached to promotional activities, it remains problematic on how a company might successfully brand its products. Conclusions The hardwood industry has experienced substantial and solid growth over the past ten years despite the timber regulations that have restricted the harvest levels from federal and state forests. This growth has occurred in both the domestic US market as well as in foreign markets which now account for almost 28 % of red alder production. While survey respondents did not feel that harvest restrictions had adversely impacted their industry, riparian zone regulations related to endangered salmon populations could have a severe impact on the hardwood resource, particularly if those regulations are vigorously applied to private forests. Respondents indicated that virtually none of the regulatory factors evaluated in the survey were viewed in a positive light, although few were perceived to have a strongly negative impact on the industry. Despite this, a variety of factors were perceived by respondents to have had a moderately negative impact on the hardwood industry. These factors included: state taxes, federal harvest restrictions, state forest practice regulations, hardwood log price volatility, and hardwood log price increases. It is interesting to note that while federal and state harvest restrictions were perceived to have a moderately negative impact on the industry, respondents indicated that resource availability has not yet had an adverse impact on the hardwood industry. Respondents indicated that those marketing variables that influenced a firm’s reputation and production efficiency were the most important in terms of positively impacting the firm’s performance. In contrast, virtually all of the marketing variables associated with acquiring market information and promoting innovation were perceived to have a negative impact on the firm’s performance. In general, these results seem to suggest that hardwood companies in the PNW are conservative and tend to place a low value on the marketing activities associated with innovation and product differentiation...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{oil prices}} and {{concerns}} about global warming have reinforced the interest in biofuels for domestic and district heating, most commonly through combustion of solid biomass like wood logs, <b>hog</b> <b>fuel</b> and pellets. Combustion at non-optimal conditions can, however, lead to substantial emissions of noxious compounds like unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides {{as well as the}} generation of soot. Depending on the rate of combustion more or less air is needed per unit time to completely oxidize the fuel; deficiency of air leading to emissions of unburned matter and too much of excess air to slow combustion kinetics and emissions of mainly carbon monoxide. The rate of combustion is influenced by parameters like fuel quality – moisture and ash content etc. – and in what phase the combustion takes place (in the gas phase through combustion of evaporated substances or on the surface of char coal particles), none of which is constant over time. The key to boiler operation, both from an environmental as well as a power to fuel economy point of view, is thus the careful adjustment of the air supply throughout the combustion process. So far, no control schemes have been applied to small-scale combustors, though, mainly {{due to the lack of}} cheap and simple means to measure basic flue gas parameters like oxygen, total hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide concentrations. This thesis reports about investigations on and characterization of silicon carbide (SiC) based Metal Insulator Semiconductor (MIS) field effect gas sensors regarding their utility in emissions monitoring and combustion control applications as well as the final development of a sensor based control system for wood fired domestic heating systems. From the main sensitivity profiles of such sensor devices, with platinum (Pt) and iridium (Ir) as the catalytic metal contacts (providing the gas sensing ability), towards some typical flue gas constituents as well as ammonia (NH 3), a system comprising four individual sensors operated at different temperatures was developed, which through the application of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, showed good performance regarding simultaneous monitoring of propene (a model hydrocarbon) and ammonia concentrations in synthetic flue gases of varying content. The sensitivity to CO was, however, negligible. The sensor system also performed well regarding ammonia slip monitoring when tested in real flue gases in a 5. 6 MW boiler running SNCR (Selective Non-Catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia). When applied to a 200 kW wood pellet fuelled boiler a similar sensor system was, however, not able to follow the flue gas hydrocarbon concentration in all encountered situations. A PCA (Principal Components Analysis) based scheme for the manipulation of sensor and flue gas temperature data, enabling monitoring of the state of combustion (deficiency or too much of excess air), was however possible to develop. The discrepancy between laboratory and field test results was suspected and later on shown to depend on the larger variation in CO and oxygen concentrations in the flue gases as compared to the laboratory tests. Detailed studies of the CO response characteristics for Pt gate MISiC sensors revealed a highly non-linear sensitivity towards CO, a large response only encountered at high CO/O 2 ratios or low temperatures. The response exhibits a sharp switch between a small and a large value when crossing a certain CO/O 2 ratio at constant operating temperature, correlated to the transition from an oxygen dominated to an almost fully CO covered Pt surface, originating from the difference in adsorption kinetics between CO and O 2. Indications were also given pointing towards an increased sensitivity to background hydrogen as being the mediator of at least part of the CO response. Some general characteristics regarding the response mechanism of field effect sensors with differently structured metal contacts were also indicated. The CO response mechanism of Pt metal MISiC sensors could also be utilized in developing a combustion control system based on two sensors and a thermocouple, which when tested in a 40 kW wood fired boiler exhibited a good performance for fuels with extremely low to normal moisture content, substantially decreasing emissions of unburned matter...|$|E
