5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{is defined as}} damage to the brain {{resulting}} from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile.

5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly <b>impaired,</b> <b>and</b> LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E

5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually <b>impaired</b> <b>and</b> worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound design studio.|$|E

40|$|Acquired {{brain injury}} (ABI) {{frequently}} {{results in a}} characteristic spectrum of physical, cognitive, and behavioural consequences. Individuals with ABI are often unable to appreciate these consequences and comprehend the influence of these deficits on everyday life. These individuals {{are said to have}} impaired awareness. A selective overview of the literature on impaired awareness following ABI is presented. Emphasis is placed on terminology, theories, measurement, treatment, and the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> emotional distress. It was established that the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> aspects of neuropsychological and mood functioning is still unclear. In addition, relatively few empirical studies have investigated treatment techniques for impaired awareness. This study investigated the association between <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> executive functioning, and the relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> emotional distress with a sample of 30 adults with ABI. A sub-sample of 17 individuals with impaired awareness participated in an intervention where they received feedback of their brain scan findings. The main finding of the study was that measures of <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> emotional distress decreased following the feedback intervention. No evidence of a statistically significant relationship between <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> mood, or <b>impaired</b> awareness <b>and</b> executive functioning was found. There was a trend towards poor planning ability being related to unrealistic goal setting. Recommendations for further research in this area of neuropsychology and neurorehabilitation are made...|$|R

30|$|In survivors, {{isolated}} {{impairment of}} intestinal/colonic emptying developed in 66.7 % of patients; {{the combination of}} <b>impaired</b> gastric emptying <b>and</b> <b>impaired</b> intestinal/colonic emptying was revealed in 33.3 % of patients. In non-survivors, isolated impairment of intestinal/colonic emptying developed in 9.1 % of patients; the combination of <b>impaired</b> gastric emptying <b>and</b> <b>impaired</b> intestinal/colonic emptying was revealed in 90.9 % of patients. Therefore, isolated impairment of intestinal/colonic emptying was observed significantly more frequently in group I (p = 0.01), whereas the combination of <b>impaired</b> gastric emptying <b>and</b> <b>impaired</b> intestinal/colonic emptying was observed significantly more frequently in group II (p = 0.01). Independent risk factors such as positive fluid balance, sympathomimetics, administration of narcotics, and sympathomimetics were revealed significantly more frequently in non-survivors than in survivors.
