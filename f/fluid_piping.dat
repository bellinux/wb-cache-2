40|$|Over {{recent years}} the concept of leak-before-break (LBB) has been {{considered}} in establishing safety cases for piping particularly for the nuclear industry. The LBB concept {{is viewed as a}} more realistic design criterion in the design of high energy <b>fluid</b> <b>piping</b> as compared with the double-ended guillotine break as a design criterion, which gives rise to many problems. The concept of LBB aims at the application of fracture mechanics to demonstrate that pipes are very unlikely to experience sudden, catastrophic break without prior indication of detectable leakage. This report is intended to give a review of LBB research activities that have been or are being conducted throughout the world on the basis of literature published up to 1990. Its introduction deals with the background, approach and limitations of LBB. A review of research work related to LBB gives details of nuclear piping studies carried out in different countries.

40|$|AbstractThe {{plane wave}} {{assumption}} {{is key to}} the formulation of one dimensional (1 D) and quasi- 2 D water hammer models, which have been widely used in the design and evaluation of <b>fluid</b> <b>piping</b> systems. As transient analysis and utilization {{are becoming more and more}} popular and important to pipe system diagnosis such as pipe faults (leakage and blockage) detection, a better understanding of the influence of plane wave assumption on the transient responses is necessary and critical to the development and application of such innovative technologies. This study aims to (i) address the efficiency problem of existing 2 D scheme, and then extend the full- 2 D water hammer model to a classical reservoir-pipe-valve system so as to simulate the whole process of typical water hammer event; and (ii) estimate the accuracy of plane wave assumption for reproducing pressure histories under both low frequency wave (LFW) and high frequency wave (HFW) conditions. The results confirm that the plane wave assumption is invalid during the period shortly after valve closure, and the influence of radial pressure wave is evident when the incident wave frequency is larger than the radial wave frequency. Moreover, the radial wave dissipation and dispersion rates are highly dependent on the incident wave frequency. This result may provide implication to the utilization of different transient waves (LFW & HFW) for the pipeline assessment in this field...|$|E

40|$|Gas-geochemistry {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} {{reliable}} and simple technique to apply, at different scales, in many geological scenarios. The study of spatial distribution of soil-gas anomalies, at the surface, can give important and interesting information on the origin and processes involving deep and superficial gas species. This information can be applied and studied in different frameworks, for example: I) seismic zonation, examining, at the surface, anomalous concentrations of deep gas species that upraise throughout preferential pathways (faults and/or fractures); II) environmental protection, monitoring naturally occurring toxic gases and highlighting zones with high health risks for humans; III) geomorphological and structural research, detecting the aggressive <b>fluid</b> <b>piping</b> that causes carsic phenomena; IV) radionuclide migration, both in the pollution assessment from abandoned uranium mines and in the study of high-level radioactive-waste isolation systems. Soil-gas distribution could be affected by surface features such as pedological, biogenic and meteorological factors: these are supposed to have only a subordinate effect on gas leakage. However, it is possible to properly interpret soil-gas anomalies and recognize, and avoid, influences of surface features studying the association of different gases (with different origin and physical/chemical behavior), collecting a large number of samples during periods of stable meteorological and soil moisture conditions (e. g., during dry season) and using appropriate statistical treatment of data (i. e., experimental variograms to investigate the spatial dependency of gas concentrations). We will try, in this paper, to give hints for a better comprehension of the main mechanisms ruling soil-gas features both displaying and discussing some data obtained in either prospecting or monitoring case studies. Soil-gas geochemistry involves the study of many gaseous species (i. e., radiogenic, trace and diagenetic gases) each of them can give specific information on the conditions that allow their formation, accumulation and/or migration.

40|$|The Automatic Test Equipment {{industry}} {{must maintain}} a tester accuracy of roughly one tenth the pulsewidth {{of the device}} under test (DUT). Funneling {{a vast number of}} electrical signals into a very tiny area to contact the DUT while still maintaining good signal fidelity is a problem not only in the ATE industry, but also for personal computers, network servers and supercomputers. As the speed of processors increase, ATE companies must find new ways to achieve the required accuracy. A solution to this problem is investigated whereby a large number of semi-rigid coaxial wires are routed in 3 D space from a low-density array (the tester side) to a high-density array (the DUT side). The three dimensional paths are subject to bend constraints and cannot intersect with any other paths. A software program has been written and tested that is able to find solutions to this 3 D routing problem for many test cases. For relatively simple test cases with less than 15 wires, solutions can typically be found in under a minute. Once the geometries of the paths are determined, a block is made with 3 D tunnels transversing through it. This part is created using a 3 D additive process (e. g. stereolithography), and the coaxial wires are pushed into each tunnel. The maximum force used to insert a wire into a tunnel is limited by the force at which buckling occurs. Uncontrolled buckling of the coaxial wire will compromise electrical signal fidelity or cause opens and must therefore be prevented. To this end, models have been developed to predict the force required to push wires into a predetermined path. Relatively good experimental agreement, within 20 % in many cases, was achieved for paths with radii of curvature to wire diameter ratios between 200 : 1 and 10 : 1. A perfectly elastic beam model is developed as well as an elastic-plastic beam model. (cont.) Additional models are developed which account for the friction and the effect of clearance between the tunnel and the beam. The model is used to guide the routing software such that no path is created that cannot have a wire inserted into it. The solution proposed provides an excellent alternative to a printed circuit board for high speed electrical signals. The general method of using additive manufacturing to create tunnels to guide signal opens up many possibilities for not just coaxial cables, but <b>fluid</b> <b>piping,</b> optical fibers and solid wires. The solution has many further advantages and applications that are reviewed briefly but have not been investigated. by Keith J. Breinlinger. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The Heavy Water Components Test Reactor (HWCTR) {{facility}} (Figure 1) {{was built}} in 1961, operated from 1962 to 1964, and {{is located in the}} northwest quadrant of the Savannah River Site (SRS) approximately three miles from the site boundary. The HWCTR facility is on high, well-drained ground, about 30 meters above the water table. The HWCTR was a pressurized heavy water test reactor used to develop candidate fuel designs for heavy water power reactors. It was not a defense-related facility like the materials production reactors at SRS. The reactor was moderated with heavy water and was rated at 50 megawatts thermal power. In December of 1964, operations were terminated and the facility was placed in a standby condition {{as a result of the}} decision by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission to redirect research and development work on heavy water power reactors to reactors cooled with organic materials. For about one year, site personnel maintained the facility in a standby status, and then retired the reactor in place. In 1965, fuel assemblies were removed, systems that contained heavy water were drained, <b>fluid</b> <b>piping</b> systems were drained, deenergized and disconnected and the spent fuel basin was drained and dried. The doors of the reactor facility were shut and it wasn't until 10 years later that decommissioning plans were considered and ultimately postponed due to budget constraints. In the early 1990 s, DOE began planning to decommission HWCTR again. Yet, in the face of new budget constraints, DOE deferred dismantlement and placed HWCTR in an extended surveillance and maintenance mode. The doors of the reactor facility were welded shut to protect workers and discourage intruders. The $ 1. 6 billion allocation from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to SRS for site clean up at SRS has opened the doors to the HWCTR again - this time for final decommissioning. During the lifetime of HWCTR, 36 different fuel assemblies were tested in the facility. Ten of these experienced cladding failures as operational capabilities of the different designs were being established. In addition, numerous spills of heavy water occurred within the facility. Currently, radiation and radioactive contamination levels are low within HWCTR with most of the radioactivity contained within the reactor vessel. There are no known insults to the environment, however with the increasing deterioration of the facility, the possibility exists that contamination could spread outside the facility if it is not decommissioned. An interior panoramic view of the ground floor elevation taken in August 2009 is shown in Figure 2. The foreground shows the transfer coffin followed by the reactor vessel and control rod drive platform in the center. Behind the reactor vessel is the fuel pool. Above the ground level are the polar crane and the emergency deluge tank at the top of the dome. Note the considerable rust and degradation of the components and the interior of the containment building. Alternative studies have concluded that the most environmentally safe, cost effective option for final decommissioning is to remove the reactor vessel, steam generators, and all equipment above grade including the dome. Characterization studies along with transport models have concluded that the remaining below grade equipment that is left in place including the transfer coffin will not contribute any significant contamination to the environment in the future. The below grade space will be grouted in place. A concrete cover will be placed over the remaining footprint and the groundwater will be monitored for an indefinite period to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The schedule for completion of decommissioning is late FY 2011. This paper describes the concepts planned in order to remove the major components including the dome, the reactor vessel (RV), the two steam generators (SG), and relocating the transfer coffin (TC) ...|$|E

SAM 1651 has a glass transition temperature of {approx} 584 C, a recrystallization temperature of {approx} 653 C, and a melting point of {approx} 1121 C. The measured critical cooling rate for SAM 1651 is {le} 80 K per second, respectively. The yttrium addition to SAM 1651 enhances glass formation, as reported by Guo and Poon [2003]. The corrosion behavior of SAM 1651 was compared with nickel-based Alloy 22 in electrochemical polarization measurements performed in several highly concentrated chloride solutions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of elevated dynamic loads, affecting {{the elements of}} the hydraulic drive, is an important task in production equipment maintenance. In case of the hydraulic drive with actuators, remotely located from the power source, the piping defines the working capacity of the whole system. Hence the development of piping vibroacoustic analysis methods appears to be the vital task. The said methods would not only help to define the cause of increased loads, but also permit to develop an adequate design solution without prolonged experimental checks. The article proposes the method of pipeline system vibroacoustics analysis through the example of press-forge unit drain piping. The novelty of this method consists {{in the use of the}} <b>fluid</b> pulsation and <b>piping</b> vibration spectra analysis in their correlative comparison with account to the calculated modal parameters of a pipeline. The measurements of working fluid pressure pulsation and pipeline vibration in the vicinity of the breakage locations were carried out. The experimental data spectrum analysis indicated an apparition of intense water-hammer process along with the frequency coalescence of fluid pulsation and pipeline vibration. The resonant vibration amplification, caused by the water-hammer effect, was suggested. The pipeline system mathematical model, allowing to calculate its modal parameters, was derived. The comparison of the modal analysis with the vibroacoustic response confirmed the hypothesis of the pipeline resonant breakdown. The article depicts, that the study of the pipeline system vibroacoustic response, based only on Fourier analysis of the working fluid pulsation and pipeline vibration, is prone to fail the reliable causation of elevated dynamic loads. It is suggested to complement the vibroacoustic response analysis with the modal parameters calculation. The mathematical computation of the modal frequencies and shapes was implemented instead of their experimental observation in order to exclude the undesired signal, introduced with attached mechanical equipment. On top of that, the mathematical computation of the pipeline modal parameters allowed to perform the pipeline modal frequency shift from the water-hammer effect frequency range through cautious relocation of additional supports...|$|R
