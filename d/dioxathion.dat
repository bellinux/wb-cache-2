50|$|<b>Dioxathion,</b> {{systematically}} {{known as}} p-dioxane-2,3-diyl ethyl phosphorodithioate, is an organophosphate pesticide. It {{is used as}} an insecticide on livestock and as an acaricide on citrus fruits, deciduous fruits and nuts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dioxathion</b> must {{be stored}} away from alkalis, iron, tin and strong acids. Contact {{can be avoided}} by using {{protective}} clothing and eyeware. If poisoning occurs, a physician may administer atropine sulfate, or pralidoxime in case of severe poisoning.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dioxathion</b> is an Extremely Hazardous Substance, {{as defined}} by Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, {{and is no longer}} allowed to be sold in the United States. However, it {{continues}} to see use in some other countries. It has been known to cause inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase in rats, and it is recommended that people who have exposure to <b>dioxathion</b> regularly get their plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase levels assessed. Persons exposed to other chemicals which affect cholinesterase levels, e.g. other organophosphates or carbamates, may be at an increased risk. There are no known carcinogenic or reproductive effects, but long term exposure may result in nerve damage, poor motor coordination, and personality changes of anxiety, depression or irritability.|$|E
40|$|A method whereby {{resistance}} {{data can}} be analysed by means of frequency distributions is described. This method established that Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi evertsi show either little or only developing resistance to the pesticides chlorfenvinphos and <b>dioxathion.</b> Boophilus spp., however, show more instances {{and higher levels of}} resistance to these 2 pesticides.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Boophilus decoloratus, {{resistant}} to fenvalerate, {{was subjected to}} larval immersion, adult immersion and stall tests using the following classes of ixodicides : organochlorines, organophosphates, a diamidide and pyrethroids. A susceptible reference strain of B. decoloratus was used for comparative purposes. The results indicated {{a high level of}} resistance to DDT and camphechlor, slight tolerance to <b>dioxathion,</b> chlorfenvinphos and pirimiphos ethyl, full susceptibility to bromophos ethyl and amitraz, but marked resistance to cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and flumethrin. This marked resistance in the strain therefore appears to be widespread within the pyrethroid group of chemicals and may have developed as a result of organochlorine cross-resistance.

40|$|Samples of 6, 1 st {{generation}} larval {{populations of}} Boophilus decoloratus, originating from field collected females, {{were subjected to}} increasing doses of the organophosphate acaricide, <b>Dioxathion.</b> The dose-response relationship for 3 populations showed random heterogeneity, where systematic deviations from the linear probit lines were observed for the other 3 populations. Logistic and Gompertz regressions were also fitted for all 6 populations. Probit regressions fitted best for 2 populations exhibiting heterogeneous responses. The logistic regression fitted best for 1 population with heterogeneous responses and 1 population with systematic deviating responses. The Gompertz regression fitted best for the 2 remaining populations exhibiting systematic deviating responses. The Gompertz function {{may be useful in}} describing the dose-response relationship obtained for certain acaricidal toxicity tests.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{adverse effect}} of arsenical tick control dips on Parafilaria bovicola infections {{was investigated in}} 48 artificially infected cattle. A treatment group of 24 cattle was dipped in a plunge dip containing 1600 ppm arsenic trioxide. A control group {{of the same size}} was dipped in an organophosphate dip containing a mixture of chlorfenvinphos and <b>dioxathion.</b> Regular weekly to 3 -weekly dipping had no effect initially on the prevalence of ovipositional blood spots of P. bovicola in either group. However, from 4 months after bleeding commenced there was a significant reduction in blood spots in the arsenic-dipped cattle and, on slaughter at 12 - 14 months after infection, the arsenic group had significantly fewer live worms and fewer carcass lesions. Arsenic residues in muscle samples of treated cattle were 11, 6 times higher than in the controls. It is proposed that arsenic residues in the sub-cutaneous muscle layers increase with repeated dipping until a level toxic to P. bovicola is finally reached. Older cattle would therefore be refractory to infection and their carcasses at slaughter would not be affected. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|A {{government}} analyst laboratory generated {{record on}} acute pesticide poisoning in Zimbabwe. Examination {{and analysis of}} records from the (Zimbabwe) Government Analyst Laboratory show {{that there has been}} 1 294 cases of positive, acute pesticides poisoning from 1960 to 1990. Of these, 40 per cent were suicide eases, 24 per cent foul play and 26 percent accidental. The pesticides involved in the highest number of cases are arsenic formulations during the period 1960 - 1969, endosulphan (1970 - 1979), <b>dioxathion</b> (1980 - 1984) and endosulphan (1985 - 1989 and 1990). Cases were recorded from the provinces, with Manicaland having the highest proportion (13 per cent of cases) and Masvingo the lowest (4 per cent of cases). Among other tasks, the Government Analyst Laboratory which falls under the Health Support Services Branch of the Ministry of Health analyses many varied samples and specimens to provide medico-legal data in Sudden Death Dockets for the Zimbabwe Republic Police when poisoning is the suspected cause of death. The decision on what cases are submitted for analysis is made by the Investigating Officer of the Zimbabwe Republic Police aided by the professional opinion of the Government Medical Officer performing the postmortem. Viscera, the suspected poison, when available, and any other substance(s) and containers found and suspected to have been used are submitted for analysis with a brief report of the circumstances on Form 36. A report is written after the analysis. When a poison is detected, an affidavit is written and submitted for use as evidence if so required...|$|E
