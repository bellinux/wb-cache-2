5|$|Diplodocus is {{both the}} type genus of, and gives its name to, the Diplodocidae, the family to which it belongs. Members of this family, while still massive, are of a {{markedly}} more slender build than other sauropods, such as the titanosaurs and brachiosaurs. All are characterised by long necks and tails and a horizontal posture, with fore limbs shorter than hind limbs. Diplodocids <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{artists and}} singer-songwriters have always <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Athens atmosphere, albeit, as mentioned, not as {{significantly}} as Pop and Rock. Some of Athens' most notable solo singer-songwriter performers are Vic Chesnutt, Nathan Sheppard, Corey Smith, John Berry, Patterson Hood, Ricky Fitzpatrick, along with younger, emerging musicians like Thayer Sarrano and T. Hardy Morris.|$|E

5|$|Ljótólfr {{is a minor}} {{character}} in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga, who is purported to have <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-12th century. The Orkneyinga saga was compiled in about 1200, and documents the reigns of the earls of Orkney. It depicts Ljótólfr as a nobleman {{who lived on the}} Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. During the 12th century, the Hebrides formed part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Newport News' {{location}} next to Hampton Roads {{along with}} its rail network has provided advantages for the city. The city houses two industrial parks which enabled manufacturing and distribution to take root in the city. As technology-oriented companies <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, Newport News became a regional center for technology companies.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{was first}} planted in New Zealand in the 1970s and has <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{relatively}} cool {{climate of the}} Marlborough area and for late harvests in the Nelson region. In comparison to Australian Riesling, New Zealand produces lighter and more delicate wines that range from sweet to dry. Home of cool climate wines, Central Otago, has recently emerged as another area producing terroir driven wines.|$|E

5|$|The Cripple Creek {{strike was}} a major victory for the miners' union. The Western Federation of Miners used {{the success of the}} strike to {{organize}} almost every worker in the Cripple Creek region – including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys – into 54 local unions. The WFM <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cripple Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most county officials (including the new sheriff).|$|E
5|$|Bowling as a {{participation}} sport <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1960s, but {{its popularity}} was diluted due to overbuilding; {{the number of}} bowling alleys sanctioned by the then-American Bowling Congress peaked at about 11,000 by mid-decade, and Kona was {{one of more than}} 30 in southern California alone. A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up for fewer league bowlers.|$|E
5|$|During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Sitakunda {{was part}} of Sector 1, led by Ziaur Rahman and Major Rafiqul Islam of the Mukti Bahini, the forces {{fighting}} for the independence of Bangladesh. The ship breaking industry began in earnest in 1974 when Karnafully Metal Works started scrapping Al Abbas, a Pakistani ship damaged in 1971, and <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. As of 2007, Sitakunda had overtaken the ship breaking industries of India and Pakistan to become {{the largest in the}} world.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{settlements}} {{had been}} established predominantly {{along the lines of}} the existing roads, and the principal villages were Stepney, Whitechapel and Bow. Settlements along the river began at this time to service the needs of shipping on the Thames, but the City of London retained its right to actually land the goods. The riverside became more active in Tudor times, as the Royal Navy was expanded and international trading developed and downstream, a major fishing port developed at Barking to provide fish to the City. These and other factors meant that industries relating to construction, repair, and victualling of naval and merchant ships <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{branch of}} swordmaking in Bizen Province is the Ko-Bizen (old Bizen) school. It {{was founded by}} Tomonari who lived around the early 12th century. The school <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Heian period (10th–12th century) and {{continued}} into the Kamakura period. Three great swordsmiths—Kanehira, Masatsune and Tomonari—are associated with the school. Ko-Bizen tachi are generally thin, have a strong koshi-zori and small kissaki. The grain is itame-hada or small itame-hada and the hamon is small midare made of nie in combination with chōji and gunome.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{expanded}} its railroad connections and industrial activity. It suffered a corresponding rise in pollution {{of the river}} and waterfront. During the early 1870s, the Eads Bridge was constructed over the Mississippi River, and the city established several large parks, including Forest Park. Due to local political and economic disputes, the city separated from St. Louis County in 1876 and became an independent city. Its limited geographic area has inhibited its success in the 20th and 21st centuries because of the small tax base. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became home to two Major League Baseball teams. Ragtime and blues music <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, with African Americans making major contributions also in jazz.|$|E

50|$|Although teleradiology is <b>flourishing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{developed}} world, few teleradiological links {{have been}} made to the developing world. Generally, barriers to the implementation of radiology services have also complicated setting up reliable links.|$|R
5|$|Although Italian Renaissance had {{a modest}} impact in Portuguese arts, Portugal was {{influential}} in broadening the European worldview, stimulating humanist inquiry. Renaissance arrived through {{the influence of}} wealthy Italian and Flemish merchants who invested in the profitable commerce overseas. As the pioneer headquarters of European exploration, Lisbon <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 15th century, attracting experts who made several breakthroughs in mathematics, astronomy and naval technology, including Pedro Nunes, João de Castro, Abraham Zacuto and Martin Behaim. Cartographers Pedro Reinel, Lopo Homem, Estêvão Gomes and Diogo Ribeiro made crucial advances in mapping the world. Apothecary Tomé Pires and physicians Garcia de Orta and Cristóvão da Costa collected and published works on plants and medicines, soon translated by Flemish pioneer botanist Carolus Clusius.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of gambling and prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of gambling and bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|As in {{most other}} parts of the world, the decades {{following}} the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture did not change much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s, giving birth {{to some of the most}} well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK's Black Army, Djurgårdens IF's Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.|$|E

25|$|The late 16th century, however, saw {{a revival}} of Hangul, with gasa {{literature}} and later sijo <b>flourishing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, Hangul novels became a major genre. By this point spelling had become quite irregular.|$|R
2500|$|The {{notion of}} the [...] "Father complex" [...] still <b>flourishes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> culture at large. For example, Czeslaw Milosz wrote of Einstein, [...] "everything about him appealed to my father complex, my yearning for a {{protector}} and leader".|$|R
5|$|During the Cambrian period, Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was {{partially}} in the Northern Hemisphere, and {{during this period}} large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical seas. By {{the start of the}} Devonian period (416Ma), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. Sand and silts were laid down in what is now the Ellsworth, Horlick and Pensacola Mountains. Glaciation began {{at the end of the}} Devonian period (360Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as Glossopteris, a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 61.3% of {{city streets}} or 17.860 {{kilometers}} are concrete while 38.70% or 10.950 kilometers are gravel roads. In order for business to <b>flourish</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poblacion, all city streets {{need to be}} concreted within the plan period.|$|R
