50|$|To provide {{communications}} between the Emotion Engine and the <b>Input</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Processor</b> (IOP), the input output interface interfaces a 32-bit wide, 37.5 MHz input output bus {{with a maximum}} theoretical bandwidth of 150 MB/s to the internal data bus. The interface provides enough bandwidth for the PCMCIA extension connector which {{was used for the}} network adapter with built-in P-ATA interface for faster data access and online functionality. An advantage of the high bandwidth was that it could be easily used to introduce hardware extensions like the Network Adapter with built-in IDE HDD support or other extensions to extend functionality and product lifecycle which {{can be seen as a}} competitive advantage. In newer variants (like the slim edition), the interface would however offer vastly more bandwidth than what is required by the PlayStation's input output devices as the HDD support was removed and the PCMCIA connector design was abandoned in favor of a slimmer design.|$|E

The FTB DFLCC has triplex digital redundancy architecture. We use to DFLCC rapid prototyping (RP) to help the participants perform design review and function analysis easily.

A major technical challenge remaining is the integration, flight testing, and validation of data link equipment and procedures in the aircraft cockpit. The flight test organizational chart, was designed to have the airplane side of data link experiments implemented in the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) experimental Boeing 737 airplane. This design would enable investigations into implementation of data link equipment and pilot interface, operations, and procedures. The illustrated ground system consists of a work station with links to a national weather database and a data link transceiver system. The data link transceiver system could be a Mode-S transponder, ACARS, AVSAT, or another type of radio system such as the military type HF data link. The airborne system was designed so that a data link transceiver, workstation, and touch panel could be interfaced with an <b>input</b> <b>output</b> <b>processor</b> to the aircraft system bus and thus have communications access to other digital airplane systems...|$|E

40|$|Introduction To help users {{find their}} way in a virtual theatre we {{developed}} a navigation agent. In natural language dialogue the agent assists users looking for the location of an object or room, and it shows routes between locations. The speech-based dialogue system allows users to ask questions such as "Where is the coffee bar?" and "How do I get to the great hall?" The agent has a map and can mark locations and routes; users can click on locations and ask questions about them. In an earlier version (Luin et al., 2001) no underlying dialogue model was used. Now we have a generic architecture and dialogue model allowing multimodal interactions, including reference modelling and backward/ forward looking tags to determine and model dialogue structure. The architecture of the system can be conceived as a box containing a dialogue manager (DM) and world knowledge, to be connected with <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>processors.</b> The processors can be plugged into different dialogue systems.

This proliferation has created a need for standard tools that allow the packages to communicate with each other. Since each package has its own strengths and weaknesses, it is desirable {{to be able to use}} a particular package for the specific tasks it is good at, and to switch between different packages when necessary. Moreover, the ability to share data between packages allows modular problem solving, where sub-tasks are delegated to specific packages. This eliminates the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|One is the {{pipelining}} method, and {{the other}} is the block partitioning. Several papers have discussed the pipelining method [1][6]. Each processor calculates an entire block for I/W iterations and passes extrinsic information (Le) to the next processor, where I is the iteration number, and W is the number of processors. Though the decoding delay is reduced to O(N/W) from O(N), the register space for a received data and that for Le is increased to O(NW). Here N is block size. This is too much overhead since the increased register space occupies a large portion within the entire decoder. A parallel decoding method using block partitioning was suggested in [7]. Each information block is divided into partially overlapped W SISO (Soft <b>Input</b> Soft <b>Output)</b> <b>processors,</b> and these processors decode in parallel as illustrated in Fig. 1. This scheme can reduce the decoding delay down to O(N/W), not requiring additional register space for the received data and that for Le. However, memory bandwidth for Le, which should be handled at the same time, is increased by W, {{and it needs to be}} interleaved at the same time. Consequently, there can be a data conflict at the read/write operation between the W processors and Le memory. Note, however, that this problem was not seriously addressed at the early paper [7][8], and narrow down to the block-type interleaver at the first paper considering this problem [9]. Rec-eive...|$|R

This device, which controls a client PDA, {{is known as the}} Personal Speech Assistant (PSA). The PSA contains complete speech recognition, speech synthesis and dialog management systems. Packaged in a hand-sized enclosure, of size and physical design to mate with the popular Palm III personal digital assistant, the PSA includes its own battery, microphone, speaker, audio <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> amplifiers, <b>processor</b> and memory.

40|$|Fuzzy Logic {{implementation}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important, and finding applications in diverse areas of current interest, such as control, pattern recognition, robotics, and other decision making applications. Fuzzy decision process offer a significant advantage over crisp decision process which {{is the ability to}} process different levels of truth instead of only 1 or 0 levels. Fuzzy Logic does not require precise inputs, it is inherently robust, and can process any reasonable number of inputs but system complexity increases rapidly with more <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> Distributed <b>processors</b> would probably be easier to implement. Simple, plain-language IF X AND Y THEN Z rules are used to describe the desired system response in terms of linguistic variables rather than mathematical formulas. The number of these is dependent on the number of <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> and the designer 2 ̆ 7 s control response goals. The new Motorola 68 HC 12 MCU has an embedded fuzzy logic instruction set. Using this instruction set, we can implement complex fuzzy logic systems using only a few hundred bytes of ROM that cycle compute in less than a millisecond. Considering the fact that the fuzzy logic instruction set of the 68 HC 12, enables the use of fuzzy logic in mass-market high-speed applications, such as car engine control, anti-skid brakes, traction control, inter-vehicle dynamics control, hard disk drive control, servo motor control, and cellular phones. This thesis deals with the design of Automotive Airbag Control System a using Fuzzy Logic based decision structure and implementation using the 68 HC 12 microcontroller.

Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher Ideal, and Törnqvist-Theil index number procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91.
