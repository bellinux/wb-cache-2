25|$|<b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>aqueous</b> {{solution}} {{the color}} change exhibited {{can be used}} to test for distinguishing aldehydes from ketones. Aldehydes reduce dichromate from the +6 to the +3 oxidation state, changing color from orange to green. This color change arises because the aldehyde can be oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid. A ketone will show no such change because it cannot be oxidized further, and so the solution will remain orange.|$|E
25|$|The self-{{ionization}} {{of water}} (also autoionization of water, and autodissociation of water) is an ionization reaction in pure water or <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aqueous</b> solution, {{in which a}} water molecule, H2O, deprotonates (loses the nucleus {{of one of its}} hydrogen atoms) to become a hydroxide ion, OH−. The hydrogen nucleus, H+, immediately protonates another water molecule to form hydronium, H3O+. It is an example of autoprotolysis, and exemplifies the amphoteric nature of water.|$|E

25|$|The {{solubility}} {{of proteins}} in aqueous buffers {{depends on the}} distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residues on the protein's surface. Hydrophobic residues predominantly occur in the globular protein core, but some exist in patches on the surface. Proteins that have high hydrophobic amino acid content on the surface have low solubility <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aqueous</b> solvent. Charged and polar surface residues interact with ionic groups in the solvent and increase the solubility of a protein. Knowledge of a protein's amino acid composition will aid in determining an ideal precipitation solvent and methods.|$|E
25|$|Pre-synthesized polymers, {{like the}} PDMEAMA/PTMSPMA block copolymer, can be immobilized on a surface (i.e. glass) by simply {{immersing}} the surface <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aqueous</b> solution containing the polymer.

As expected, an inverse relationship exists between grafting density and molecular weight. As the antimicrobial activity depends on the concentration of quaternary ammonium tethered to the surface, grafting density and molecular weight represent opposing factors that can be manipulated to achieve high efficacy.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} {{application of}} methylene blue is the intravital or supravital staining of nerve fibers, an effect first described by Paul Ehrlich in 1887.

Vital methylene blue was formerly much used for examining the innervation of muscle, skin and internal organs.

The formation of non-lamellar phases in phospholipids is not completely understood, but it is significant that this amphiphilic molecule is capable of doing so. The formation of non-lamellar phases is significant in biomedical studies which include drug delivery, the transport of polar and non-polar ions using solvents capable of penetrating the biomembrane, increasing the elasticity of the biomembrane when it is being disrupted by unwanted substances (viruses, bacteria, solvents, etc.) and functioning as a channel or transporter of biomaterial.|$|E

25|$|Most metals {{occur in}} nature in their {{oxidized}} form (ores) and thus must {{be reduced to}} their metallic forms. The ore is dissolved following some preprocessing <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aqueous</b> electrolyte or in a molten salt and the resulting solution is electrolyzed. The metal is deposited on the cathode (either in solid or in liquid form), while the anodic reaction is usually oxygen evolution. Several metals are naturally present as metal sulfides; these include copper, lead, molybdenum, cadmium, nickel, silver, cobalt, and zinc. In addition, gold and platinum group metals are associated with sulfidic base metal ores. Most metal sulfides or their salts, are electrically conductive and this allows electrochemical redox reactions to efficiently occur in the molten state or in aqueous solutions.|$|E
