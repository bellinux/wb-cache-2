40|$|CONTEXT: The {{clinical}} {{evolution of}} autonomous thyroid nodules (ATN) is unpredictable, and thyrotoxicosis is observed at variable nodule size. In vitro {{data suggest that}} hydrogen peroxide production is decreased in ATN, indicating intranodular iodide organification impairment. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine iodide organification efficiency in ATN and its relationship with thyroid status in patients. DESIGN: Forty-six patients with a single ATN on the 123 I thyroid scan {{were included in the}} study. Biological evaluation and iodine perchlorate (I-ClO 4) <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> were carried out in all subjects. SETTING: The study took place at an academic hospital. RESULTS: Among the 46 patients, 28 patients (61 %) had a positive I-ClO 4 <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> with a mean +/- sd value of discharge of 42 +/- 13 %, and 18 (39 %) had a negative <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> with mean +/- sd of 5 +/- 9 %. In the group of patients with a negative <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> but not in the group with a positive test, serum-free T 3 and free T 4 concentrations were significantly correlated with the 123 I uptake. The severity of hyperthyroidism was not different between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intranodular iodide organification was impaired in most patients with ATN.

40|$|Deterioration of {{stator winding}} {{insulation}} {{continues to be}} one of the predominant causes of large motor and generator failures. Over the past several years, practical methods have been developed for measuring the partial discharge activity in the high voltage insulation of stator windings, since partial discharges are a symptom of most of the insulation failure mechanisms. One test, called the PDA test, can be performed by utility personnel during normal operation of a hydrogenerator. Several improvements have recently been made to the PDA test to help maintenance personnel interpret results and identify the root cause of any problems. A similar partial <b>discharge</b> <b>test,</b> called the TGA test, has now been specifically developed for turbine generators and large motors. The TGA test allows fossil and nuclear plant staff to reliably perform a partial <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> on motors and turbine generators. This paper presents several case studies of the use of these new partial <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> technologies on generators. Test results show that machines with deteriorated windings have a partial discharge activity at least 30 times higher than good windings. The availability of these test methods enables utilities to economically and reliably plan stator winding maintenance and avoid unexpected failures. ...|$|E

40|$|Pendred {{syndrome}} is an autosomal recessive condition classically characterized by deafness and goitre. Since both cochlear and thyroid pathology {{are required to}} secure the diagnosis, {{it is unclear whether}} the condition might present without the classical features. The perchlorate <b>discharge</b> <b>test,</b> the gold-standard investigation for Pendred syndrome, is non-specific, {{and in the absence of}} alternative means of confirming the diagnosis, its sensitivity is unknown. We used the recent mapping of the gene to chromosome 7 q to identify pedigrees with a likely diagnosis of Pendred syndrome, and assessed the prevalence of clinical parameters of disease in affected patients. Thirty-six familial cases showed co-segregation between disease and the Pendred syndrome locus on chromosome 7 q. Clinical and investigative findings were compared in index cases (n = 18) vs. affected siblings (n = 18). The overall prevalence of goitre was 73 %, higher in index cases (94 %) than in siblings (56 %), many of whom had not previously been considered to have the condition. One perchlorate <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> was false-negative (2. 9 %). Radiological malformations of the cochlea were identified in 86 % of cases.

40|$|We {{propose a}} state-of-charge (SOC) {{estimation}} method for Li-ion batteries that combines a fuzzy sliding mode observer (FSMO) with grey prediction. Unlike the existing methods {{based on a}} conventional first-order sliding mode observer (SMO) and an adaptive gain SMO, the proposed method eliminates chattering in SOC estimation. In this method, which uses a fuzzy inference system, the gains of the SMO are adjusted according to the predicted future error and present estimation error of the terminal voltage. To forecast the future error value, a one-step-ahead terminal voltage prediction is obtained using a grey predictor. The proposed estimation method is validated through two types of discharge tests (a pulse <b>discharge</b> <b>test</b> and a random <b>discharge</b> <b>test).</b> The SOC estimation results are compared {{to the results of}} the conventional first-order SMO-based and the adaptive gain SMO-based methods.
