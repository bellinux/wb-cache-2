40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} stabilizing a class of nonlinear systems by using an H-infinity <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> feedback controller. First, a class of nonlinear systems is approximated by a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model. Then, based on a well-known Lyapunov functional approach, we develop a technique for designing an H-infinity <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> feedback control law which guarantees the L 2 gain from an exogenous input to a regulated output is less or equal to a prescribed value. A design algorithm for constructing an H-infinity <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> feedback controller is given. In contrast to the existing results, the premise variables of the H-infinity <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> feedback controller are not necessarily {{to be the same}} as the premise variables of the TS fuzzy model of the plant.

30|$|There {{are many}} {{studies in the}} {{literature}} related to FR since then proposed by Tanaka et al. [46]. Bardossy [5] developed a general form of regression equations for the fuzzy numbers and formulated the FR problem as a mathematical programming. Bardossy et al. [6] introduced a general methodology for FR and applied to an actual hydrological case study including the imprecise relationship between soil electrical resistivity and hydraulic permeability. Sakawa and Yano [40] developed LP-based methods for solving formulated three types of problems for obtaining the FLR models, where both input and <b>output</b> data are <b>fuzzy</b> numbers. Sakawa and Yano [41] introduced three types of multiobjective programming (MOP) problems for obtaining FLR models with fuzzy input and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> data. They developed an LP-based interactive decision making method to derive the satisfying solution of the decision maker for the MOP problems. Ming et al. [31] described a model for LS fitting of fuzzy input and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> data. Kao and Chyu [26] introduced the method of LS under fuzzy environment to handle fuzzy observations in regression analysis for three cases: crisp input-fuzzy <b>output,</b> <b>fuzzy</b> input-fuzzy <b>output,</b> and non-triangular <b>fuzzy</b> observations. Yang and Lin [48] proposed two estimation methods along with an FLS approach for considered FLR models with <b>fuzzy</b> inputs, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>outputs</b> and <b>fuzzy</b> parameters. Hojati et al. [20] proposed a simple goal programming-like approach for computation of FR for two cases: crisp inputs-fuzzy <b>outputs</b> and <b>fuzzy</b> inputs-fuzzy <b>outputs.</b> Chen and Dang [10] proposed a three-phase method to construct the FR model with variable spreads to resolve the problem of increasing spreads. Lu and Wang [30] proposed an enhanced fuzzy linear regression model (FLR_FS). Shakouri and Nadimi [43] introduced an approach to find the parameters of an FLR with crisp inputs and <b>fuzzy</b> <b>outputs.</b> Khan and Valeo [27] introduced a method, which {{is an extension of}} the Diamond’s [16] FLS method, for FLR with fuzzy regressors, regressand and coefficients.|$|R

If there are M rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than M rules.
