5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E

5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis {{are now trying to}} develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|Several {{courtship}} displays by splendid fairywren {{males have}} been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so {{named for the}} similarity of movements to those by a seahorse, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display {{may be seen as}} a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of osmium {{appears to be}} for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO4), which is a highly toxic compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. <b>It</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E

5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when <b>it</b> <b>involves</b> <b>the</b> fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
