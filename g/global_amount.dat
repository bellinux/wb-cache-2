2500|$|There is {{a debate}} about {{whether there was a}} large enough amount of methane hydrate to be a major carbon source; a recent paper {{proposed}} that was the case. The present-day global methane hydrate reserve is poorly constrained, but is mostly considered to be between 2,000 and 10,000 Gt. However, because the global ocean bottom temperatures were ~6°C higher than today, which implies a much smaller volume of sediment hosting gas hydrate than today, the <b>global</b> <b>amount</b> of hydrate before the PETM has been thought to be much less than present-day estimates. in a 2006 study, scientists regarded the source of carbon for the PETM to be a mystery.

Adaptive numerical modelling, the SUpport vector Parsimonious ANalysis Of VAriance (SUPANOVA) approach, has been applied to image analysis data to identify those features which distinguish between the graphite nodules which initiate fatigue and those that do not. Critical crack initiating features are identified to be a combination of graphite nodule size and local clustering within a mesoscopic region containing a lower volume fraction of graphite nodules.

40|$|The {{aging of}} Canada’s {{population}} {{in the coming decades}} will drive up the cost of many government programs, such as public health insurance and elderly benefits. In the area of primary and secondary education, though, the opposite should be true (Robson 2003). With a declining share of youngsters in the population, governments should be able to spend relatively less on their education and redirect resources to other programs. That reallocation of public funds should already be under way because in most provinces, kindergarten-to-grade 12 (K- 12) enrolments have been falling significantly since the mid- 1990 s. With no corresponding decline in spending, however, falling enrolments have not freed up any margin in provincial budgets.

50|$|In general, the {{principle}} of the CERINA-Plan is: The more a country emits, the more it has to invest in counterbalancing renewable energy technology. Since the annual global CO2 growth rate and the investments in renewable energy generation plants concerning power, heating and fuels are known, the necessary amount which have to be spent for renewable can be calculated. According to IWR calculations, the <b>global</b> <b>amount</b> should be increased to 500 billion Euro per year from 125 billion Euro of actual investment in 2009. Together with the figure of 31.1 billion tons of CO2 emissions, this leads to a theoretical price of 16 Euro per ton 3. With the help of this calculation, the required investment sum can be determined for each country. For example, the world’s largest emitter China would have to spend an amount of 119 billion Euro to compensate for its 7.4 billion tons of emitted CO2. The IWR has calculated the necessary investment for 65 countries.|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila, dosage {{compensation}} augments X chromosome-linked transcription in males relative to females. This process {{is achieved by}} the Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC), which associates specifically with the male X chromosome. We previously found that the morphology of this chromosome is sensitive to the amounts of the heterochromatin-associated protein SU(VAR) 3 - 7. In this study, we {{examine the impact of}} change in levels of SU(VAR) 3 - 7 on {{dosage compensation}}. We first demonstrate that the DCC makes the X chromosome a preferential target for heterochromatic markers. In addition, reduced or increased amounts of SU(VAR) 3 - 7 result in redistribution of the DCC proteins MSL 1 and MSL 2, and of Histone 4 acetylation of lysine 16, indicating that a wild-type dose of SU(VAR) 3 - 7 is required for X-restricted DCC targeting. SU(VAR) 3 - 7 is also involved in the dosage compensated expression of the X-linked white gene. Finally, we show that absence of maternally provided SU(VAR) 3 - 7 renders dosage compensation toxic in males, and that <b>global</b> <b>amounts</b> of heterochromatin affect viability of ectopic MSL 2 -expressing females.

At {{the end of the}} year 2000, it was estimated to be 4800 PBq, and in 1973, an estimated 1961 PBq (53 Megacuries). The most important of these human sources is nuclear fuel reprocessing. Nuclear fission produces about three atoms of krypton-85 for every 1000 fissions; i.e. it has a fission yield of 0.3%. Most or all of this krypton-85 is retained in the spent nuclear fuel rods; spent fuel on discharge from a reactor contains between 0.13-1.8 PBq/Mg of krypton-85. Some of this spent fuel is reprocessed. Current nuclear reprocessing releases the gaseous Kr-85 to the atmosphere when the spent fuel is dissolved. It would be possible in principle to capture and store this krypton gas as nuclear waste or for use. The cumulative <b>global</b> <b>amount</b> of krypton-85 released from reprocessing activity has been estimated as 10,600 PBq as of 2000. The global inventory noted above is smaller than this amount due to radioactive decay; a smaller fraction is dissolved into the deep oceans.|$|E
