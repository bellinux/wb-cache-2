Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is likely to have been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E

Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E

[...] Of the three stories, Jacobsson liked [...] "Do the Bard, Man" [...] the most, although he overall found the episode to be [...] "mediocre". Adam Rayner of Obsessed with Film wrote that, even though the episode [...] "has a few laughs", it [...] "just feels half-hearted", and, writing for 411Mania, Ron Martin described the episode as being [...] "just a lazy way out for the writers". Giving the episode a negative review, Nate Boss of Project:Blu wrote that the episode is [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "kinda annoying", and that it [...] "has been <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times, it's hardly all that funny". On the other hand, Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com wrote that he is [...] "particularly fond of [...] " [...] and Rosie Fletcher of Total Film considered {{it to be a}} [...] "stand-out" [...] episode in the season.

In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else {{is he going to do}} after this? He's <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's nice for the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will."

In the episode, they rhyme a hip hop song that according to Selman is [...] "all bragging about how awesome and cool you are as a foodie." [...] It was co-written by the duo, and {{was inspired by the}} song [...] "Empire State of Mind". [...] Selman has commented that [...] "In animated TV shows, whenever you're trying to show people having fun doing their new thing , it just kind of becomes a boring montage.

Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E

[...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows.

Let's try to play some of the albums.' There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form.

Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years.

So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together.

500|$|During the mid-afternoon of Saturday 14 January 1933, {{the second}} day of the Third Test, Woodfull and Fingleton opened the batting for Australia in the face of an England total of 341 before a record {{attendance}} of 50,962 people. Fingleton was caught by the wicketkeeper without scoring. The third over of the innings was bowled by Larwood with fielders still in orthodox positions. The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head and the final ball, delivered short on the line of middle stump, struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest, bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: [...] "Well bowled, Harold!" [...] Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, who was also batting at the time, Woodfull was appalled. Play resumed after a brief delay, once it was certain the Australian captain was fit to carry on, and since Larwood's over had ended, Woodfull did not have to face the bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into Bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> <b>Many</b> commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the angry spectators became extremely volatile. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. It is likely Jardine wished to press home his team's advantage in the match, and the Bodyline field was usually employed at this stage of an innings.|$|E
