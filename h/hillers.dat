25|$|Scholars {{have long}} {{recognized}} that Amos utilized an ancient hymn within his prophecy, verses {{of which are}} found at 4.13; 5.8–9; 8.8; 9.5–6. This hymn is best understood as praising YHWH for His judgment, demonstrated in His destructive power, rather than praise for creation. Scholarship has also identified 'Sumerian City Lament' (SCL) motifs within Amos and particularly the hymn, offering the possibility that Amos used SCL as a literary template for his prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction. The Amos hymn has also been {{discussed in terms of}} a 'covenant curse' which was used to warn Israel of the consequences of breaking the covenant, and in particular a 'Flood covenant-curse' motif, first identified by D.R. <b>Hillers.</b> Recent scholarship has shown Amos' hymn is an ancient narrative text, has identified a new verse at 7.4; and has compared the hymn to the Genesis Flood account and Job 9:5–10.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hiller</b> was {{the founder}} of <b>Hiller</b> Industries which, in {{collaboration}} with Henry J. Kaiser, became United Helicopters in 1945. In 1948 the company became <b>Hiller</b> Helicopters. After <b>Hiller</b> merged with Fairchild Industries in 1966, <b>Hiller</b> left to pursue a second career as a company turnaround specialist. <b>Hiller</b> created the <b>Hiller</b> Investment Company to realize the opportunities in bringing together strong management groups and effective boards of directors to revitalize companies with large asset bases not being employed as effectively as possible. His strategy was to become chairman or chief executive officer, and not take any compensation until the employees had a turnaround, and the company's shareholders realized their promised returns.|$|R
5000|$|Wagner’s dismissive {{remarks on}} <b>Hiller</b> {{throughout}} his autobiography Mein Leben {{and in his}} later review of <b>Hiller’s</b> autobiography are not however representative {{of his relationship with}} <b>Hiller</b> as revealed through other documents. Wagner features quite frequently in <b>Hiller’s</b> diary for the period. Amongst such notes are:and so forth. <b>Hiller</b> assisted with the staging of Tannhäuser in Dresden in October 1845. In November 1846 <b>Hiller</b> went to see Tannhäuser and notes [...] "Mendelssohn is sitting in front of us" [...] (but presumably no conversation took place). In 1847 he discusses his draft of Konradin with Wagner.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Hillers</b> {{settled in}} Rose Tree, {{at the north}} edge of Media, Pennsylvania. [...] Hiller founded a clinic in nearby Chester for poor workers in the {{factories}} there. [...] While there, he encountered a devastating {{outbreak of a disease}} that spread rapidly and paralyzed its victims, especially children. [...] A few physicians in other towns were experiencing similar outbreaks. [...] They communicated, shared experiences, and realized not only that they were dealing with the same disease (“infantile paralysis”), but that it was a form of polio, which apparently had taken a more damaging, virulent, epidemic form. The <b>Hillers</b> had two daughters, Margaret Linn and Virginia (“Ginny”).|$|E

By then, just over {{ten years after the}} publication of <b>Hiller's</b> and Leonard Isaacson's seminal book Experimental Music (<b>Hiller</b> and Isaacson 1959), a startling number of experiments in generativemusic with early computers had been completed. <b>Hiller’s</b> early research, compositions, and publications established him as a leader in the then-emerging field of computer-aided algorithmic composition (CAAC). Some researchers, likely inspired by <b>Hiller</b> and Isaacson's 1956 Illiac Suite string quartet, even duplicated their instrumentation: in an amusing footnote, <b>Hiller</b> writes that "it is curious to note how many computer pieces have been written for string quartet... particularly since string-quartet performers seem to be among the least receptive to newer compositional ideas such as computermusic" (<b>Hiller</b> 1970, p. 70) ...|$|R

For me it's the one joke that may save me from pessimism. Take fewer men and give me an hour's fun. Really and truly, James, if you collected coins or humming-birds, and I could buy one with the price of your road, I would buy it. I collect incidents--those rare, those precious things.
