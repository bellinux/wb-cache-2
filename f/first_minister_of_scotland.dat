5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Scottish heraldry, use of the banner is not restricted to the sovereign. Several Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland are permitted to use the Royal Banner of Scotland, including; the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> (as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland), Lord Lieutenants within their respective Lieutenancies, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the Lord Lyon King of Arms and other lieutenants who may be specially appointed by the Sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Brown faced a major prime-ministerial {{challenge}} {{two days}} after entering office, when two unexploded car bombs were discovered in London on 29 June. The following day, a car was driven into {{the entrance of the}} main terminal of Glasgow International Airport in a second apparent terrorist attack, causing a fire and considerable damage to the building. Brown was born in Glasgow, leading to speculation that the attacks were motivated against him. As a result of both the London and Glasgow incidents, Brown chaired emergency COBRA meetings to review plans to protect the British public. He also spoke to the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> Alex Salmond regarding the incidents.|$|E
5|$|The monarch has {{a similar}} {{relationship}} with the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Sovereign appoints the <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> on the nomination of the Scottish Parliament, and the First Minister of Wales on the nomination of the National Assembly for Wales. In Scottish matters, the Sovereign acts {{on the advice of}} the Scottish Government. However, as devolution is more limited in Wales, in Welsh matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The Sovereign can veto any law passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly, if it is deemed unconstitutional by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Privy Counsellors are {{appointed}} for {{life by the}} Monarch, on the advice <b>of</b> the Prime <b>Minister.</b> All members <b>of</b> the British Cabinet (technically a committee of the Privy Council) {{are appointed}} to the Privy Council, as are certain other senior ministers in the government and leaders of the major political parties. The Privy Council thus includes all current and {{former members of the}} Cabinet of the United Kingdom, excepting those who have resigned from the Privy Council. The <b>First</b> <b>Ministers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland,</b> Wales and Northern Ireland are also so appointed.|$|R

5000|$|In devolved administrations, {{the powers}} {{currently}} exercised by the EU {{in relation to}} common policy frameworks {{would return to the}} UK, allowing the rules to be set in the UK by democratically-elected representatives. <b>Ministers</b> <b>of</b> devolved administrations would be given the power to amend devolved legislation to correct law that would not operate appropriately following Brexit. However, the bill also prevents devolved administrations from making changes that are [...] "inconsistent" [...] with those made by the UK government. This significantly limits the power of the devolved governments by making it impossible for them to, for example, choose to retain a piece of EU law that has been modified by the UK government. The <b>First</b> <b>Ministers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, issued a joint statement calling the bill a [...] "naked power grab" [...] and threatening to withhold Legislative Consent Motions unless the bill was redrafted.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} {{appointing}} a new Scotland manager is {{undertaken by the}} main SFA board. After a review was conducted by former <b>First</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> Henry McLeish, the SFA board structure was streamlined considerably in 2011. Professional game and non-professional game boards govern their respective areas of football, while the main board has a strategic focus. There are seven members on the main board, consisting of four SFA office bearers, one representative each from the professional game and non-professional game boards and one independent member. As of September 2013, these positions are occupied by Stewart Regan (chief executive), Campbell Ogilvie (president), Alan MacRae (first vice-president), Rod Petrie (second vice-president), Peter Lawwell (professional game) and Barrie Jackson (independent). The non-professional game position is presently vacant.|$|E

50|$|The {{major and}} the oldest church in Mauritius is the St. Louis Cathedral, Port-Louis. Originally built by French during the 18th century, the church was {{destroyed}} in a cyclone during the early 19th century. It was rebuilt during 1925 and expanded with a twin tower during 1932. A fountain built during 1786 by Governor Vicomte de Souillac and an oil painting depicting Biblical scene by A. Richard during 1855 are the major artefacts in the church. St. James Cathedral, located on the Poudriere Street is locally called cyclone shelter with its two metre thick wall of the old structure. St. Andrews, built in 1851 and St. Johns' in 1856 in Port Louis are prominent churches built by Patrick Beaton, the <b>first</b> <b>minister</b> <b>of</b> Church <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> in Mauritius.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{to being}} officially announced, {{it was widely}} speculated that a June date for the {{referendum}} was a serious possibility. The <b>First</b> <b>Ministers</b> <b>of</b> Northern Ireland, <b>Scotland,</b> and Wales co-signed a letter to Cameron asking him not to hold the referendum in June, as devolved elections were scheduled to take place the previous month. These elections had been postponed for a year to avoid a clash with the 2015 general election, after Westminster had implemented the Fixed-term Parliament Act. Cameron refused this request, saying people {{were able to make}} up their own minds in multiple elections spaced a short time from each other.|$|R

The building, now known as West Register House, now houses part of the National Archives of Scotland.
