40|$|The {{debate on}} the topic of the merits of fiscal policy has re-emerged due to the {{financial}} crisis of 2008 - 10 and the effect of the zero lower bound on monetary policy. New research has added new models and identification methods to the growing body of literature on fiscal multipliers. The motivation for the paper was to investigate the effects of fiscal policy shocks using a structural VAR. The main goal has been to estimate the spending and tax multipliers for Estonia. Estonia {{was one of the first}} countries to put forth austere fiscal consolidation measures in response to the aforementioned crisis. Thereafter, it has become a peculiar case study for critics and advocates of austerity, as it managed to grow its way through the financial crisis despite significant austerity measures. A major challenge when using a SVAR is the identification of fiscal policy shocks. Due to the simplicity of the method and the lack of narrative data on fiscal measures, I opted to estimate the SVAR using the Cholesky decomposition. The estimated multipliers are small in magnitude, same as mostly found in the literature based on the Blanchard-Perotti identification scheme. However, the signs of the estimates are reversed compared to the usual. Estimation results show positive spending shocks to be contractionary and positive tax shocks to be expansionary. These can be interpreted as negative fiscal multipliers, as found in papers such as Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) and Alesina and Ardagna (1998). This suggests that fiscal austerity could be expansionary in the Estonian economy. Another explanation for the results is the possibility that the the spending-savings decisions of the Estonian firms and consumers are consistent with Ricardian equivalence. Furthermore, the small sample size and the possibility of a misspecified model are other important aspect to keep in mind when interpreting the results. Thus, further investigation is warranted. The study could be extended in many different directions. For instance, one could attempt to estimate state-dependent multipliers, control for fiscal <b>foresight,</b> <b>test</b> different SVAR identification schemes, include monetary policy interactions with fiscal policy, and extending the research to a panel study covering all the Baltic States. The latter could perhaps offer a way out of the small sample size problem, considering the similarity of Estonian and other Baltic economies...|$|E

However, the average data are consistent with the behavior of a representative consumer. The estimation of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution shows that a rise in the interest rate has an important effect on consumption. Earlier findings using average cohort data are confirmed. ...|$|R

The model is estimated on various experimental data sets of repeated public good games involving different numbers of players. Our estimation results provide direct support for the proposed social ties mechanism, showing that the history of social interaction is an essential determinant of preferences. About a quarter of the subjects appear to be forward-looking. Both the within-sample and the out-of-sample predictive performance of the model turn out to be remarkably good, as it is able to track the often complex dynamic contribution patterns. This is true both for games played in pairs and in groups of four players, where the decision-making processes are much more complex. Moreover, we show that this model performs better than some other social preferences models that allow for a dynamic implementation. Our conclusion is that this simple, tractable, and psychologically grounded model of social preferences can account very well for dynamic behavioral patterns in repeated public good games...|$|R

Economists typically assume transactions occur with perfect information and <b>foresight.</b> As a <b>test</b> {{of the value}} of information, we estimate the effect of consumer knowledge of these benefits on their demand. Treating knowledge as endogenous in a two-part model of demand, we find that consumer knowledge has a substantial positive effect on the use of preventive services. Our findings suggest that strategies to educate the insured Medicare population about coverage of preventive services may have substantial social value.

40|$|Purpose – To {{specify what}} defines {{managerial}} foresight {{and to assess}} the association between managerial foresight and firm performance Methodology/Approach – First, previous research was reviewed and foresight was defined. Second, an instrument for measuring managerial foresight was developed. Third, an empirical case served as an illustration and as anassessment of validity. Fourth, managerial <b>foresight</b> was <b>tested</b> for association with firm performance. Findings – Foresight was specified as behavior with eight sub-components. A moderate and statistically significant positive relationship between managers’ foresight and firm performance was found. Research implications – The empirical evidence {{for the importance of}} managerial foresight provides a strong rationale for further studies. In distinguishing eight sub-components of foresight, and developing a managerial foresight measurement instrument, the dissertation makes relating foresight to various research fields possible, both on individual managerial andorganizational levels. Practical implications – Managers may consider whether foresight is important to them or to their organization. Managers, practical foresight tools, foresight programs et cetera, may now be assessed and compared in terms of foresight. Originality/Value – The dissertation provides empirical evidence of the importance of managerial foresight to firm performance. It conceives and advances foresight as a distinct construct. In developing and estimating aninstrument for measuring managerial foresight, the dissertation advancesforesight into a quantitatively measurable concept...|$|R

Employing daily data, the hypothesis that the actual yield spread is an unbiased predictor of the perfect <b>foresight</b> spread is <b>tested.</b> Additionally, Johansen's FIML procedure is used in order to explore the dynamic comovement of yields across the term structure and also test the parameter restrictions imposed by the EH. The empirical findings provide some evidence in favor of the EH. In particular, there is evidence that all yields share a common stochastic trend. Furthermore, at the margin, the EH restrictions imposed on the cointegration space are not rejected. On balance, one might conclude that the EH is not grossly at variance with the data. expectations hypothesis, interbank market, term structure of interest rates, yield spread,...|$|R
