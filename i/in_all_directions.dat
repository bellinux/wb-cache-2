5|$|The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, {{published}} in 1968, {{shows that in}} a given universe, if all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> (that is, they measure the background radiation to be isotropic), then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous Friedmann–Lemaître spacetime.

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced from the center. Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E

5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had stomach to renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E

King Richard took especial pains over the {{disposition}} of his army. The probable posts of greatest danger, at the front and especially {{the rear of the}} column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's shield volcanoes {{are built}} {{almost entirely of}} fluid lava flows. They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> from central summit vents and from groups of vents, {{building}} a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure vents instead of central vents, flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

5|$|Round Hill (sometimes spelt Roundhill) is {{an inner}} {{suburban}} area of Brighton, {{part of the}} coastal city of Brighton and Hove in England. The area contains a mix of privately owned and privately rented terraced housing, much {{of which has been}} converted for multiple occupancy, and small-scale commercial development. It was developed mostly in the late 19th century on an area of high land overlooking central Brighton, and with good views <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> the area became a desirable middle-class suburb—particularly the large terraced houses of Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road, and the exclusive Park Crescent—and within a few decades the whole of the hill had been built up with smaller terraces and some large villas.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions,</b> which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E

If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E

The preeminent naval powers, Great Britain and France, halted further construction of wooden-hulled ships, and others followed suit.

The use of a small number of very heavy guns, mounted so that they could fire <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> was first demonstrated by Monitor but soon became standard in warships of all types.

The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to set the stage for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mafic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of thin mafic lava flows on an eroded surface. Successive eruptions sent lava pouring <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>directions</b> from central vents, forming a broad, gently sloping volcano of flat, domical shape, with a profile much {{like that of a}} warrior's shield. Alkali basalts and ankaramites were the primary lavas produced during this stage of activity which, due to their low silica content, were able to travel great distances away from their source. These lavas also erupted from vents on the flanks of the volcano. Blocky 'a'a and ropy pāhoehoe flows characterized the fluid and effusive nature of volcanism at Level Mountain during the mafic shield-building stage.|$|E
