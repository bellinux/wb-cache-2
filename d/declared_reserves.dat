40|$|The {{combined}} fish collection databases of the Albany Museum and the J. L. B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology {{are used}} to identify hotspots of endemism and threatened fish distributions in South Africa. Hotspots of fish species richness occur in the north-eastern lowveld sectors of South Africa and along the ecotone between the tropical, subtropical and temperate faunal zones. Hotspots of endemic fish richness occur within both the tropical and temperate faunal regions, notably in the Olifants River system, Western Cape and in areas of high relief such as the Cape Fold Mountains, the Amatola-Winterberg (Eastern Cape), and the Drakensberg Escarpment (Kwazulul Natal-Eastern Transvaal). Threatened taxa are concentrated in the hotspots of endemic species richness which coincide largely with areas of major river conservation concern. There is limited scope for fish conservation within the ambit of formal (or informal) <b>declared</b> <b>reserves,</b> and {{the survival of the}} fauna depends on the success of river catchment conservation management. The value of museum collections in identifying areas of conservation concern for freshwater fishes is emphasized, and highlights the importance of well-preserved voucher specimens for biodiversity conservation...|$|E

40|$|On most {{developed}} coastlines, dunes backing ocean beaches {{constitute an}} urbanised landscape mosaic containing remnant pockets of small conservation areas. Urbanised beaches are also prime sites for domestic dogs, {{known to be}} environmentally harmful in many other settings. It is unknown, however, whether small, protected parcels of dune are adequate for biological conservation and whether dogs compromise their functional conservation objectives. Here we examine, for two small (2 km ocean boundary) reserves in Eastern Australia abutting an urban area, whether such small reserves can continue to function as effective conservation instruments on ocean beaches, using scavenger community composition and efficiency to assess ecosystem function. Two non-native species of canids—domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) —were ubiquitous and numerous inside conservation areas, {{to the point of}} having become the most abundant vertebrate scavengers at the beach-dune interface, outcompeting native scavengers for wave-cast carrion. Dogs and foxes have effectively supplanted raptors, normally abundant on non-urban beaches in the region, and other avian scavengers, as the principal consumers of animal carcasses both inside the <b>declared</b> <b>reserves</b> and at the urban beach. Whilst the ecological threats posed by foxes are widely and intensively addressed in Australia in the form of fox-control programs, dog controls are less common and stringent. Our data emphasize, however, that managing domestic dogs may be required to the same extent in order to maintain key forms and functions in coastal reserves situated close to urban areas...|$|E

If the supplier’s marginal cost curve is convex, then a unique equilibrium exists. Competitive Equilibrium; Electricity; Reserve Capacity; Simultaneous Equilibrium...|$|R
