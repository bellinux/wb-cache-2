40|$|ABSTRACT. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model {{contains}} a furrow irrigation component to simulate hydrology and erosion in irrigation furrows. It currently {{is the only}} multiple-event furrow erosion simulation model available for public use. However, the furrow irrigation component has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, we evaluated the WEPP model for furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> comparing predicted <b>infiltration,</b> runoff, and soil loss with field measurements from three southern Idaho studies on Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids). Baseline effective hydraulic conductivity, rill erodibility, and critical shear were calibrated using data measured from the upper quarter of two fields. Calibrated effective hydraulic conductivity was {{within the range of}} WEPP-defined values for Portneuf soil. Calibrated rill erodibility of 0. 0003 s m- 1 was almost two orders of magnitude less than the WEPP-defined value of 0. 02 s m- 1, while calibrated critical shear of 1. 2 Pa was about one-third of the WEPP-defined value of 3. 5 Pa. Predicted infiltration correlated poorly with measured infiltration for most fields. Regression coefficients for predicted versus measured infiltration ranged from- 0. 07 to 0. 35, indicating that predicted infiltration did not vary with measured infiltration. Predicted soil loss correlated well (R 2 = 0. 57) with measured soil loss from {{the upper end of the}} two fields used to calibrate erodibility parameters. At the field ends however; runoff was underpredicted and soil loss was overpredicted. When runoff was predicted reasonably well for an irrigation, cumulated predicted soil erosion across a field did not match cumulated measured erosion at field quarter segments because transport capacity was overpredicted. Deposition was not predicted unless runoff was greatly under-predicted. The WEPP model cannot be recommended for use with furrow irrigation until erodibility parameters and sediment transport are better defined for irrigation furrows...|$|R

Total gross margin risk resulting from production risk of alternative deficit irrigation practices was quantified using an irrigation simulation model and stochastic budgeting procedures. Results showed increasing production variability with increasing levels of deficit irrigation, especially when rainfall has significant potential to contribute to the production process. Risk-averse decision makers are more willingly to adopt deficit irrigation schedules for maize due to increased effective rainfall. The conclusion is that the potential to use rainfall more effectively through deficit irrigation is a key variable determining adoption of deficit <b>irrigation</b> strategies <b>by</b> risk-averse decision makers.
