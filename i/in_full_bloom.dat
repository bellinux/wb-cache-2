Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>bloom.</b> Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.|$|E
5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather. Prolonged periods of dryness can ruin cotton, wheat, and corn crops. While corn crops can be ruined by drought, their dried remains {{can be used as}} a cattle feed substitute in the form of silage. Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to ensure quality green forage and silage early in the spring on family farms in northern Croatia, through introducing winter cereals and Winter pea mixtures. For that purpose mixtures of Winter pea (cv. Maksimirski visoki) with triticale (cv. Clercal) were cut in the beginning of May, while the mixtures of Winter pea with wheat (cv. Sana and cv. Žitarka) were cut {{in the second half of}} May at family farms: Maletić (Ferdinandovac), Mirović (Višnjevac), Bazić (M. Trojstvo), Mlinar (Kapela Podravska), Mužinić (Križevćec) i Uher (Grabovac). The mixtures were used to feed dairy cows from the beginning of flowering till the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> of Winterpea. The green mass yields (GMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of pea flowering varied from 24. 0 to 52. 7 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures cut <b>in</b> the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> of Winter pea were from 46. 7 to 67. 5 t/ha. Average dry matter yields (DMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of flowering varied from 4. 05 to 12. 2 t/ha, while the DMY of mixtures cut <b>in</b> the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> of Winter pea were from 8. 98 to 18. 39 t/ha. All mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of flowering had drymatter content (DMC) from 19. 41 % while the DMC of mixtures cut <b>in</b> the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> of Winter pea were from 23. 56 %.

To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty, further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531BCE.

Startled and angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands up from his chair and finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company.

25|$|Post-production {{took place}} in Munich and {{required}} nine months to complete, concluding {{in the third quarter}} of 2006. Film editor Alex Berner was present at all the shooting locations and was on set with Tykwer. Berner also cut dailies as filming progressed which, according to Tykwer, saved a lot of time later. Tykwer said they had to work this way due to the film's tight schedule (the European release dates had already been locked). On every night of filming, Tykwer and Griebe would take screenshots from the dailies and make notes for the film laboratory on what sort of tone and palette they wanted, and the level of brightness and contrast they wanted for the prints. A digital intermediate was used for the film. About three months was spent grading the film. Digital grading tools were used to improve the color of the lavender fields because the film crew had arrived a week early and the flowers were not <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>bloom.</b> In the scene where Grenouille murders the plum girl, selective coloring was used to take the tone of the dead body's flesh from its natural color to a pale white color.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the influence of stage of growth at harvest on fermentative characteristics of Panicum maximum silage. The treatments were three different growth stages (early vegetative, boot and <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage) that were ensiled directly or wilted prior to ensiling. Directly ensiled and wilted forage material were mixed prior to ensiling with molasses at 12 and 8 kg/ton dry matter, respectively. Thereafter, each treatment was ensiled in 12 one litre glass jars (bottles). From each treatment, samples of the silage were taken from three bottles at 0, 7, 21 and 120 d post-ensiling for analysis of fermentative characteristics. Growth stage in directly cut silage {{had no effect on}} silage pH between days 0 and 21. In contrast, within the wilted groups, a lower pH was observed at day 7 when the plants were harvested at the boot stage than at an early vegetative or <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage. <b>In</b> both directly cut as well as prior wilted silage, a higher lactic acid concentration was recorded on day 7 in the boot stage silage compared to the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage silage, but on day 21 the boot stage had a lower lactic acid concentration than that of the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage silage. Growth stage had no effect on the acetic acid concentration on day 7. However, on days 21 and 120 the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage had a higher acetic acid concentration when the material was directly ensiled. In contrast, in prior wilted silage a higher acetic acid concentration was found in the early vegetative stage silage than <b>in</b> the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage silage at 120 days post-ensiling. Total nitrogen was lower <b>in</b> the <b>full</b> <b>bloom</b> stage silage than in the early vegetative and boot stage silages. A higher level of ammonia nitrogen was recorded at days 7 and 21 for the early vegetative stage silage as compared to the boot stage silage. A similar trend was revealed in the prior wilted groups between days 0 and 21. Harvesting at the boot growth stage consistently resulted in a good fermentation process with desirable fermentation end products (low pH and higher lactic acid concentration) up to a period of 21 days, but when compared at 120 days post-ensiling the differences between boot and bloom stages were not clearly observed in terms of fermentative attributes, probably due to the confounding effect of undesirable fermentation by entrobacteria or yeast.
