40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Bermudians are rightly {{concerned}} about the over-representation of young Black Bermudian men {{among those who have}} been incarcerated in Bermuda, especially because of drug trafficking and violent crime. Some are concerned that these young men are driven to these activities because they are “On the Wall, ” or idle. Labor economists describe a unique set of relationships among the various labor-market outcomes Bermudians may have in mind when they use this phrase. These outcomes include employment, unemployment, and labor force participation. This study uses micro-data from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing in Bermuda to measure these outcomes and put the concern about Black Bermudians males who may be “On the Wall ” under close scrutiny. It also examines differences in employment at low earnings (underemployment), since this may also reflect what Bermudians mean when they say that young Black Bermudian men are “On the Wall. ” Our examination shows that young Black Bermudian men have nearly the same <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratios</b> and pure non-labor force participation rates, the best proxy for being idle, as young White Bermudian men and Black Bermudian women.

40|$|The {{combination}} of very low unemployment rates and somewhat limited {{wage and salary}} pressures has called into question our ability to measure labor market tightness. One issue {{is the extent to}} which labor availability is understated, given the existence of people who are not actively looking for work but express interest in working. This note examines the evidence on discouraged and other marginally attached workers.; The author concludes that the number of discouraged and other marginally attached workers is extremely low, and their inclusion in an expanded measure of unemployment is unlikely to change the conclusion that the current jobless rate is the lowest in three decades. Marginally attached workers are more concentrated than the unemployed in demographic groups whose <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratios</b> are low. As a group, they are less likely to become employed or remain employed.

40|$|The {{decline in}} the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratios</b> {{for men and women}} over the period 2000 - 2007 prior to the Great Recession {{represents}} an historic turnaround in the evolution of U.

About half of men’s decline can be explained by declines in wage rates and by changes in nonlabor income and family structure influences, but the decline among women is more difficult to explain and requires distinguishing between married and unmarried women and those with and without children, who have each experienced quite different wage and employment trends. Neither taxes nor transfers appear likely to explain the employment declines, {{with the possible exception of}} the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Other influences such as the minimum wage or health factors do not appear to play a role, but increases in incarceration could have contributed to the decline among men.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine recent {{trends in the}} {{employment}} of older men and women. I also forecast likely future scenarios given different assumptions. The analysis concentrates on the UK, but international comparisons and contrasts are noted. More than half the population of women aged 50 - 59 years in the UK are currently employees or self-employed. With each successive cohort a larger proportion re-enter paid work, but they are remaining attached to the labour force for shorter periods. The overall employment-population rates for this age group and those in their 60 's has therefore been roughly constant for several decades. For men aged 55 - 64 years full-time employment was the norm in the UK throughout the 20 th Century until the late 1970 s. A sharp recession in the early 1980 s altered this and it is now a 5 : 50 chance whether a 60 year old man will have a job. Despite a second long recession in the early 1990 s the relative position for this age group has not worsened again to the same extent and slight increases in the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratios</b> for some older age groups can be detected. In this paper I therefore examine whether the shake out of older males in recent decades may in the long run show up as a more temporary phenomenon. This paper is about older workers and their transition from paid employment to retirement, buth is should not be thought of as concerning a special group or merely the current cohort. We may all be in this position one day. Some of us are there now, but {{most of the rest of}} us will come up to it soon. Therefore we should not view the transitions as simply affecting someone else. The consequences of the policies that lead to what we observe now are what we will inherent when our turn comes. We need, therefore, to think of sensible policies for second agers as well as those about to retire if we are to make a lasting impression on the areas of concern. It is on this wider context of present and future patterns of retirement that I concentrate in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{collective}} bargaining on the relative employment of youth, women, and older individuals. In a right-to-manage model of collective wagesetting, we show that unionization reduces employment more for worker groups with relatively elastic labor supply curves, such as youth, older individuals, and women. Intuitively, employment loss is less costly for those with good alternative time uses such as school (youth), home production (women, under a traditional division of labor) and retirement (older workers). We test this implication using data from 17 OECD countries over the 1960 - 96 period. Controlling for a standard set of labor market institutions, aggregate unemployment, and period and country effects, we find that time-varying indicators of union involvement in wage-setting decrease the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratio</b> of young and older individuals relative to the prime-aged, and of prime age women relative to prime age men.

40|$|Employing two {{widely used}} {{approaches}} {{to identify the}} effects of monetary policy, this paper explores the differential impact of policy on the labor market outcomes of teenagers, minorities, out-of-school youth, and less-skilled individuals. Evidence from recursive vector autoregressions and autoregressive distributed lag models that use information on the Federal Reserve's contractionary initiatives indicate that the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratio</b> of minorities is more sensitive to contractionary monetary policy than that of whites. The ratio falls primarily because {{of an increase in}} unemployment and not because of a decline in labor force participation. Monetary policy appears to have a disproportionate effect on the unemployment rate of teenagers, particularly African American teenagers. Their employment-population ratios fall because of increased difficulty in obtaining employment.

40|$|Excerpt] This article {{examines}} the behavior of New York City’s unemployment rate from several perspectives. The analysis begins by placing the unemployment rate {{and the growth of}} nonfarm jobs in their historical context. The aim is to identify other periods in which strong job growth coexisted with persistent high unemployment. Then the labor force participation rate and the <b>employment–population</b> <b>ratio</b> are examined to see if they shed light on the inertia in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate and the count of nonfarm jobs are based on two different surveys, of households and business establishments, respectively. The two surveys have different concepts of employment, making it difficult to infer that increases in nonfarm payroll jobs will translate into proportional increases in the number of employed city residents. However, an analysis of data from another household survey—the American Community Survey (ACS) —makes possible an examination of whether that survey’s patterns are similar to those in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) household survey. The article concludes with a comparison of movements in data from the two household surveys...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the long run}} total response among rich countries to differences in tax rates on labor income, payrolls and consumption. To guide our investigation, we develop a theory of time allocation and task assignment between market and nonmarket production sectors. The theory implies that higher tax rates reduce work time in the market sector, {{increase the size of}} the shadow economy, shift the industry mix of market activity, and alter the composition of labor demand so as to amplify negative effects on work hours and employment and concentrate those effects on the less skilled. In OLS regressions on rich-country samples in the mid 1990 s, a unit standard deviation tax rate difference of 12. 8 percentage points is associated with 122 fewer market work hours per adult per year, a 4. 9 percentage point reduction in the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratio</b> and an increase {{in the size of the}} shadow economy amounting to 3. 8 percent of GDP. A unit standard deviation difference also involves 20 to 30 percent lower employment and value added shares in retail trade, personal and household services and eating, drinking and lodging, confirming a key prediction of the theory.

40|$|Guided by {{a simple}} theory of task {{assignment}} and time allocation, we investigate the long run response to national differences in tax rates on labor income, payrolls and consumption.

We also describe conditions whereby cross-country OLS regressions yield consistent estimates of the total effect of taxes, inclusive of indirect effects that work through government spending responses to tax revenues. Regressions on rich-country samples in the mid 1990 s indicate that a unit standard deviation tax rate difference of 12. 8 percentage points leads to 122 fewer market work hours per adult per year, a drop of 4. 9 percentage points in the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratio,</b> and a rise in the shadow economy equal to 3. 8 percent of GDP.

40|$|Using {{data from}} 17 OECD {{countries}} over the 1960 - 96 period {{and a simple}} theoretical framework, we investigate the impact of institutions on the relative employment of youth, women, and older individuals. Theoretically, we show that union strategies meant to improve workers' income share imply larger disemployment effects when labor supply is more elastic. Hence, demographic groups with good alternative uses of their time [...] -youth, older individuals, and prime age women [...] -should be relatively less employed compared to prime age males in more unionized labor markets. We regress group specific employment and unemployment outcomes on a standard set of labor market institutions, aggregate unemployment, and period and country effects. This design allows us to control for unmeasured countryspecific factors that affect relative employment and unemployment. We find that more extensive involvement of unions in wage-setting decreases the <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratio</b> of young and older individuals relative to the prime-aged and of prime age women relative to prime age men. There is also evidence that unionization raises the unemployment rate {{of young men and}} prime age women compared to prime age men.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse income {{inequality}} for a sample of 14 European countries and their composite regions using data from the Cambridge Econometrics regional dataset from 1980 to 2009. The purpose of the paper is to provide insight into the dynamics of regional and national cohesion among the EU- 14 countries studied. Design/methodology/approach – Initially, inequality is decomposed using the Theil coefficient into between and within country inequality to assess the extent to which convergence has occurred. To investigate the underlying causes of the changes in inequality, the Theil coefficient is further decomposed to assess the contribution of productivity and <b>employment-population</b> <b>ratio</b> differentials to inequality. Findings – The results indicate that while between-country inequality has declined, within-country inequality has increased by approximately 50 percent. Subsequent decomposition indicates that while productivity levels among regions have converged, the employment-population ratios have diverged substantially driving increasing levels of inequality. This suggests that while EU cohesion policies have reduced productivity inequalities they have had little effect in stimulating convergence of employment-population ratios across regions. Research limitations/implications – The paper argues that national priorities, particularly in the context of the current European economic crisis, are likely to hinder European Union level policies to reduce income inequality at a regional level. This may result in further increases in regional inequality among European regions. Originality/value – This paper's main contribution is to highlight how national convergence can lead to regional divergence being overlooked. The value of the paper is that it provides policy insights, based on empirical evidence, for European cohesion policy. ...|$|E
