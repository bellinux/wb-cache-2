5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
25|$|The moral {{influence}} view can {{be combined}} {{with some of the}} other views of atonement. Indeed, Methodist theologian Vincent Taylor, while regarding the moral influence theory of atonement as inadequate by itself, described the moral influence theory as the 'truth' that is the 'presupposition of any worthy doctrine of the Atonement'. In the early centuries of the church, the moral influence view focused around the issue of how people can pass God's final judgment (namely through positive moral change). Some other atonement views, such as ransom from Satan, <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about final judgment and deal with other concerns. Such views can therefore be easily held in combination with the moral influence view.|$|E
500|$|On 8 January 1913, Tolkien {{travelled}} {{by train}} to Cheltenham and was {{met on the}} platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By {{the end of the}} day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was [...] "dreadfully upset at first", and the Field family was [...] "insulted and angry". [...] Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will {{be in a position to}} marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different." ...|$|E

60|$|In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at {{the first}} view very frightful to me, we saw {{two or three times}} little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> us, we <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them; we let them go.|$|R
500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of}} his death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E

2500|$|Reportedly {{outraged by}} Bush's {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence, on July 2, 2007, Wilson told CNN: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to Scooter Libby... I don't owe this administration. They owe {{my wife and}} my family an apology for having betrayed her. Scooter Libby is a traitor. Bush's action ... demonstrates that the White House is corrupt from top to bottom." [...] He reiterated this perspective on the commutation in the House Judiciary Committee hearing on July 11, 2007, vehemently protesting that a Republican congressman was engaging in [...] "yet a further smear of my wife's good name and my good name." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his release}} from prison, he moved to Miami Beach, Florida with his friend Meyer Lansky. They {{reportedly}} continued to make money through illegal activities, though they changed tack, focusing instead on stock market fraud, money laundering, and questionable real estate dealings. He frequently visited {{his family and friends}} in Minnesota and declared to a Minneapolis reporter in 1976 that he had recently turned down an offer to write his memoirs. He said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> really." [...] He died in Minneapolis' Mt. Sinai Hospital of heart disease in the summer of 1981. Rabbi Max Shapiro of Temple Israel recited the graveside services when Kid Cann was interred at the Adath Yeshurun Cemetery in Edina, Minnesota.|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
