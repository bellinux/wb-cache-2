5|$|C. J. gets emotionally {{involved}} in {{a story about the}} deadly assault on a homosexual youth.

5|$|He asked Guidon Games {{to publish}} it, but the 3-volume rule {{set in a}} labeled box was {{beyond the scope of}} the small publisher.

They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman army left Wallachia, Vlad offered Albert of Habsburg {{to set the}} burghers who {{had been}} {{captured}} at Sebeș free, but the king (who regarded them traitors) refused <b>his</b> <b>offer.</b> Vlad's attempts to maintain a balance between Hungary and the Ottomans made both the king and the sultan suspicious about his true intentions.

60|$|And now {{she knew}} that all that was false--false his sympathy, false <b>his</b> <b>offers</b> of friendship--his words were false, his hand-grasp false. Treachery lurked behind that kindly look in his eyes, and {{falsehood}} beneath his smile.|$|R
5|$|Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, {{a clumsy}} Gungan exiled {{from his home}} and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.

Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but <b>his</b> <b>offer</b> to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the play's run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed <b>his</b> <b>offer</b> {{to produce}} the play on Broadway.

Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms.|$|E

60|$|Mershone bit his lip. This {{fellow was}} not so simple, after all, boyish as he seemed. And, worse than all, he had a {{suspicion}} the youngster was baiting him, and secretly laughing at <b>his</b> <b>offers</b> of bribery.|$|R
5|$|Due to the unrelenting {{losses and}} stories of Greek atrocities in Tripolis, the Sultan became desperate and in 1824 {{he called on}} his Viceroy in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to aid him.

5|$|He {{was named}} {{manager of the}} team in 1905, but did not receive {{additional}} pay; he was, however, offered a bonus if the team didn't lose money. In 1905, Tenney tried to sign William Clarence Matthews, an African-American middle infielder from Harvard University, to a contract. Tenney later retracted <b>his</b> <b>offer</b> due to pressure from MLB players. Defensively, he led the majors in errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts for any position. Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record. For the second straight year, the Boston team lost more than 100 games.|$|E
