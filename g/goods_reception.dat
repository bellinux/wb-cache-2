40|$|Within today’s {{organizations}} {{there is}} continual development work {{to increase efficiency}} {{and the power to}} compete at the market. Production development with focus on continual improvements constitutes {{an important part of the}} daily work within a lot of organizations today. The purpose of this study is to contribute to a part of the development process that Volvo Penta factory in Vara has in mind. A description of the current situation was compiled by mapping the internal runnings and material flow throughout the factory. A new suggestion for a layout and a comparison with the current situation will assist with creating a factual basis for the development of a new <b>goods</b> <b>reception.</b> A study was made where the volumes and the quantity of the daily arrival goods were settled. Another study mapped the fork lift - and the moped traffic of the factory. The quantity and the volume of the material that was transported were also settled. The layout that was proposed was used during the comparison. The compilation of the description of the current situation showed that the fork lift truck constitute 40 % of the total number of runnings. Empty box running and empty running constitute 15 % and 45 % of the transportations respectively. The material-, empty box- and empty runnings of the moped are divided 40 %, 19 % and 41 %. The result of the comparison of the existing with the planned <b>goods</b> <b>reception</b> showed that the new solution would decrease the use of fork lift truck transportations by as much as 16 %. The equivalent rate for the moped runnings would be 3 %. The conclusion of the studies is that a new <b>goods</b> <b>reception,</b> placed close to the start point of the process, would make a contribution to a streamlining of the internal runnings in the factory. It was also established, by the layout flowchart, that the material- and the process flow would be more efficient. The aim of the project was achieved through the extensive studies that were made. All of the transport stretches can now be studied in depth according to which factors are seen to be most important. The study contains separate information from each driver. A closer review by each driver is therefore suggested during the continued work. The development of new transport stretches where coordinated runnings may decrease and empty runnings may decrease is possible in order to reach even greater efficiency...|$|E

30|$|Firstly, {{the third}} party {{logistics}} should be developed vigorously to promote the socialization and specialization level of logistics distribution, with an aim of improving the efficiency of logistics. Development of socialization and specialization of logistics can make the distribution of resources concentrated as a large-scale, lower unit distribution costs and improve the management efficiency. At present, our country’s {{third party logistics}} {{is still in its}} infancy with a small-scale and a low market share. It is recommended that advantage resources of various logistics enterprises should be integrated, and a large third-party logistics enterprises be established; the information platform of third party logistics should be used to integrate modules such as inventory management, shipping management, <b>goods</b> <b>reception</b> management, financial management, collection on delivery management, management on bank’s payment of salaries, data transmission, and business decision, providing the service of tracking the whole process of logistics. In addition, clients are provided with individualized service such as logistics plans, resolutions to problems, management on circulation processing, and supply chain to improve their satisfaction and loyalty. Moreover, through intensive operations, logistics distribution is improved and the scale of logistics distribution is enlarged to reduce logistics costs.|$|E

The cost level of home delivery service is also compared to the current costs of a household customer visiting a supermarket using his/her own car. In addition, the environmental effects of the different home delivery models are analysed. According to the results, home delivery transportation costs using the shared reception box concept are 55 - 66 % lower than those of the current standard home delivery model with attended reception and 2 -hour delivery time windows. This cost reduction alone justifies the two-to-five-year payback period of the investment required, even if there is only a fairly small number of deliveries per day. Compared similarly, using customer-specific reception boxes in home delivery operations leads to a cost reduction of 44 - 53 %. Because of the high investments involved in customer-specific reception boxes, the payback period, based on the cost savings, is 6 - 13 years. This requires customer involvement in investment. These results show that the most cost-efficient e-grocery home delivery model is based on unattended reception, which enables the optimal routing and scheduling of delivery vehicles. It would also be the best solution when considering the environmental aspects. Usage of e-grocery home delivery services offers a notable potential for traffic reduction when compared to the situation in which customers visit the shop using their own cars. In the selected test area, the reduction would be between 54 and 93 per cent, depending on the home delivery model used. However, the total traffic reduction and reduction of traffic emissions depends greatly on the e-grocery market share in the future. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|It {{has become}} a {{survival}} factor to have a constantly evolving business in order to handle today’s changing markets. The distributor role in the supply chain has evolved, leading to more pressure on cutting both costs and lead times. The usage of third party logistics providers has increased during the last decade. Companies outsource parts or entire activities to meet customer demands {{as well as to}} be able to focus on the company’s own core competence. Focus Nordic have an established partnership with a third party logistics provider that handles parts of the warehouse operations, in order to cope with current space issues at the central warehouse. Even though Focus Nordic outsource some of the storage to an external partner there are still other issues connected to the lack of space, for instance lack of picking locations, congestions, picking routes etc. Focus Nordic has considered the possibility of expanding the central warehouse to increase the capacity, thus enabling to store all goods at the central warehouse, excluding the external third party logistics provider from the structure. The purpose of this master thesis was to provide the company with a data foundation, comparing the current outsourced cost structure with a future in-house one. In addition to the cost comparison the study aims towards identifying areas of improvement within the current warehousing activities that could be further investigated during a potential expansion. To be able to investigate and reach the objectives of the study both quantitative and qualitative data have been gathered using a triangulation approach. This further means that multiple sources of information have been used in order to increase {{the reliability and validity of}} the study. The theoretical and empirical findings were combined in order to conduct the analysis and provide the company with answers to the main objectives. The results show that the total cost in a future structure would be decreased with an expansion of the required capacity of 600 m 2. The main differences in the new structure is that all cost categories related to the partnership would be decreased or cease to exist, except for the storage rent that would increase. An in-house solution would also require some initial material investments during the first period for new pallet locations. The second part of the analysis showed that ergonomics, <b>goods</b> <b>reception,</b> storage assignments and picking routes were all identified as clear areas of improvements that could be combined with an expansion in order to develop the future structure. However, to successfully improve these areas more than 600 m 2 would be needed, that would require further investments...|$|E
40|$|Schefenacker Vision Systems Australia (SVSA) in Lonsdale {{manufactures}} Passenger Vehicle Exterior & Interior Rear View Mirrors, Light Truck Rear Mirrors, Motor Mechanisms for Electric Motors and Door Handles. Schefenacker Lighting Systems Australia (SLSA) in Taree manufactures Tail Lamps, Turn Signals, High Mounted Stop Lamps, Interior Lighting and Small Lamps. Both {{of these}} divisions {{have their own}} laboratory where usage and environmental tests are performed on the product. The tests performed are comparable to normal usage of the product over ten years. SVSA, Lonsdale has expanded their testing in the last year. Testing of a new mirror family which is larger than earlier mirrors has resulted in investment of new test equipment and a split of the laboratory in May 2006 into two facilities. One new test laboratory area was created on Aldershot Road 500 m from the laboratory area on Sheriffs Road. To make the laboratory more effective an amalgamation of these two laboratories and the photometric laboratory in Taree is planned {{in the beginning of}} 2007. The aim for this project is to recommend one layout for a new amalgamated laboratory, planned with a view towards Lean Production. The new layout shall fit in an allotted area of 1006 m 2 in the warehouse on Aldershot Road, which belongs to SVSA, Lonsdale. The facilities that will be included in the amalgamation are the existing laboratory facility on Sheriffs Road and the additional laboratory facility already located on Aldershot Road, and the photometric facility from the test laboratory in Taree. The methods used for achieving the layout are Simplified Systematic Layout Planning, data collection, literature studies and benchmarking. Two detailed layouts were developed and evaluated. Layout 1 -room has one temperature controlled room located {{in the middle of the}} warehouse, with equipment for testing the performance. Layout 2 -open has two open areas, one for new planning of performance and durability, and one area for the durability test planned for the flow of the new mirror family already existing on Aldershot Road. The layouts include areas for reception, offices, employee rooms, <b>goods</b> <b>reception</b> and delivery, vibration room, sound room, dust room and the photometric laboratory from Taree. These two layouts were both adequate for the laboratory business and a final evaluation between theses two were necessary. The two layouts were very similar in function and the cost for investment and running becomes the knock-out factor. Layout 1 -room was most appropriate in all issues for the amalgamation and is the one recommended. Additionally a further recommendation is to install a well functional heating and cooling system and the purchase of work benches with adjustable height giving space for legs, knees and feet when standing work is performed.

40|$|Cities {{attract more}} and more {{residents}} from rural areas and small towns. This ongoing trend of urbanization means that large cities grow even larger and in pace with growth the city’s need for transportation of goods increase. Freight transport is necessary to keep the city alive, {{not only for the}} supply of goods but also for the disposal of waste. Freight transport creates problems in urban areas. Large, difficult to maneuver trucks move close to people strolling in the city center, which lead to an increased risk for accidents. The trucks also contribute to noise and air pollution, which results in a less healthy urban environment. The large amount of stakeholders in city logistics, such as pedestrians, the environment, distribution traffic and so on, contribute to the complexity that municipalities have to manage. This study aims at developing a proposal on how a municipality can contribute to streamline the distribution of goods in a large city (over 200000 residents) in such way that negative effects of transport can be reduced without inhibiting the economic development of the city. The research strategy of this study has been a case study, more specifically the “last mile” distribution. The data collection has partly been conducted through observations in the area surrounding Hötorgsfaret in Stockholm where the traffic to and from the underground loading/unloading area and the loading zones have been observed. Other than the observations, shorter interviews with drivers, store employees and car park attendants as well as longer interviews with representatives from road carriers have been carried out. During the time at the City of Stockholm, the writers have participated at several meetings, seminars and workshops to further expand their knowledge about city distribution. The research approach for the study has been abductive with a starting point in the theoretical areas, city logistics and <b>goods</b> <b>reception.</b> The study shows that the distributors of goods run in to a number of problems {{during the course of a}} day. The problems start as soon as the truck leaves the terminal or supplier. There are long traffic queues that make the drive into the city time consuming. Once in the city illegally parked cars create major problems for the distribution trucks. The primal problem is parked cars in the unloading zones, but cars parked to close to an intersection also create problems. Underground unloading areas have proven to be a good solution since the distribution trucks is able to escape the traffic, but even underground unloading areas has its problems. The main problem with these is that the headroom is to low, but other problems such as inadequate signage has emerged. To be able to contribute to streamlining the distribution of goods a municipality can use a number of different policy measures. These are divided into four categories: economic, knowledge-based, legal and societal policy measures. The study shows that municipalities, to contribute to a more efficient distribution of goods can review the possibility of delivering goods at night, consider giving commercial traffic access to the public transport lanes, make sure the parking control functions in a satisfactory manner, promote shared receptions of goods and underground unloading areas in new construction projects.
