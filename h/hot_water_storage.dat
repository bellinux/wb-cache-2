5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. <b>Hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power.

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} an {{attractive}} energy source among various renewable energy resources in Malaysia as relatively high solar radiation is available throughout the year. This solar energy can be utilized for air-conditioning by using solar-powered adsorption refrigeration cycle. Intermittent nature of the solar radiation leads to a challenge for continuous air-conditioning operation. In the present study, a combination of solar adsorption refrigeration system based on activated carbon-ammonia or activated carbon-methanol working pairs, and thermal storage is studied. Analytical calculation results show that activated carbon-methanol pair indicates higher coefficient of performance (COP) than activated carbon-ammonia pair, while adsorption chiller system with <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> thermal <b>storage</b> has higher COP than the system with ice thermal storage.

40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of IEA SHC Task 42 / ECES Annex 29, a simple tool for the economic evaluation of thermal energy storages has been developed and tested on various existing storages. On that account, the storage capacity costs (costs per installed storage capacity) of thermal energy storages have been evaluated via a Top-down and a Bottom-up approach. The Top-down approach follows {{the assumption that the}} costs of energy supplied by the storage should not exceed the costs of energy from the market. The maximum acceptable storage capacity costs depend on the interest rate assigned to the capital costs, the intended payback period of the user class (e. g. industry or building), the reference energy costs, and the annual number of storage cycles. The Bottom-up approach focuses on the realised storage capacity costs of existing storages. The economic evaluation via Top-down and Bottom-up approach is a valuable tool to make a rough estimate of the economic viability of an energy storage for a specific application. An important finding is that the annual number of storage cycles has the largest influence on the cost effectiveness. At present and with respect to the investigated storages, seasonal heat storage is only economical via large sensible <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storages.</b> Contrary, if the annual number of storage cycles is sufficiently high, all thermal energy storage technologies can become competitive...|$|R

This is particularly true at high latitude locations, where seasonal variations of solar radiation are significant, and in cold climates, where seasonally varying space heating loads dominate residential energy consumption. This review presents the principal methods available for seasonal storage of solar thermal energy. It concentrates on residential scale systems, and particularly those currently used in practice which mostly store energy in the form of sensible heat.

40|$|This thesis {{relates to}} the study of {{thermally}} stratified <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storages</b> used in district heating systems and is an extension of the doctoral theses of Jan Dahl and Roger Hermansson. The thermal performance of a stratified <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> is reduced by different phenomena such as heat transfer to the surroundings and mixing between <b>hot</b> and cold <b>water</b> during the charging of the tank. The study of the flow field in the storage tank gives a better understanding of these phenomena. The work described here is composed of two parts. The first concerns the development of a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique, described in Paper I, which can be used to measure the velocity field in a model <b>water</b> heat <b>storage.</b> Paper II presents a study of phenomena affecting the accuracy of the PTV technique. The inaccuracy of the velocity measurements due to the limited resolution of the video camera increases rapidly if the time-step between pictures is too small. The number of incorrect identifications is also an important factor for the determination of the time-step. A method of selecting the appropriate time-step has been proposed in Paper III. With the help of a procedure to remove incorrect identifications, a method for evaluation of the velocity field aimed at reducing errors caused by resolution inaccuracy and incorrect particle identifications has been developed. The second part of this thesis concerns studies of flow patterns in a model <b>water</b> heat <b>storage.</b> Using the PTV technique presented previously, the natural convection boundary layer has been observed and measured in Paper IV. Flow phenomena caused by heat losses to the surrounding are found to have an important effect {{on the nature of the}} gradient zone. The gravity current resulting from the inflow of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> in the tank filled with cold water has been studied in Paper V. A numerical simulation has been performed. The mixing has been quantified through an efficiency based on exergy. Phenomena leading to a loss of efficiency during the formation of the thermocline have been identified. The conditions of vortex formation at the edge of the inlet plate during the formation of the thermocline are investigated in Paper VI. A range of critical Richardson numbers, based on a comparison of experimental results, numerical simulation and theorietical analysis has been proposed. Godkänd; 1998; 20061123 (haneit...|$|R
