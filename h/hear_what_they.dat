5|$|While {{previous}} {{games in}} the series focus on defense attorneys, Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring. The game consists of investigation phases, in which the player investigates crime scenes in search for evidence, and rebuttal phases, in which they confront other characters, to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think has happened; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters' statements, {{to get closer to}} the truth.|$|E
500|$|Some {{of those}} Hope met in Morris' band were also {{interested}} in jazz. One, saxophonist Johnny Griffin, recalled a group of musicians, including Hope, who practiced and learned together in New York {{in the days of}} late-1940s bebop: [...] "We'd go to Monk's house in Harlem or to Elmo's house in the Bronx, we just did a lot of playing. I played piano a bit, too, so I could <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were all doing harmonically. But if something stumped me, I'd ask and Elmo would spell out harmonies. We'd play Dizzy 's tunes or Charlie Parker's." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} {{to have the}} player {{play the role of}} a nephew who had inherited a fortune from his aunt, to be spent only on the world's largest and most profitable theme park. The graphics were drawn and modelled using 3D Studio. Molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 bytes of memory, enough for them to have their own personality. The team travelled the world visiting theme parks and taking [...] notes, and sound effects were sampled from real parks. Molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible. There was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so the player could <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were saying, and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline. Multiplayer mode would have let players send thugs to other parks.|$|E

500|$|The studio's basic {{equipment}} consisted of [...] "two analog 24-track machines, a Studer A80, and a Studer A80 shell {{that had been}} modified by a local electronics wizard, with its own audio cards and transport controls". To record vocals a Neumann U47 tube microphone and a Decca compressor were used without equalization. All of Sos songs were made in a similar format. Gabriel would record a piano demo on a modified [...] "B machine" [...] and play this to the band. During rehearsals, the band would listen to the B machine through headphones and record their output onto the [...] "A machine"; parts of Gabriel's demo would also {{be transferred to the}} A machine at this stage. Subsequent takes of the song were then put onto the B machine in order for the band to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had played with the demo, as well as the song's new and old takes.|$|E
500|$|The Protoss are humanoids, [...] {{with two}} {{luminous}} eyes, typically gold, green, or blue. With two fingers {{flanked by two}} opposable thumbs on each hand, two large toes on each foot (four small toes in earlier games), digitigrade legs, broad chests and shoulders with narrow waists, Protoss are very agile and physically strong. A bony crest extends back from the crown of the head, with long neural strands sprouting {{from the back of}} the head. These strands facilitate the basic psychic communal link all Protoss naturally share. Each Protoss has a different skin shade that corresponds to the tribe from which they are descended. The Protoss do not possess any visible ears (but they can hear, as when Terrans speak to them or <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are thinking), mouths or noses, but are able to communicate telepathically and possess strong olfactory sensitivities. Protoss do not need to eat or drink, but are shown in The Dark Templar Saga to instead absorb energy from a form of photosynthesis. The average life expectancy for a Protoss is about one thousand years. Little is known of the internal anatomy of the Protoss.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were singing about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Georgiana's nephew once {{remarked that}} she thought of {{politics}} and [...] "nothing else", while her sister cared little for it. In 1838, Lady Carlisle articulated a negative opinion of Charles Dickens, who was then emerging as a successful author. [...] "I know there are such unfortunate beings as pickpockets and streetwalkers. I am very sorry for it and am very much shocked at their mode of life, but I own I do not much wish to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say to one another", she said. Historian Judith Lewis cites this opinion {{as evidence of the}} prevalence of class consciousness during the 19th-century, as Lady Carlisle was [...] "one of the more inoffensive of the grand dames of her time".|$|E
2500|$|Rose {{described}} the recording process as [...] "very solitary work" [...] that required {{her to do}} much research and preparation. She elaborated, [...] "I called people in New Orleans; I listened to their voices to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> sounded like. I {{did a lot of}} reading up on the city, and listened to a lot of music in the jazz era." [...] Rose gradually received the film's screenplay [...] "in pieces". During her first recording session, Rose read through and recorded the entire script in eight hours, describing the experience as [...] "exhausting, but wonderful." [...] She and co-star Bruno Campos, who provided the voice of Prince Naveen, recorded the majority of their dialogue separately.|$|E
2500|$|These circumstances, which {{applied to}} the enemy as well, don't explain the Castilian behaviour: the chronicles of both sides show that the Prince's battle kept {{increasing}} (making a [...] "gross battle"), because towards it moved many defeated and fugitives from the Royal Battle and also the Prince's men {{coming back from the}} enemy's chase, and even contingents of soldiers from [...] Toro, which crossed the battlefield to reinforce the Prince. Thus, if all these men could reach the Prince, the Castilians could do it too, especially because the two battles (the Portuguese and the Castilian) were so proximal that the men could listen to each other: [...] "(...) being so close to each other [...] that they could <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> talked about (...)" [...] (Garcia de Resende).|$|E

2500|$|On 16 August 1819 a {{crowd had}} {{assembled}} near Manchester {{to listen to}} a speech by Henry Hunt and was run down by the yeomanry cavalry, with fifteen dead as a result. Fitzwilliam's first reaction to [...] "Peterloo" [...] was cautious. He wrote on 24 August: [...] "I see they are making much of what has happened in Manchester, in London. No doubt much may be said against interfering with a legal meeting...but circumstances may arise to call for the intervention of the magistrates even on such occasions, and to be impartial, one must <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have to say for themselves". On 5 October Fitzwilliam wrote to Lady Ponsonby: [...] "If we do not set this matter to rights, the military are henceforward the governing power in the British Empire". At the county meeting of Yorkshire held on 14 October, Fitzwilliam was represented by his son Lord Milton, and it adopted the resolutions drafted by Fitzwilliam: the right to public assembly and condemnation of unlawful interference with it, and a demand for an inquiry into Peterloo. Fitzwilliam's objection, as he wrote on 17 October, was to: ...|$|E
