50|$|After {{the failure}} of their first assault on Sevastopol, the Axis opted to conduct siege warfare {{until the middle of}} 1942, at which point they {{attacked}} the encircled Soviet forces by land, sea, and air. On 2 June 1942, the Axis began this operation, codenamed Störfang (Sturgeon Catch). The Soviet Red Army and Black Sea Fleet held out for weeks under intense Axis bombardment. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) played a vital part in the siege. The Luftwaffe made up for a shortage of Axis artillery, providing highly <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> bombardment in support of the ground forces. Finally, on 4 July 1942, the remaining Soviet forces surrendered and the Axis seized the port. Both sides had suffered considerable losses during the siege and attack.|$|R

50|$|A World War II medium bomber unit, the 41st {{was cited}} for {{extraordinary}} heroism in {{action against the}} enemy Japanese forces during the Okinawa Campaign, from 4 April 1945 to 14 July 1945. Bearing the burden of land-based aircraft bombardment missions, the 41st Bombardment Group began the first sustained medium bombardment strikes against the main islands of Japan. It established its facilities and operated its aircraft under the most hazardous field conditions. Undeterred by either the constant rain during April and May or by heavy enemy artillery shelling and repeated day and night aerial bombing of the air strips, the unit succeeded in carrying out highly <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> operations against the enemy from Kyushu to the southern-most island of the Ryukyu Group, flying reconnaissance and search missions, escort missions, day and night bomber strikes.|$|R
40|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939 the only anti-aircraft guns available in the Union of South Africa were eight 3 -inch 20 -cwt guns. This fact not only points to the grave conditions under which the Union Defence Force was to defend its harbours and other strategically important installations, but is also indicative of the fact that a formal anti-aircraft organisation in pre-war times was virtually non-existant. The serious shortage of <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> defence is also emphasised {{by the fact that the}} above-mentioned guns and six searchlights (which accounted for all anti-aircraft equipment in the Union) were taken on charge by 1 Anti-Aircraft SA Artillery Brigade and despatched to East Africa shortly after hostilities started.

This recommended combat air patrols (CAP) which were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least 80 km from {{the main body of the}} fleet to provide earlier radar interception, and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers. This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets, though the U.S. Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat. A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed action bombs to make repairs more difficult.|$|R
5000|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{production was}} begun {{by the company}} in the 1930s and eventually monopolized all its resources. Perhaps the most notable design was the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, one of the Luftwaffe's most <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> weapons in the early-war period and continually used for bombing attacks {{as an integral part}} of the Blitzkrieg strategy. The Stuka was used both for precision tactical bombing and the strafing of enemy positions, acting as a sort of [...] "airborne artillery" [...] that was able to keep up with the fast-moving tanks and attack defended points long before traditional artillery could be brought into range. Later in the war it was fitted with two large-calibre, Bordkanone 3,7 37mm underwing autocannon and employed in a [...] "tank busting" [...] role against Soviet armour. It gained notoriety for its use at both Dunkirk and later Stalingrad, where it caused enormous destruction under Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen's VIII Air Corps.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{increase}} in gravity on the mechanics of running has been studied by using a force platform fixed to the floor of an aircraft undergoing flight profiles, resulting in a simulated gravity of 1. 3 g. The power spent to maintain the motion of the centre of mass of the body is similar to 1. 3 times greater than on Earth, due to a similar increase of both the power spent against gravity and to sustain the forward speed changes. This indicates that the average vertical displacement per unit distance and the average direction of the push are unchanged. The increase in power is mainly due to {{an increase in}} step frequency rather than to an increase in the work done at each step. The increase in step frequency in turn is mainly due to a decreased duration of the <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> phase (when the vertical force is less than body weight), rather than an increase in the stiffness of the bouncing system. The maximal speed where step frequency can match the resonant frequency of the bouncing system is increased by similar to 5 km h(- 1) at 1. 3 g. These results suggest a similar running mechanics at higher gravity, maintained at the expense of greater energy expenditure...|$|R
50|$|Chemical and {{cultural}} controls {{are the two}} most practiced ways of control. No commercial varieties resistant to B. squamosa have been reported so far. Cultural controls include avoiding cull piles and 2-3 years of rotation with non host (species other than Allium) plants. It is important to discard damaged and diseased onions at harvest. Dithiocarbamates have been identified as the most effective protectant fungicides.Weather forecasting is generally used to aid in limiting the number of sprays per cropping season.

40|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and large-scale genetic structure have been little studied in ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, despite the ecological and economic importance of EM symbioses. We coupled population genetics and phylogenetic approaches to understand spatial structure in fungal populations on a continental scale. Using nine microsatellite markers, we characterized gene flow among 16 {{populations of the}} widespread EM basidiomycete Laccaria amethystina over Europe (i. e. over 2900 km). We also widened our scope to two additional populations from Japan (104 km away) and compared them with European populations through microsatellite markers and multilocus phylogenies, using three nuclear genes (NAR, G 6 PD and ribosomal DNA) and two mitochondrial ribosomal genes. European L. amethystina populations displayed limited differentiation (average FST = 0. 041) and very weak isolation by distance (IBD). This panmictic European pattern may result from <b>effective</b> <b>aerial</b> dispersal of spores, high genetic diversity in populations and mutualistic interactions with multiple hosts that all facilitate migration. The multilocus phylogeny based on nuclear genes confirmed that Japanese and European specimens were closely related but clustered on a geographical basis. By using microsatellite markers, we found that Japanese populations were strongly differentiated from the European populations (FST = 0. 416), more than expected by extrapolating the European pattern of IBD. Population structure analyses clearly separated the populations into two clusters, i. e. European and Japanese clusters. We discuss the possibility of IBD in a continuous population (considering some evidence for a ring species over the Northern Hemisphere) vs. an allopatric speciation over Eurasia, making L. amethystina a promising model of intercontinental species for future studies...|$|R
5000|$|Mendip {{was set up}} as a C/D group {{transmitter}} when {{it entered}} service with analogue PAL transmissions. In July 2007, Ofcom confirmed that it would remain a C/D group transmitter at digital switchover. The mast broadcasts digital television over a large area of the west of England, including Somerset, Wiltshire, North Somerset, Bath and North-East Somerset, Bristol, South Gloucestershire, Southern Gloucestershire, Northern Dorset and East Devon. The station also covers the coastal areas of south east Wales, and {{in the days of}} analogue TV, many households used it in preference to their more local station, Wenvoe. This is because prior to the digital switchover, Mendip carried Channel 4 and Channel 5, whereas Wenvoe only carried S4C, which broadcast a lot of Welsh language programming. Power on analogue transmissions was 500 kW (erp) on channels 1 to 4 and 126 kW on Channel 5. The latter was transmitted outside of the original C/D grouping of the transmitter but most people in reasonable signal areas could receive it anyway, see <b>aerial</b> <b>gain</b> curves. All six digital multiplexes were transmitted at 10 kW until switchover in 2010 when the power on the [...] "BBC A", [...] "BBC B/HD" [...] and [...] "D3&4" [...] multiplexes was boosted to 100 kW. In 2011, SDN was boosted to 50 kW and in 2012 the remaining two Arqiva multiplexes will be boosted to 50 kW too. Mendip's population coverage is around 1.5 million, although some homes in the immediate vicinity, such as those in Cheddar are unable to receive a signal due to being {{in the shadow of the}} Mendip Hills and therefore have to depend on local relays.|$|R
