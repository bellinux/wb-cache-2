50|$|Ropes course advocates {{claim that}} they meet a number of educational, developmental, and {{recreational}} goals. High ropes course and climbing programs generally focus on personal achievements and ask participants to confront their personal fears and anxieties. Challenges may be physical and/or emotional. In certain cases, high element programs involve the development and mastery of technical skills to manage rope belay systems used to secure other climbers as they move through the course. In such cases, outcomes often include exploring the fundamentals of trust, craftsmanship, and coaching. Programs using low ropes course elements or group initiatives are most often designed to explore group interaction, problem-solving, and leadership.

This occupation leads to {{a way of life}} which is full of extremes and has unusually strong effects on the family. This study examines the effects of the occupation on the quality of family life and working life through a teamwork perspective. It is a study of the slow breakdown in cooperation among families and the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the work setting. The breakdown in family cooperation reduces the family’s ability to respond to its members’ needs for love, inclusion, and intimacy, and has important consequences for the quality of family life. The <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the work setting contributes to the creation of important social benefits such as trust, agreement, and a sense of inclusion. These social outcomes, and improved task performance, positively influence the quality of working life. Major themes include anthropology at home and among peers, family adaptations to occupational influences, the role of story-telling in building cooperation and commitment in teams, generosity and relaxed social accounting strategies in adult socialization, and the importance of extremes in evaluating the quality of working life.

Development of effective control strategies against these viruses requires their identification, characterization, and diagnosis. However, the study of plant viruses requires highly specialized facilities and techniques, which are not generally available in Zambia. A significant number of economically important plant viruses are yet to be identified and characterized. This will require acquisition of appropriate facilities, training of more plant virologists, and provision of adequate financial support. Meanwhile, <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> with well-equipped research institutions within and outside sub-Saharan Africa should further be explored to ensure effective plant virus research in Zambia.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} cooperative behaviors of small-world networking agents in a snowdrift game mode, where two agents (nodes) are connected with probability depending on their spatial Euclidean lattice distance in the power-law form controlled by an exponent α. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that the game dynamics crucially depends on the spatial topological structure of underlying networks with different values of the exponent α. Especially, in the distance-independent case of α= 0, the small-world connectivity pattern contributes to an <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> compared with that in regular lattices, even for the case of having a high cost-to-benefit ratio r. However, with the increment of α> 0, when r≥ 0. 4, the spatial distance-dependent small-world (SDSW) structure tends to inhibit the evolution of cooperation in the snowdrift game.

40|$|Individual {{heterogeneity}} in {{the reproductive}} rate {{is found to}} play an important role in the emergence and persistence of cooperation. Most of the existing literature focused mainly on the <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> by the introduction of inhomogeneous teaching capability of the individuals. It is far from clear how the heterogeneous learning ability of the individuals affects the evolution of cooperation. To fill this research gap, we make comparative studies of the evolutionary spatial prisoner's dilemma game with reduced learning or teaching ability of the players, under both synchronous and asynchronous strategy updating schemes. By carrying out extensive computer simulations, we show that cooperation can always be facilitated if the inhomogeneous teaching ability of the players is considered, irrespectively of the strategy updating manner. By contrast, cooperation is promoted (inhibited) in the case of synchronous (asynchronous) strategy updating, if heterogeneous learning ability is considered, which is attributed to the reduced ability of cooperators to expand their domains.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{mobility}} on the evolution of cooperation among mobile players, which imitate collective motion of biological flocks and interact with neighbors within a prescribed radius $R$. Adopting the prisoner's dilemma game and the snowdrift game as metaphors, we find that cooperation can be maintained and even enhanced for low velocities and small payoff parameters, when compared with the case that all agents do not move. But such <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> is largely determined by the value of $R$, and for modest values of $R$, there is an optimal value of velocity to induce the maximum cooperation level. Besides, we find that intermediate values of $R$ or initial population densities are most favorable for cooperation, when the velocity is fixed. Depending on the payoff parameters, the system can reach an absorbing state of cooperation when the snowdrift game is played. Our findings may help understanding the relations between individual mobility and cooperative behavior in social systems. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|When the {{interactions}} between cooperators (C) and defectors (D) can be partially avoided within a population, {{there may be an}} overall <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooperation.</b> One example of such screening mechanism occurs in the presence of risk-averse agents (loners, L) that are neutral towards others, i. e., both L and its opponent, whatever its strategy, receive the same payoff. Their presence in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game sustains the coexistence of cooperators and defectors far beyond the level attained in their absence. Another screening mechanism is a heterogeneous landscape obtained, for example, by site diluting the lattice. In this case, cooperation is enhanced with some fraction of such inactive, interaction-averse sites. By considering the interplay of both mechanisms, we show that there is an explosive increase in the range of densities, just above the percolation threshold, where neutrality is prevented and loners become extinct, the behavior reverting to the pure PD game. Interestingly, this occurs despite defectors being usually abundant in that region. This has to be compared with the corresponding loner-free region in the undiluted case that, besides being very small, is dominatedby cooperators. Comment: 8 page...|$|E
30|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} communication demands <b>enhancement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cooperation</b> at the multi-tier level {{to improve the}} end-user data rate. Cooperation among wireless systems has been demonstrated {{to be a better}} alternative for coexisting networks[1]. Contemporary novel wireless network concepts such as heterogeneous networks (HetNets) and multi-tier networks such as femtocells overlaid onto the macrocells require advanced management of the cell load, cross-tier interference, and user access to the spectrum. Spectrum sharing increases to the complexity of meeting the demand in wireless broadband access, thus prompting the emergence of these networks. This process requires the design of spectrum-sharing self-enforcing rules compatible with each individual system[2]. Considering the differences in the transmit power and the near-far problem in two-tier networks[3], our proposal contributes to the design of a coordinator between the two systems, which manages the cross-tier interference and enhances the ergodic sum rate capacity scaling.|$|R
