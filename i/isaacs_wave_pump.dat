This overwash, {{generated by the}} medium wave height swell occurring during this flooding, was able to lift the lake levels near the entrance, persistently over several tidal cycles, to well above the ocean water levels. The <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> model was used to model this flooding.

The extents of these two nodes were established from previous water surface measurements. While the qualitative flood behavior was reproduced by this remarkably simple model, the peak flood level was not satisfactorily predicted when using literature values for model turning parameters. One reason for this mismatch was that the <b>waves</b> <b>pumped</b> against a head including critical flow on the beach berm. Based on recent images of Lake Conjola wave overwash events, it may be concluded that pumping against critical flow is too harsh.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the numerical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) validation of a new pumping concept and the possibility for application of a further developed type, as an implantable ventricular assist device (VAD). The novel principle of the so-called progressive <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> {{is based on the}} interaction of an elastic membrane actuated by forced excitation with a surrounding fluid and the pump housing. By applying forced vibrations to one end of the membrane, a transversal wave builds up and progresses to the far end generating both a positive pressure gradient and flow rate. Among others, two axisymmetric geometrical configurations are possible, namely the discoidal and the tubular design. The first one has been built as a physical prototype and is experimentally investigated. In addition, a corresponding numerical FSI model is set up and validated against the experimental findings. Based on this validated numerical method, further numerical investigations are conducted focusing on the development of a tubular progressive <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> concept with regard to its potential for application as a VAD in the future. To address VAD-relevant issues such as size, hydraulic performance, and blood trauma, corresponding numerical simulations involving macroscopic blood trauma models have been performed.

40|$|Water {{level and}} current {{measurements}} from two virtually enclosed South Pacific atolls, Manihiki and Rakahanga, support a new lagoon flushing mechanism which {{is driven by}} waves and modulated by the ocean tide for virtually enclosed atolls. This is evident because the lagoon water level remains above the ocean at all tidal phases (i. e., ruling out tidal flushing) and because the average lagoon water level rises significantly during periods with large waves. Hence, we develop a model by which the lagoons are flushed by <b>waves</b> <b>pumping</b> of ocean water into the lagoon and gravity draining water from the lagoon over the reef rim. That is, the waves on the exposed side push water into the lagoon {{during most of the}} tidal cycle while water leaves the lagoon on the protected side for most of the tidal cycle. This wave-driven through flow flushing is shown to be more efficient than alternating tidal flushing with respect to water renewal. Improved water quality should therefore be sought through enhancement of the natural <b>wave</b> <b>pumping</b> rather than by blasting deep channels which would change the system to an alternating tide-driven one.

40|$|The lagoon {{flushing}} mechanisms {{were investigated}} for the South Pacific lagoon atolls of Manihiki and Rakahanga, {{located in the}} Cook Islands 2 ̆ 7 northern group. This investigation included two research trips to the larger atoll of Manihiki and, during the first visit there, Rakahanga {{was included in the}} field measurements. The key field measurements included for identifying the lagoon flushing process were: -centimetre accuracy water surface levels for [...] ocean [...] lagoon [...] inflow and outflow reef tops - decimetre per second accuracy currents for inflow and outflow reef tops The investigation revealed that the lagoon flushing is driven by ocean <b>waves</b> <b>pumping</b> water into the lagoon via those reef tops which face the larger waves. At the same time water will usually flow out {{on the other side of}} the atoll. The water level in the lagoon is above the ocean at any particular time and the magnitude of the overheight correlates closely with the height of the waves on the exposed side. Title page figure A illustrates this process with the resulting one-way flow transporting water volume through the lagoon. The quantitative field measurements are supported by visual observations of the water level on the inflow reef seen to be persistently above the lagoon while, at the outflow reef tops, the water passes through critical depth at the atoll edge. Additionally, two simple mathematical models developed during the investigation and tested against the field measurements support wave-driven flushing, modulated by the ocean tide. Finally, with no true deep reef pass, the <b>wave</b> <b>pumping</b> process explains the rapid rise in mean lagoon level that occurs as the wave conditions strengthen (second research trip measurements). This flushing mechanism in operation at both Manihiki and Rakahanga is qualitativly different to tidal flushing, which potentially can increase the mean lagoon water surface levels above the mean tidal level through non-linear feeding channel conveyances (from bed friction and cross sectional area variations) and rapid changes in storage surface area with water level (i. e. tidal flats in estuaries). However, these two processes are unable to lift the instantaneous lagoon water surface level above the ocean tide level, as measured at Manihiki and Rakahanga. Title page figure B shows qualitatively, the tidal flushing scenario if these lagoons were connected to the ocean via multiple deep and wide channels. The lagoon dynamics typical of tidal flushing are oscillating flow patterns; lower mean water surface levels; large water surface level variations; and water surface level variations are contained within the ocean tide variations. Using field measurements and several simplifying assumptions, the lagoon turn over time during average wave energy flux conditions is 50 days. The very best lagoon turn over time from tidal flushing using several very large reef passes is 62 days. With <b>wave</b> <b>pumping</b> being significantly more efficient at flushing the lagoon, flushing could be improved by increasing the reef top length. At Manihiki, this could be achieved by removing parts of the ancient reef situated along the southern coast where the reef crest currently is about 1. 5 m above mean sea level. The present reef edge should remain undisturbed so as to maintain the current present lagoon water level [see Callaghan et al., 2006 for details]. The <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> and tidal flushing processes are not mixable, as the connecting channels would short circuit the <b>wave</b> <b>pumped</b> inflow directly out to the ocean, similar to the coastal rip cell scenario. Hence, the persistent one-way flow pattern would not be established and flushing would be limited to near reef tops...|$|R

40|$|The {{convective}} {{cells are}} {{observed in the}} auroral ionosphere and they could {{play an important role}} in the nonlinear interaction of Alfvén waves and disrupt the kinetic Alfvén wave (KAW) turbulence. Zonal fields, which are analogous to convective cells, are generated by microturbulence and regulate microturbulence inside toroidally confined plasmas. It is important to understand the role of convective cells in the nonlinear interaction of KAW leading to perpendicular cascade of spectral energy. A nonlinear gyrokinetic particle simulation has been developed to study the perpendicular spectral cascade of kinetic Alfvén wave. However, convective cells were excluded in the study. In this thesis project, we have modified the formulation to implement the convective cells to study their role in the nonlinear interactions of KAW. This thesis contains detail description of the code formulation and convergence tests performed, and the simulation results on the role of convective cells in the nonlinear interactions of KAW. In the single KAW <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> simulations, we observed the <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> energy cascades to waves with shorter wavelengths, with three of them as dominant daughter waves. Convective cells are among those dominant daughter waves and they enhance the rate of energy transfer from <b>pump</b> to daughter <b>waves.</b> When zonal fields are present, the growth rates of the dominant daughter waves are doubled. The convective cell (zonal flow) of the zonal fields is shown to play a major role in the nonlinear wave interaction, while the linear zonal vector potential has little effects. The growth rates of the daughter waves linearly depends on the <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> amplitude and the square of perpendicular wavenumber. On the other hand, the growth rates do not depend on the parallel wavenumber in the limit where the parallel wavenumber is much smaller than the perpendicular wavenumber. The nonlinear wave interactions with various perpendicular wavenumbers are also studied in this work. When convective cells are excluded, the nonlinear wave interactions show exponential growth on the daughter waves, but at a rate about half of that of the wave interactions with convective cells. In the two <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> simulations, six daughter waves dominate in the energy cascade process, and three of them are convective cells. The growth rates of the daughter waves are doubled compared with the growth rates of the daughter waves generated in single KAW <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> simulation.

40|$|National Research Council Canada (NRC) is {{collaborating with}} College of the North Atlantic (CNA) {{to develop an}} ocean wave-driven pump to supply the CNA shore-based {{aquaculture}} centre in Lord's Cove, Newfoundland. NRC provides a combination of physical model testing under controlled laboratory conditions and computer simulation using numerical modelling tools developed at NRC and commercial software. The CNA plans to demonstrate the sustainability of a shore-based aquaculture centre {{in the context of}} rural Newfoundland. The efficiency of the centre depends in part on its energy consumption, a major part of which is supplying seawater to a facility some distance from the ocean and above sea level. The development of a seawater supply pump driven by the power of ocean waves would reduce the electrical costs for the centre. The NRC is supporting a staged design program through numerical and physical model testing to select a robust design optimized for the local sea conditions at the Lord's Cove mooring site. The <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> is inspired by designs for wave energy converters. But since wave energy converters have not converged on a single design, there are major risks and costs in designing a <b>wave</b> <b>pump,</b> from construction and testing of physical models for competing designs to mooring failure and potential loss of the device in the hurricane-force storms typical of southern Newfoundland. Using lessons learned in the energy sector, risks can be mitigated by systematically testing the behaviour and response of proposed concepts through a staged design program, starting from characterizing the hydrodynamic characteristics of a simplified model through progressively larger, more complex physical and numerical models used in functional tests. This approach systematically directs the design process toward a single prototype optimized for performance in specified wave conditions using scaled model tests in advance of the most costly stage of sea trials. The goals of the staged design program for the CNA wave-driven pump are to 2 ̆ 022 evaluate various design concepts 2 ̆ 022 select a design suited to the CNA mooring site 2 ̆ 022 optimize the design for a typical sea state and 2 ̆ 022 specify a mooring robust enough to keep the platform on station during the sometimes extreme sea states at Lord's Cove. The program began with characterization of the chosen mooring site outside Lord's Cove. Processed wave buoy data from this site informed the estimation of mooring line loads using numerical tools developed by NRC and typical sea states on which to focus design optimization. In the second stage, a numerical tool was developed to estimate pump output and validated against test results for a physical pump. In the third stage, various <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> platform design concepts were evaluated based on estimation of hydrodynamic characteristics. The designs were characterized using a combination of physical model tests in the NRC 200 -metre wave tank in St. John's and computer simulations using Ansys Aqwa and Matlab.

The high-frequency wave enhance the turbulence close to the jet exit, but the low-frequency waves are most effective further downstream...|$|R
50|$|The {{coherent}} {{generation of}} an optical frequency comb from a continuous <b>wave</b> <b>pump</b> laser {{is not a}} unique property of Kerr frequency combs. Optical frequency combs generated with cascaded optical modulators also possess this property. For certain application this property can be advantageous. For example, to stabilize the offset frequency of the Kerr frequency comb one can directly apply feedback to the pump laser frequency. In principle {{it is also possible}} to generate a Kerr frequency comb around a particular continuous wave laser in order to use the bandwidth of the frequency comb to determine the exact frequency of the continuous wave laser.|$|R

40|$|Results from {{plasma wave}} {{experiments}} in spacecraft give support to nonlinear interactions involving Langmuir waves, electromagnetic waves and ion-acoustic waves {{in association with}} type III solar radio bursts. In this paper we present a theory of the fundamental plasma emission of type-III solar radio bursts. Starting from the generalized Zakharov equations, considering the <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> {{as a pair of}} oppositely propagating Langmuir waves with di erent amplitudes, and the excitation of electromagnetic and induced Langmuir waves, we obtain a general dispersion relation for the coupled waves. We numerically solve the general dispersion relation using the <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> amplitude and plasma parameters as observed in the interplanetary medium. We compare our results with previous models. We find that the stability properties depend on the <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> numbers and on the ratio of wave amplitude between the forward and backward <b>pump</b> <b>wave.</b> The inclusion of a second <b>pump</b> <b>wave</b> allows the simultaneous generation of up and down converted electromagnetic waves. The presence of a second pump with di erent amplitude from the first one brings a region of convective instability not present when amplitudes are the same...|$|R
