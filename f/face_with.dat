5|$|During {{the episode}} Jack Donaghy {{inherits}} Argus, Don Geiss's beloved pet peacock. Throughout the episode, Argus {{can be seen}} at Jack's office in the 30 Rock building. An actual peacock was featured here. In one scene, Liz Lemon sees Argus and is frightened of him. While talking to Jack, Argus hits Liz across the <b>face</b> <b>with</b> his feathers, thus marking her as his mate. To accommodate this, puppeteers—Peter Linz, Noel MacNeal, and Carmen Osbahr—were brought in to hit Liz in the <b>face</b> <b>with</b> feathers instead of using the peacock itself.|$|E

The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd's scar, which later became synonymous with the character.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between school anxiety and academic achievement of students. This study analyzed the relationship between school anxiety and academic achievement in a sample of 520 Spanish students from 12 to 18 years (M = 15. 38, SD = 1. 95). Results revealed that students with high performance in Spanish language (language and literature) had significantly higher scores in anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment, anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> aggression, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. Similarly, students with high performance in mathematics had significantly higher scores in anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment, anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> aggression and behavioral anxiety. Furthermore, students with academic success scored significantly higher in anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. However, students with school failure had significantly higher scores on anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> social evaluation. Finally, anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment {{was a significant predictor of}} high achievement in Spanish language (language and literature) and mathematics, whereas anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> school failure and punishment and anxiety <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> social evaluation were significant predictors of overall academic success. Thus, the results indicate a higher academic performance of students who have certain fears school. These results could be used by teachers, school psychologists and clinical psychologists as an empirical basis to develop preventive and effective intervention of underachievement...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} how {{physical and social}} facial cues are integrated {{in the formation of}} face preferences. Here we show that expression differen-tially qualifies the strength of attractiveness preferences for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct and averted gaze. For judgments of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct gaze, attractiveness preferences were stronger for smiling faces than for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral ex-pressions. By contrast, for judgments of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> averted gaze, attractiveness preferences were stronger for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions than for smiling faces. Because expressions can differ in meaning depending on whether they are directed toward or away from oneself, it is only by integrating gaze direction, facial expression, and physical attractiveness that one can unambiguously identify the most attractive individuals who are likely to reciprocat...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} dimensional stability properties of oriented strandboard (OSB) panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> fire retardant treated (FRT) veneers. The beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) veneers {{were treated with}} monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), lime water (LW), and a borax/boric acid (BX/BA) (1 : 1) mixture. Dimensional stability tests were performed according to ASTM D- 1037. The results revealed that <b>facing</b> veneers impregnated <b>with</b> fire-retardant chemicals had significant effects on the linear expansion (LE) properties. The lowest LE value {{was obtained from the}} panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> MAP treated veneers, while the highest LE value was found in the panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> BX/BA treated veneers. The FRT treated veneer facing technique also affected the thickness swelling (TS) properties of the OSB panels. The panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> LW treated veneers had the highest TS, whereas the panels <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> MAP treated veneers had the lowest TS values...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that categorizing stimuli containing multi-dimensional information was better when the stimuli were schematic human faces than if they were either polygons or number matrices. It has also been shown that faces are perceived holistically, and that <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> organized inner features are detected more quickly than <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> unorganized inner features. This study used the speeded classification task and found that <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> organized inner features are perceived holistically whereas <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> unorganized inner features showed little evidence for holistic processing. These results suggest that information about organized faces is perceived very efficiently. The implications for using a face as a data display are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public <b>face,</b> <b>with</b> the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{sought to}} clarify {{the nature of the}} face {{processing}} strength commonly observed in individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) by comparing the face recognition ability of persons with WS to that of per-sons with autism and to healthy controls under three conditions: Upright <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions, upright <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> varying affective expressions, and inverted <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> neutral expressions. No differences were observed under the upright/neutral expression condition. However, the WS group was more accurate than the autism group when discriminating upright <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> varying affective expressions, whereas the opposite pattern emerged when discriminating in-verted faces. We interpret these differences as a reflection of the contrasting social features of the two syndromes...|$|R

5|$|Captivated by Hedren's Nordic looks, Hitchcock becomes {{infatuated}} with her. While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently shatterproof glass of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's <b>face</b> <b>with</b> splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E
5|$|Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 {{until his}} death in 814, {{expanded}} the Frankish kingdom into an empire that incorporated much of western and central Europe. He brought the Frankish state face to <b>face</b> <b>with</b> the Slavs to the northeast and the Avars and Slavs to the southeast of the Frankish empire. The Croats lived in Pannonian Croatia and Dalmatian Croatia (Littoral Croatia) to the southeast of the Frankish Empire.

50|$|The western hall, nicknamed Kristall (Crystal) is {{decorated}} with two rows of angular pylons <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> light gray marble. Large metal cornicles running along {{the base of the}} ceiling hide the illumination lamps. The walls are <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> bright marble and the floor with gray granite. The eastern hall is nicknamed Garmoshka (Garmon), because of its pylons (<b>faced</b> <b>with</b> yellowish marble) which look like a stretched accordion parallel to the length of the hall. The walls are <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a greyish marble and the floor with bright granite. Heritage of the station's original name, Ploshchad Nogina, can still be found midway in the transfer passage, where a bust of Viktor Nogin (sculptor Shlykov) still stands.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} makeup on {{attractiveness}} {{have been evaluated}} using mainly subjective measures. In this study, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from a total of 45 Japanese women (n = 23 and n = 22 for Experiment 1 and 2, respectively) to examine the neural processing of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> no makeup, light makeup, and heavy makeup. To have the participants look at each face carefully, an identity judgement task was used: {{they were asked to}} judge whether the two faces presented in succession were of the same person or not. The ERP waveforms in response to the first faces were analyzed. In two experiments with different stimulus probabilities, the amplitudes of N 170 and vertex positive potential (VPP) were smaller for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> light makeup than for <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> heavy makeup or no makeup. The P 1 amplitude did not differ between facial types. In a subsequent rating phase, <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> light makeup were rated as more attractive than <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> heavy makeup and no makeup. The results suggest that the processing fluency of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> light makeup {{is one of the reasons}} why light makeup is preferred to heavy makeup and no makeup in daily life...|$|R

5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a <b>face</b> <b>with</b> a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
