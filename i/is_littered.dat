5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz {{was the first}} one to sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|The {{tracks in}} Super Mario Kart {{are based on}} {{locations}} in Super Mario World such as Donut Plains. Each of the four cups contains five different tracks {{for a total of}} twenty unique tracks, additionally there are four unique Battle Mode courses. The course outlines are marked out by impassable barriers and feature a variety of bends ranging from sharp hairpins to wide curves which players can power slide around. Numerous obstacles themed from the Mario series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser's Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from Super Mario World in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks. Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks. Each single player track <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with coins and power up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed and jumps which launch the karts into the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy VII {{is mostly}} comparable to earlier Final Fantasy titles and Japanese role-playing games. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, {{and the battle}} screen. At its grandest scale, players explore the entire world of Final Fantasy VII on a 3D world map. The world map <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with representations of areas for the player to enter, including towns, environments, and ruins. Natural barrierssuch as mountains, deserts, and bodies of waterblock access by foot to some areas; as the game progresses, the player receives vehicles that help traverse these obstacles. Chocobos {{can be found in}} certain spots on the map, and if caught, can be ridden to areas inaccessible by foot or vehicle. In field mode, the player navigates fully scaled versions of the areas represented on the world map. For {{the first time in the}} Final Fantasy series, this mode is represented in three-dimensional space. The player can explore the environment, talk with characters, advance the story, and initiate event games in this mode. Event games are short minigames that use special control functions and are often tied into the story. While in field mode, the player may also find shops and inns. Shops provide an opportunity to buy and sell items that can aid Cloud and his party, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. If the characters rest at an inn, their hit points and mana points will be completely restored, along with any abnormalities contracted during battles.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Mega Man {{series on}} the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters. Each stage <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon. The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; the password will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage. In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armors to fight enemies. Ride Armors are bipedal tanks capable of powerful punches.|$|E
5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E

25|$|Some {{area of the}} fort, {{especially}} the eastern part, has been refurbished into a park. The interior of the fort is now used by the local army garrison and boarding house for the local police families, which means the interior was not very well-maintained and the ground <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with rubbish. Other government offices also set inside the fort.|$|E
25|$|The whale {{population}} in the seas around the island was substantially reduced over the following sixty years until the station closed in December 1966, by which time the whale stocks were so low that their continued exploitation was unviable.

25|$|The Big Scott Mountain {{formation}} {{consists of}} rhyolite of variable composition, lapilli-tuff, and crystal tuff. Most of the rhyolites {{are characterized by}} large amounts of pyroxene. One rhyolite unit appears to overlie the McDougall Brook Granite formation. The tuff <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> by clasts from the Seelys and McDougall Brook Granite formations. The tuff {{also appears to be}} layered. It is colored dark orange on the map, and the exposed part partially rings the north of the volcano.|$|E
25|$|The biographical {{tradition}} <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with apocryphal {{tales about}} Bodhidharma's life and circumstances. In {{one version of}} the story, {{he is said to}} have fallen asleep seven years into his nine years of wall-gazing. Becoming angry with himself, he cut off his eyelids to prevent it from happening again. According to the legend, as his eyelids hit the floor the first tea plants sprang up, and thereafter tea would provide a stimulant to help keep students of Chan awake during zazen.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, {{the head}} of urban {{planning}} in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim {{was to create a}} harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the great depression in 1929. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the Vedado district (begun in 1859). This whole neighborhood <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with set back well-proportioned buildings.|$|E

25|$|The Carrow {{formation}} is a predominantly fine-grained redbed (consisting of typically red sedimentary rocks) unit {{that has a}} grade ranging from pebbles and cobble in conglomerate at the base to mudstone laced with calcrete at the top. The flow <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with abundant flows from the Seelys (in the intercaldera sequence) and Rothea (earlier) formation towards the southeast, but in the north metasedimentary rocks, which are sedimentary rocks exhibiting metamorphosis, predominate. The {{lower part of the}} formation consists of unwelded and highly compacted lapilli tuff with abundant amounts of pumice fragments. A basalt and basalt-clad mudflow occurs near the top if the formation in some places. A dated locality {{from the top of the}} formation has been dated to the Late Devonian, around 350 million years ago. The exposed part of the formation forms a long band around the South Oromocto Andesite formation, and is colored brown on the map.|$|E
25|$|The Southwest <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> {{with the}} archaeological remains of efforts by Indian {{societies}} {{to overcome the}} severe environmental challenges to agriculture throughout the region. The Ancestral Puebloan centers of Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde were abandoned in the 12th and 13th centuries CE, probably because of drought. After a thousand years of success, the complex Hohokam society disappeared in the 15th century CE and became the smaller-scale Pima culture of historic times. However, many Indian agricultural societies have been extremely durable. The Rio Grande Pueblos, the Hopi, and the Zuni have survived {{to the present day}} while retaining much of their traditional culture. Many of the Mexican Indians have been integrated into a mestizo society, but the Yaqui and Mayo still retain their identities and part of their traditional lands. The once numerous Opata have disappeared as a distinct people but their descendants still occupy the valleys of the Sonora River and its tributaries.|$|E
25|$|Devil's Den State Park {{protects the}} largest {{sandstone}} crevice {{area in the}} United States. The park is in the Lee Creek Valley. The valley <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with numerous sandstone caves, bluffs, ravines, rock shelters and crevices that provided an excellent hiding place for outlaws on the Butterfield Stage Line from 1858 {{until the beginning of}} the American Civil War in 1861. With the onset of the war the rocky area was used by bands of Confederate guerillas as a hide out and staging area for conducting raids on the Union Army's supply lines as well as civilian targets. The roads of the Butterfield State Line were also used by regular troops during the Civil War. Confederate and Union forces used the road during the Battle of Prairie Grove and for the Raid on Van Buren. The former town of Anna is contained within the park. It was destroyed by a flood in 1893. All that remains of the town is a cemetery, a well, and some foundations. The remnants of Anna can be seen along the Butterfield Hiking Trail near Junction Camp.|$|E

500|$|The Fifth Symphony has two {{movements}} {{instead of}} the usual four, which is the only time Nielsen used this structure. Nielsen explained jokingly in an interview that it was not difficult to write the first three movements of a symphony but by the finale most composers had run out of ideas. The work has a craggy profile as [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with false climaxes at every turn". In summary, the first movement is a battle between the orchestra and a renegade snare-drummer, who can only be silenced by the full forces of his colleagues in the final bars. The second movement continues the struggle with shivers of anxiety, building through repetitions and detours to the final victorious grand explosion.|$|E
500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent {{gave the}} album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "Williams' albums have {{increasingly}} come to focus upon the singer himself, which has consequently made them {{less and less}} appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five. She said that [...] "Reality Killed the Video Star <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with references to his fall from grace, most of which hinge {{on the premise that}} someone or something else is truly responsible for his diminishing popularity." [...] Swash said that [...] "If there's a theme here it's not obvious, but it turns out Williams can be quite interesting when he moves off the topic of himself." [...] Swash concluded that the album swings between [...] "mawkish strings and piano overproduction" [...] and [...] "flashes of genuine pop frivolity".|$|E
500|$|The synergy between Taylor Street’s Little Italy and the Hull House complex; i.e., the {{settlement}} {{house and its}} summer camp, the Bowen Country Club, is well documented. [...] Alice Hamilton, medical professional and early member of that elite Hull House hierarchy, wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Those Italian women knew what a baby needed, far better than my Ann Arbor professors did." [...] The ancillary literature between, among and about members of Hull House's inner sanctum of sociologists and philanthropists <b>is</b> <b>littered</b> with such comments, reinforcing the relationship that existed between Taylor Street's Little Italy and Hull House. [...] A review of the ethnic composition of those who registered for and utilized the services provided by the Hull House complex, during its 74 years as a tenant of the near-west side, suggests an ethnic bias. Of the 257 known WWII veterans who were alumni of the Bowen Country Club, [...] "virtually all had a vowel {{at the end of}} their names...denoting their Italian heritage." ...|$|E
