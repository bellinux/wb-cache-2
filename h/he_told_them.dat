5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|Later on in 2012, Feeder took on {{one last}} tour for the year. The tour lasted for five dates {{starting}} at the O2 Academy Glasgow, before ending at the Brixton Academy in November. At the Brixton show, Grant Nicholas announced that the band would be going away for a while, before deciding what to do next. Earlier on before the tour began, Nicholas was interviewed by website Mancunian Matters in which <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that the band would take a break next year with no shows planned, although a follow-up album was mentioned alongside possible side-projects.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, {{a friend who had}} worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> he believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E

5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} the riot. He had spent time in a {{residential}} school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks, though <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> he had first arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot, according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Jane Pierce died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album and told the band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E

6000|$|... "Didn't I {{tell you}} the rest? I declare for't, I don't believe I did; I be'n so put about. Well, as we was drivin' up to the depot, we met the same two young men, and the captain asked 'em, 'Are you goin' or not a-goin'?'--just that way; and they said, 'We're goin'.' And he said, 'When you comin' aboard?' and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>he</b> was goin' to haul out this mornin' at three o'clock. And they asked what tug, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em,</b> and they fixed it up between 'em all then that they was to come aboard from the tug, when she'd got the ship outside; and that's what I suppose they did. The captain {{he said to me}} he hadn't {{mentioned}} it before, because he wa'n't sure't they'd go till that minute. He give 'em a first-rate of a character." ...|$|R
25|$|Narbona {{held back}} his forces, who were hidden {{on both sides}} of the defile. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that when the time was right, and not before, they would cut the long file of men into small pieces, like cutting a long tree trunk into firewood.|$|E
25|$|Yuengling will {{transfer}} {{at least}} 51% {{control of the}} company in the future to either of his daughters that are currently executives Jennifer or Wendy, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> which one privately but not publicly.

25|$|Columbus timed {{the eclipse}} with his hourglass, and {{shortly before the}} totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened {{indigenous}} people {{that they were going}} to be forgiven.

50|$|Stanford's {{situation}} deteriorates as {{his father}} continues {{to distance himself from}} home, his grandmother becomes senile and moves to a dead retirement home, Millicent tortures him in their study sessions, and his lie to his friends becomes harder and harder to cover up - because <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>he</b> passed English with flying colors.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Walker {{was nearly}} as pleased as wot 'e was, and the fuss they made of the old gentleman was sinful a'most.

25|$|On February 27, after a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February {{during which the}} Senators won only 7 of 21 games, Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low, taking over the coaching duties himself. Both Low and Paddock were offered other jobs within the organization. Murray said <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to call him in a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that they}} did not need to find {{corroboration}} of Price's testimony. If they believed her, that was enough to convict. Judge Callahan said he was giving them two forms - one for conviction and one for acquittal, but he supplied the jury with only a form to convict. He supplied them with an acquittal form only after the prosecution, fearing reversible error, urged him do so.|$|E
25|$|Josef Fritzl told Elisabeth and {{the three}} who {{remained}} (Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix) {{that they would be}} gassed if they tried to escape. Investigators concluded that this was just an empty threat to frighten the captives; there was no gas supply to the basement. He stated after his arrest that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that they would receive an electric shock and die if they meddled with the cellar door.|$|E
500|$|Back in the present, Frohike tells Mulder and Scully {{that what}} <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{is based on}} a story he found in a {{magazine}} he subscribes to.

However, he decides not to kill him and quotes the last line from his unpublished novel: [...] "I can kill you whenever I please, but not today".|$|R

25|$|Robertson later {{claimed that}} he {{attended}} the Calais Conference thinking it would be solely about railways, but this is probably untrue. Robertson was at the War Cabinet (20 February) – <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that Haig and Nivelle were in complete agreement – which insisted on a conference {{to draw up a}} formal agreement about “the operations of 1917”, and Robertson wrote to Haig (24 February) informing him of this.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{eventually}} {{turned into}} a villain once more by betraying the fans. This happened when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> of how he was {{sick and tired of}} pleasing them with his dancing and how it was just a waste of his time on an episode of Raw following the , only to be squashed by Rhyno immediately thereafter, thus turning Rhyno into a face once again.

25|$|According to his Department of Defense Detainee Assessment, it is {{believed}} that he traveled in Mecca in 2001 where he met Abu Walid al-Makki who began {{to talk to him about}} Islam and jihad. Al-Makki introduced him to Muhammad al-Saudi al-Harabi who was his contact for joining the jihad in Afghanistan. Because he believed that his family would not support his participation in jihad <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that he would be traveling to Pakistan to memorize the Koran.|$|E

He also testified that Brian sold public domain versions to Iraq and Jordan.|$|E
25|$|Anzhel Vagenshtain {{was their}} {{discoverer}} for the cinema. After reading their feuilletons in Starshel, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that they should}} write a comedy.

The then-fashionable Bulgarian singer Liana Antonova and the East German film star Manfred Krug appeared in the film. The music was by Bulgarian composer Petar Stupel.|$|E
25|$|When Grossman signed Janis Joplin and {{her four}} bandmates from Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1967, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{he would not}} {{tolerate}} any intravenous drug use, and all five agreed {{to abide by the}} rule. When he discovered, in the spring of 1969, that Joplin was injecting drugs anyway, he did not confront her. Instead, in June 1969 he took out a life insurance policy guaranteeing him $200,000 in the event she died in an accident. His yearly premium was $3,500.|$|E
