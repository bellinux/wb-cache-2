40|$|In {{this paper}} I wish {{to examine how}} changes have {{occurred}} in the processes of <b>gendered</b> <b>identity</b> construction amongst Mexican youths through examining local experiences of global, and specifically Mexican, modernities. Based on f eldwork carried out amongst youths in the city of San Cristobal de las Casas, in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, my analysis addresses how youths plan for the future in the context of economic and political marginalisation, and how this affects {{the way in which they}} pursue different forms of romantic relationships. I also address changes that have occurred in youths’ understandings, perceptions and performances of their <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> in the context of a highly developed local tourist industry, the advent of mass media, and new online social worlds. My study shows how <b>gendered</b> <b>identity</b> construction amongst youths here becomes context-dependent, and how it encompasses individual agency whilst at the same time being negotiated through wider structural and social limitations. I also wish to demonstrate how changing <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> amongst youths are constantly constructed and renegotiated by individuals seeking to accommodate notions of modernity with perceptions of the traditional, and how these individuals balance contesting notions of <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> within themselves. This is, therefore, a study of local and <b>gendered</b> <b>identity</b> change amongst youths in the context of localised modernities and rapid social change. " (author's abstract...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, the queercore {{movement}} developed {{around a}} number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, Pansy Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, <b>gender</b> <b>identity,</b> and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.|$|E

5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, cultural, and social factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and <b>gender</b> <b>identity,</b> showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care.

40|$|On the 50 th {{anniversary of}} the ISSA and IRSS, {{one of the leading}} Spanish {{scholars}} on gender and sport, Montserrat Martín, considers research on how entrenched <b>gender</b> <b>identities</b> empower males and marginalize females. In assessing the trajectory of research, it is noted that work in the sociology of sport has challenged and facilitated change in understanding <b>gender</b> <b>identities</b> with emphasis on both the “multiplicities of difference” and on “shared affinities” in the construction of gender. A continuing challenge has been to get past entrenched gender binaries; it is suggested that more sophisticated intersectional understandings, about men–women, gay–straight, people of colour and not, are needed, not only to blur boundaries, but in the process to reinvent understandings about our <b>gendered</b> <b>identities.</b> A key challenge for the future is to provide examples and analysis through which it is possible to show how sport, instead of reproducing the inertia and stability of social <b>gender</b> <b>identities,</b> blurs the borders and hierarchies between and within each of them...|$|R

A simple typology is derived from the articles which assists in revealing a remarkable degree of consistency in the portrayal of <b>gender</b> <b>identities</b> over time.

The implications of this are highlighted and suggestions made for research with the consumers of these media products...|$|R

This space, both marital and familial, compels us to reconfigure our conceptualization of masculinities and femininities, gender relations, and <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> in general. However, menâ€™s temporary or permanent return migration results in return masculinities being forced to accept the changes provoked by their absence and in the process transforming gender relations and <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> into more democratic spaces of interaction. The transformation of these gender relations and <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> also triggers changes in the marriage institution as spouses begin to see and interact with each other as partners and equals. In addition, the changes witnessed in gender relations and <b>gendered</b> <b>identities</b> result in the production of a tolerant masculinity that is adaptive, flexible, and reflexive...|$|R
