The first two papers describe the complex web of protections available to users of four popular electronic payment mechanisms: credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, and ACH <b>e-checks.</b> This third paper considers how protections related to fraud, error, and disputes affect market participants. The paper concludes that (i) the current protection mechanisms {{make it more difficult to}} encourage the adoption of fraud-reduction schemes, (ii) the current protections represent a significant cost to banks, merchants, processors, and consumers, and (iii) the present federal system of protection, while encouraging innovation and thoughtful regulation, leads to consumer confusion.

As a result, the project was completed in four months. The bridge remained open to one lane of traffic throughout the construction.Effective January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2014, INDOT adopted an {{electronic toll collection system}} for the bridge, with users being required to obtain a transponder in order to legally use the bridge. The automated toll collection system, called Wabash Pass, cost $900,000. Tolls were 50 cents for cars, 30 cents for motorcycles or bicycles, and $1.70 for six-axle trucks. The last toll increase was in 1984. Customers pre-paid their tolls on-line or over the telephone using an <b>e-check,</b> debit card or credit card. Each driver had to have a windshield decal that contained a transponder circuit associated with the driver's account. Over 7,000 of the ISO 18000 6C sticker tag transponders from Federal Signal/Sirit were issued.|$|E

The third paper will discuss broader industry and policy implications of the authors’ findings. Consumer protection; Stored-value cards...|$|R
40|$|Computer Aided Design (CAD) {{has become}} the {{standard}} practice for engineering work, particularly in design of architecture and structural engineering. Many CAD software tools are available in different engineering disciplines to achieve various design objectives. Indeed, the use of CAD tools can improve designers' efficiency, thus raise their productivity. With the rapid advance in IT and Web technologies, there is a stringent demand, from the AEC (Architecture-Engineering-Construction) industry, for more effective coordination in design processes and design collaborations. Such a demand has driven the advances in CAD systems from single to multi-taskings, from fragmentation to system integration, and from a single user to multi-user web-based environments. Information modelling {{is critical to the}} development of a new generation of CAD systems to represent knowledge, exchange data, and integrate CAD tools. In this thesis, two information models - process model and building product models for structural engineering applications have been developed. The main challenges in the present development are to specify a process and building product models for design of building structure, and to explore model-based applications. In the process modelling, an initiative process model for structural design is proposed by reengineering the traditional structural design process. In the product modelling, a building product data model, which is primarily a SEC (Structural Engineering Class) object model, is specified by employing use case-driven object-modelling approach. Implementation approaches of the proposed object model are also addressed. To promote the application of the proposed information models, the research in this thesis is extended to explore a new generation of CAD information systems, such as computer-integrated structural design, web-based structural data model server and online checking (<b>e-checking)</b> systems. All the aforementioned systems make use of generic information models as the basis for the further development. Based on the proposed process and product models, TBCAD II is developed as a prototype system for the computer-integrated structural design of tall buildings. In TBCAD II, the proposed process model and SEC-object model, as well as the component technology are utilised to provide a common software platform for integrating structural engineering CAD tools. A practical example is presented to demonstrate the functional capability of TBCAD II for structural design of tall buildings. Furthermore, a web-based structural data model server is developed, which allows for data sharing and model translation via Internet. Finally, the framework of an online code-compliance checking system is proposed to conduct automated check for structural design plans...|$|R
40|$|Background Reticulocytes are {{the most}} {{sensitive}} index available to authorities who seek to sanction athletes for blood doping based on deviations beyond individual reference ranges. Because such data comprise longitudinal results that are generated by different laboratories, the comparability of reticulocyte counts from different instruments is of crucial importance. Aims To enhance between-instrument comparability of reticulocyte counts reported by the Sysmex XT- 2000 i automated haematology analyser. Methods We optimised recalibration of instruments towards assigned values of control material (<b>e-CHECK)</b> in tandem with fresh blood verification. Results In terms of reticulocyte counts reported {{as a percentage of}} all cells in a fresh blood sample, it was possible to recalibrate all three test instruments so that the mean of 10 samples was within 0. 1 % of the comparative instrument’s mean value. Conclusions This approach provides a straightforward means of reducing between-instrument differences in reticulocyte counts generated by the Sysmex XT- 2000 i...|$|E
40|$|Diverse {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to assure the analytical quality of automated hematology; as such, there is great variation in their error detection capabilities. We summarize the intralaboratory performance of a cohort of Sysmex XE- 2100 ’s running <b>e-Check</b> hematology quality control (QC). The imprecisions of a median performing (50 th percentile imprecision) and more imprecise [15 th percentile (15 P) imprecision] Sysmex XE- 2100 are compared with measures of total allowable error (regulatory and physiologically based) to obtain multiples of the usual imprecision that must be detected to prevent the hematology analyzer from producing medically unacceptable results. The resultant large multiples of the usual imprecision (s) demonstrate the need for insensitive QC rules employing very broad control ranges, control rules that have been implicitly supported by hematology analyzer manufacturers for the last several decades. For today’s highly precise hematology analyzers, the following control rules are strongly advised: 13. 5 s, 14 s and 14. 5 s rules (violated if a single control observation exceeds either its ± 3. 5, ± 4. 0 and ± 4. 5 s limits, respectively). In order for the hematology laboratory to totally embrace expanded QC limits, manufacturers must make available their instruments’ usual and poorer (e. g. the 15 P performance) imprecision’s. Users of hematology analyzers that require more sensitive but less specific rules to prevent the reporting of clinically erroneous data are advised to acquire more precise (and thus more dependable) instrumentation...|$|E

40|$|Central Laboratories of Strakonice Hospital, {{joint stock}} company, are {{accredited}} according to CSN EN ISO 15189 Medical laboratories - Particular requirements {{of quality and}} competence. Requirements of verification and validation of methods emerge from this accreditation. Results of validation and verification processes are {{used to evaluate the}} uncertainty of measurement and assessment for continuity and comparability of measurement results. Introduction of a new type of automated hematology analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i in Central laboratories in Strakonice Hospital, joint stock company, in the hematology and blood storage section, requires verification and validation of basic examined blood count parameters on hematology analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i. The theme of the work is based on the requirements of CSN EN ISO 15189 and SOPO-C- 06 Method validation/verification procedure for introducing laboratory hematology analyzer. Measurements of the basic parameters of blood count, namely leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume were done according to this document. Measurements of these parameters were used to evaluate a precision in terms of repeatability, precision in terms of reproducibility and accuracy. Parameters leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume were measured from twenty patient samples at two concentration levels to evaluate the precision in terms of repeatability. Basic parametres of blood count validated in EHK process were measured to evaluate the precision in terms of reproducibility. Reference materials <b>e-check</b> level 1 and <b>e-check</b> level 2 from Sysmex manufacturer were used as hematology control materials which moved within the physiological range. Measurements of these two reference materials were carried out daily during 20 days in a singlet. These measurements were used as the basis to calculate basic statistical parameters, the variational coefficient of repeatability and the variational coefficient of reproducibility from which variational analytical coefficient was calculated. The variational coefficient of reproducibility was used to compare methods of investigated parameters to the data specified by the manufacturer of the analyzer, as the manufacturer of the analyzer does not give the variational coefficient of repeatability. To estimate the validity, basic parametres of blood counts were measured to control materials from the company SEKK, Ltd. These materials are used to measure performance parametres. Validity measurements were used to calculate basic statistical parameters of which bias was calculated. It served to calculate the total analytical error of a laboratory and also it served to be compared to the total maximum error recommended by the company SEKK Ltd. in 2012. Passing-Bablock regression analysis was used to compare hematology analyzer Sysmex XT- 2000 i and hematology analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i, namely to compare the existing and the introducing analyzer and to compare open and closed mode of the introducing analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i. To compare analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i and Sysmex XT- 2000 i, which was regarded as referential, 40 patient samples were measured in a closed mode. To compare open and closed modes of analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i, 168 patient samples were measured. The measured values of all basic parameters were evaluated using MedCalc programme. The study showed that the device Sysmex XT- 4000 i meets the criteria required by CSN EN ISO 15189 Medical laboratories - Particular requirements for quality and competence and SOPO-C- 06 Method validation/verification procedure for introducing laboratory hematology analyzer in Central laboratories Strakonice Hospital, Inc. section of hematology and blood storage. Comparison of the new hematology analyzer Sysmex XT- 4000 i to the current Sysmex XT- 2000 i showed that both analyzers are comparable...|$|E
