5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70–110 by 25–45µm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical <b>excrescence</b> (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae {{embedded in a}} gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a cutis (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
500|$|Molecular {{analyses}} of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus, but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species. Size of the fruit bodies, color of the cap, spore size, {{presence or absence of}} cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus. V.earlei has smaller fruit bodies (cap less than [...] in diameter), has no pleurocystidia (usually), and the cheilocystidia usually have a very long apical <b>excrescence</b> (outgrowth). In V.asiaticus the majority of the pleurocystidia have an apical <b>excrescence</b> up to 10–15µm long and the cheilocystidia are predominantly lageniform (flask-shaped). V.michiganensis has smaller basidiospores, on average less than 12.5µm long. Volvariella acystidiata, known from central Africa (Zaire) and Italy, somewhat resembles Volvopluteus gloiocephalus. It can be distinguished from the latter by its smaller fruit bodies, with caps up to [...] in diameter, and, microscopically, by the complete absence of cheilo- and pleurocystidia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} prospectively the prevalence, evolution and embolic risk of valve <b>excrescences</b> in normal subjects and patients with and without suspected cardioembolism. Background. Valve <b>excrescences</b> detected by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have been considered a cardioembolic substrate in selected patients. Methods. Ninety healthy volunteers (Group I) and 88 patients without suspected cardioembolism and a normal TEE (Group II) were studied and followed up clinically for 58 ± 21 and 48 ± 20 months, respectively. To assess the evolution of valve <b>excrescences,</b> 45 of these subjects underwent repeat TEE at 31 ± 13 months. The findings in Groups I and II were {{compared with those of}} Group III— 49 patients referred for TEE for suspected cardioembolism. Results. Valve <b>excrescences</b> were detected in 34 subjects (38 %) in Group I and in 41 patients (47 %) in Group II. In Group III, 20 patients (41 %) had <b>excrescences,</b> but 85 % of them had other potential cardiac or vascular sources of embolism. In all groups, mitral valve <b>excrescences</b> were predominant (68 % to 76 %), followed by aortic (38 % to 50 %) and right-sided valves (< 10 %). <b>Excrescences</b> were equally frequent in men and women and between all age groups studied. During follow-up in Groups I and II, <b>excrescences</b> persisted unchanged, and 1 (1. 4 %) of 74 patients with and 2 (2 %) of 99 subjects without <b>excrescences</b> had cerebral ischemic events (80 % power to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 4 %). Conclusions. Valve <b>excrescences</b> are common on the left-sided heart valves of normal subjects and patients regardless of gender and age; they persist unchanged over time and {{do not appear to be}} a primary source of cardioembolism...|$|R
40|$|Lambl's <b>excrescences</b> are {{filiform}} fronds {{that occur}} at sites of valve closure. They originate as small thrombi on endocardial surfaces (where the valve margins contact) {{and have the}} potential to embolize to distant organs. We describe the case of a 61 -year-old woman who presented with repeated episodes of stroke. She was found to have Lambl's <b>excrescences</b> on all 3 leaflets of the aortic valve. After all other possible causes of stroke were ruled out, she underwent successful open heart surgery for débridement of these <b>excrescences.</b> The histopathologic diagnosis was consistent with Lambl's <b>excrescences.</b> Our patient did not have any cerebrovascular embolic event after surgery...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY-The {{incorporation}} of H 3 -thymidine (H 3 TdR) into epithelial cells of colonic mucosal <b>excrescences</b> and mucosa {{adjacent to the}} excres-cences was studied in vitro. The findings were compared with the incorpo-ration patternof H 3 TdR in normal rectal tissue. Inall <b>excrescences</b> examined, epithelial cells located in the upper thirdand surface of the crypts incorpo-rated H 3 TdR. In mucosa adjacent to <b>excrescences</b> containing evidence of hyperplasia, the same abnormality was always found. In mucosa adjacent to <b>excrescences</b> when no microscopic evidence of pathologic abnormality was present, this alteration was sometimes seen. These areas may, on occasion, be foci of future polyp activity prior to the macroscopic appear-ance of newly formed <b>excrescences.</b> The data presented supportthe concept that papillomas and adenomas are derived from surface epithelium. -JNat Cancer Inst 36 : 849 - 857, 1966.

40|$|AbstractA case of tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) was {{diagnosed}} in a 68 -year-old male with prolonged cough.

The aetiology and pathogenesis is unknown. The severity of TO range from no symptoms to severe dyspnoea, haemoptysis or pneumonitis. Treatment is seldom necessary. However, in severe cases, bronchoscopic removal of obstructing <b>excrescences</b> and surgery has been performed with therapeutic effect. Differential diagnosis of nodular <b>excrescences</b> includes amyloidosis, endobronchial sarcoidosis, calcificating lesions of tuberculosis, papilomatosis and tracheobronchial calcinosis.

40|$|Laminar flow has the {{potential}} to dramatically reduce fuel consumption and/or extend the range of modern aircraft. However, before laminar-flow aircraft can be made practical, the effect of surface imperfections must be better understood. Many studies have been performed on the effects of distributed roughness and other types of imperfections. Two-dimensional step <b>excrescences,</b> however have not been studied in significant detail until recently. Two-dimensional steps are common on real aircraft due to practical considerations such as skin-panel junctions, high-lift-device interfaces, deicing mechanisms, etc. Traditionally, these 2 -D <b>excrescences</b> have been treated as just another form of roughness; however, the behavior of these steps is fundamentally distinct. The present study tests the effect of 2 -D <b>excrescences</b> near 1 % chord in order {{to examine the effects of}} pressure gradient and curvature. Testing on a 30 ? swept-wing model is performed in both the flight environment aboard a Cessna O- 2 A Skymaster, as well as in the Klebanoff-Saric Wind tunnel at Texas A&M University. In both environments, IR thermography is utilized to detect the global laminar?turbulent transition location. In the wind tunnel, a hotwire traverse is also utilized to map out the boundary layer and further measure the influence of these <b>excrescences.</b> Interactions between the crossflow instability and these <b>excrescences</b> are observed. Both critical and subcritical step induced transition behavior is present. Comparisons are made to other contemporary experiments in order to draw conclusions about the influence of pressure gradient, sweep, and curvature on the step-induced transition behavior. The resulting data are intended for use in validating an ongoing companion computational effort...|$|R
