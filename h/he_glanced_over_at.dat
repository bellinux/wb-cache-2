60|$|The adventurer was {{stuffing}} {{his pipe}} with rank Indian tobacco, which he pared from a plug with a scalping knife. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> {{the two little}} plumes of smoke which stood straight up against the red evening sky.|$|E
60|$|Carl did not move. He {{was aware}} of Genie Linderbeck rising, to his left. No one else was up, but, with Genie's frail adherence, Carl {{suddenly}} desired to rouse every one to stand for Frazer and freedom. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the one man whom he could always trust to follow him--the Turk. A tiny movement of Carl's lips, a covert up-toss of his head, warned the Turk to rise now.|$|E
5000|$|... "By the way, {{the morning}} my father made {{the picture of}} JFK at the window, the {{president}} was reading the Times. He had gotten to the editorial page. My father said, 'He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware that I took that picture from the back, but he saw me when I moved to the side there. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me, and he said: [...] "I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his." [...] Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day.'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> Razumov, who {{waited for him}} to move on.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the Indian girl as he spoke. She was riding behind {{with an air}} of perfect ease and self-possession.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's your affair," [...] he said curtly. [...] "Eh, Carrier?" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the proconsul, who at once assented.|$|R
5000|$|As he {{explained}} {{in an interview}} late in life, Tames took the photograph {{through the door of}} the Oval Office, after Kennedy thought he had left: [...] President Kennedy's back was broken during the war, when that torpedo boat of his was hit by the Japanese destroyer. As a result of that injury he wore a brace on his back most of his life. Quite a few people didn't realize that. Also he could never sit for any length of time, more than thirty or forty minutes in a chair without having to get up and walk around. Particularly when it felt bad he had a habit, in the House, and the Senate, and into the Presidency, of carrying his weight on his shoulders, literally, by leaning over a desk, putting down his palms out flat, and leaning over and carrying the weight of his upper body by his shoulder muscles, and sort of stretching or easing his back. He would read and work that way, which was something I had seen him do many times. When I saw him doing that, I walked in, stood by his rocking chair, and then I looked down and framed him between the two windows, and I shot that picture. I only made two exposures on it--we were very conservative with our film. Then I {{walked out of the room}} and stood there for a while, then I saw him straighten up. I went in again and I photographed him straight up, for a different shot, from the back, then I walked around to the side and photographed him profile, right and left. He had a copy of the New York Times, he was reading the editorial page--and I have that print right here, I was looking at it just the other day. He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware that I took that picture from back, but he saw me when I moved to the side there. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> me, and he said: [...] "I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his." [...] Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day. So that was the occasion of that picture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! It's only a squall--be {{over in a}} minute," [...] {{said the}} middy, by way of {{encouraging}} himself, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> the flickering lights, which were now barely visible.|$|R
6000|$|... "So far, so good," [...] murmured the mate, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the little group posing on the steps. [...] "I’ve done the best I could, but I suppose there’ll be a row." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the black cloud trailing away before the wind, saw Sylvia's desire in her face, and silently complied; {{for being a}} keen student of character, {{he was willing to}} prolong an interview that gave him glimpses of a nature in which the woman and the child were curiously blended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they pass}} into my keeping," [...] said Lingard, {{returning}} the other's bright smile but otherwise looking grim {{enough with the}} frown which had settled on his forehead <b>at</b> Daman's approach. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> a group of spearmen escorting the two captives who had come down the steps from the hut. At the sight of Daman barring as it were Lingard's way they had stopped at some distance and had closed round the two white men. Daman also glanced dispassionately that way.|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still really following. But look where he will, he still beholds him {{close to the}} {{opposite}} houses, making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door, and often, as <b>he</b> creeps along, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> him watchfully. Soon satisfied that {{the last thing in}} his thoughts is to give him the slip, Allan goes on, considering with a less divided attention what he shall do.|$|R
60|$|And then as he {{came back}} to the fire he saw {{something}} that he instantly dismissed as an optical illusion, as a mirage effect of the clouds of steam his guest was disengaging. The stoker was sitting, all crouched up, as close over the fire as he could contrive; and he was holding his black hands, not to the fire but in the fire, holding them pressed flat against two red, glowing masses of coal.... <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> the Author with a guilty start, and then instantly the Author perceived that the hands were five or six inches away from the coal.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard fancied that he {{was right}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the rail <b>at</b> the dimness that was {{creeping}} in on them. It was blowing almost fresh now, and the Selache was driving very fast through the swell, which commenced to froth here and there. It is, as he knew from experience, always hard work, and often impossible, to pull a boat to windward in any weight of breeze, which rendered it advisable to keep the schooner under way. If the boat drove by them while they were reefing it might be difficult {{to pick her up}} afterwards in the dark. He was now distinctly anxious about her. At length, just as the light was dying out, the man in the shrouds sent down a cry.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{touching}} {{to see these}} three big men, with the marks of their hard labour about them, anxiously bending over the worn books and painfully making out, [...] "The grass is green," [...] "The sticks are dry," [...] "The corn is ripe"--a very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single words all alike except in the first letter. It {{was almost as if}} three rough animals were making humble efforts to learn how they might become human. And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle Massey's nature, for such full-grown children as these were the only pupils for whom he had no severe epithets and no impatient tones. He was not gifted with an imperturbable temper, and on music-nights it was apparent that patience could never be an easy virtue to him; but this evening, as <b>he</b> <b>glances</b> <b>over</b> his spectacles <b>at</b> Bill Downes, the sawyer, who is turning his head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness before the letters d-r-y, his eyes shed their mildest and most encouraging light.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} <b>at</b> the open door, where the shadow was still lingering and shivering; {{and with no}} conscious repugnance of the mind, yet with a tremor of the belly, he drew near the body of his victim. The human character had quite departed. Like a suit half-stuffed with bran, the limbs lay scattered, the trunk doubled, on the floor; and yet the thing repelled him. Although so dingy and inconsiderable to the eye, he feared it might have more significance to the touch. He took the body by the shoulders, and turned it on its back. It was strangely light and supple, and the limbs, {{as if they had}} been broken, fell into the oddest postures. The face was robbed of all expression; but it was as pale as wax, and shockingly smeared with blood about one temple. That was, for Markheim, the one displeasing circumstance. It carried him back, upon the instant, to a certain fair-day in a fishers' village: a gray day, a piping wind, a crowd upon the street, the blare of brasses, the booming of drums, the nasal voice of a ballad singer; and a boy going to and fro, buried over head in the crowd and divided between interest and fear, until, coming out upon the chief place of concourse, he beheld a booth and a great screen with pictures, dismally designed, garishly coloured: Brown-rigg with her apprentice; the Mannings with their murdered guest; Weare in the death-grip of Thurtell; and a score besides of famous crimes. The thing was as clear as an illusion; he was once again that little boy; he was looking once again, and with the same sense of physical revolt, at these vile pictures; he was still stunned by the thumping of the drums. A bar of that day's music returned upon his memory; and at that, for the first time, a qualm came over him, a breath of nausea, a sudden weakness of the joints, which he must instantly resist and conquer.|$|R
60|$|At {{these latter}} words the girl shivered again, {{and for a}} moment paused in her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint. It escaped his attention, for <b>he</b> was <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> the stern <b>at</b> {{something}} the boat had in tow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{when the}} girls are going down," [...] laughed Jack, who had {{recognized}} Juliet's scarlet boating-suit as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Both girls laughed, and Amy averred that Karl's eyes {{danced with}} merriment as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, as the silvery peal sounded behind him.|$|R
60|$|Taking them up {{carelessly}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> two {{or three}} quickly when something caught his eye which caused the cry of surprise that had stopped Bob.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you want?" [...] demanded one, {{as soon as}} {{he could}} speak. And then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> their {{shoulders}} to see if the newcomers were alone.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. Every {{one looked}} toward the door. Just outside were two dark figures. To three people at the table the truth came like a flash.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mm," [...] Ludlow {{made in his}} throat. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the {{shoulder}} next her, and asked, as if Charmian were not there, [...] "What makes you do her always alike?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good Lord, I say, what ho!" [...] cried Ginger. [...] "Fancy {{meeting you}} here. What {{a bit of}} luck!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his {{shoulder}} warily. [...] "Has that blighter pipped?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Whilst he was hastily packing {{together}} a few articles for his journey <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> a poor plain missive also lately come to hand--the one from Marian and Izz Huett, beginning-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{means to}} give us {{as much of a}} chase as possible," [...] remarked Tom, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder. [...] "If I {{remember}} rightly, Baxter was always a pretty fair oarsman." ...|$|R
60|$|Charnock {{nodded as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{the edge of}} the narrow tableland. The descent was not steep near the top, but farther on it dropped precipitously to the water, {{crossing}} the curve by the bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "A good beginning, truly. Now for the rest," [...] said Godwin. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and added, [...] "See, {{they are}} leading Rosamund away, but Sinan remains, {{to speak with}} you doubtless, for Masouda beckons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'One out of {{that crowd}} will call me his,' said Miss McCabe, handing to her adorer the list, which she had {{received}} by mail {{a day or two}} earlier, of the accepted competitors. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the names.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> {{the first}} page, but on {{turning to the}} second his eye became arrested, and he read carefully, {{frowning}} deeply as he did so. Then he turned back and read it again. The passage was as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hampton!' {{the latter}} exclaimed, {{as soon as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the first line or two; 'I am glad indeed. Let us sit down on that rock over there; the news is too {{pleasant}} to be lost by {{not being able to}} read it distinctly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The same writing," [...] remarked Holmes, as {{he opened}} the envelope, [...] "and {{actually}} signed," [...] he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle. [...] "Come, we are getting on, Watson." [...] His brow clouded, however, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the contents.|$|R
6000|$|Bensington, {{grasping}} this, {{started off}} {{along the path}} by the well. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and saw Cossar's gigantic figure standing out {{as if he were}} regarding the holes pensively. At the sight Bensington halted for a moment and half turned. They were all leaving Cossar---! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, my fine fellow, quiet now," [...] said Charley in a {{soothing}} tone, patting the horse's neck. [...] "It's a comfort {{to know you}} can't go far in that direction, anyhow!" [...] he added, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder, and saw an immense drift behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible!" [...] {{said the}} doctor, fumbling with nervous fingers at the envelope. [...] "By Jove, though," [...] he continued, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> the contents, [...] "you're right. He has. Poor lad! he's more cut {{up about it}} than we can be, so we must not blame him." ...|$|R
60|$|He hurriedly opened it. A {{letter from}} his daughter, and another from Theodosius. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> their contents—‘Ere this reaches you, far distant—appeal to feelings—love to distraction—bees’-wax—slavery,’ &c., &c. He dashed {{his hand to his}} forehead, and paced the room with fearfully long strides, to the great alarm of the precise Maria.|$|R
