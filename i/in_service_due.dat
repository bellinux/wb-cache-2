25|$|By {{the end of}} the First World War the Norwegian {{torpedo boat}} fleet had been worn down by {{constant}} service and 14 of the vessels were decommissioned and disposed of in 1920. Twenty-three torpedo boats, including Kjell, were obliged to continue <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to budgetary restrictions despite being long outdated and ready for replacement. Although officially still in service the torpedo boats spent most of the inter-war period in port, only being equipped for exercises some two to three months every year.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} the {{conflict}} in Africa the Portuguese Armed Forces went through a reorganization and shifted their focus back from counter-insurgency to honoring Portugal's commitments to NATO and preparing for a possible conflict in Europe against the Warsaw Pact. The Portuguese Air Force's F-86F Sabre and G.91 fighters were considered to be outdated in both the air defense and ground attack roles to face Soviet forces in the European operations theater and only a few Sabre fighters were <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to problems with the engines and lack of spare parts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Microstructure and {{mechanical}} properties {{of a new}} developed cold work die steel (SDC 99) were investigated under solution treatment and comparison with Cr 12 MoV steel. The new developed high strength and high toughness cold work die steel has overcome the weakness of Cr 12 MoV which failed with tipping, fracture and collapse <b>in</b> <b>services</b> <b>due</b> to low toughness. The toughness achieves to 80 J which is twice as Cr 12 MoV while the hardness is 62 HRC...|$|R

25|$|Zhang Jing's replacement, Zhou Chong (周珫), had {{his powers}} greatly limited {{compared}} to his predecessor. Instead of the 6 coastal provinces under Zhang Jing's command, Zhou Chong's {{was limited to}} only the Southern Metropolitan Region, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The investigating censor of military affairs in Zhejiang, Hu Zongxian, was promoted to Li Tianchong's position of grand coordinator. Hu was promoted even higher to supreme commander in April 1556, after Zhou Chong and his successor Yang Yi (楊宜) were cashiered after {{less than a year}} <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to their underwhelming performance.|$|E
25|$|The Tribal class, or Afridi class, were a {{class of}} destroyers built for the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Australian Navy that saw service in World War II. Originally {{conceived}} during design studies for a light fleet cruiser, the Tribals evolved into fast, powerful destroyers, with greater emphasis on guns over torpedoes than previous destroyers, in response to new designs by Japan, Italy, and Germany. The Tribals were well admired by their crews and the public when they were <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to their power, often becoming symbols of prestige while in service.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, it was {{projected}} that the fleet of 32 U-2s would be operated until 2015. In 2014, Lockheed Martin {{determined that the}} U-2S fleet has used only one-fifth of its design service life {{and is one of}} the youngest fleets within the USAF. In 2011 the USAF intended to replace the U-2 with the RQ-4 before fiscal year 2015; proposed legislation required any replacement to have lower operating costs. In January 2012 the USAF reportedly planned to end the RQ-4 Block 30 program and extend the U-2's service life until 2023. The RQ-4 Block 30 was kept <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to political pressure over USAF objections, who state that the U-2 costs $2,380 per flight hour compared to the RQ-4's $6,710 as of early 2014. Critics have pointed out that the RQ-4's cameras and sensors are less capable, and a lack of all-weather operating capability; however, some of the U-2's sensors may be installed on the RQ-4. The RQ-4 Block 30's capabilities were planned to match the U-2's by FY 2016, the replacement effort is motivated by decreases in the RQ-4's cost per flying hour.|$|E

500|$|The {{interior}} of the building was termed [...] "severely plain" [...] and utilitarian for its simple design of two large rooms on each side with a central hall and stairwell. [...] Each room was filled with natural light from the windows, and had a chimney for the iron stoves on {{the east and west}} ends of the building. The oak floors were installed in the early 20th-century and the ceiling was covered with modern acoustical tiles. The third floor is a shallow attic that gives access to the cupola. The ceiling and roof framing is supported with two king-post trusses at the ends of the main ridge. The basement is divided into halves and supported by summer beams that run the length of the sills and supported by posts on stone pedestals. By 1982, the steel I-beams were [...] "recently" [...] inserted under the floor joists and between the summer and the sills. The cellar also has an old furnace that is not <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to the building using electrical heating.|$|E
500|$|The ship did {{not last}} long <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>due</b> to her poor construction; this necessitated {{significant}} refurbishment, which was carried out at the naval depot at Geestemünde in 1868–1869. Her armor plating had to be removed and reinstalled, a breakwater was installed at the stern of the ship, and the main mast had to be relocated. She was re-rigged to a schooner rig during this refit. Prinz Adalbert also suffered from severe leaking throughout her short career. In 1870, shortly before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussian fleet was mobilized for a training cruise into the Atlantic. Prinz Adalbert and the recently commissioned broadside ironclad [...] steamed to Plymouth, England, where they rendezvoused {{with the rest of the}} fleet. While in Plymouth, the squadron received news of imminent hostilities with France, and made for safety in Wilhelmshaven, arriving on 16 July, three days before the outbreak of war. For the duration of the conflict, Prinz Adalbert served as a harbor guard ship in Hamburg. Her timber hull was found to be rotten in 1871, which forced her decommissioning. She was removed from service on 23 October 1871 and disarmed in 1875–1876. The ship was formally stricken from the naval register on 28 May 1878. She was broken up that year in Wilhelmshaven, and her engines were removed and reused.|$|E
