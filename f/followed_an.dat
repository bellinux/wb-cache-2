Abum <b>followed</b> <b>an</b> everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life.

One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E

5|$|Bregowine died in 764 and was {{originally}} {{buried in the}} baptistry in Canterbury, but his remains were moved to the choir of Canterbury Cathedral in 1123. This <b>followed</b> <b>an</b> attempt in around 1121 to remove his remains to another monastery, which came to nothing. The remains were placed by the altar of St Gregory in the south transept, after having been briefly placed in the north transept. Bregowine was later considered a saint, with a feast day of 26August, although Florence of Worcester, a 12th-century writer, recorded his death date as 24August. Other sources record the death date as 25August. His life was later written by Eadmer in the 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers <b>followed</b> <b>an</b> old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a corduroy road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the corduroy logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E

5|$|Echo & the Bunnymen is {{the fifth}} studio album by the English post-punk band Echo & the Bunnymen, their last with drummer Pete de Freitas, who died in 1989 in a {{motorcycle}} accident, aged 27. The album was produced by Laurie Latham who recorded the album in Germany, Belgium, London and Liverpool; this <b>followed</b> <b>an</b> aborted attempt at recording the album without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton. With Latham being an exacting producer, and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily, the recording of the album was more difficult than the band had initially hoped. The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums, which had been string-heavy.|$|E

Doris Nolan, in her Broadway debut, received positive criticism for her portrayal of the lead role. Several regional productions <b>followed.</b> <b>An</b> off-Broadway revival in 1973, under the title Penthouse Legend, was a commercial and critical failure.
