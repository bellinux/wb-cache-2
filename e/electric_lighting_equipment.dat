40|$|Some {{building}} energy codes now {{require the}} incorporation of daylight into buildings and automatic photosensor-controlled switching or dimming of the electric lighting system in areas that receive daylight. This paper describes enhancements to the open-source Daysim daylight analysis software that permit users to model a photosensor control system as it will perform in a real space, considering the directional sensitivity of the photosensor, its mounting position, the space and daylight aperture geometry, window shading configuration; the <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>equipment</b> and control zones; exterior obstructions; and site weather conditions. System output includes assessment of the daylight distribution in a space throughout the year, the photosensor’s ability to properly track the daylight and modify electric lighting system output, and the energy savings provided by the modeled control system. The application of daylight coefficients permits annual simulations to be conducted efficiently using hourly or finer weather data time increments. ...|$|E
50|$|QIHG is the {{internal}} heat generation rate per unit floor area due to occupancy, <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> and mechanical <b>equipment,</b> given in W/m2 (Btu/s/ft2). This internal heat generation is not constant due to variability in occupancy, <b>lighting,</b> and <b>equipment</b> operation schedule but is largely considered constant to a first order approximation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{building}} balance point {{temperature is}} the {{outdoor air temperature}} when the heat gains of the building are equal to the heat losses. Internal heat sources due to <b>electric</b> <b>lighting,</b> mechanical <b>equipment,</b> body heat, and solar radiation may offset {{the need for additional}} heating although the outdoor temperature may be below the thermostat set-point temperature. The building balance point temperature is the base temperature necessary to calculate heating degree day to anticipate the annual energy demand to heat a building. The balance point temperature is a consequence of building design and function rather than outdoor weather conditions.|$|R
5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a {{light switch}} is a switch, {{most commonly used}} to operate <b>electric</b> <b>lights,</b> permanently connected <b>equipment,</b> or electrical outlets. Portable lamps such as table lamps will have a light switch mounted on the socket, base, or in-line with the cord. Manually operated on/off switches may be substituted by remote control switches, or light dimmers that allow controlling the brightness of lamps as well as turning them on or off. Light switches are also found in flashlights and automobiles and other vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1889, the stage was removed and a [...] "section stage" [...] was constructed. The roof was raised 25 feet, so that the {{heaviest}} scenery could be drawn up out of sight without folding it. <b>Electric</b> <b>lights</b> were introduced in the auditorium and on the stage, though the gas was retained for use in emergencies, or in producing stage effects in which it might be superior to the <b>electric</b> <b>light.</b> New ventilation <b>equipment</b> was installed. The entire orchestra floor was reconstructed; the circle which had been added {{to this part of}} the auditorium the previous summer was removed. The boxes were reärranged, and the original iron fronts of the balcony and gallery were replaced by papier-mâché and woodwork. The capacity was 1,573.|$|R
2500|$|A toggle {{light switch}} is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate <b>electric</b> <b>lights,</b> permanently connected <b>equipment,</b> or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud [...] "snap" [...] or [...] "click" [...] noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on/off position. The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.|$|R

500|$|The ship went to East Africa in 1905, departing Austria-Hungary on 15 January, {{under the}} command of Captain Ludwig von Höhnel. The ship stopped in French-controlled Djibouti, where Höhnel and a group left the ship to travel {{overland}} to Ethiopia, where they concluded a trading treaty for Austria-Hungary. Höhnel's mission lasted from 4 February to 10 April. From there, Panther continued on in the Pacific Ocean, making visits in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China, before ultimately returning to Austria-Hungary on 22 December 1906. In June 1909, the ship was drydocked for modernization that included a complete overhaul of her gun battery; after emerging from the shipyard, she carried four [...] 45-cal. guns and ten [...] QF guns, along with her original torpedo tubes. <b>Electric</b> <b>lighting</b> and <b>equipment</b> to bake bread were also installed. From 16 August 1909 to 15 November 1910, Panther made another voyage to East Asia; during the trip, she cruised in Japan's inland sea and made several stops along the Chinese coast. From her return to Austria-Hungary to 1913, she served as a station ship in Trieste.|$|R
40|$|AbstractData from {{multiple}} sensors and actuators {{has been recorded}} from December 2001 to March 2008 at the LESO-PB building of the EPFL campus, using the EIB/KNX bus standard. Sensors and actuators provided data on room temperature, presence, lighting level, windows opening, blinds position, <b>electric</b> <b>lights</b> and heating power. Weather data has also been collected and includes ambient temperature, solar radiation on a horizontal surface (direct and diffuse components), wind speed and direction and rain alarm. The data was written continuously to a MySQL database, each EIB/KNX telegram being recorded into the database. The primary goal of that setup was the experimental validation and checking of advanced control algorithms for the actuation of solar shadings (outside fabric blinds), <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> and heating <b>equipment.</b> With {{the aid of the}} database it was shown that such control algorithms were able to reduce significantly the energy consumption while keeping the same comfort or even improving it.

Studies assessing the impact of <b>electric</b> <b>light</b> exposure on sleep and its relation to work hours are rare due to the ubiquitous presence of electricity.
