These skills can include social graces, communication abilities, language skills, personal habits, cognitive or emotional empathy, time management, teamwork and leadership traits. A definition based on review literature explains soft skills as an umbrella term for skills under three key functional elements: people skills, social skills, and personal career attributes. National Business Education Association deems soft skills as critical for being industrious in today’s workplace. Soft skills complement <b>hard</b> <b>skills</b> also known as technical skills, for productive workplace performance and everyday life competencies (Arkansas Department of Education, 2007). <b>Hard</b> <b>skills</b> were the only skills necessary for career employment and were generally quantifiable and measurable from educational background, work experience or through interview. In the 20th century soft skills are a major differentiator, a sine qua non for employability and success in life. A study conducted by Harvard University noted that 80% of achievements in career are determined by soft skills and only 20% by <b>hard</b> <b>skills.</b> Experts say soft skills training should begin for a person when they are students, to perform efficiently in their academic environment {{as well as in}} their future workplace.
