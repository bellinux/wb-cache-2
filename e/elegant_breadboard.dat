40|$|We {{report on}} ongoing {{technology}} {{activities on the}} <b>Elegant</b> <b>Breadboard</b> for the LOCUS telescope and its 1. 15 THz receiver. LOCUS is a Low-Earth orbit small satellite (150 kg category) {{with the objective of}} linking observations of climate, the upper atmosphere and space weather by performing simultaneous high spectral resolution measurements of molecular signatures of molecules which drive the thermal exchange in the highest layers of our atmosphere. These measurements are performed both in the THz frequency region and in a photometric narrow-band near and mid-IR channels allowing to decouple molecular abundances from temperature and pressure profiles. The <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> under development will reproduce representative optics and explore the thermal implications of a compact optical-bench with a small cryo-cooler and radiator stage for a small LEO satellite. An extensive test programme will be undertaken to raise the payload and receiver system and we will seek opportunities to test the system in an observational campaign. Technology developments will benefit future technology activities related to both a future Earth-Orbit mission and potential astronomy missions...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a space-compatible laser frequency stabilization to a hyperfine transition in molecular iodine with a frequency stability in the 10 - 15 domain at longer integration times. A setup on <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> (EBB) level was successfully implemented and verified. Using modulation-transfer spectroscopy, a frequency stability of 4 ⋅ 10 - 15 at an integration time of 1. 000 s was demonstrated in a beat measurement with a laboratory ULE cavity setup. The spectroscopy setup is realized using a 550 mm x 250 mm x 50 mm baseplate made of a thermally highly stable glass ceramics in combination with adhesive bonding technology for integration of the optical components. The EBB setup is the basis for a setup on engineering model (EM) level that is currently developed using the same assembly-integration technology.

40|$|Precision phase readout {{of optical}} beat note signals {{is one of}} the core {{techniques}} required for intersatellite laser interferometry. Future space based gravitational wave detectors like eLISA require such a readout over a wide range of MHz frequencies, due to orbit induced Doppler shifts, with a precision in the order of μrad/√(Hz) at frequencies between 0. 1 mHz and 1 Hz. In this paper, we present phase readout systems, so-called phasemeters, that are able to achieve such precisions and we discuss various means that have been employed to reduce noise in the analogue circuit domain and during digitisation. We also discuss the influence of some non-linear noise sources in the analogue domain of such phasemeters. And finally, we present the performance that was achieved during testing of the <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> model of the LISA phasemeter, that was developed in the scope of an ESA technology development activity.

40|$|The Point Ahead Angle Mechanism (PAAM) for ESA’s Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) {{mission will}} {{compensate}} the out-of-plane point-ahead angle between three satellites flying 5 million kilometres apart. The PAAM {{consists of a}} mirror supported by flexures allowing the mirror to rotate with a maximum stroke of ± 1 mrad. The mirror is actuated in 0. 14 μrad steps by two redundant linear Piezo LEGS ® actuators driving a sine-bar. Since the actuators are self-locking, a special lever performing {{the role of a}} linear mechanical differential is used to provide redundancy. The design uses high-precision flexures to minimise mirror parasitic piston displacements in the picometres range. The angle is driven in closed loop using two capacitive sensors. This paper presents the mechanism at the design stage of an <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> (EBB) ready for tests. The performance requirements are summarized, then the overall concept of the mechanism is described, at last the key aspects of the detailed design are discussed: flexures design, kinematic structure, kinematic mount, redundant piezo-actuation, sensors and control. Optimisation of the design has shown that the selected high-precision design can meet the stringent requirements of fine positioning and severe environments. ...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{frequency}} {{references are}} a key element for the realization of future space missions. They are needed for missions related to tests of fundamental physics, gravitational wave detection, Earth observation and navigation and ranging. In missions such as GRACE follow-on or eLISA the optical frequency reference is used as light source for high-sensitivity inter-satellite distance metrology. While cavity-based systems are current baseline e. g. for eLISA, frequency stabilization on a hyperfine transition in molecular iodine near 532 nm is a promising alternative. Due to its absolute frequency, iodine standards crucially simplify the initial SC acquisition procedures. Current setups fulfill the GRACE-FO and eLISA frequency stability requirements and are realized near Engineering Model level. We present {{the current status of}} our developments on <b>Elegant</b> <b>Breadboard</b> and Engineering Model level taking into account specific design criteria for space compatibility such as compactness (size iodine spectroscopy EM: 38 × 18 × 10 cm^ 3) and robustness. Both setups achieved similar frequency stabilities of 1 · 10 ^− 14 at an integration time of 1 s and below 5 · 10 ^− 15 at integration times between 10 s and 1000 s.

40|$|Laser based {{metrology}} systems {{become more}} and more attractive for space applications and are the core elements of planned missions such as LISA (NGO, eLISA) or NGGM where laser interferometry is used for distance measurements between satellites. The GRACE-FO mission will for the �rst time demonstrate a Laser Ranging Instrument (LRI) in space, starting 2017. Laser based metrology also includes optical clocks/references, either as ultra-stable light source for high sensitivity interferometry or as scienti�c payload e. g. proposed in fundamental physics missions such as mSTAR (mini SpaceTime Asymmetry Research), a mission dedicated to perform a Kennedy-Thorndike experiment on a satellite in a low-Earth orbit. To enable the use of existing optical laboratory setups, optimization with respect to power consumption, weight and dimensions is necessary. At the same time the thermal and structural stability must be increased. Over the last few years we investigated adhesive bonding of optical components to thermally highly stable glass ceramics as an easy-to-handle assembly integration technology. Several setups were implemented and tested for potential later use in space applications. We realized a heterodyne LISA related interferometer with demonstrated noise levels in the pm-range for translation measurement and nano-radiant-range for tilt measurements and two iodine frequency references on <b>Elegant</b> <b>Breadboard</b> (EBB) and Engineering Model (EM) level with frequency stabilities in the 10 e- 15 range for longer integration times.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} recent updates {{about the}} ESA study: Sample Canister Capture Mechanism Design and Breadboard developed under the Mars Robotic Exploration Preparation (MREP) program. The study {{is part of}} a set of feasibility studies aimed at identifying, analysing and developing technology concepts enabling the future international Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. The MSR is a challenging mission with the purpose of sending a Lander to Mars, acquire samples from its surface/subsurface and bring them back to Earth for further, more in depth, analyses. In particular, the technology object of the Study is relevant to the Capture Mechanism that, mounted on the Orbiter, is in charge of capturing and securing the Sample Canister, or Orbiting Sample, accommodating the Martian soil samples, previously delivered in Martian orbit by the Mars Ascent Vehicle. An <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> of such a device was implemented and qualified under an ESA contract primed by OHB-CGS S. p. A. and supported by Politecnico di Milano, Department of Aerospace Science and Technology: in particular, functional tests were conducted at PoliMi-DAST and thermal and mechanical test campaigns occurred at Serms s. r. l. facility. The effectiveness of the breadboard design was demonstrated and the obtained results, together with the design challenges, issues and adopted solutions are critically presented in the paper. The breadboard was also tested on a parabolic flight to raise its Technology Readiness Level to 6; the microgravity experiment design, adopted solutions and results are presented as well in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of an adjustable mould tool for solid antenna reflector dishes for space application {{is part of}} the Advanced Systems and Technology Program (ASTP), Phase 3. For ground station antennas an adjustable mould called 'Bed of Nails' concept, has already been successfully applied. Objective of the reporter study was to investigate a concept to produce solid reflectors with different shapes for space application with very good surface accuracy. The adjustable mould should be used for curing composite materials by autoclave treatment under heat and pressure. The results of the concept selection investigation was the bed of nails concept together with a thermoplast mould skin. Backed by creep behaviour tests of the thermoplast and trials on the model mould, the appropriate parameters were found to form the thermoplast mould skin over the contour-giving nailheads. Once formed at a temperature of around 200 C, the mould skin remains stable during the reflector curing process. The design of the real adjustable mould (see figure below) was updated according to the results of the trials and the mechanical and thermal analyses of the mould. Summing up the results of the trials with the model mould was found that requirement for the contour accuracy can be fully met. The RMS-values of the formed thermoplast mould skin were between 20 and 40 #mu#m and for the <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> reflector panel less than 44 #mu#m.

40|$|We {{realized}} ultra-stable {{optical frequency}} references on <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> (EBB) and engineering model (EM) level utilizing Doppler-free spectroscopy of molecular iodine near 532 nm. A frequency stability of about 1 ⋅ 10 - 14 at an integration time of 1 s and below 5 ⋅ 10 - 15 at integration times between 10 s and 100 s was achieved. These values {{are comparable to}} the currently best laboratory setups. Both setups use a baseplate made of glass material where the optical components are joint using a specific assembly-integration technology. Compared to the EBB setup, the EM setup is further developed with respect to compactness and mechanical and thermal stability. The EM setup uses a baseplate made of fused silica with dimensions of 380 x 180 x 40 mm 3 and a specifically designed 100 x 100 x 30 mm 3 rectangular iodine cell in nine-pass configuration with a specific robust cold finger design. The EM setup was subjected to thermal cycling and vibrational testing. Applications of such an optical frequency reference in space {{can be found in}} fundamental physics, geoscience, Earth observation, and navigation & ranging. One example is the proposed mSTAR (mini SpaceTime Asymmetry Research) mission, dedicated to perform a Kennedy-Thorndike experiment on a satellite in a sunsynchronous low-Earth orbit. By comparing an iodine standard to a cavity-based frequency reference and integration over 2 year mission lifetime, the Kennedy-Thorndike coefficient will be determined with up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy than the current best ground experiment. In a current study, the compatibility of the payload with the SaudiSat- 4 host vehicle is investigated. I...|$|E
30|$|The RLS {{instrument}} {{used for this}} study was an <b>elegant</b> <b>breadboard</b> for the ExoMars mission, originally designed as a combined Raman and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument [24]. In order to decrease the weight and power usage of the payload aboard the ExoMars mission, the LIBS capability had in the meantime been removed from the flight mode instrument. Therefore, the effect of Mars atmospheric conditions on the LIBS performance of the instrument is not discussed in this article. The Raman modality uses a 659  nm laser with a maximum output of 20  mW. The RLS focal plane assembly incorporates a charge coupled device (CCD), a thermal/mechanical interface (cold finger) and proximity electronics. The proximity electronics include CCD bias voltage filters and a pre-amplifier circuit for amplifying the analogue video output signal produced by the on-chip amplifier. The thermal design of the spectrometer allows the CCD to be operated between − 40  °C and room temperature, with the CCD thermally isolated {{from the rest of the}} spectrometer including the proximity electronics. The spectrometer was designed to project multiple grating orders at different heights of the CCD. This way the instrument could be used over a broad wavelength range (for LIBS) and still offer a high spectral resolution (for Raman and LIBS). The CCD was a back-illuminated e 2 v Technologies CCD 42 - 40 with an imaging area comprising 2048 [*]×[*] 2048, 13.5  μm pixels. The device is Ultraviolet (UV)-enhanced, with a quantum efficiency of at least 50  % between 240 and 840  nm and imaging pixels with a full-well capacity in excess of 105 electrons. The device is a full-frame CCD but is usually operated in pseudo frame transfer mode in order to reduce smearing effects at short integration times (which can result in cross contamination of the spectral orders). The CCD is bonded to a ceramic Dual-In-Line (DIL) package but is flight representative with respect to its functional and thermal performance (including the mechanical interface to the rest of the spectrometer). The analogue video output from the focal plane assembly is digitised using a correlated double-sampling circuit and low-noise analogue-to-digital converter. A programmable digital signal processor (DSP) enables flexible detector operating modes, including synchronised CCD readout and laser emission.|$|E
