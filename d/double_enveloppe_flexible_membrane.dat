The wave barrier consists of a thin <b>flexible</b> <b>membrane</b> suspended {{in the water column}} by a moored cylindrical buoy on the free surface and fixed to a hinge at the seafloor. The analytical model combines the three-degree of freedom rigid body motion of the cylindrical buoy with the two-dimensional analog of a vibrating string for the response of the <b>flexible</b> <b>membrane.</b> Theoretical results for reflection and transmission coefficients, dynamic mooring line tension, horizontal hinge force, horizontal and vertical displacements and rotation of the cylindrical buoy are compared with measured results presented by Bender(1989).

40|$|To {{lessen the}} {{deterioration}} of fixed-wing aerodynamic performance associated with chord Reynolds numbers below 100, 000, <b>flexible</b> <b>membrane</b> wing designs have been studied and proposed as an alternative for micro air vehicle use. The beneficial effects of a <b>flexible</b> <b>membrane</b> can include higher lift, steeper lift-curve slope, delayed stall, gentle stall characteristics, and greater efficiency.

This work discusses the geometric and prestrain effects on a batten-reinforced, free trailing-edge membrane wing in low-Reynolds-number (50, 000) flow. The global aerodynamic forces on the wings with varying wing aspect ratio, cell aspect ratio, and prestrain level were measured. The results show that the aerodynamic advantages of the <b>flexible</b> <b>membrane</b> are retained for the low-aspect-ratio wings. The optimal membrane cell aspect ratio is found to be approximately 1.
