50|$|The main {{difference}} between {{the different types of}} footmice is a flat pedal which slides or a pedal which tilts. There also exists a mouse adapter which converts a conventional mouse to a footmouse that slides and horizontally tilts to one side. A footmouse that uses sliding can be a slipper with a mouse connected to it, or a special frame in which a pedal can move around. Also a tiny magnet or other location device can be used on a tablet. A footmouse that uses a tilting pedal has one or two pedals which are able to tilt and turn in one or more <b>directions.</b> <b>Buttons</b> that are pushed by the feet are not considered footmice.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mobile {{service robots}} for {{interaction}} with {{people need to}} be easily maneuverable by their users, even if physical restrictions make a manual pushing and pulling impossible. In this paper, we present a low cost approach that allows for intuitive tactile control of a mobile ser-vice robot while preserving constraints of a differential drive and obsta-cle avoidance. The robot’s enclosure has been equipped with capacitive touch sensors able to recognize proximity of the user’s hands. By simu-lating forces applied by the touching hands, a desired motion command for the robot is derived and combined with other motion objectives in a local motion planner (based on Dynamic Window Approach in our case). User tests showed that this haptic control is intuitively understandable and outperforms a solution using <b>direction</b> <b>buttons</b> on the robot’s touch screen. ...|$|R
5000|$|Rather than {{an analog}} stick or joystick, the Smash Box {{controller}} features four analog <b>direction</b> <b>buttons,</b> allowing players to hit each button individually. This layout and the controller's flat surface allows each individual finger access to any button, {{eliminating the need}} for rapid and precise thumb movements. Involved usage of the Smash Box controller may still result in Ulnar tunnel syndrome and general postural concerns, but it is overall less stressful than the original controller. Hungrybox explained that the learning curve for the Smash Box controller is very steep, but it [...] "theoretically could make someone the most technical player of all time." [...] The binary input method could also be of use for tool-assisted superplays. The Smash Box controller can't do anything a traditional controller isn't also capable of, however, as it simply maps each input on a different type of button.|$|R

50|$|The game {{is split}} {{into a series}} of levels in which the player takes control of either Bruiser or Scratch {{depending}} on the level. The aim of the game is to try to escape each level by creating a portal out of different random objects. The player does this by pushing these objects together to form a completely new object to create a portal out of the level. Objects move in a straight line and are controlled by a four <b>direction</b> one <b>button</b> interface. There are a few tutorials to introduce a player to the game and the actual story takes place over 48 puzzles and six landscapes. Challenge mode also offers 75 additional puzzles that range in difficulty.|$|R
40|$|The small {{physical}} size {{of mobile}} devices imposes dramatic {{restrictions on the}} user interface (UI). With the ever increasing capacity of these devices as well as access to large online stores it becomes increasingly important to help the user select a particular item efficiently. Thus, we propose binary search with character pinning, where users can constrain their search to match selected prefix characters while making simple binary decisions about the position of their intended item in the lexicographic order. The underlying index for our method {{is based on a}} ternary search tree that is optimal under certain user-oriented constraints. To better scale to larger indexes, we analyze several heuristics that rapidly construct good trees. A user study demonstrates that our method helps users conduct rapid searches, using less keystrokes, compared to other methods. able to browse huge catalogs of recorded music. In order to address the market demand for tiny media players, different companies have introduced a wide range of small form factor products, with and without a small graphical user display (e. g. Figure 1). However, the small physical size of such devices only allows for a limited user interface (UI), typically a small number of buttons and a single line display. For example, the iPod Shuffle 1 has a directional pad (d-pad) with one center and four <b>direction</b> <b>buttons,</b> and no display unit. Given such a limited UI, selecting a song or artist from a large list (which could potentially be all the music available in an online store), becomes challenging. Simple approaches, such as iterating through the index item by item, fail to scale to large indexes...|$|R

5000|$|The Fender Mustang Pro Guitar controller, {{which is}} based on the Fender Mustang, has 102 buttons along its neck which {{simulate}} holding the guitar strings against the fretboard. All six strings are represented along 17 different frets. In order to simulate picking/strumming, the Mustang pro controller features a [...] "string box" [...] located on the body of the controller (around the position of the strum bar on standard guitar controllers, or the cavity/pickups on a real guitar). It consists of six short stainless-steel strings suspended between two sensors, which detect the vibration of the stings when plucked or strummed. In addition to pro mode use, the Mustang can be used to play the game in basic mode. It also functions as a full MIDI guitar, with a MIDI output connector providing compatibility with MIDI software sequencers and hardware devices. For use in gaming mode, each Mustang controller can only be used with the game console it was designed for. An unofficial workaround involves connecting it through a MIDI-Pro Adapter, although <b>direction</b> pad <b>buttons,</b> overdrive detection and Basic 5-button game play are unavailable since they do not function through the MIDI port. The Mustang Pro-Guitar is only a few inches smaller in length than an actual guitar, but, being made of plastic, is much lighter than an actual guitar. The neck is removable from the body for easier storage and transport.|$|R
5000|$|In the Beginner mode, all {{notes are}} {{represented}} either by a D-Pad icon or a button icon, and any <b>direction</b> or face <b>button</b> respectively will automatically play the correct note. In Amateur mode, {{each of the}} eight buttons {{on the face of the}} Nintendo DS system correspond to a musical note; there is also a drum set where each button, including the L and R buttons, plays a specific drum or cymbal. As many songs contain fast or difficult parts to play, they are covered in the Beginner and Amateur modes—when the cursor is about to move over them, the lower screen will change to the [...] "touch" [...] command; touching the bottom screen at this time causes the notes underneath the touch screen portion to be played automatically. These do not contribute to the player's score, but prevent high-speed sequences from being forced on the player early on, and activating them helps to keep the rhythm and flow of the song.|$|R
30|$|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) topics {{may benefit}} from being taught in an {{embodied}} manner using new media. However, the gestures need to be congruent to the task learned. Koch, Glawe, and Holt (2011) report that participants react faster in a Stroop condition using congruent gestures (up movement attached to word “happy”) compared to incongruent gestures (down movement for “happy”) performed on a large 28 -inch slider (Koch et al., 2011). Glenberg and Kaschak (2002) vary the <b>direction</b> of <b>button</b> pushes for sentence comprehension. Congruent sentences were judged faster than the action mismatch sentences. A wide range of topics are now being instructed using theories of embodiment or based on gestures. Abrahamson (2009) researches mathematics and proportionalities. Alibali and Nathan explore learning and teaching diverse math topics including equation solving, word-problem solving, and algebraic and geometric concepts (Alibali & Nathan, 2012; Nathan et al., 2014). Using congruent whole body movements and immersive MR platforms, others have shown increased learning about astronomy (Lindgren, Tscholl, Wang, & Johnson, 2016) and electric circuits (Yoon, Elinich, Wang, Steinmeier, & Tucker, 2012). Virtual worlds {{are being used to}} understand spatial maps (Weisberg & Newcombe, 2015) and further body metaphor work is being done with motion capture sensors, like the Kinect, to teach students computer coding via dance moves (Parmar et al., 2016). This small sample of embodied research highlights the variety of platforms and methodologies used to explore the positive effects of embodiment on education. Our lab focuses on understanding the best pedagogies available that map to current technologies in today’s classrooms. To that end, many science simulations are being created that are also gamified.|$|R
