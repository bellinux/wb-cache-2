25|$|The New Deal {{programs}} {{to relieve the}} Depression are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending unemployment. At the time many New Deal programs - especially CCC - were popular.

In addition, Farmer's A Feast Unknown, and its two sequels Lord of the Trees and The Mad Goblin, are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, with the premise that they tell the story of the real characters the fictional characters are based upon.

40|$|Sustainable {{bio-energy}} is interwoven with sustainable {{rural development}} for <b>family</b> <b>farmers.</b> In this context, the Brazilian government {{is pursuing a}} “social inclusion” goal by means of <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> providing a fraction of biodiesel feedstock. In 2009, the state-run petroleum company established a biodiesel plant {{in the north of}} Minas Gerais State. <b>Family</b> <b>farmers</b> in this region are {{faced with the prospect of}} entering agreements with the industry to provide castor beans (castor). Fewer <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> than anticipated are engaging and this raises doubts regarding the sustainability of this option for <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> (da Silva César and Batalha 2010). Exploration into the sustainability of such farmer-industry agreements from the farm-level perspective is timely. We conduct an exploratory assessment using sustainability indicators. We aim to: (i) capture and explore the scope of sustainability if <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> choose to cultivate castor and (ii) explain sustainability as a function of current yield levels, alternative yield levels and alternative management decisions at the farm level...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{contributes}} to identifying obstacles {{to the development}} of a local biodiesel agro-industrial system (AGS) in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The research questions are: “How do local social characteristics influence the organizational effectiveness of agents involved in the joint production effort?”; and “How can the institutional arrangement of biodiesel production be described?” The method adopted is the case study, focused on <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> served by the <b>Family</b> <b>Farmers</b> Rural Extension and Technical Assistance Company (EMATER). This state organization introduced castor beans (Ricinus communis L.) to <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> as an alternative crop to supply a processing plant (Darcy Ribeiro Biodiesel Plant—DRBP) in northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. These <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> are not horizontally organized, and sign individual contracts with DRBP. The paper concludes that the primary obstacle to developing the biodiesel AGS with castor beans in Minas Gerais is the lack of horizontal organization among <b>family</b> <b>farmers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pontal do Paranapanema is {{the only}} region in São Paulo state where a large scale {{sugarcane}} expansion can take place. Such expansion is expected and will likely affect the rural <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> in the region. Without regulations, the expansion might negatively affect the income of <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> who start to grow sugarcane. Some <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> already grow sugarcane {{and it has been}} shown that their average income from sugarcane is sometimes less than 3 times the average income from sugarcane in the rest of the state. The same is expected to be the case for all <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> who start to grow sugarcane if no regulations are added. The <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> have such small properties that it is not profitable for them to buy all necessary equipment for growing sugarcane. They rent some services from the sugarcane industry leading to lower net incomes. The sugarcane expansion can lead to increased socioeconomic benefits for the <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> if the expansion is done in combination with changed cattle farming. <b>Family</b> <b>farmers</b> can have a combined production system where they grow sugarcane on parts of their property and in exchange for the delivered sugarcane to the sugarcane industry they could receive nutritious cattle feed made from sugarcane residues. If the cattle stock is changed and feed with the cattle feed this can lead to large increases in milk production and hence large income gains. To evaluate the socioeconomic and climate impacts of expanding ethanol sugarcane production in conjunction with this combined production system, two models were created: one for calculating income growth of <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> when a combined sugarcane and milk production system is introduced and one for calculating energy and emissions from a sugarcane expansion when coupled with the combined production system. The model analyses indicate that income could 10 -fold for <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> if a combined sugarcane and milk production system is introduced. At the same time, the global emissions of greenhouse gases could be significantly reduced if the ethanol from such production replaced gasoline used for transportation in the EU. If a sugarcane industry wants to run in Pontal regulations could state that they then have to produce cattle feed of some of the sugarcane residues in order to promote the combined production system...|$|R

40|$|Biofuels {{have been}} criticized in {{academic}} and activist circles not only for their environmental consequences but also for their social impacts on food availability and on small-scale family farming. Meanwhile (global) initiatives and policies {{have been developed to}} stimulate "sustainable biofuels". Brazil a frontrunner in production and use of biofuels - aimed to combine biodiesel production with rural development. The biodiesel policy implemented in 2004 had two main objectives: to advance biodiesel as a transportation fuel and to foster the social inclusion of <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> through participation in the biodiesel chain. Although participation of <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> was low in the beginning, it increased substantially after a 2009 policy change that gave cooperatives a more prominent role. We analyze how, why and to what extent cooperatives are involved in integrating <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> into the biodiesel chain and what this means for the social sustainability of biodiesel, taking the northeast state of Bahia as a case study area. The findings show that through the biodiesel policy, cooperatives until then a marginal phenomenon in northern Brazil increased their membership, were empowered and contributed to the economic development of a significant group of <b>family</b> <b>farmers.</b> However, these <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> have not been substantially included in the biodiesel production chain itself. The biodiesel policy functions as a catalyst for rural (economic) development in which the cooperatives seem to achieve what governments were unable to achieve: the integration of specific categories of <b>family</b> <b>farmers</b> into agrarian development. Subsistence <b>family</b> <b>farmers,</b> in particular, {{have not been able to}} profit from this policy-driven, "market-oriented," rural development model. Hence, it can be questioned whether this policy has made biodiesel more socially sustainable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
