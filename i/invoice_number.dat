[...] The stamps, as a result, were issued in values of 7c, 13c, 25c, and 50c.

30|$|Figure  1 {{lists the}} order volumes and also {{distribution}} or {{orders from the}} smallest to the largest. The distribution of orders is relatively normal and the orders are divided rather evenly between the smallest and the largest amounts. The distribution is listed according to <b>invoice</b> <b>numbers</b> during 6 / 2009. Fig. 1 addresses that the orders are rather small in tons: {{over half of the}} deliveries are under 5 tons. The smallest orders were only some hundred kilos and the largest were up to 26 tons. The figure reveals an interesting factor about the business and logistics character of a paper mill: a large unit can manufacture about 500, 000 tons of paper annually. If orders are from 2 to 25 tons, on average, around 5 tons, there can be roughly between 20, 000 and 50, 000 annual international deliveries and between 1500 to 4000 monthly deliveries. This addresses the importance of logistics for bulk industry in getting the products to the customers in good shape and in time.|$|R

The aim of this thesis {{is to find the}} factors that affect the time required for the processing of accounting and taxes. Another goal is to create a multidimensional econometric model that meets the assumptions of the classical regression model. The theoretical part focuses on basic obligations in accounting, taxes and wages under the relevant legislation. A method of regression analysis is also introduced. In the practical part the dependence between the number of hours and selected explanatory variables in chosen companies is examined. The result is an econometric model that is 90 % identical to the original data. The final model contains four explanatory variables. This is the <b>number</b> of received <b>invoices,</b> the <b>number</b> of issued <b>invoices,</b> the <b>number</b> of employees and experience of the accountant.

40|$|For (forensic) {{auditing}} purposes {{it is useful}} to have a wise view of how pro- cesses are performed in an organisation. Workflow mining can help in creating such a view by mining workflow models that give a visual representation of the processes. But not all organisations use workflow management systems that produce the needed event logs that are used as input for the workflow min- ing techniques. What this research is set to accomplish is to design a stepwise approach that extracts these event logs from corporate network data that is available in any organisation To accomplish this the stepwise approach must extract caseIDs, activities and the order in which the activities occur. The fo- cus of the approach is on the process around invoices. The approach that have been designed has four steps. 1. Indexing of the Corporate Network Data 2. Mining the <b>invoice</b> <b>numbers</b> to be used as caseIDs 3. Document discovery of all the documents that are related to the invoice process. 4. Extracting the activities those documents support. The case study shows that the event logs can indeed be created and a work- flow model is mined from those event logs. Thought the validation {{of the quality of the}} mined workflow model is very difficult. The approach does look promising for extracting event logs.

Thirty-nine top LTL carriers were called on to explain their perspectives and methodologies with regard to fuel surcharge policies. Part-to-whole qualitative analysis was conducted to summarize responses from a standardized interview protocol. In addition, 25 published fuel surcharge policies were obtained and analyzed to explore the disparities among LTL fuel surcharge policies. Findings show that, while carriers were reluctant to discuss their fuel surcharge development, in practice there were two primary methodologies that left all carriers with very similar fuel surcharge policies...|$|R
40|$|Too often, {{organizations}} that contract for software development services {{are at the}} mercy of vendors for cost and schedule estimates. Once a program office releases a request for proposal (RFP) for software development, it must somehow evaluate the validity of cost and schedule estimates that come back with the proposals. Or, a program might have a limited budget or schedule but not a clear understanding of what amount of development is actually feasible within these limitations. This article proposes an approach that can help buyers of software take control of this situation by providing the ability to objectively evaluate software development proposals, select the best value for their needs, and effectively manage acquisition costs from kickoff to product delivery. Just a few years ago, purchasing a new car was often a lopsided affair.
