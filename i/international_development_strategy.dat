40|$|From the {{perspectives}} of economic anthropology, feminist anthropology, and feminist theory, this applied anthropological study is an evaluation of a popular <b>international</b> <b>development</b> model targeting poor women. Based on the celebrated Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, the so-called 2 ̆ 2 microcredit 2 ̆ 2 model is designed as a poverty alleviation strategy to provide small loans to poor women in rural settings and is designed to facilitate microenterprise development. Due to {{the popularity of the}} microcredit model with the <b>international</b> <b>development</b> community, it is being replicated in different settings. Through an analysis of microenterprise development among Afro-Caribbean women, this study presents the argument that successful application of <b>international</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as the microcredit model, requires consideration of three critical factors if the objective is to facilitate economic empowerment. First, <b>international</b> <b>development</b> policy and practice has tended to homogenize women, enforce gender-typed work, and emphasize group structure regardless of recipients 2 ̆ 7 needs or preferences. Second, attempts by local governments to replicate the microcredit model may fail due to lack of commitment or inadequate infrastructure. Third, application of <b>international</b> <b>development</b> interventions, such as the microcredit model, must be tailored to fit the cultural and historical context as well as account for the needs and expectations of intended recipients...|$|R

40|$|Location {{theory is}} often downplayed in the {{orthodox}} development economics discipline because {{the limitations of}} natural endowments are less restrictive {{in the wake of}} mass transformation and industrialization. However, good determination of location-friendly economic development policies has largely been responsible for the development in China. Moreover, these policies have sacrificed the balanced development discipline, which has been regarded as an untouchable rule in the traditional socialist method of development. By first reviving the importance of location theory using the economic development in China as a primary example, this paper then extends location theory to the Korean <b>international</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> and the East Asian region. While the Chinese regional development strategy was based on economically plausible conditions supported by location theory, Korea’s strategy was biased toward a political rationale, which disregarded the logic of the market. The long-term success of government initiat-ed special economic zones depends heavily on finding compatible location elements sup-ported by economic factors. Thus, regional development should be based on rational consideration of economic needs, practical comparative advantages, and diversified pro-motional stimulations faithful to location theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{race between}} firms to acquire {{capacities}} worldwide has evolved in a chronological order which centered at first around products, then around position to move later on to skills and to focus currently on networks.

The present paper investigates the relationship between the internationalization strategies and logics and comes to the conclusion that, a particular logic is behind every choice made. Indeed, the present work was conducted within the Tunisian food enterprises and helped confirm this hypothesis as it was found out that the position logic is behind the choice of exportation and the creation of production subsidiaries while the choice of partnership is based on the logic of skills. The option for merger, on the other hand, is motivated by the networks logic...|$|R
40|$|Global {{development}} goals {{have become increasingly}} used by the United Nations {{and the international community}} to promote priority global objectives.

It analyses the MDGs as an example to argue that global goals activate the power of numbers to create incentives for national governments and others to mobilise action and galvanise support for important objectives. But the powers of simplification, reification and abstraction lead to broader unintended consequences when the goals are misinterpreted as national planning targets and strategic agendas, and when they enter the language of development to redefine concepts such as development and poverty...|$|R

This research poses the hypothesis that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is introduced as an enterpriselevel strategy to overcome the negative effects produced by the territory and to react to the diminution of value of the made in, in order to restore the level of competitiveness of the firm. CSR’ s behaviour can be implemented to SMEs too. For these firms, theory speaks about of a sunken and silent CSR.

A nuanced assessment of the potential effectiveness of fiscal decentralization reform around the world requires recognition of the following facts: (1) The intergovernmental dimension of public finance is critically important for the public sector to support economic growth and deliver public services in an effective and pro-poor manner. (2) Sound fiscal decentralization reforms require sound decentralized finances as well as sound decentralized governance and administration. (3) Not all countries are at the same stage of fiscal decentralization, and different policy responses are appropriate under different conditions. (4) There is an institutional bia...|$|E

The Chief Directorate: Population Development {{which is}} {{responsible}} for the implementation of the Population Development Programme and the Rural Foundation, regard the community <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> {{as one of the most}} important means of improving the quality of life of the population and especially of the farm worker. Against the above-mentioned background this study firstly draws a comparison between the levels of development of Third World inhabitants, the Third World component in South Africa and farm workers. In this regard it is concluded that the level of development of farm workers corresponds with that of Third World inhabitants, and that they are even worse off than the rest of the third World component in South Africa. Secondly, the community <b>development</b> <b>strategy,</b> which forms part of South Africa's official development policy, is being evaluated with regard to other existing <b>international</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies.</b> It is concluded that the community <b>development</b> <b>strategy</b> is a potentially useful tool for the furthering of development. Lastly, a synthesis is made between the theory and practice of the community development approach, within a suggested implementation model. The implementation model (see Diagrams 1 to 4) is developed incrementally in this study according to the following three schools of thought most commonly applied in practice: Endogenous initiative,where the community acts solely on its own initiative; Exogenous initiative, where the community's latent initiative is stimulated by an outside catalyst; and Concerted initiative, where the community does have its own initiative, but needs help from outside and consequently invites the help of (for instance) a community developer...|$|R
40|$|The collection, primary processing, and {{subsequent}} sale of shea-based products make {{an important contribution}} to rural women’s cash income in many of Mali’s shea producing areas. Internationally, shea has recently become popular in high-valued cosmetics thanks to its therapeutic properties — a deviation away from its historic use as a cheap cocoa-butter substitute. For these reasons, <b>international</b> <b>development</b> actors have targeted the Malian shea value chain as part of their private-sector-development and rural-poverty-alleviation programs and strategies. Information asymmetry in the production and marketing of shea has led to a “Market for Lemons ” scenario much like that described by Akerlof (1970), thereby compromising the subsector’s potential to serve as a powerful source of rural income growth and poverty alleviation. A combination of tools is used to describe the Malian shea value chain, including the “Structure, Conduct, Performance ” framework borrowed from the industrial organization literature and the “Subsector Studies ” approach popular in current export-led <b>international</b> <b>development</b> <b>strategies.</b> Analogies from subsectors historically plagued by adverse selection and moral hazard are used to identify potential leverage points and intervention strategies for stakeholders to help improve shea quality and returns to primary producers.
