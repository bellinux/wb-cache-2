5|$|The {{ship was}} {{transferred}} to the Ministry of War Transport, which renamed her Empire Simba and assigned Andrew Weir & Co. of London to manage her. After spending six weeks at Methil, where she had an advanced ship <b>degaussing</b> <b>system</b> installed among other repairs, Empire Simba proceeded to Oban via Lyness in mid November. She set out for North America in Convoy OB-253 on 2 December. Four days out, heavy weather dispersed the convoy, and Empire Simba proceeded independently. The ship continued to take a beating from heavy seas which opened the number one cargo hold to the ocean. Because the water was coming in faster than the bilge pumps in the hold number one could pump, the crew cut through the bulkheads into cargo hold number two to double the pumping capacity and were able to keep the ship under control long enough to arrive in Bermuda on 26 December. After temporary repairs were made there, Empire Simba sailed on 6 January 1942 first to Halifax and then to Baltimore for more permanent repairs.|$|E

50|$|Two large fans {{located on}} each side create an air cushion between the two hulls and a front and aft rubber skirt, lifting the vessel, giving small drag and a high cruise speed, as well as low {{susceptibility}} to the shock of exploding mines since {{only a small portion}} of the hull is actually exposed in the water.

Taking the ship’s magnetic field and its gradient reduction into account, the problem is treated as a multi-objective optimization problem. First a set of scale factors are calculated by LDW-PSO to scale the two kinds of objective function, then the multi-objective optimization problem is transformed to a single objective optimization problem via a set of proper weights, and the problem is solved by LDW-PSO finally. A typical ship <b>degaussing</b> <b>system</b> is applied to test the method’s validity, and the results are good...|$|E
