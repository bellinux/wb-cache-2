25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E

Jae' Jones of Yahoo! noted that Sharon's actions would always lead her back to Adam. After Adam is attacked (losing his vision), Sharon brings him back to his mother's farm in Kansas and they become engaged. After returning to Genoa City, however, she leaves Adam when his additional past crimes come to light. After marrying Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), Adam helps Sharon through an emotional breakdown (which drove her to burn down Victor's home) and covers <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> so she is not arrested. Sharon and Adam's attraction drove a wedge between him and Chelsea. Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential considered Chelsea [...] "out of her league" [...] against Sharon.

Scully chases the kidnapper as he flees, but stops in <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> when he runs along a gantry beneath the brewery's logoa leering blue devil. The gantry gives way, and the kidnapper falls to his death. Scully speaks to Boggs again, to whom she tells that if he had orchestrated the kidnapping, the kidnapper would have been aware of the danger he warned her about, hence refraining from crossing that gantry [...] and that he saved her life as well as the boy's life. He then claims to be able to contact her father and offers to relay one last message to her from him if she will attend his execution.|$|E
500|$|... "Not on Drugs" [...] is {{the opening}} track on Tove Lo's debut {{extended}} play, Truth Serum. According to the artist, {{the songs on}} the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship from beginning to end, which started [...] "really happy and passionate". Following the narrative of Truth Serum, the track conveys the time when Lo was [...] "really {{in love with someone}} and [...] think straight" [...] and felt [...] "high" [...] all the time. She also stated that she wanted to write a happy and euphoric song that represented the positive beginning of her relationships, since most of <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> are about the decay of them. In an interview with MTV UK, the artist said, [...] "'Not On Drugs' is, like many of my songs so far, about love. At least it's about the happy kind of love where you feel like there's nothing that can get you higher than the person you're with and have these feelings for". [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was also included in [...] "The Love" [...] section of Lo's debut studio record, Queen of the Clouds, a concept album that describes the pattern of the singer's relationships.|$|E
500|$|After {{uploading}} {{a few of}} <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> to her YouTube channel, Del Rey {{was discovered}} and got signed by Stranger Records to release her debut single [...] "Video Games". She told The Observer that [...] "Video Games" [...] was never {{intended to be a}} single, but she enjoyed the video and uploaded on the internet. The song earned her a Q Award for [...] "Next Big Thing" [...] in October 2011. Later that month, she signed a joint record deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album, Born to Die. Del Rey built anticipation to the album by doing a number of live appearances, such as promotional concerts at the Bowery Ballroom and at the Chateau Marmont, and with performances at television shows such as De Wereld Draait Door, and Later... with Jools Holland. To further promote the upcoming release of Born to Die, Interscope Records released the EP in the United States and Canada on January 10, 2012.

500|$|Badu {{composed}} {{more than}} 75 songs {{within the year}} and intended on splitting them among her planned series of New Amerykah albums. She said of her productivity with her laptop, [...] "I could be here, in my own space, with headphones on, and the kids could be doing what they doing, and I’m cooking dinner still, I’m making juices still, and it’s so easy just to sing. You got an idea — boom! Idea, boom!" [...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b> Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E
500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover <b>her</b> <b>tracks.</b> In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as he knows how to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have done it in a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

500|$|The Russians {{were spotted}} {{early on the}} morning of 27 May by Japanese ships as they entered the Korea Strait en route to Vladivostok. During the {{subsequent}} battle Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron and was initially the target of at least two battleships and a pair of armored cruisers when the Japanese opened fire at 14:10. As the Japanese approached, Rozhestvensky ordered the fleet to move from line ahead formation to parallel columns and Oslyabya was forced to almost stop in <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> to avoid hitting the battleship , the last ship of Rozhestvensky's division, as she maneuvered. Almost immediately, the shells began inflicting damage, knocking out the rangefinder, wounding the gunnery officer and severing the cables connecting the guns to the Geisler fire-control system. Other hits shot away the mainmast and knocked out the forward gun turret as well as three of the port six-inch guns. Splinters from one of the many hits entered her conning tower, killing the quartermaster and wounding most of the men inside. This caused the ship to fall out of line to starboard and she was engaged by six Japanese armored cruisers at short range. More serious were several large-caliber shells that struck along the ship's waterline about 15 minutes into the engagement that caused major flooding; they opened up enough of the ship's bow to the sea that her forward motion forced more and more water into her hull and she began listing to port. Flooding of her starboard forward magazine was ordered in an attempt to counteract the list, but it just added more weight forward and destroyed the ship's stability. Oslyabyas list increased to 12 degrees at 14:20, flooding many of the lower turrets. Her funnels touched the water around 15:10 and Ber ordered [...] "abandon ship". The ship sank a few minutes later, with her starboard propeller still turning, taking Ber and 470 of her crew with her.|$|E

2500|$|Ovid likens Ceres' {{devotion to}} her own {{offspring}} {{to that of a}} cow to its calf; but she is also as the originator of bloody animal sacrifice, a necessity in the renewal of life. She has a particular enmity towards her own sacrificial animal, the pig. Pigs offend her by their destructive rooting-up of field crops under her protection; and in the myth of Proserpina's abduction on the plains of Henna (Enna), <b>her</b> <b>tracks</b> were obscured by their trampling. If not for them, Ceres might have been spared the toils and grief of her lengthy search and separation.
