5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the town following a fire in 1731. After this the town's importance grew as it became a centre for clothmaking across Somerset and Devon, its <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> trade centre enhanced by fires in Taunton and Tiverton. By the 1831 census, 258 people were recorded as cloth workers in Wellington.|$|E

5|$|The archaeological {{value of}} the site does not compare with its <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> rock art collection. The {{findings}} do, however, support the shamanist origin of the engravings because food remains from the site proved to be bones of small antelope, rock dassie and even lizards rather than the large species depicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{inscriptions}} in South India suggest sallekhana {{was originally}} an ascetic practice which later extended to Jain householders. Its <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> an ideal {{death in the}} spiritual life of householders ceased by about the 12th century. The practice was revived in 1955 by the Digambara monk Acharya Santisagara.|$|E
5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater <b>importance,</b> <b>as</b> the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics.

5|$|Ashford's <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> an {{agricultural}} and market town {{grew in the}} 13th century, and in 1243, King Henry III granted the town a charter to hold a market for livestock. The pottery industry expanded in the 13th and 14th centuries, with the main works based at what is now Potter's Corner, a few {{miles west of the}} town centre. Later evidence from examining waste suggests that production was on a large scale. The Kent Archaeological society have discovered sandy ware at this location dating from around 1125 – 1250.|$|E
5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in the years since, with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to {{the erosion of the}} highway's shoulders. In mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a through route for commuters traveling to and from the village of Malone.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places in historic times. While Axbridge grew in <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era and the advent of tourism.|$|E

5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> the political center eclipsed its <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
5|$|Chiprovtsi {{is thought}} to have been founded in the Late Middle Ages as a mining and metalsmithing centre. Attracting German ore miners who {{introduced}} Roman Catholicism to the area, the town grew in <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a cultural, economic and religious centre of the Bulgarian Catholics and the entire Bulgarian northwest during the first few centuries of Ottoman rule. The apogee of this upsurge was the anti-Ottoman Chiprovtsi Uprising of 1688. After the suppression of the uprising, some of the town's population fled to Habsburg-ruled lands; those unable to flee were killed or enslaved by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|Dating back to 1910, {{the route}} US6 follows was {{originally}} the Great White Way and River-to-River Road. Both were auto trails which connected Council Bluffs and Davenport. When the U.S. Highway System {{was created in}} 1926, the highway was designated U.S. Highway 32. US 32 was renumbered in 1931 as US6 was extended to the west coast. As the Interstate Highway System expanded in the 1950-1970s, US6's <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a cross-state route was diminished by I-80. As a result, the least-traveled sections of the route were moved onto I-80 {{and control of the}} vacated sections of highway was given to local jurisdictions.|$|E

At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Samuel Johnson.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Ashford's <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a {{transport}} hub and its location between {{the continent and}} London made it a target for aerial bombing. A bomb fell on the railway works on 25 March 1917, killing 61 people, while the town was a target in the Battle of Britain during World War II, including an attack on 15 September 1940.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's <b>importance</b> <b>as</b> a {{major port}} saw it become {{a target for}} the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb {{exploded}} in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
