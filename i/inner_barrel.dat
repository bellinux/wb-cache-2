5000|$|These are bolt-action [...] "sniper" [...] rifles. Before each shot is fired, {{the shooter}} has {{to pull the}} bolt, cock the piston and load a BB into the chamber. All three {{versions}} of the VSR-10 share the same stock, same internals and same air chamber. The Pro-sniper version has a black stock, 430 mm long <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> and is the most accurate of the three versions. The Real Shock version has a metal weight in the piston to simulate recoil. Real Shock has a simulated wooden stock and the same 430 mm long <b>inner</b> <b>barrel.</b> However, due to the vibration caused by the heavier piston's impact, Real Shock is the least accurate of the three, albeit only by less than an inch difference at 20 m distance.

Due to short <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> its accuracy is close to Real Shock, but a couple mm more accurate. A needle-like contraption called air brake protrudes from the piston. The air brake plugs the cylinder before piston impacts, trapping {{a small amount of}} air between the piston and cylinder. This reduces impact vibration and adds to VSR series' unique accuracy.|$|E

50|$|This forward-moving barrel {{has given}} rise to the view that the Gat is not an air weapon at all, but simply a spring catapult. This is incorrect.

50|$|The Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX DG HSM is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a metal mount. This lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 1.4 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth-of-field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains eight lens elements, including one aspherical lens element. This lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a ring USM motor. Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the outer body barrel is longer than the <b>inner</b> lens <b>barrel,</b> when the <b>inner</b> lens <b>barrel</b> is at its longest extension. This results in the lens maintaining the same overall length no matter where the point of focus lies.|$|R

5000|$|Airsoft guns can be {{modified}} to increase pellet velocity, rate of fire, reliability, or accuracy/range. For an electric airsoft gun, the pellet velocity can be increased by two different methods. The first is upgrading the <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> of the gun. The <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> is what the BB travels within while in the gun. Stock AEG inner barrels are usually between 6.05-6.10mm. An airsoft <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> is considered [...] "tight-bore" [...] when the inner diameter is less than 6.05mm. Typically, tight-bore barrels that are 6.03mm in diameter are installed into stock AEGs, so that accuracy {{as well as an}} up to 30fps increase is enjoyed by the player. Tighter bores risk a higher chance of pellet jams and a need for higher quality pellets and require more lubrication as well as a larger cylinder inside the gear-box in some cases(to contain more air to be forced through, most commonly called a [...] "bore-up" [...] upgrade). Tight-bore barrel upgrades as small as 6.01mm are usually reserved for high-powered sniper rifles. The second is simply upgrading the mainspring. Doing this will increase the air pressure subjected to the pellet produced during operation. But due to the higher forces at play, it is advised that other parts should be upgraded together with the mainspring in order to maintain a high level of reliability. The rate of fire is increased by using a battery with a higher voltage, high-speed ratio gears and/or a high-speed motor. Rates of fire can be increased to over 20 rounds per second with very few upgrades, but with careful selection and extreme modification of gearbox components, rates of fire in excess of 50 rounds per second are not unheard of. In the case of gas guns, a higher pellet velocity can be achieved through the use of different types of gases and/or changing the valve. Some gases have detrimental effects to some plastic components inside the airsoft gun.|$|E

50|$|The {{drying pistol}} {{consists}} of two concentric barrels; the inner is connected to a vacuum source via a trap.

5000|$|The {{reliability}} of the rifle's accuracy has also raised some complaints from owners.

50|$|On {{the female}} plug, the outer body is {{metallic}} and cylindrical in shape, and comprises {{one of the}} two contacts.

50|$|In early {{practice}} of autofrettage {{of a gun}} barrel, the barrel was pressurized hydraulically. In modern practice, a slightly oversized die is pushed slowly through the barrel by a hydraulically driven ram. The amount of initial underbore and oversize of the die are calculated to strain the material around the bore past its elastic limit into plastic deformation. A residual compressive stress remains on the <b>barrel's</b> <b>inner</b> surface, even after final honing and rifling.|$|R
50|$|Airsoft guns {{commonly}} {{come with}} mounts or rails {{on which the}} airsofter can add external accessories. Some common customizations added are flashlights, scopes and lasers. Many airsoft guns are made 1:1 in scale and detailing to their realsteel counterparts, but few are able to safely swap external components. Airsoft replicas of real scopes are commonly made available for sale {{at a much lower}} price (sometimes thousands of dollars less). The replicas differ from their real-steel counterparts in that the replicas are not made to function in a high-recoil environment such as that in of an actual firearm. In no way can an airsoft rifle be modified to shoot real ammunition. In most cases, add-ons are more for aesthetics than performance. However, scopes can allow for greater precision at longer ranges with proper firing technique by the user/operator (the installation of a scope does not physically make the gun fire pellets more accurately). Other attachments, such as replica grenade launchers can act as under-barrel shotguns, and a mock silencer can be added to provide concealment for a longer <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> therefore improving accuracy and range.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ballistics}} {{of spring}} or electrically powered airsoft guns differ from real firearms in that a longer barrel will not always result in better accuracy. In spring/electric airsoft equipment, barrel length {{does not have}} a significant effect on accuracy. The [...] "sweet spot" [...] for barrel length in a spring/electric powered airsoft gun is around 450 mm. Past that length, added barrel length will not improve accuracy. In any case, barrel quality, velocity consistency, and hopup quality/design are more important factors with regard to accuracy. Added barrel length will result in slightly increased velocity if the cylinder size and compression are appropriate for the barrel length. For example, a gun with a large cylinder and a long barrel will shoot slightly harder than a gun with a small cylinder and a short barrel (ceteris paribus). This rule will apply even for barrels longer than 500 mm, if there is enough cylinder volume and air compression to propel the pellet through the barrel. However, the resulting velocity increase will be hardly noticeable. The only considerable advantage of using a longer <b>inner</b> <b>barrel</b> in an AEG or spring powered gun is that it generally will make the gun quieter.|$|E
5000|$|Another common upgrade done by {{players is}} in the [...] "hop-up" [...] system, {{featured}} in most mid- to high-end AEG's, as well as gas guns and spring sniper rifles. In this system, {{the wall of a}} rubber tube, called a bucking, is forced into the upper path of the pellet right before it begins flying down the <b>inner</b> <b>barrel.</b> This contact imparts backspin, which in turn gives the pellet a Magnus lift to maintain a flatter trajectory {{for a longer period of}} time. This is adjusted by screws or gears that cause the bucking to only show a small or large presence in the barrel. Different degrees of firmness of the rubber are considered when a hop-up is being upgraded. The hop-up can either make or break an airsoft gun's range and accuracy: too much hop-up makes the pellet fly very straight, but can also cause it take a sharp curve upward toward the end of its flight. If a light enough BB is used, adjusting the hop-up can even cause the trajectory to curve upwards straight out of the barrel. The hop-up is adjusted around the weight of the pellet and the speed at which it is leaving the barrel. A well-tuned hop-up puts just enough spin on the pellet to maximize its range without drastically effecting the curvature of its trajectory.|$|E
