40|$|Copper {{antimony}} sulfide, CuSbS 2 nanoparticles {{have a large}} {{potential of}} being a good thermoelectric material because they {{are made up of}} <b>earth</b> <b>abundant</b> elements. Thermoelectric materials can convert thermal energy into electricity, so that the wasted energy can be saved. Also, by using this <b>earth</b> <b>abundant</b> material, we can make thermoelectric materials much cheaper. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} CuSbS 2 could have a large Seebeck coefficient, one of the most important factors of thermoelectric materials, because of the complexity of its band structure. The other hypothesis is that thermal transport could be significantly suppressed through nanostructuring. There are three main methods used in this study. First, the synthesis (mass production) of the CuSbS 2 nanoparticles was performed by a redox reaction in an oxygen-free environment. The second method is the material characterization including electron microscopy X-ray diffraction and energy dispersion spectroscopy. Finally, the thermoelectric properties characterization was performed, including the measurements of Seebeck coefficients and electrical conductivities. The initial results show comparable thermoelectric performance to other thermoelectric materials made by <b>earth</b> <b>abundant</b> elements.

Here, direct ethanol based dip coating of <b>earth</b> <b>abundant</b> Cu 2 NiSnS 4 (CNTS) films on soda lime glass (SLG), molybdenum coated glass (Mo), and fluorine doped tin oxide coated glass (FTO) substrates is investigated. The structural and morphological properties of pre-annealed and sulfurized CNTS films coated on SLG, FTO, and Mo substrates are reported. The influence of dipping cycles on composition and optoelectronic properties of preannealed and sulfurized CNTS films deposited on SLG substrate is presented. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis reveal how changes in thickness and elemental composition affect morphology and optoelectronic properties. The obtained absorption coefficient, optical bandgap, resistivity and mobility of pre -annealed and sulfurized films are found to be 104 cm(- 1), 1. 5 eV, 0. 48 cm, 3. 4 cm(2) /Vs and 104 cm(- 1), 1. 29 eV, 0. 14 Omega cm, 11. 0 cm(2) /Vs, respectively.

40|$|Nanocrystals from non-toxic, <b>earth</b> <b>abundant</b> {{materials}} have recently received great interest for their potential large-scale application in photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Here, we {{report for the}} first time on the shape-controlled and scalable synthesis of phase-pure pyrite (FeS 2) nanocrystals employing the simple, inexpensive, thermal reaction of iron–oleylamine complexes with sulfur in oleylamine. Either dendritic nanocrystals (nanodendrites) or nanocubes are obtained by adjusting the iron-oleylamine concentration and thereby controlling the nucleus concentration and kinetics of the nanocrystal growth. Pyrite nanodendrites are reversibly assembled by washing with toluene and redispersed by adding the ligand oleylamine. The assembly–redispersion-process is accompanied by an increased absorption in the red/near-infrared spectral region for the aggregated state. This increased low-energy absorption is due to interactions between the closed-packed nanocrystals. High-concentration nanodendrite dispersions are used to prepare pyrite thin films with strong broadband extinction in the visible and near-infrared. These films are attractive candidates for light harvesting in all inorganic solar cells based on <b>earth</b> <b>abundant,</b> non-toxic materials as well as for photocatalytic applications. ...|$|R
