40|$|In 2012 some {{children}} developed sepsis after playing {{together with a}} soap bubble toy. Microbiological testing revealed heavy contamination of the soap solution, which reasonably represented the vehicle of infection. We investigated the issue with a multidisciplinary approach: review of toy safety legislation; microbiological testing of additional samples; query of the RAPEX database for noncompliant soap bubbles; identification of major manufacturing districts. Microbiological contamination of <b>industrial</b> <b>soap</b> bubbles was widespread. Sixty-three notifications of batches contaminated by environmental microorganisms and opportunistic pathogens had been reported. The Chinese had a virtual monopoly of the soap bubble market. We identified two main manufacturing districts in Guangdong Province, both notable for degradation of their water resources. The use of untreated water for the industrial production of soap bubbles may explain the bacterial contamination. Existing legislation provides an unsatisfactory approach for managing microbiological hazards in sensitive toy categories and for identifying responsible parties in import and export of the products...|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays {{there is}} still in hardly any local use of Allanblackia seed oil as people prefer use of easily {{available}} liquid oils and cheap <b>industrial</b> <b>soaps.</b> The allanblackia tree has predominantly been used for timber in the last decades and hence the number of trees has significantly reduced [...] Most of the allanblackia trees nowadays remaining in the wild are growing in the East Usambara Mountains which provides the right climate for this tree. As a result, even today the volumes of oil available from wild-harvesting are still very small.|$|R

The smokehouse recycles all meat grease and vegetable oil used in the restaurant by sending the refuse to a local rendering plant. The grease from the meat is rendered into <b>industrial</b> <b>soaps</b> and cleaners and the vegetable oil is turned into bio-diesel fuel. All of the take-out materials and cups, plates, and utensils are biodegradable. The cups are made from corn, most of the utensils are made from potato starch, and the take-out materials are made from bamboo rather than the styrofoam material used {{in the majority of}} BBQ restaurants.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFormulation of {{efficient}} lubrication {{procedures for}} multi-pass steel wire drawing {{is a problem}} of prime importance. One studies the performances of <b>industrial</b> <b>soaps</b> in stainless steel wire drawing by experiments. Before drawing, the wire is pickled and covered with salt. One measures the drawing force, die average temperature, and the total residual film surface weight and observes the drawn wire surface by scanning electron microscope. The influence of the drawing velocity u in the range 0. 1 - 10 m/s, the nature of the stearate (Na, Ca) and the filler amount, the salt surface weight, the wire roughness and yield stress, and the die angle are studied. Results demonstrate that quasi-hydrodynamic lubrication is induced by a mixture of salt and soap; calcium stearate is well adapted to the lowest velocities, whereas sodium stearate has better performances at the highest velocities. Rheological origins of these differences are discusse...|$|R

5000|$|Soybean meal {{is used in}} {{food and}} animal feeds, principally as a protein supplement, {{but also as a}} source of metabolizable energy. Typically 1 bushel (i.e. 60 lbs. or 27.2 kg) of {{soybeans}} yields 48 lbs. (21.8 kg) of soybean meal. Some, but not all, soybean meal is produced from the residue left after oil extraction. (Removal of the oil, which is used mostly in food, but also for <b>industrial</b> oils, <b>soaps</b> and biodiesel, involves crushing and either pressing or solvent extraction.) Some, but not all, soybean meal contains ground soybean hulls. Soybean meal is heat-treated during production, to denature the trypsin inhibitors of soybeans, which would otherwise interfere with protein digestion.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{petrochemical}} industry {{can be traced}} back to the oil works of James Young in Scotland and Abraham Pineo Gesner in Canada. The first plastic was invented by Alexander Parkes, an English metallurgist. In 1856, he patented Parkesine, a celluloid based on nitrocellulose treated with a variety of solvents. This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The <b>industrial</b> production of <b>soap</b> from vegetable oils was started by William Lever and his brother James in 1885 in Lancashire based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used glycerin and vegetable oils.|$|R
40|$|Mangrove {{products}} have been historically {{used by many}} indigenous populations in tropical coastal areas worldwide. One {{of these is the}} use of mangrove ashes to extract alkali for soap production. However, until recent times, few examples of industrial uses (i. e. transformation of raw material by artificial, non-artisanal means into secondary products) of mangrove were restricted to the use of tannins in the leather industry (Lacerda, 1999). We report here one of the first, if not the very first, example of industrial use of mangrove products, which was also {{regarded as one of the}} initial steps in the development of the Brazilian chemical industry: the development in the early 19 th century of an industrial process of hard soap production based on mangrove leaves ash in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Lacerda, 1999). Soap has been known by mankind for about 2, 000 years, as a mixture of alkali and fatty materials, in general animal fat. Before the invention of the Le Blanc and more recently the Solvay process of saponification, natural sources of alkali were obtained by evaporation of naturally alkaline waters, relatively rare and time consuming or the leaching of bulk wood ash, which gave very low yields. These two sources hampered the development of an actual, large-scale <b>industrial</b> process of <b>soap</b> making, keeping its production as an artisanal method for millennia (Shreve & Brink, 1977). In this context, mangroves played a key, but unsuspected role in the <b>industrial</b> production of <b>soap</b> and in the development of 19 th century Brazilian chemical industry. On 25 th January 1812...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{adoption}} of service-oriented architectures based on web services in industrial automation promises increased interoperability and flexibility. However, industrial automation requires real-time processing, i. e. a task {{has to be}} processed within a specific deadline, which is a large obstacle for utilizing web services in this domain. The Time-Constrained Services (TiCS) framework meets the demands of industrial automation and empowers automation engineers to develop, deploy, publish, compose, and invoke time-constrained web services. This paper presents the TiCS real-time <b>SOAP</b> engine for <b>industrial</b> PCs called <b>SOAP</b> 4 IPC. It permits the execution of web services in realtime. The architecture of the SOAP 4 IPC engine, implementation details, and experimental results are discussed. I...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>industrial</b> {{production}} of <b>soap</b> involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition {{of fat and}} removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional batch processes. The three variations are the cold process, wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled process, wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{production}} of biodiesel fuel in Egypt by the transesterification of vegetable oils is being {{faced with the}} problem of feedstock shortage. Egypt imports annually about 90 % of its needs as edible oils for human consumption. The {{production of}} biodiesel by direct esterification of fatty acids that can be obtained from the oil and <b>soap</b> <b>industrial</b> sector in huge quantities each year (around 16 thousand tons) may be a proper solution to this problem. According to results of a previous study [1], the biodiesel produced following this approach and using methyl alcohol was quite efficient as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. However, the process should be economically feasible for application on an industrial scale. The present study assessed the economic feasibility of biodiesel production by direct fatty acid esterification. Complete process simulation was first carried out using the process simulation software, Aspen HYSYS V 7. 0. The process was then designed comprising four main steps being esterification, solvent recovery, catalyst removal and water removal. The main processing units include the reactor, distillation column, heat exchangers, pumps and separators. Assuming that the rate of fatty acids esterified was 2 Â ton/h, all process units required have been sized. Total capital investment, total manufacturing cost and return on investment were all estimated. The latter was found to be 117. 1 % which means that the production process is quite economically feasible...|$|R
