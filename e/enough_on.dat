5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the vehicular river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E

5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E

5|$|One {{man in the}} crowd, Leon Czolgosz, {{hoped to}} assassinate McKinley. He {{had managed to get}} close to the presidential podium, but did not fire, {{uncertain}} of hitting his target. Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg lived most of {{his later}} life in Lafayette, California, where he devoted himself to editing and {{publishing}} the journals that documented both his early life and later career. He rallied {{a group of scientists}} who criticized the science curriculum in the state of California, which he viewed as far too socially oriented and not nearly focused <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> hard science. California Governor Pete Wilson appointed Seaborg to head a committee that proposed changes to California's science curriculum despite outcries from labor organizations and others.|$|E
5|$|The Tevis novel {{had been}} optioned several times, {{including}} by Frank Sinatra, but attempts to adapt {{it for the}} screen were unsuccessful.

Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool-themed play called Corner Pocket, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.|$|E

5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not {{confident}} that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder's size did not appear big <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver a good show. Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the 1988–89 Football League season was contested at Anfield between Liverpool and Arsenal, {{the top two}} teams in the First Division, on 26 May 1989.

5|$|The party truce {{ended in}} 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's {{handling}} of the territorial dispute between the German Confederation and Denmark known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office. Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the July 1865 general election. In {{the wake of the}} poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.|$|E

5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{training}} ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts. Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> the performances of the team.|$|E
5|$|When {{high levels}} of {{phosphorus}} and mercury were discovered in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

Sensing his own {{inability}} to help, he trains {{much harder to}} learn the two succession techniques in Kamiya Kasshin-ryū. Such moves allow him to block an opponent's attack and then hit him with his weapon. He successfully learns both of this techniques and becomes so adept at using them, that Yahiko starts performing several variations. He uses these moves against one of Enishi's partners Otowa Hyōko and defeats him. While Yahiko rests from to his injuries, Kaoru is kidnapped by Enishi, and Yahiko and his friends start searching for her. When another of Enishi's comrades, Kujiranami Hyōgo escapes from jail and goes on a rampage, Yahiko stands up against him. However, he is not strong <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> his own to defeat him and Kenshin saves him at the last moment. After he and Kenshin recover from their fight injuries, they go to rescue Kaoru from Enishi. While on his island fortress, Yahiko defeats {{one of the four}} bodyguards from Enishi's partner, Heishin, and witnesses Kenshin's fight against Enishi, which Kenshin wins. Five years later, he is the acting instructor at the Kamiya Kasshin-ryū dojo. One day Kenshin calls him to test his skills; when he lands a hit on Kenshin, he gives Yahiko his own reverse-blade sword as a sign that he has become a true samurai.|$|E
5|$|By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed well <b>enough</b> <b>on</b> {{the violin}} {{to gain a}} {{position}} with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After {{less than a year}} at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Frank Oz voices Yoda, the centuries-old {{leader of}} the Jedi Council who is {{apprehensive}} about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls. Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted In & Out. A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis portrays him in the scene in which Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight. Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well <b>enough.</b> <b>On</b> the Blu-ray release of The Phantom Menace, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda {{similar to the one}} from the other prequels is used instead.|$|E
