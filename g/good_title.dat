25|$|Adverse {{possession}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} contentious methods of acquiring property, albeit one that has played a huge role in the history of English land. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a <b>good</b> <b>title.</b> This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the middle ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned.|$|E
25|$|The Holocaust {{also had}} {{a major impact on}} works of art created before the Holocaust. The reason is that huge amounts of works of art were looted by the Nazis from Jewish art {{collectors}} and dealers, either through outright theft or fire sales under extreme duress. Although the original owners were in turn brutally murdered during the Holocaust, many of their relatives survived, and naturally would like to retrieve their long-lost family heirlooms. A current owner cannot simply plead ignorance of an artwork's terrible history, since a thief can never convey <b>good</b> <b>title.</b> One who purchases stolen property from a thief must give the property back to its rightful owner and sue the thief (if he has not already vanished) for fraud to get one's money back.|$|E

500|$|Games journalists regard Undead Nightmare {{as among}} the best {{expansion}}s. Kotaku wrote of its originality, despite the trite zombie theme, and added that the expansion functioned best when Rockstar used the game's silly pretense to exercise their sense of humor, with undead versions of normal animals, and new mythical creatures. The reviewer related the game's level of entertainment to it being the first Rockstar release in years to [...] "wholeheartedly embrace the inherently madcap nature of open world games". Undead Nightmare took a <b>good</b> <b>title</b> and [...] "put it over the top", as USgamer put it. Hardcore Gamer cited the expansion {{as an example of}} downloadable content that would have never fit in the main game but instead let the developers explore other ideas.|$|E

He tells an interrogator a convoluted story about events that led him and his partners in crime to the boat, and about a mysterious mob boss known as Keyser Söze who commissioned their work. Using flashback and narration, Kint's story becomes increasingly complex. It was shot on a $6 million budget and began as a title taken from a column in Spy magazine called The Usual Suspects, after one of Claude Rains' most memorable lines in the classic film Casablanca, and Singer thought that it would make a <b>good</b> <b>title</b> for a film.|$|E

500|$|Bryan Singer met Kevin Spacey {{at a party}} after a {{screening}} of the young filmmaker's first film, Public Access, at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival. Spacey had been encouraged {{by a number of}} people he knew who had seen it, and was so impressed that he told Singer and McQuarrie {{that he wanted to be}} in whatever film they did next. Singer read a column in Spy magazine called [...] "The Usual Suspects" [...] after Claude Rains' line in Casablanca. Singer thought that it would be a <b>good</b> <b>title</b> for a film. When asked by a reporter at Sundance what their next film was about, McQuarrie replied, [...] "I guess it's about a bunch of criminals who meet in a police line-up," [...] which incidentally was the first visual idea that he and Singer had for the poster: [...] "five guys who meet in a line-up," [...] Singer remembers. The director also envisioned a tagline for the poster, [...] "All of you can go to Hell." [...] Singer then asked the question, [...] "What would possibly bring these five felons together in one line-up?" [...] McQuarrie revamped an idea from one of his own unpublished screenplays — the story of a man who murders his own family and disappears. The writer mixed this with the idea of a team of criminals.|$|E

2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son.

The success of the title applications, he maintained, did {{not depend on the}} odometer readings, although Schmuck might have been committing mail fraud if he had mailed the original odometer slips himself. Scalia said he was contradicting his earlier argument that the mail was utterly irrelevant to the scheme, to which Steinberg said [...] "ou {{have to be able to}} point out how the mailing contributed to the success of the scheme." ...|$|E

Many film adaptations have not used Dick's original titles. When asked why this was, Dick's ex-wife Tessa said, [...] "Actually, the books rarely carry Phil's original titles, as the editors usually wrote new titles after reading his manuscripts. Phil often commented that he couldn't write <b>good</b> <b>titles.</b> If he could, {{he would have been}} an advertising writer instead of a novelist."

2500|$|One {{area which}} English law takes outside the {{ordinary}} law of misrepresentation {{is what is}} typically called [...] "mistakes" [...] about identity. In this group of cases, the common fact pattern is that Alice gives a valuable good to Bob thinking that Bob will pay. Bob is a fraudster and has misrepresented his identity or creditworthiness or both, and has left Alice with a dud cheque, or simply does not fulfil a promise to pay later. The valuable good is then sold by Bob to Claire. Bob disappears and cannot be charged for fraud. Alice finds that Claire has the valuable good and sues Claire to get back the good. The dilemma courts face is whether to prefer one innocent party over another innocent party. Alice has {{been a victim of}} fraudulent misrepresentation. Claire is also defrauded in the sense that Bob represented to her that he had <b>good</b> <b>title</b> to the good he sold on. Claire has paid good money for the good. But because Bob cannot be found, Alice has no remedy.|$|E
2500|$|Were {{the issue}} treated {{as one of}} {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, the simple equitable principle to be applied {{would be that the}} contract is voidable unless third party rights have intervened. The defrauded party (Alice, in the example) has a right to rescind the contract, until the point where Claire's rights had intervened. Claire could be considered a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any pre-existing interest, and should take full title to the property. This was essentially the approach advocated in Lewis v Averay. However, it is not the stance English law is currently taking. In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson the House of Lords by three to two decided to uphold an older line of authority which declares a contract void from the start. If there was never any contract between the seller and the fraudster, the fraudster cannot sell any property right to the third party, because they never had a good property right in the first place. This follows the Latin maxim, nemo dat quod non habet, that one cannot give what one does not have. So the present law is that if a person deals with another by distance (and not face to face, in which case there is deemed to be no [...] "mistake" [...] about identity), that person's presumed identity is recorded in a document, {{and it turns out that}} that person is in fact an uncreditworthy [...] "rogue" [...] then the third party cannot acquire <b>good</b> <b>title</b> and the good must be returned to the original person who is defrauded. The minority of the House of Lords (Lord Nicholls and Lord Millett) preferred to follow Lewis v Averay, which is in line with the law across Europe, in the United States and most of the rest of the world.|$|E
