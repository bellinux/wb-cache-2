Iron defi-ciency is {{a major cause of}} anemia that is resistant to erythro-poietin therapy in dialysis patients (1); therefore, iron agents are often administered to dialysis patients, in most cases intra-venously. Conversely, aimless continuation of iron administration to dialysis patients sometimes causes iron overload, which is also clearly harmful. Iron overload has been thought to induce the accumulation of iron in the organs and subsequent organ dys-functions (2).

40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{reactions}} involve metals, especially noble metals {{or metal}} oxides as catalysts. Although metal-based catalysts {{have been playing}} {{a major role in}} various industrial processes, they still suffer from multiple competitive dis-advantages, including their high cost, susceptibility to gas poisoning, and detri-mental effects on the environment.

This perspective highlights recent progresses in the development of carbon-based metal-free catalysts.

Salt coated specimens were exposed to lh thermal cycles at 950 °C in flowing oxygen for up to 500 cycles. Mass change data of the specimens revealed a significant dependence of the corrosion attack not only, as expected, on the average contaminant flux rate, but also on the initial amount of salt deposited during each recoating cycle. Furthermore, deposit removal before salt recoating was found to markedly influence the corrosion attack of the alloys. This was related to changes in salt chemistry by the dissolution of elements such as Cr from the alloy which shifted the basicity of the salt and thus affected the extent of attack. Substituting Na for K in sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate salt mixtures <b>enerally</b> resulted in a decreased attack. Although the high K-containing salts still caused significant attack typical of Type-I hot corrosion, the overall degration was much less than for sodium sulfate alone...|$|E

A very general and flexible complex nonlinear least squares fitting (CNLS) program (LOMFP) is described which runs on microcomputers of the PC and AT type. Advantages {{and disadvantages of}} LOMFP are discussed and compared to those of a recent CNLS program developed by Boukamp. LOMFP incorporates many thousands of equivalent cir-cuits fitting possibilities and ten different distributed circuit elements {{which can be used}} in these circuits. Its fitting is both speedy and accurate, and it provides considerable insurance against confusing local minima tits with true least squares tits. It is optimized for fitting real, imaginary, or complex data of either partly conducting or purely dielectric character, and it incorporates great flexibility in handling and fitting data in different forms (different immittance levels and rectangular or polar representation). Seven different data weighting choices are provided. Exact synthetic data were generated from a typical Impedance Spectroscopy equivalent circuit, and the effects on CNLS fitting were investigated of rounding the exact data to 4, 3, and 2 decimal places. We present he results of an extensive study of the effects of transforming exact data to different immittance levels and representations and then rounding to two places or of transforming rounded 2 -place data directly. We conclude that real data should not be transformed from its original measured form before carrying out CNLS fitting. Finally, the effects were investigated of various kinds of weightings on CNLS fitting of 2 -place data, leading to the conclusion that in spite of its advocacy and use by Zoltowski and Boukamp, modulus weighting <b>enerally</b> ields misleading and appreciably worse CNLS fitting results than does proportional weighting.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{population}} structure and migrations of a predominantly rural area situated within {{the sphere of}} influence of several externally located, large and middle-size cities, notably Bydgoszcz, Toruń and Włocławek. Basic demographic indices, such as population density, natural increase, death rate and spatial mobility for the region {{are close to the}} national averages. Population dynamics in the Basin are on the whole well balanced; the size of net out-migration has been approximately 0. 5 °/o of the total population per year, as compared to the natural increase of 1. 1 %. In 1974 urban places within the Basin showed a net gain of 1, 289 migrants, and the rural areas a loss of 4, 142 migrants. The degree of closure of migrations within the Basin amounted to a low figure of 0. 31, which is {{explained by the fact that}} large portions of the Basin are contained within migration fields of Bydgoszcz and Toruń, and, to a lesser extent, of the more distant regional capitals, such as Poznań and Gdańsk, Rural-to-rural moves, <b>enerally</b> of a short range, represent however still the main component of migration patterns, accounting for two-fifth of all moves. Rural-to urban migrations are evenly distributed among small, medium-size and large cities. Urban-to-urban moves, which are more elastic with respect to distance, basically follow urban-size structure and the administrative hierarchy. Spatial pattern of commuting-to-work closely corresponds to migration patterns. This suggests that commuting often serves as a substitute to migration and tends to be followed by the chaoge of residence once housing becomes available closer to places of employment. It was also found that urban residents travel longer distances to bigger urban places, while destinations of trips to work and migrations originating in rural areas are more evenly distributed among small, medium- size and large urban places. Problems of future changes and planning relate to 1) the future role of the large adjacent cities, and 2) further growth in the intensity of agricultural production. The changing spatial patterns of the Upper Noteć Basin should be discussed in conjunction with the questions of the future size of Bydgoszcz-Toruń agglomeration. According to the existing spatial development plans, this agglomeration is expected to grow very rapidly over the next decades what may result in its extension toward the central part of the Basin and the merge with Inowrocław — its largest urban centre. As to the second point, it seems realistic to assume that the furtheer growth in the intensity of agriculture should not involve greater changes in the number of rural population, although it will definitely bring about serious changes in the occupational and family structures.

40|$|The {{stucture}} of {{the human}} lympl vessel wall was studied with a special reference to the muscular architecture, and also to the regional and individual differences. Twenty-eight preserved cadavers of Japanese adults and one fresh corpse were used. The specimens were prepared from them within the range macroscopically possible of obtaining necessary materials. Therefore, the smallest vessels {{were not involved in}} the present study. Besides ordinary histological procedures, film specimen method and graphical reconstruction were also applied. 1. The muscle bundles of the lymph vessel wall, ever changing their course, branching out, and anastomosing with one another, form a flat network (muscle bundle group or muscle plate). At the thicker portion, the muscular coat consists of multiple muscle plates. Their bundles intersect with one another obliquely and form diamond meshes, but there never interlace with one another like textile fabrics. Often a group of muscle bundles branches out from one muscle plate and form new musucle plate, the bundles of which are directed in another direction. Such communications of msucle bundles can be observed commonly in between each layer of the muscular coats (see below). 2. Elastica interna of the lymph vessel is poorly developed. It spreads out around the bundels of the inner longitudinal muscle, forming the elastic sheathes. Therefore, it is not necessarily of a single layer, but is often made up of a rather wide zone including longitudinal muscle bundles. 3. The muscles of the intima and the adventitia are thin, generally consisting of a single or double muscle plates running approximately longitudinally. The muscular coat of the media is thick. The muscle bundles rung <b>enerally</b> longitudinally in the inner layer and circularly in the outher layer with ones in transitional state in between. However, some of the vessels show all the muscle bundles of the media running longitudinally, while in others all circularly. The longitudinal muscle bundles of the intima and inner layer of the media, connecting with each other, constitute the inner longitudinal muscle of the lymph vessel. The course and obiqueness of the muscle bundles of the media are extremely irregular so that the coat offers variable patterns. 4. The regional differences {{in the structure of the}} lymph vessel are most markedly exhibited in the amount of the longitudinal and circular muscles. Furthermore, systematic differences are involved to a great extent in them, and local ones seem to be less significant. 5. Systematic differences. a) In the most peripheral lymph vessels the wall is thin, and contains only a small quantity of longitudinal muscle, suggesting the transformation to muscleless vessels. However, more proximally the wall becomes fairly thicker, the vessel showing considerable contraction. In this type the muscular coat is composed mostly of longitudinal bundles and only a few circular bundles can be recognized. Still nearer to the center the vessels are now made up of three muscular coats, namely, the inner logitudinal, the middle ciruclar and the outer longitudinal. As compared with the lumen the wall in rather thin, and contains less muscles, the contraction of the vessels growing weaker. According to these differences in the muscular architecture, author divided lymph vessels into five types. Of them the vessels consisted of three muscle coats seem to be designated as conducting lymph ducts. The thoracic duct and other lymph trunks as weel as vessels in the upper and lower limbs (excepting those in the periphery) and the chain of vessels ascending from the deep subinguinal nodes to the lumbar trunks belong to this category.
