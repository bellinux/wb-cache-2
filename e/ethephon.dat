40|$|Abstract Background The {{stimulatory effect}} of CO 2 on {{ethylene}} evolution in plants is known, but {{the extent to}} which ethylene controls photosynthesis is not clear. Studies on the effects of ethylene on CO 2 metabolism have shown conflicting results. Increase or inhibition of photosynthesis by ethylene has been reported. To understand the physiological processes responsible for ethylene-mediated changes in photosynthesis, stomatal and mesophyll effects on photosynthesis and ethylene biosynthesis in response to <b>ethephon</b> treatment in mustard (Brassica juncea) cultivars differing in photosynthetic capacity were studied. Results The effects of <b>ethephon</b> on photosynthetic rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g S), carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity, 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) activity and ethylene evolution were similar in both the cultivars. Increasing <b>ethephon</b> concentration up to 1. 5 mM increased P N, g S and CA maximally, whereas 3. 0 mM <b>ethephon</b> proved inhibitory. ACS activity and ethylene evolution increased with increasing concentrations of <b>ethephon.</b> The corresponding changes in g s and CA activity suggest that the changes in photosynthesis in response to <b>ethephon</b> were triggered by altered stomatal and mesophyll processes. Stomatal conductance changed in parallel with changes in mesophyll photosynthetic properties. In both the cultivars ACS activity and ethylene increased up to 3. 0 mM <b>ethephon,</b> but 1. 5 mM <b>ethephon</b> caused maximum effects on photosynthetic parameters. Conclusion These results suggest that <b>ethephon</b> affects foliar gas exchange responses. The changes in photosynthesis in response to <b>ethephon</b> were due to stomatal and mesophyll effects. The changes in g S were a response maintaining stable intercellular CO 2 concentration (C i) under the given treatment in both the cultivars. Also, the high photosynthetic capacity cultivar, Varuna responded less to <b>ethephon</b> than the low photosynthetic capacity cultivar, RH 30. The photosynthetic capacity of RH 30 increased with the increase in ethylene evolution due to 1. 5 mM <b>ethephon</b> application. </p...|$|E

This effect occurred in less than 6 days {{in the case of}} apple cuttings (Sun and Bassuk [1993]) although the effect of <b>ethephon</b> on P. radiata after 1 week was minimal. Once formed, however, ethylene triggered gene expression from each type of tissue at 8 WAT, and these were different in composition (Figure 2) and function (Table 2). Some (25 - 50 %) of the genes expressed at 1 WAT were found to be differentially expressed at 8 WAT, indicating that these genes may form the core response of these tissues to <b>ethephon.</b> Amongst these were at least 8 gene ontology classes that showed bidirectional responses (both up- and down-regulated) to <b>ethephon</b> in the xylem (Table 2).

For these reasons we studied the uptake and fate of [1, 2 - 14 C]ethephon in dormant seeds of Avena fatua, Sinapis arvensis, Thlaspi arvense, and Chenopodium album. The radioactivity within the seeds was separated into a labile carbon-labeled ethephon/ethylene fraction (64 - 87 %) and, following extraction in methanol-chloroform-water (12 : 5 : 3), into fractions associated with insoluble (12 - 29 %) and soluble (3 - 8 %) seed constituents.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Nut {{drop in the}} filbert is a {{consequence}} of the senescence of the husk. It is possible to accelerate this process by the application of <b>ethephon</b> (2 -chloroethyl) phosphonic acid after the nut has abscised {{from the base of the}} husk. This study is an investigation on the physiological effects of the use of this chemical to accelerate husk senescence. By measuring the amount of ethylene evolution following husk treatments of <b>ethephon,</b> it was found that a tremendous increase in the rate of ethylene evolution, which is dependent on the log of the concentration of <b>ethephon</b> used, occurred during the first day. The rate of ethylene evolution from the husks remained high for over 7 days. Translocation studies of <b>ethephon</b> from the leaves to the husk were attempted by using both radioactive tracer and biological methods. Ra- dioautographs of filbert stems following foliar applications of ¹⁴C-ethephon showed accumulations of radioactivity in stem tips, lateral buds and husks. In the biological method, rates of ethylene evolution were compared from (1) husks receiving direct <b>ethephon</b> treatments, (2) husks from branches where both the husks and leaves were treated, (3) husks from branches where only the leaves were treated, and (4) husks from untreated control branches. Results from this study revealed a significantly higher rate of ethylene evolution from husks receiving only a foliar <b>ethephon</b> treatment as compared to untreated controls. This indicated that either <b>ethephon</b> or its active derivative was translocated from the leaves to the husks. Such an increase in ethylene evolution occurred in less than a day following <b>ethephon</b> treatments. From these experiments, it is concluded that rapid translocation of <b>ethephon</b> could be achieved in a source-to-sink manner. The applied <b>ethephon</b> breaks down in the plant, leading to an increase in ethylene evolution, and brings about the acceleration of husk senescence. This conclusion is supported by simple laboratory tests using beans and peas. In both plant species, uptake of <b>ethephon</b> was found to occur via the roots and leaves. Biological effects following <b>ethephon</b> applications were those typical of ethylene treatments. These responses were observed mainly in fast-growing locations which would serve as strong metabolic sinks...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of phloem solute generally falls from leaves to roots. However, a local increase in latex total solid content (LILTSC) was identified near the tapping cut of rubber trees. To understand {{the mechanism of}} ethephon-stimulated latex yield, the formation and <b>ethephon</b> (an ethylene releaser) alleviation of the LILTSC near the tapping cut were examined. It {{was found that the}} LILTSC near the tapping cut of a tapped rubber tree was caused by the tapping-accelerated rubber biosynthesis which began following the first tapping and became significant after the fourth tapping. <b>Ethephon</b> stimulation markedly reduced the LILTSC. The latex yield change pattern upon <b>ethephon</b> stimulation was associated with the kinetic change of LILTSC and the decomposition dynamic of <b>ethephon</b> into ethylene. Once the LILTSC was reduced by ethylene release upon <b>ethephon</b> stimulation, the latex yield increased; however, when the ethylene release upon <b>ethephon</b> stimulation receded, the LILTSC was restored and the effect of <b>ethephon</b> stimulation dissipated. The reduction of LILTSC by <b>ethephon</b> stimulation could be ascribed to the translocation property of ethylene in plants and its regulation of aquaporins. Because maximum ethylene release upon tapping-cut-ethephon-application occured close to the tapping cut, the aquaporins were more up-regulated in this region, leading to a reduction of the LILTSC and an increase in latex yield. All these results suggest that the LILTSC near the tapping cut was caused by tapping; the ethephon-induced aquaporin up-regulation and LILTSC reduction are involved in the mechanism of ethephon-promoted latex yield...|$|E

Among the inorganic defoliants tested, only Mg(ClO 3) 2 · H 2 O gave satisfactory results in defoliating apple rootstocks.

40|$|<b>Ethephon</b> {{promotes}} fruit abscission and accelerates {{harvest of}} macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia (Proteaceae), but has limited use due to concerns that associated abscission of inner-canopy leaves may reduce subsequent yield and nut quality.

Nut quality was not adversely affected in subsequent seasons, but effects on yield varied. In 3 of 6 experiments, <b>ethephon</b> reduced yield in the year after application. However, in 4 of the 6 experiments, 2 years of <b>ethephon</b> application greatly elevated yield in the third year.
