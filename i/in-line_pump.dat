40|$|Interest in {{the control}} of {{variable}} fluid power pumps/motors has increased in recent years. The actuators used are inefficient and expensive and this reduces the variable units’ usability. This paper introduces displacement control of pumps/motors {{by means of a}} rotating valveplate. By changing the angle of the valve plate, the effective use of the stroke is changed. Therotating valve plate is experimentally verified by a modified <b>in-line</b> <b>pump.</b> In the prototype,the valve plate is controlled with a worm gear connected to an electric motor. The resultsshow potential for this kind of displacement control. However, the rotating valve plate createspressure pulsations at part-displacement due to the commutation being performed at highpiston speeds. If the piston speed and hence the flow from each piston is low, the pressurepulsation is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{underwater}} robots play {{a significant}} role in many aspects of industry such as mine hunting, sea floor mapping, sub-sea pipeline construction and pipe surveys. Ever increasing demand on better control systems of underwater robots ignites engineers on modeling the systems for perfection. Since they are the lowest chain of the control problem, yet the most important ones. Thrusters are the most crucial parts of the underwater robot actuation. The need for maneuvering precision, for small and fast dynamic positioning, for precise motion and position control and for station keeping made developments of thruster modeling inevitable. The fundamental difficulty in modeling of a thruster is that axial flow velocity is an unmeasurable state, yet the model depends on that variable. This work addresses this difficulty. It explores the dynamics of <b>in-line</b> <b>pump</b> jet thrusters which are used for underwater robotic actuation. This work uses impeller geometry characterization, fluid flow analysis through impeller blades and through pump jet, thrust modeling and DC motor modeling. The main contribution of this work is incorporation of axial flow velocity into thruster modeling in order to resolve the unmeasurable state problem, thanks to the dynamical properties of impeller geometry and flow conditions through impeller blades...|$|E

Using this technique bit rates exceeding 1 Terabits/s have been demonstrated. However to fully exploit the potential of WDM several key device developments are required. This report describes {{the results of an}} experimental program, Multicore rare-earth doped fibres; application to amplifiers, filters and lasers funded under the ROPA scheme and targeted at new devices for WDM applications. The proposed program covered a three year program however funding was only awarded for two years. The key thrusts of the original submission were to introduce spatial hole burning into rare earth doped devices to controllably induce effective inhomogeneous broadening into the gain/loss medium. It was proposed to develop and optimise twincore erbium doped fibres to provide spatial hole burning and thus effective inhomogeneous broadening in the gain/loss medium. The development of channel equalising optical amplifiers, multi-wavelength and single frequency fibre lasers as well as passive tracking optical filters was targeted. These objectives were met. In addition multi-wavelength DFB fibre lasers have been developed as telecommunication sources and also applied to <b>in-line</b> <b>pump</b> a polarisation insensitive phase conjugator and as an active fibre temperature and strain sensor. Finally, a multi-wavelength (12 channel) Brillouin fibre laser has been demonstrated<br/...|$|E

40|$|Throughout history, {{machines}} {{have replaced}} human labor in many industries. Our machines {{have made it}} possible to transcend human limitations. In the present day, underwater robots have stretched the boundaries of what was previously thought impossible in terms of exploration, security and scientific discovery. These robots have become prevalent in a number of sectors and fields including the military, marine biology, oceanography and documentary production. As their applications become increasingly diverse, establishing precise control over the movement of these robots become more and more crucial. DC motors as force/torque generators for robots are well understood. We know exactly how much voltage must be applied to generate precise movement to achieve specifi c tasks. On the other hand, {{this is not the case}} for thrust generators for swimming robots due to the complexity of the dynamics of the combination of motor action with fluid/solid interactions.

40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{advancing}} the microchemical field from single device based demonstrations to systems that can perform multi-step series and parallel synthesis. Few examples of micro-separators and micro-pumps suited for miniaturized lab-on-a-chip systems for organic syntheses exist, {{so the first}} half of this thesis developed systems for these micro-unit-operations, while the second half demonstrated multistep microchemical operations enabled by these systems. In-line continuous separation devices are developed that enabled removal of unreacted reagents/byproducts, making it possible to realize a series of reactions without leaving the microreactor environment. Differences in surface forces and preferential wettability characteristics of fluoropolymers are used for phase separation. Such microseparators are used to demonstrate 100 % separation of two phase flows of hexane and water, toluene and water, dichloromethane and water, and hexane and methanol. Integrated liquid-liquid extraction devices are microfabricated that performed two -phase contacting by segmented flow, followed by separation - resulting in single stage extraction. Single stage extraction of N,N-dimethylformamide from dichloromethane to water, and from diethyl ether to water is demonstrated. The development of separators allows microreactors to be connected to microseparators to form microreactor networks enabling reactions and separations in succession. The starting reagents are loaded in syringes and syringe pumps push fluid through the train of microdevices. However, this pumping scheme is limited by pressure constraints at the pump drives as well as the microseparators. Therefore, there is a need to develop in-line pumps to sustain the microdevice network. Pressure-driven flow is employed for the operation of micropumps. An enclosure with the liquid is pressurized with helium gas, causing the liquid to flow. The dynamics of pressurizing and de-pressurizing an enclosure are modeled and confirmed by experiments. Active and passive control schemes to provide constant flowrate of the liquid are developed and implemented. Different schemes are developed to use the gas pressure to manipulate the flow path of liquids. (cont.) In one scheme, two enclosures are used together to perform as an <b>in-line</b> <b>pump.</b> The in-line pumps also acted as a buffer to prevent any disturbance propagation, and allowed the upstream and downstream to operate at different flowrates. The pump concept is demonstrated at two scales - 1) microfabricated silicon chips of 40 microliter volume and 2) using glass shell vials of 10000 microliter volume. These pumps are used along with two microseparators to demonstrate two-stage countercurrent and cross-flow liquid-liquid extraction of N,Ndimethylformamide from dichloromethane to water starting with 4. 4 mole percent mixture. The in-line pumps also allowed recirculation with a constant flowrate that enabled long residence time reactions. As an example, peptide synthesis from amino acids, using the Merrifield technique is implemented. Specifically, the pentapeptide, Leuenkephalin is synthesized on different resins simultaneously as an example. A new design for the silicon microreactor for packed bed reactions is developed to enable larger catalyst loadings and offer manageable pressure drops across the packed bed even when the solid loading increased in volume during operation, as is the case with the peptide synthesis experiments. These microchips are also used to study "click chemistry" reactions to synthesize drug-candidate molecules. The packed bed microreactor experiments give higher conversions and better selectivities than batch experiments after the same amount of reaction time as the microreactor experiments provide increased relative catalyst concentration, and reduce side reactions that otherwise reduce selectivity. As an example of multi -step synthesis involving reactions and separations, the synthesis of carbamates starting from azoyl chloride and sodium azide, using the Curtius rearrangement of isocyanates is performed. This example also demonstrates parallel synthesis of analogous carbamates by introducing branching in the synthesis sequence after the isocyanate production to form microreactor networks. The second reaction involved heat decomposition of the organic azide, and performs faster when catalyzed using solid acid zeolite catalyst in a packed bed microreactor. (cont.) Continuous operation of the microdevice network for ~ 7 - 10 days at flowrates of 1 - 5 [mu]l/min show no change in performance. The microreactor based synthesis is run at higher temperatures than conventional batch scale reactions due to the inherent safety in microreactor based production. The multiple-carbamate-synthesis microreactor network consists of five microreactors and two separators. This demonstration is the first multi-step organic synthesis involving reactions and separations, and showcased the major contributions from this thesis. The development of micro-unit-operations in this thesis has advanced the microchemical field from single device based demonstrations to systems that can perform continuous-flow multi-step series and parallel chemical synthesis. by Hemantkumar Sahoo.

It is placed in between the shaft of the pump and the impeller and corotates with the rotor system. A high accuracy is obtained due to the orthogonality of bridge positioning and the signal conditioning electronics embedded within the dynamometer. The suction flow distribution to the pump is adapted using a pipe bundle situated in the suction pipe. Results of measurements show the influence of the suction flow profile and blade interaction on pump performance and forces.

40|$|The {{operation}} of diesel engine is closely connected with controlling {{the process of}} injecting the fuel into the cylinder. It influences proper combustion process, which translates directly into irregular engine operation resulting in dumping and noise. It is related to improper control of fuel injection which is connected with improper completion of expected control strategy {{that can be a}} result of defective injection system. Irregular engine operation can also be caused by total lack of initiated combustion process in specific cylinder of the engine or in several cylinders, described as misfire, or ca be a result of differences in combustion process in individual operation cycles / engine cylinders. The effect is an engine working irregularly (there is instability of rotational speed) and emitting increased amount of pollutants. As a consequence the secondary fuel purification systems located in the exhaust system can be damaged. Therefore, it is required to choose the fuel injection control parameters in a way that enables detecting and correcting the process of fuel injection in order to minimize effects resulting from improper process of fuel combustion in individual cylinders or even lack thereof.

For this purpose, efficiency level of centrifugal pumps of various designs has been analyzed at certain head and flow range. The change of efficiency level of circulators has also been investigated in the article. It’s been done at different deviations from nominal pump head. As a criterion, the effectiveness of proportional pressure control has been analyzed for pumps with variable speed motors. It’s been done if proportional pressure control is used in comparison with constant pressure control.

40|$|Adaptation of {{compression}} ignition engines to dual fuel supply can be accomplished both in case of modern engines equipped with common rail system and older engines equipped with classic injection system (piston pumps). Due to big differences in price of gaseous and liquid fuels there is observed a natural tendency to use very small initial doses. At current level of introduction of gas-eous fuels to powering of traction engines {{there is a need}} to provide alternating fuelling of the engine with the Diesel only and in dual fuel system. It requires usage of original injection systems in the dual fuel engines, what largely restricts possibility of reduc-tion of the initial doses. In the paper are presented investigations concerning uniformity of the dosing by <b>in-line</b> piston <b>pump</b> of the P 56 - 01 type and two types of injectors with common rail system. The investigations have shown that the P 56 - 01 pump adjusted for nominal doses shows big non-uniformity of the dosage in area of small doses. Improved uniformity of the dosage can be attained in result of adjustment for a smaller doses, what allows reduction of the dose to about 15 - 20 % of nominal dose and improves smooth-ness of engine operation. Also in case of the injectors in common rail system, reduction of the doses is limited due to worsening of uniformity of the dosing from one cycle to another, and failure of the dosing. It results from the fact, that minimal doses in dual fuel system are smaller than the ones present in case of idling speed when the engine is run on the Diesel oil only.

50|$|A {{circulating}} pump - {{a device that}} causes the flow of liquid (e.g. water or aqueous solutions, mostly glycol) in circuits (primary or secondary) of heating or cooling installations. The {{circulating pump}}s are used only as centrifugal pumps. The basic elements of the centrifugal pump are coiled housing with two ports, suction and discharge, and what is more, blade rotor mounted on a shaft driven be an electric motor. The ports of the circulating pump can be arranged in one axis (<b>in-line</b> circulating <b>pump,</b> typically suitable to be built directly in the pipeline) or suction axis that can be perpendicular to the axis of discharge port (the so-called circulating radial pump). The mechanical energy delivered to the circulating pump via motor is transmitted through the rotor to the liquid flow causing the increase in pressure (potential energy) and speed (kinetic energy). The energy increase of the liquid occurs only in the circulating pump rotor, {{which is the only}} element of the energy transmission. However, in the remaining parts, one type of energy changes into another e.g. kinetic energy into pressure energy. For instance, in the coiled shaped housing, part of kinetic energy changes into potential energy, which causes a further increase in the fluid pressure.Pressure generated by the pump is used to overcome resistance of the liquid flow through the heating or cooling circuit. During the pump operation, there is a drop of the liquid flow {{in the center of the}} rotor, causing the inflow of the liquid through the suction port. In the event of an excessive pressure decrease, in some parts of the rotor, the pressure can be lower than the saturation pressure corresponding to the temperature of the pumped liquid, causing the so-called cavitation, i.e. liquid evaporation. To prevent this, the pressure in the suction port (at the inlet of the pump) should be higher than the saturation pressure corresponding to the liquid temperature by the net positive suction head (NPSH).|$|R

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe {{studies have focused on}} the relationship between the molecular configuration of xanthan gum in solution, and its rheological and drag reducing properties. The rheology has been studied at both moderate and low (drag reducing) concentrations as a function of solution ionic strength. Drag reduction has been examined in a capillary flow device, and in a larger recirculating flow loop with an <b>in-line</b> centrifugal <b>pump.</b> The objective was to estaDlish a relationship between the dilute solution rheology of xanthan gum and its drag reducing effectiveness. At moderate concentrations (500 < c < 5000 ppm), the effects of salt, shear, and temperature on the intermolecular associations of xanthan gum have been examined using dynamic oscillatory shear. The solution behavior of xanthan gum changes at c 1000 - 2000 ppm. Above this concentration, intermolecular associations dominate the solution rheology, xanthan gum exhibits typical "gel-like" behavior, and salt addition causes an increase in intermolecular associations, which results in increased dynamic moduli. Below this concentration, salt addition causes a decrease in hydrodynamic size and dynamic moduli. The low concentration rheology has been studied using steady and transient shear. Single-step stress transient experiments have been used to determine the onset of intermolecular interactions as a function of salt and concentration. A new parameter, the dynamic overlap concentration (c*dyn), has been defined from the transient experiments and used to correlate the drag reduction data. Drag reduction at c < 500 ppm in low and high salt was studied in the capillary flow device (i. d. = 0. 236 cm). The type of drag reduction observed is similar to that seen for other semi-rigid polymers. The data in low and high salt have been shown to correlate with c*dyn. A plot of %DR (max) vs. c/c*dyn collapses the drag reduction data to a single curve, indicating that the drag reducing effectiveness can be correlated with hydrodynamic size, and that intermolecular interactions are necessary to obtain high levels of drag reduction. Degradation studies in the capillary flow system indicate that xanthan gum is more shear stable than typical random coiling drag reducing polymers. This is corroborated by studies in the recirculating flow loop...|$|R

One of the uses for rotor-stator mixer is to perform liquid-liquid homogenization. The small gap between the rotor tip and surrounding stator in combination of high rotational speeds yields high magnitudes of what is considered as break-up forces. The flow inside the mixer is highly turbulent and extremely complex. There exist today {{a limited number of}} papers explaining the flow and turbulence fields inside the mixer. With the continuous increase of computational power comes the possibility of performing CFD-simulation useful in understanding the flow field and mixing effects in rotor-stator mixers. A workflow consisting of verified methodology custom for rotor-stator mixer of type in-line, reviewing the steps from a CAD-model to steady-state of a CFD-simulation would effectively decrease the time needed compared to if one start from naught every time. Additionally it would be beneficial if the approximations made in a CFD-simulation of a periodic slice of a mixer compared to a full scale model are rendered acceptable. This is especially advantageous when the simulation uses LES to resolve the turbulence as a slice would keep down the computational costs. The thesis is divided into two parts. First part is RANS-simulation of an <b>in-line</b> mixers <b>pump</b> curve and flow field. Second part is a feasibility study of the possibility to perform a LES-simulation of a periodic slice instead of a full scale batch mixer. From the RANS simulations two workflows have been developed. When developing the workflows different mesh strategies, grid sizes and ways to model the rotors movement are tested. Experimental measurements and grid convergence studies have has served as verification of the simulation results. One workflow is aimed to obtain the mixers pump curve. The other workflow is developed in purpose to model the local flow variables i. e. resolve the flow field inside the mixer.

A novel fetal bypass circuit requiring no priming volume was designed incorporating an <b>in-line</b> axial flow <b>pump</b> (Hemopump, Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems, Rancho Cordova, Calif.) and was demonstrated to have a marked beneficial effect on placental function. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of this newly developed customized fetal bypass circuit on fetal survival and developing fetal organs. Methods and results: Nine fetuses at 122 to 126 days of gestation were subjected to fetal cardiac bypass via a transsternal approach, with a 16 F single right atrial venous cannula and a 12 F arterial cannula. Normothermic cardiac bypass was continued for 30 minutes at flow rates of 320 ± 32 ml/kg. Of the nine fetuses, one fetus was stillborn 4 days after bypass and eight (89 %) were delivered alive after progressing to term gestation. One lamb died of blunt trauma 1 day after birth. All other lambs (n = 7) thrived normally, and at 1 week of age they were subjected to autopsy. No gross hemorrhagic or thromboembolic lesions were detected in the organs examined including the brain. Microscopic examination of representative sections from all organs revealed mild pleural reaction in two lambs, and in two other lambs the hepatocytes showed evidence of mild increase in glycogen content, the significance of which is unknown in relation to fetal bypass. In one fetus that was aborted there was evidence of mild to moderate neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that with improvements in fetal extracorporeal circuitry and techniques very favorable fetal outcome can be achieved. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effects of bypass on fetal brain in an appropriate animal model. Advances in extracorporeal circuitry to suit the unique fetal physiology increase the possibility of future clinical application. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1996; 111 : 536 - 44...|$|R

It is {{currently}} estimated that South Africa {{will be running}} out of surplus electrical capacity by the year 2007. This estimate {{is based on the}} current growth in economy that primarily includes the electrification of half-a-million new households per year, with a final target of 5 Million households by 2007. This situation is forcing ESKOM to take action to reduce peak electrical demand by initiatives such as the implementation of Demand Side Management (DSM) programs. These DSM programs are currently aimed at the industrial and commercial sectors where bigger impacts in load shifting can be achieved than in the residential sector, which is the actual cause of the surplus capacity run-out. The {{reason for this is that}} the large amount of individual consumers in the residential sector presents several barriers to the implementation of DSM programs in this sector. 7 his study addresses the optimisation of sanitary water heating systems in the commercial and industrial sectors, for DSM purposes. Commercial and industrial applications are considered separately, since a difference in application strategy emanates from the different tariff structures utilized in the industrial and commercial sectors. In the industrial sector where the focus lies on load shifting, an in-line electrical resistance heater will be utilized. In the commercial sector where the focus lies on both load shifting and energy efficiency, a combination of heat <b>pumps</b> and <b>in-line</b> electrical resistance heaters will be used. In both applications the heating equipment is connected in the so-called 'improved in-line heating' configuration developed in previous studies. The first part of the study provides results obtained from sanitary water heating DSM projects that were completed at several commercial and industrial sites. Firstly new hot water consumption patterns for hotels and mine residences are provided. The differences between these profiles, and those found in previous studies for the residential sector, were highlighted. This was achieved by a simulation study, which resulted in a design envelope for the most important system specifications, for different hot water consumption profiles. Results for <b>in-line</b> heat <b>pump</b> water heating systems installed in commercial buildings were then provided. These results show that direct benefits for both utility and building owner can be achieved in terms of peak demand reduction. Additional benefits are also obtained by the building owner in terms of energy efficiency improvements due to the utilisation of the heat pump unit. Results for a utility funded DSM project to install in-line water heating systems at several mine residences were then provided. A significant DSM load shift was achieved by this project, to the benefit of ESKOM. The results showed how the in-line heating systems enabled load shifting out of utility critical periods without any loss in hot water availability to system users. Part two of the study provides results of optimisation studies for sanitary water heating system design in both commercial and industrial sectors. This is achieved by first of all developing a water-heating system simulation program bared on simplified first law analysis. This model successfully demonstrated a high level of accuracy for hoth electrical demand and thermal availability prediction, for different configurations of sanitary water heating systems. Simulation results were verified with measured results obtained from the commercial building and mine residence projects as provided in part one of this study. The new simulation program, together with the new hot water consumption patterns for hotels, was then used in an optimisation study for commercial building water heating systems. The study provided optimal heating and storage capacities for a broad range of system parameters. The most optimal solution for designing a completely new water heating system was also provided. The study also showed that additional control upgrades resulted in improved cost- and energy efficiency for the system. Favourable economic returns are obtained by the proposed retrofits; an Internal Rate of Return of at least 47. 1 % is achieved for the different tariff structures employed in the commercial sector. Finally, a digital control algorithm was developed that optimises operational cost efficiency for sanitary water heating systems in the industrial sector, subject to Real Time Pricing (RTP). The study showed that significant savings are possible; a theoretical operational cost reduction of 20 %- 29 % can he achieved at the case study plants. Cost reductions are mainly a function of system utilization: bigger non-dimensional heating and storage capacities result in higher savings potential. The optimisation studies done in this thesis provide 'real world' solutions with a well-balanced trade-off between simplicity and efficiency. Well-evaluated options for DSM programs in the different sectors are therefore presented, which can obtain benefits for both electrical utility and client. These options should therefore he able to boost the viability of sanitary water heating system DSM projects in the South African Energy Services Industry. Doctora...|$|R
