5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with <b>iron</b> <b>supplements.</b> Those who cannot tolerate iron tablets or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|E

5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking <b>iron</b> <b>supplements,</b> which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E

25|$|Since copper {{availability}} in {{the body}} is hindered by an excess of iron and zinc intake, pregnant women prescribed <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> to treat anemia or zinc supplements to treat colds should consult physicians {{to be sure that}} the prenatal supplements they may be taking also have nutritionally-significant amounts of copper.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> from early pregnancy would {{increase the risk of}} gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Design Randomised placebo-controlled trial. Setting A university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Population One thousand one hundred sixty-four women with singleton pregnancy at less than 16 weeks of gestation with haemoglobin (Hb) level between 8 and 14 g/dl and no pre-existing diabetes or haemoglobinopathies. Methods Women were randomly allocated to receive 60 mg of <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> daily (n = 565) or placebo (n = 599). Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed at 28 and 36 weeks. Women were followed up until delivery. Outcome measures The primary outcome was development of GDM at 28 weeks. The secondary outcomes were 2 -hour post-OGTT glucose levels, development of GDM at 36 weeks and delivery and infant outcomes. Results There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of GDM in the <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> and placebo groups at 28 weeks (OR: 1. 04, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 7 - 1. 53 at 90 % power) or 36 weeks. Maternal Hb and ferritin levels were higher in the <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> group at delivery (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 003, respectively). Elective caesarean section rate was lower in the <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> group (OR: 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 37 - 0. 89). Infant birthweight was heavier (P = 0. 001), and there were fewer small-for-gestational-age babies in the <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> group (OR: 0. 46, 95 % CI: 0. 24 - 0. 85).

25|$|Prevention is by {{not walking}} barefoot where {{the disease is}} common. At a {{population}} level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. <b>Iron</b> <b>supplements</b> may be needed in those with anemia.|$|E
25|$|Upon diagnosis, the {{condition}} {{can be treated}} with <b>iron</b> <b>supplements.</b> The choice of supplement will depend upon both the severity of {{the condition}}, the required speed of improvement (e.g. if awaiting elective surgery) and the likelihood of treatment being effective (e.g. if has underlying IBD, is undergoing dialysis, or is having ESA therapy).|$|E
25|$|When {{levofloxacin}} {{is taken}} with anti-acids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts {{that are difficult}} to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is taken with <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> and multi-vitamins containing zinc.|$|E

40|$|Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. {{isolated}} from the feces of 23 neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> (<b>iron</b> concentration, less than 0. 5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently {{isolated from}} the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants.

25|$|Ethanol, {{often in}} high concentrations, {{is used to}} {{dissolve}} many water-insoluble medications and related compounds. Liquid preparations of cough and cold remedies, pain medication, and mouth washes may be dissolved in 1 to 25% concentrations of ethanol and {{may need to be}} avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions. Ethanol is present in over 700 liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen, <b>iron</b> <b>supplements,</b> ranitidine, furosemide, mannitol, phenobarbital, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and over-the-counter cough medicine.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} not needed {{if there are}} no symptoms. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may help with pain and bleeding while paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with pain. <b>Iron</b> <b>supplements</b> may be needed in those with heavy periods. Medications of the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist class may decrease the size of the fibroids but are expensive and associated with side effects. If greater symptoms are present, surgery to remove the fibroid or uterus may help. Uterine artery embolization may also help. Cancerous versions of fibroids are very rare and are known as leiomyosarcomas. They do not appear to develop from benign fibroids.|$|E
25|$|After surgery, {{patients}} feel fullness after ingesting {{only a small}} {{volume of}} food, followed soon thereafter {{by a sense of}} satiety and loss of appetite. Total food intake is markedly reduced. Due to the reduced size of the newly created stomach pouch, and reduced food intake, adequate nutrition demands that the patient follow the surgeon's instructions for food consumption, including the number of meals to be taken daily, adequate protein intake, and the use of vitamin and mineral supplements. Calcium supplements, <b>iron</b> <b>supplements,</b> protein supplements, multi-vitamins (sometimes pre-natal vitamins are best), and vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplements are all very important to the post-operative bypass patient.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} nonheme iron (NHI) and heme iron (HI) microparticles to elaborate a novel oral <b>iron</b> <b>supplement,</b> determining its effect on the iron nutritional status of neonatal piglets. Nonheme iron (ferrous sulfate) was dissolved at 20, 30, and 40 % wt/vol, and HI (porcine blood cells) was dissolved at 30 % wt/vol in a maltodextrin solution (40 % wt/vol). Solutions were spray-dried, obtaining NHI microparticles (NHIM) A, B, and C, respectively, and HI microparticles (HIM). Microparticles were characterized by iron content and release profile at gastrointestinal in vitro pigs' conditions. NHIM-B was selected and blended with HIM (oral <b>iron</b> <b>supplement).</b> Neonatal pigs (n = 66) were supplemented with 200 mg of injectable dextran iron on d 2 of life (parenteral group; n = 22), with 126 mg oral <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> on d 2 and 8 (oral I; n = 22), or with 84 mg oral <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> on d 2, 8, and 14 (oral II; n = 22). Red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), and serum ferritin (SF) were determined. The Hb content of the oral I group was lower (8. 3. 1. 3 g/dL) than the parenteral (10. 1. 1. 7 g/dL) and oral II (10. 2. 1. 4 g/dL) groups (P < 0. 05). Moreover, RBC, Ht, MCV, MCHC, and SF were altered in the oral I group, indicating iron deficiency anemia.

5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when chelated to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common <b>iron</b> <b>supplement.</b> Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce <b>iron</b> glycinate <b>supplements.</b>|$|R
25|$|Chemotherapy {{can cause}} anemia; {{intravenous}} iron {{has been found}} to be more effective than oral <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> in reducing the need for blood transfusions. Typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks, repeated for 6 weeks or more. Fewer than 6 weeks (cycles) of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more. Germ-cell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers— a regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles. Chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause amenorrhea, infertility, birth defects, or miscarriage. Maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Overall, studies {{investigating}} whether cognitive function in already iron-deficient {{children can be}} improved with <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> have produced mixed results, possibly because deficiency in critical growth periods may cause irreversible damage. However, several studies with better design have shown substantial benefits. One way to prevent iron deficiency is to give specific supplementation to children, for example as tablets. However, this is costly, distribution mechanisms are often ineffective, and compliance is low. Fortification of staple foods (cereals, flour, sugar, salt) to deliver micronutrients to children {{on a large scale}} is probably the most sustainable and affordable option, even though commitment from governments and the food industry is needed. Developed nations fortify several foods with various micronutrients.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation is {{generally}} not recommended for healthy adults who consume a well-balanced diet which includes {{a wide range of}} foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk {{during the first year of}} life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent diarrhea or infections; alcoholics), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the elderly, the infirm, those with eating disorders or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) anemia patients who are treated with <b>iron</b> <b>supplements,</b> 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from osteoporosis.|$|E
30|$|Hemin is {{a potent}} <b>iron</b> <b>supplement.</b> A major {{limitation}} of the applicability of hemin is its extremely low aqueous solubility and bioavailability. The aim of this work is to prepare hemin nanoparticles with improved solubility. Transmission electron microscopic images showed that hemin nanoparticles with different initial concentrations of hemin (0.1 and 0.5 [*]mg/mL) were tadpole-shaped (head of approximately 200 [*]nm and tail of 100 [*]nm) and sphere-shaped (50 – 100 [*]nm), respectively. Moreover, hemin nanoparticles exhibited higher solubility than free hemin. The solubility of sphere-shaped nanoparticles was 308.2 -fold {{higher than that of}} pure hemin at 25 [*]°C. The hemin nanoparticles were stable in acidic conditions and displayed excellent thermal stability. These results suggested that hemin nanoparticles could serve as a potential <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> with potential applications in the food, biomedical, and photodynamic-photothermal therapy fields.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the bioavailability of heme iron added to biscuit filling. It comprised two stages: first, {{the development of the}} heme iron enriched biscuit filling; second, the evaluation of the bioavailability of the mineral in fattening piglets. Two groups were selected randomly and fed: a) Low iron feed and biscuits with heme <b>iron</b> <b>supplemented</b> filling; b) Normal feed (with ferrous sulphate). Weight and blood parameters were measured every fifteen days. Averages were compared after duplicate analyses. The filling had a creamy appearance, chocolate taste and smell, appropriate spreadability, heme iron content of 2. 6 mg per gram and a shelf-life of a month. The heme <b>iron</b> <b>supplemented</b> pigs registered a greater (P&# 60; 0. 05) weight gain (27. 8 % more than the control group). Mortality in the heme iron group was 10 %, compared to 50 % in the control group. The amount of iron measured in the different compartment was greater in the heme group (3315 mg) than in the control group (2792 mg). However, the amount of iron consumed in the latter was greater. We show that an acceptable product with high heme iron content can be formulated, suitable for use as biscuit filling. The heme <b>iron</b> <b>supplement</b> produced better weight increase and lesser mortality in fattening pigs. The bioavailability of heme iron was 23 % greater (P&# 60; 0. 05) compared to ferrous sulphate. </p...|$|R
25|$|This lack of {{deworming}} {{of pregnant}} women is {{explained by the fact}} that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. But a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group {{of pregnant women}} treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group. Studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The gradual loss {{of blood}} from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for anemia with blood tests repeated every three months in active disease and annually in quiescent disease. Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anemia should be treated with <b>iron</b> <b>supplements.</b> The form in which treatment is administered depends both on {{the severity of the}} anemia and on the guidelines that are followed. Some advise that parenteral iron be used first because patients respond to it more quickly, it is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, and it is not associated with compliance issues. Others require oral iron to be used first, as patients eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects. All guidelines advise that parenteral iron should be administered in cases of severe anemia (a hemoglobin level less than 100 g/L).|$|E
500|$|Iron uptake is tightly {{regulated}} by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people {{as a result of}} a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis. Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take <b>iron</b> <b>supplements</b> unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.|$|E
