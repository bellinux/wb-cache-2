2500|$|On Sunday, June 15, Woods {{began the}} day with another double bogey, and trailed Rocco Mediate by one stroke after 71 holes. <b>He</b> <b>winced</b> after several of his tee shots, and {{sometimes}} {{made an effort to}} keep weight off his left foot. Woods was behind by one stroke when he reached the final hole. Left with a [...] putt for birdie, he sank it to force an 18-hole playoff with Mediate on Monday. Despite leading by as many as three strokes {{at one point in the}} playoff, Woods again dropped back and needed to birdie the 18th to force sudden death with Mediate, and did so. Woods made par on the first sudden-death hole; Mediate subsequently missed his par putt, giving Woods his 14th major championship. After the tournament, Mediate said [...] "This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat everybody on one leg." [...] His third win in the U.S. Open tied him with Bobby Jones for the career lead in USGA championships won, with nine.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced,</b> but Joan rattled on {{with the}} platitudinous {{originality}} of youth.|$|E
6000|$|STEPHEN: See? Moves to {{one great}} goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen {{years ago he}} was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled. Twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (<b>He</b> <b>winces)</b> Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money? ...|$|R
60|$|The captain stood, indeed; but <b>he</b> neither <b>winced</b> nor {{drew back}} a foot.|$|R
6000|$|And still Jerry came back. As any {{screaming}} {{creature of}} the jungle, he hysterically squalled his indignation. But he made no whimper. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>wince</b> or cringe to the blows. He bored straight in, striving, without avoiding a blow, to beat and meet the blow with his teeth. So hard was he flung down {{the last time that}} his side smashed painfully against the rail, and Van Horn cried out: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced</b> {{before the}} amazed scorn of her words. Yet he {{continued}} steadily.|$|E
60|$|I thought <b>he</b> <b>winced</b> a little, but he {{said nothing}} to the point.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced</b> under Wyllard's gaze, {{and spread}} out his hands with a deprecating gesture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor little beasts! I think he'll cry too. <b>He</b> <b>winces.</b> <b>He</b> could--for tuppence. I didn't {{know he had}} {{lachrymal}} glands at all until {{a little}} while ago. I suppose all love is hysterical--and a little foolish. Poor mites! Silly little pitiful creatures! How we have blundered! Think how we must look to God! Well, we'll pity them, and then we'll inspire him to stiffen up again--and do as we've determined he shall do. We'll see it through,--we who lie here on the cliff. They'll be mean at times, and horrid at times; we know them! Do you see her, a poor little fine lady in a great house,--she sometimes goes {{to her room and}} writes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know where}} that draft came from," [...] <b>he</b> cried, <b>wincing</b> back like one who has greatly dared, and {{instantly}} regrets the venture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand!" [...] cried Alan, {{and pointed}} his sword at him. The captain stood, indeed; but <b>he</b> neither <b>winced</b> nor drew back a foot.|$|R
60|$|And Tom {{felt his}} elder brother despised him a little. <b>He</b> <b>winced</b> under it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced</b> {{a trifle}} at the blunt epithet but quickly {{recovered}} {{and smiled at}} her.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pilkington seemed shocked. <b>He</b> <b>winced</b> {{away from}} the word as though it pained him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' <b>he</b> interrupted, <b>wincing.</b> 'I {{should not}} allow any one to {{inconvenience}} me, if I could hinder it--walk in!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This person," [...] went on Mrs. Porter, {{indicating}} Steve {{with a wave}} of {{her hand}} which caused him to sidestep swiftly and throw up an arm, as had been his habit in the ring when Battling Dick or Fighting Jack endeavoured to blot him out with a right swing, [...] "who, I observe, retains the tattered relics of a conscience, seeing that <b>he</b> <b>winces,</b> you employed to do the only dangerous part of your dirty work. I hope he will see that he gets his money. In his place I should be feeling uneasy." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{prisoner}} {{watched the}} proceedings {{with an air}} which had more of amusement than of uneasiness. <b>He</b> never <b>winced</b> as the black sergeant approached with the glowing shoe held upon two bayonets.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced</b> {{and hated}} it. He {{went away to}} read. Never had his soul felt so flayed and uncreated.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced.</b> And the calmness she had regained, {{which was}} so {{characteristic}} of her, struck him with a new fear.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced</b> at this, and let drive {{a pillow}} at me, {{so hard that}} it nearly knocked me over a chair.|$|E
60|$|Da Souza <b>winced.</b> <b>He</b> {{was about}} to speak, but Trent {{interrupted}} him.|$|R
60|$|Even then, numb as was {{her flesh}} with cold, <b>he</b> felt her <b>wince</b> at the question.|$|R
60|$|Bailey <b>winced.</b> <b>He</b> {{wished the}} world was not perpetually {{reminding}} him that Basil and Sybil were on speaking terms.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are kindly {{welcome to}} their opinion," [...] said Fitzpiers, not {{allowing}} himself {{to recognize that}} <b>he</b> <b>winced.</b> [...] "Anything else?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>winced</b> {{a little}} at her sarcasm but soon {{collected}} himself. Strangely enough, he {{did not appear to}} be angry with her.|$|E
60|$|Hisses {{and cries}} of execration {{followed}} this confession. <b>He</b> <b>winced</b> under them at first; but recovered his self-possession before silence was restored.|$|E
60|$|Ivo Taillebois <b>winced.</b> <b>He</b> {{had just}} stolen a manor from the monks of Crowland, and meant to keep it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a wild}} guess, but I don't {{think that}} I underestimated my new client's rank, for <b>he</b> did not <b>wince.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Carvel <b>winced.</b> <b>He</b> put an {{arm around}} her. He, thought of his lonely widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken.|$|R
60|$|For a while Blanca {{leaned on}} Walthew's arm, and <b>he</b> <b>winced</b> {{as he felt}} her limping movements, but at last she stopped.|$|E
6000|$|With great outward show of rebellion, half genuine, half facetious, he {{made several}} {{tentative}} scrapes with the razor. <b>He</b> <b>winced</b> violently, and violently exclaimed: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bennett sat down. Miss Hubbard {{extended}} {{once more}} the hand holding the needle which had caused his outcry. <b>He</b> <b>winced</b> away from it desperately.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell them to {{undo the}} man's galabeeah. Order them to put a {{horseshoe}} in the fire and make it red-hot." [...] The prisoner watched the proceedings with an air which had more of amusement than of uneasiness. <b>He</b> never <b>winced</b> as the black sergeant approached with the glowing shoe held upon two bayonets.|$|R
6000|$|BLOOM: (Cowed) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter {{bearing the}} extra {{regulation}} fee before the too late box {{of the general}} postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second {{according to the law}} of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle as you probably... (<b>He</b> <b>winces)</b> Ah! ...|$|R
6000|$|But Blakeney neither started nor <b>winced.</b> <b>He</b> {{broke into}} a laugh, his own usual {{pleasant}} laugh, half shy and somewhat inane, then said in tones of lively astonishment: ...|$|R
