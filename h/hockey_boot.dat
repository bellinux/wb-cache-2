40|$|Midway {{through the}} season, an intercollegiate ice hockey player {{experienced}} bilateral numbness in the posterior {{aspect of the}} leg along {{the area of the}} calcaneal tendon. This numbness corresponded with the distribution of both sural nerves. While obtaining a history of the condition, the athlete admitted that he routinely spiraled his ice hockey laces tightly around the proximal portion of each ice <b>hockey</b> <b>boot</b> before finally tying the laces off. A complete neurological examination was negative except for the bilateral numbness. Based upon this information, a diagnosis of bilateral sural nerve entrapment was made. In addition to frequent follow-up examinations, nonoperative treatment consisted of changing the way the athlete laced his ice hockey skates. The athlete was able to complete the season and, after approximately 4 months, was asymptomatic. Although this appears to be an isolated incident, athletic trainers should be cautious when evaluating patients with paraesthesia in this region. If symptoms such as those described develop, entrapment of the sural nerve should be considered as a possible cause...|$|E
5000|$|... 1979: Scott Olson and Brennan Olson of Minneapolis, Minnesota {{came across}} a pair of inline skates created in the 1960s by the Chicago Roller Skate Company and, seeing the {{potential}} for off-ice hockey training, set about redesigning the skates using modern materials and attaching ice <b>hockey</b> <b>boots.</b> A few years later Scott Olson began heavily promoting the skates and launched the company Rollerblade, Inc..|$|R
5000|$|Tackaberry's {{neighbour}} Joe Hall, {{a professional}} hockey player, complained to Tackaberry about his <b>hockey</b> <b>boots</b> not lasting him {{the entire season}} without collapsing and in 1905 commissioned Tackaberry {{to make him a}} new, more durable pair of boots. Combining the natural strength of kangaroo leather with a reinforced toe, Tackaberry had the winning combination. The following year in 1906, Tackaberry was flooded with orders from Hall's team members, the business took off from there and this specific style of boot became known as the Tackaberry.|$|R
5000|$|The skates used by goaltenders are cut {{lower in}} the ankle than a normal hockey skate and the boot sits closer to the ice for a lower center of gravity. The boot itself is encased in {{hardened}} plastic, called a [...] "cowling", protecting the toe, ankle and heel from {{the force of the}} shot puck. The blade is usually longer and has less rocker (curvature to the blade) {{to make it easier for}} the goalie to move side to side in the crease. Goalie skates lack a tendon guard. Unlike regular hockey skates, goalie skates are usually protected by a synthetic material covering the toe-part of the skate. This is to prevent damage from the puck. The blade of the goalie skate is not as useful in turning as regular hockey skates, because the blade is rockered less, thus making turns slightly inconvenient. The material used to make the boot of the goalie skate is a harder synthetic material than regular <b>hockey</b> <b>boots.</b>|$|R

50|$|As in ice hockey, the goaltender is an {{individual}} who guards the net, {{in this case a}} makeshift area whose width is demarcated with available markers on the ground, such as the player's coats or snow piles. The net's dimensions vary but are generally 4 to 6 ft wide and approximately 2 to 3 ft high. The goaltender may use a jacket or hat in order to stop the ball. A variation played outdoors is <b>boot</b> <b>hockey,</b> played in the winter when most players are likely to be wearing boots, and is a form of shinny; the term <b>boot</b> <b>hockey</b> also refers to a variant of street hockey.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the differences in ankle flexibility and skating technique between a traditional <b>hockey</b> skate <b>boot</b> and a <b>hockey</b> skate <b>boot</b> with a flexible rear tendon guard. Skating technique was further investigated at different speeds to give insight on how skating technique alters as skating speed is increased. Methods: Eight elite hockey players were selected for the present study, which was conducted while skating on an Endless Ice Skating Treadmill.   Variables were recorded using a three-camera setup and measured from video records at five selected treadmill speeds using the Dartfish Team Pro v 6 software.   Kinematic variables were then compared between the two skate designs with a doubly multivariate repeated measures design.   Statistical significance was set at p< 0. 05.   Results: Post hoc univariate tests comparing skate designs displayed significant increases in plantar flexion, plantar flexion angular velocity, hip extension, hip extension angular velocity, stride length, and stride velocity while participants were wearing the skates that had a flexible rear tendon guard.   Significant increases were also displayed in plantar flexion, plantar flexion angular velocity, knee extension, knee extension angular velocity, hip extension, hip extension angular velocity, hip abduction range of motion, hip abduction angular velocity, stride width, stride length, and stride velocity as the treadmill speed increased. There was also a significant decrease in the time the skate was in contact with the treadmill as treadmill speed increased. Conclusion: The results suggested that while skating forward, hockey players could improve their hockey skating technique by using hockey skates that have a flexible rear tendon guard.   This flexible tendon guard improved skating technique by increasing the time of force application to the ice by increasing the range of ankle plantar flexion during propulsion of the forward skating stride.   Keywords: skate design, plantar flexion, tendon guar...|$|R
50|$|Kevlar {{is used as}} a {{material}} in more than 200 applications, including tennis rackets, skis, boats, airplanes, ropes, cables, tires, and bullet-proof vests. It has been used for car tires, fire fighter <b>boots,</b> <b>hockey</b> sticks, cut-resistant gloves and armored cars. It has also been used for protective building materials like bomb-proof materials, hurricane safe rooms, and bridge reinforcements. During the week of Kwolek's death, the one millionth bullet-resistant vest made with Kevlar was sold. Kevlar is also used to build cellular telephones; Motorola's Droid RAZR has a Kevlar unibody.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study {{quantified}} fit of ice <b>hockey</b> skate <b>boots</b> {{by measuring}} the pressure (MP) at the foot/ankle-to-boot interface using three skate sizes. The relationship between perceived pressure (PP), perceived comfort (PC) and measured pressures (MP) also were documented. Methods. 18 male subjects participated. Thirty piezo-resistive sensors recorded MPs from seven areas with the foot/ankle in various positions. A Visual Analogue Scale was used for subjective assessment of PP and PC. Results. Overall fit MP was estimated at 34. 2 KPa though significant mixed interactions (p< 0. 05) occurred between areas, foot/ankle positions and sizes. MP correlations with PP, PC, and foot/ankle dimensions were low though a strong inverse relationship was identified between PP and PC (r = - 0. 63). Conclusions. The technology and protocol adopted was effective in discriminating "fit" between regional pressure differences as well as responsive to foot/ankle positions. Further examination of other footwear products and different populations is feasible and warranted...|$|R
50|$|Though the {{neighborhood}} is part of Edina, part of its distinction is the independent nature of this area that has roughly 750 homes. That independence is created {{in part by the}} cohesive relationships within {{the neighborhood}} that are developed through many event and organizations that are endemic to the neighborhood. The Morningside Babysitting Cooperative has existed for nearly a century and still tracks shared hours of child care among its members. The Morningside Woman's Club was organized in 1937; it was previously known as the Morningside Literary Club. The area has an active Neighborhood Association that provides for a voice at City Hall to look after the unique needs and values of Morningside. A Morningside men's group called, the Morningside Athletic Club (MAC), meets every Saturday morning at Weber Park for sports activity, such as soccer, football and ice <b>boot</b> <b>hockey.</b>|$|R
