5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{estimated}} 90,370 physicians or 1 per every 833 people, 480,910 nurses, 43,220 dentists, and 1 hospital bed per every 769 people. Retention of skilled practitioners <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> 70% of nursing graduates go overseas to work. The Philippines is the biggest supplier of nurses for export.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{is typical}} of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> as many {{previously}} wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|E
50|$|Corrosion of the {{insulators}} {{was found}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in the harsh chemical environment as they gradually became conductive and the self-discharge rate increased. Dendritic-sodium growth can also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In November 2010, he {{yet again}} {{repeated}} his protest during a Washington Post interview: [...] "The raids <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> always. They <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> then, they <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> now. They {{have to go}} away. The Afghan people don't like these raids, {{if there is any}} raid {{it has to be done}} by the Afghan government within the Afghan laws. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> continuing disagreement between us." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Windows {{keeps the}} system {{real-time}} clock in local time. This causes several problems, including compatibility when multi booting with operating systems {{that set the}} clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a Windows registry entry RealTimeIsUniversal that had been introduced many years earlier, when Windows NT supported RISC machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained. Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> because {{underwater noise pollution}} interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the family {{as it is for}} many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> or in electric field seekers.|$|E
5|$|The major {{risks to}} the jaguar include {{deforestation}} across its habitat, increasing competition for food with human beings, especially in dry and unproductive habitat, poaching, hurricanes in northern parts of its range, and the behavior of ranchers who will often kill the cat where it preys on livestock. When adapted to the prey, the jaguar {{has been shown to}} take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2010 interview, singer Klaus Meine {{commented on}} the album cover, stating: [...] "We just {{did not know it}} would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in America, it was just sex and rock 'n' roll. It is odd that in America some of these covers <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> because in the 80's when we would tour here, we always had boobs flashed to us {{at the front of the}} stage. Nowhere else in the world, just here. We just did not think it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> to put out a record like Lovedrive in America." ...|$|R

5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E
