Man Bites Town, published in 1993, is a collection of columns that he wrote for The Los Angeles Times between 1989 and 1992. Published in 1999, It's the Stupidity, Stupid analyzed the hatred some people had for then-President Bill Clinton. Shearer believes that Clinton became disliked because he had an affair with [...] "the least powerful, least credentialed women cleared into his official compound." [...] <b>His</b> <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>book</b> is Not Enough Indians, his first novel. Published in 2006, it is a comic novel about Native Americans and gambling. Without the [...] "pleasures of collaboration" [...] and [...] "spontaneity and improvisation which characterize his other projects", Not Enough Indians was a [...] "struggle" [...] for Shearer to write. He said that [...] "the only fun thing about it was having written it. It was lonely, I had no deal for it and it took six years to do. It was a profoundly disturbing act of self-discipline." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cressie is {{best known}} for having brought {{disparate}} statistical methodologies into a nascent discipline known as Spatial Statistics. In his widely cited book, Statistics for Spatial Data, Cressie established a general spatial model that unified statistics for geostatistical data, regular and irregular lattice data, point patterns, and random sets. [...] Since the 1980s, he has been a developer of statistical theory, methodology and applications for spatial and spatio-temporal data.

It has been applied in areas of ‘big science,’ such as remote sensing of Earth on a global scale, understanding the global carbon cycle and its effect on climate change, Greenland ice-sheet dynamics, and disease mapping.|$|E
2500|$|William Robinson (no relation) takes a {{very similar}} view to that of his namesake. In <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>book,</b> Understanding Phenomenal Consciousness, he is unusual as a dualist in calling for {{research}} programs that investigate the relation of qualia to the brain. The problem is so stubborn, he says, that too many philosophers would prefer [...] "to explain it away", but he would rather have it explained and does not see why the effort should not be made. However, he does not expect {{there to be a}} straightforward scientific reduction of phenomenal experience to neural architecture; on the contrary he regards this as a forlorn hope. The [...] "Qualitative Event Realism" [...] that Robinson espouses sees phenomenal consciousness as caused by brain events but not identical with them, being non-material events.|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{writes in}} <b>his</b> <b>most</b> <b>recent</b> <b>book,</b> The Audacity of Hope: [...] "Affirmative action programs, when {{properly}} structured, can open up opportunities otherwise closed to qualified minorities without diminishing opportunities for white students." [...] In July, Obama stated, [...] "I am {{a strong supporter}} of affirmative action when properly structured so that {{it is not just a}} quota, but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced, continue to experience, and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of American life." [...] He has indicated support for affirmative action based on class, not just race, (q.v. redistributive change) in comments where he said that his daughters should be treated by prospective colleges and employers as people that grew up with a privileged background.|$|E
