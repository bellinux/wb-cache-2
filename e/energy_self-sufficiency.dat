5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over <b>energy</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E

On the question of Finland's participation in NATO operations in Libya during the 2011 Libyan civil war, Soini, saying [...] "Finland {{should not be taken}} into wars," [...] was accompanied by the Left Alliance's leader Paavo Arhinmäki on disagreeing with the other party leaders' stance on supporting Finland's participation. All the opposition parties criticised the government's tax policies which they claimed were aiming towards the establishment of a flat tax. On the question of energy policy, the chairpersons of the NCP, True Finns and SPP were in favour of building more nuclear energy on the grounds of achieving <b>energy</b> <b>self-sufficiency.</b> Jyrki Katainen said that [...] "we need to decide to either import nuclear energy from Russia or produce it ourselves" [...] and Soini pointed out that the steel industry does not get along with mere wind energy,— while the leaders of the other five parties were against it, with some preferring instead to build more renewable energy infrastructure. Anni Sinnemäki of the Green League said that [...] "not all renewable energy is expensive" [...] and Urpilainen insisted that after the summer 2010 decisions to give licences for two nuclear plants, a halt was needed for reconsideration in any decision to further nuclear projects. Stefan Wallin of the SPP was the only party leader willing to force municipalities to take in the refugees allocated to them.|$|E

40|$|In {{hydroelectric}} dominated systems, {{the value}} and benefits of energy are higher during extended dry periods and lower during extended or extreme wet periods. By accounting for regional and temporal differences {{in the relationship between}} wind speed and reservoir inflow behavior during wind farm site selection, the benefits of energy diversification can be maximized. The goal of this work was to help maximize the value of wind power by quantifying the long-term (30 -year) relationships between wind speed and streamflow behavior, using British Columbia (BC) and the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as a case study. Clean <b>energy</b> and <b>self-sufficiency</b> policies in British BC make the benefits of increased generation during low streamflow periods particularly large. Wind density (WD) estimates from a height of 10 m (North American Regional Reanalysis, NARR) were correlated with cumulative usable inflows (CUI) for BC (collected from BC Hydro) for 1979 – 2010. The strongest WD-CUI correlations were found along the US coast (r ~ 0. 55), whereas generally weaker correlations were found in northern regions, with negative correlations (r ~ - 0. 25) along BC’s North Coast. Furthermore, during the lowest inflow years, WD anomalies increased by up to 40 % above average values for the North Coast. Seasonally, high flows during the spring freshet were coincident with widespread negative WD anomalies, with a similar but opposite pattern for low inflow winter months. These poorly or negatively correlated sites could have a moderating influence on climate related variability in provincial electricity supply, by producing greater than average generation in low inflow years and reduced generation in wet years. Wind speed and WD trends were also analyzed for all NARR grid locations, which showed statistically significant positive trends for most of the PNW and the largest increases along the Pacific Coast...|$|R

Its primary source of data is a pilot survey and energy literacy test distributed in English and Danish to 328 respondents spread across the country. The survey results are used to test four propositions about energy prices, being “green,” public knowledge and competence about <b>energy</b> issues, and <b>self-sufficiency</b> and sustainable technology. The data supports the propositions that Danes identify with “being green” and prefer national and local policies that endorse sustainable technology and being self-sufficient. However, the data also challenges the propositions that Danes would prioritize low energy prices and affordability as key energy concerns and that they are knowledgeable about energy and environmental issues. In this way, a problematic gap may exist between what many academic articles (and previous surveys) report Danish attitudes to be and what this study suggests they are. Given Denmark's ambitious low-carbon goals, these findings have clear relevance to other communities and countries seeking to decarbonize their own energy sectors...|$|R

40|$|The {{drive to}} expand {{renewable}} energies is often in direct conflict with sustainable development goals. Thus, {{it is important}} that energy policies account for potential trade-offs. We assess the interlinkages between energy, food, water and land, for two case studies, Okinawa and Sogn og Fjordane. We apply a range of assessment methods and study their usefulness as tools to identify trade-offs and to compare the sustainability performance. We calculate cross-sectoral footprints, self-sufficiency ratios and perform a simplified Energy-Water-Food nexus analysis. We use the latter for assessing scenarios to increase <b>energy</b> and food <b>self-sufficiency</b> in Okinawa, while we use ecosystem service (ESS) accounting for Sogn og Fjordane. For Okinawa, we find that constraints on the energy, food and water sectors urgently call for integrated approaches to energy policy; for Sogn og Fjordane, the further expansion of renewables comes at the expense of cultural and supporting ESS, which could outweigh gains from increased energy exports. We recommend a general upgrade to indicators and visualization methods that look beyond averages and a fostering of infrastructure for data on sustainable development based on harmonized international protocols.

The growing national and international demand of bioenergy is particular interest to developing countries like Indonesia for seeking opportunities on economic growth and trade. Indonesia has a comparative advantage for bioenergy production because of greater availability of land, favorable climatic conditions for agriculture and lower labor costs. However, Indonesia faces socio-economic and environmental implications affecting the potential to benefit from the increased local and global demand of bioenergy. The interrelationship between land uses and the competing needs of energy and food security is a key issue in the bioenergy that should be considered. In addition, the effects of large-scale bioenergy production on global commodity prices are a significant trade concern. Bioenergy production may also entail harmful environmental effects such as deforestation and loss of biodiversity. Regulation is required to reduce the negative impacts of large-scale production, as well as to ensure that the most cost-effective and highest-energy conversion technologies are used.
