2500|$|In 1987 Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase) began legal {{proceedings}} against T ("Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., Plaintiff-appellee, v. Turner & Newall, Plc, Formerly Known As Turner & Newall Ltd., Defendant-third-party-plaintiff-appellant, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Turner Construction Company, third-party-defendants") in the United States. Chase [...] claimed compensatory and punitive damages from T <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> created at Chase's corporate headquarters {{by the presence}} of spray applicated asbestos fireproofing materials. In the United Kingdom, John Battle had complained to Parliament that securing documents from T was causing progress with the Armley victims' cases to stall, with [...] "documents shifted around from one subsidiary to another within the parent group. Lawyers are expected to specify exactly what records they want without knowing what the company holds. Even if they manage to specify particular records, such as reports on the escape of dust from the factory and tested measurements of asbestos levels within the factory or in the surrounding area - even details of the factory's structure and its ventilation system - those documents are either outwith the rules of discovery or the reply comes back that the records no longer exist." [...] But as the Chase case progressed, around two million T documents, many of which had previously been unseen by British solicitors and historians, were uncovered by the discovery process and research in the US.|$|E
6000|$|The ninth hole, {{like so many}} on our links, can be a {{perfectly}} simple four, although the rolling nature of the green makes bogey always a somewhat doubtful feat; but, on the other hand, if you foozle your drive, you can easily achieve double figures. The tee is on the farther side of the pond, beyond the bridge, where the water narrows almost to the dimensions of a brook. You drive across this water and over a tangle of trees and under-growth on the other bank. The distance to the fairway cannot be more than sixty yards, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> is purely a mental one, and yet how many fair hopes have been wrecked there! ...|$|E

60|$|In front {{the white}} spray {{of the fall}} whirled beneath the {{tremendous}} wall of rock, and about her stood groups of hard-handed men, who had driven the heading with strenuous, insistent toil. She knew what the work had cost them, and could understand the look in their steady eyes. They had faced the river {{in the depths of}} the tremendous rift, borne with the icy winter, and patiently grappled with obstacle after obstacle. Their money had not sufficed to purchase them costly machines. They had pitted steadfast courage and hardened muscle against the vast primeval forces of untrammelled Nature. Laura felt deeply stirred as she glanced at them. They were simple men, but they had faced and beaten roaring flood and stinging frost, caring little <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> to life or limb as they played their part in that tremendous struggle with axe and drill.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} already that but <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> of {{a journey to}} Tahiti I should doubtless never have written this book. It is thither that after many wanderings Charles Strickland came, and it is there that he painted the {{pictures}} on which his fame most securely rests. I suppose no artist achieves completely the realisation of the dream that obsesses him, and Strickland, harassed incessantly by his struggle with technique, managed, perhaps, less than others to express the vision that he saw with his mind's eye; but in Tahiti the circumstances were favourable to him; he found in his surroundings the accidents necessary for his inspiration to become effective, and his later pictures give at least a suggestion of what he sought. They offer the imagination something new and strange. It is as though in this far country his spirit, that had wandered disembodied, seeking a tenement, at last was able to clothe itself in flesh. To use the hackneyed phrase, here he found himself.|$|E
60|$|A half-hour {{devoted to}} {{wringing}} my clothing and dry-charging my revolver, {{and we were}} away. A brisk canter of a half-hour under the arches of the trees brought us to the river, where it was our ill luck to find a boat and three soldiers of our brigade. These men had been for several hours concealed in the brush patiently watching the opposite bank in the amiable hope of getting a shot at some unwary Confederate, but had seen none. For a great distance {{up and down the}} stream on the other side, and for at least a mile back from it, extended cornfields. Beyond the cornfields, on slightly higher ground, was a thin forest, with breaks here and there in its continuity, denoting plantations, probably. No houses were in sight, and no camps. We knew that it was the enemy's ground, but whether his forces were disposed along the slightly higher country bordering the bottom lands, or at strategic points miles back, as ours were, we knew no more than the least curious private in our army. In any case the river line would naturally be picketed or patrolled. But the charm of the unknown was upon us: the mysterious exerted its old-time fascination, beckoning to us from that silent shore so peaceful and dreamy in the beauty of the quiet Sunday morning. The temptation was strong and we fell. The soldiers were as eager <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> as we, and readily volunteered for the madmen's enterprise. Concealing our horses in a cane-brake, we unmoored the boat and rowed across unmolested.|$|E

6000|$|His prayers being ended, {{he goes to}} the citadel: The governor, alarmed {{with the}} cries and murmurs of the people, could not {{dissemble}} his disturbance, but reproached the Father for having engaged them in this enterprize. But Xavier upbraided him with his distrust of God; and said, smiling, to him, [...] "What! are you so dejected for so slight an accident?" [...] After which, they went in company to the shore, where the soldiers belonging to the admiral stood in great consternation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> they had run so lately. The Father reassured them, and exhorted them to remain constant in their holy resolution, notwithstanding their petty misadventure: he remonstrated to them, that heaven had not permitted their admiral to sink, but only to make trial of their faith; neither had themselves been saved from shipwreck, but only that they might perform their vow. In the mean time, the governor held it necessary to summon the great council. All the officers of the town, and the principal inhabitants, were of opinion to give over an enterprize, which, as they thought, was begun rashly, and could have no fortunate conclusion. But the captains and soldiers of the fleet, encouraged by the words of the holy man, and inspired with vigour, which had something in it of more than human, were of a quite contrary judgment. They unanimously protested, that they had rather die than violate that faith, which they had solemnly engaged to Jesus Christ. [...] "For the rest," [...] said they, [...] "what have we more to fear this day than we had yesterday? our number is not diminished, though we have one vessel less, and we shall fight as well with six foysts, as we should with seven. But, on the other side, what hopes ought we not to conceive, under the auspices and promise of Father Francis?" ...|$|E
