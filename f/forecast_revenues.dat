40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{personal income tax}} revenue forecasting model which incorporates a functional specification of the entire size distribution of incomeestimated using aggregate data. The model is shown to yield substantially moreaccetrate forecasts for Minnesota than other revenue forecasting models which do not incorpocate a functional specification of the income distribution. Although the choice of arevenue forecasting model is somewhat subjective, our {{results indicate that the}} general approach of modeling the entire income dis-tribution by a functional form is highly desirable in terms of forecast accuracy. An income tax revenue forecasting model should account for two factors related to the distribution of income which can affect tax revenues. First, incomes of individual taxpayers generally grow over time, which pushes them into higher tax brackets in a progressive tax structure. As cogently described by Neil Singer (1970), this &dquo;rate effect&dquo; has a systematic impact on tax revenues over a wide range of individual incomes. Second, the number of taxpayers varies over time. To the extent that new taxpayers have an income distribution different from that of individuals who are already taxpayers, a change in gross income resulting from additional taxpayers is unlikely to produce the same revenues as the identical change resulting from increasing incomes of previous taxpayers. In addition, a revenue forecasting model should have the capacity to <b>forecast</b> <b>revenues</b> under alternative effective ta...|$|E

Based on the analysis of the current state of the domestic tourism industry in Russia, the authors propose a division of the subjects of the tourism market, which are targeted by tax incentives, a new system for classifying domestic enterprises indicating the basic requirements and conditions for obtaining support, as well as specific measures of organizational and fiscal provisions for the growth of the domestic tourism market...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops econometric {{methods that}} facilitate estimation and improve forecasting performance in panel data models. The panel considered {{in this paper}} features large cross-sectional dimension (N) but short time series (T). It is modeled by a dynamic linear model with common and heterogeneous coefficients and cross-sectional heteroskedasticity. Due to short T, traditional methods have difficulty in disentangling the heterogeneous parameters from the shocks, which contaminates the estimates of the heterogeneous parameters. To tackle this problem, the methods developed in this dissertation assume {{that there is an}} underlying distribution of the heterogeneous parameters and pool the information from the whole cross-section together via this distribution. Chapter 2, coauthored with Hyungsik Roger Moon and Frank Schorfheide, constructs point forecasts using an empirical Bayes method that builds on Tweedie 2 ̆ 7 s formula to obtain the posterior mean of the heterogeneous coefficients under a correlated random effects distribution. We show that the risk of a predictor based on a non-parametric estimate of the Tweedie correction is asymptotically equivalent to the risk of a predictor that treats the correlated-random-effects distribution as known (ratio-optimality). Our empirical Bayes predictor performs well compared to various competitors in a Monte Carlo study. In an empirical application, we use the predictor to <b>forecast</b> <b>revenues</b> for a large panel of bank holding companies and compare forecasts that condition on actual and severely adverse macroeconomic conditions. In Chapter 3, I focus on density forecasts and use a full Bayes approach, where the distribution of the heterogeneous coefficients is modeled nonparametrically allowing for correlation between heterogeneous parameters and initial conditions as well as individual-specific regressors. I develop a simulation-based posterior sampling algorithm specifically addressing the nonparametric density estimation of unobserved heterogeneous parameters. I prove that both the estimated common parameters and the estimated distribution of the heterogeneous parameters achieve posterior consistency, and that the density forecasts asymptotically converge to the oracle forecast. Monte Carlo simulations and an application to young firm dynamics demonstrate improvements in density forecasts relative to alternative approaches. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{budget is}} not convincing enough {{to advance the}} treasurer’s ambitions, {{according}} to John Edwards THE WONDER of Treasurer Peter Costello’s 2005 - 06 budget is a handsome run of higher than expected forecast revenue, {{not only for the}} current year but right through to 2008 - 09. That’s why Mr Costello is able to promise big tax cuts and a useful contribution to funding future public pensions liabilities, measures to encourage movement from welfare to work, more child care places and assorted spending increases, and still leave a considerable underlying surplus in each of the next four years. It is every treasurer’s dream budget. But the budget is also a missed opportunity. After fourteen years of continuous prosperity, the forecast stream of revenues offered Mr Costello the opportunity to entrench the expansion with a commitment to increase skills through more education and training, to increase supply through targeted infrastructure investment, to increase incentives by broadening the base of income tax and reducing the marginal rates, and to restrain consumer demand by budgeting an underlying surplus through next year at least as great as the expected outcome for the current year. On each of these opportunities, the treasurer passed. Caught between the embarrassment of unexpectedly high revenues, a commitment to preserve the bond market by continuing to issue government debt, and a reluctance to undertake major infrastructure projects, Mr Costello decided to hand {{a good deal of the}} revenue back to the taxpayer. The $ 22 billion in tax cuts over four years are markedly more generous to the well off than the not so well off, with a sharp increase in the threshold for the top marginal rate of 47 cents and complete elimination of the superannuation contributions tax surcharge for high incomes. There will be no complaint from the winners, but it is another missed opportunity for a major tax reform. Mr Costello has spent $ 22 bn in expected revenues over four years, and in doing so lost the means to pay for serious reform of the structure of personal income tax within the life of this parliament. The only sensible measure of the government’s contribution to the change in overall demand next year is the change in its underlying budget surplus compared to this year. On Mr Costello’s forecast the underlying surplus this year will be $ 9. 2 bn and next year will be $ 8. 9 bn. It is fair to say this tiny fall in the budget surplus will not stimulate demand. But Mr Costello has passed up the opportunity to restrain demand - and avert another interest rate tightening - by budgeting a bigger surplus next year. The Reserve Bank will be unaffected by the budget, which is to say the likelihood of a tightening in the second half remains. Mr Costello thinks the economy is quite weak, and needs help. The Reserve Bank does not. As we saw in last week’s Statement on Monetary Policy the Bank thinks demand may have slowed a bit this year, but the strong terms of trade and high business investment will keep it going at a reasonable pace. The creation of a Future Fund to amass financial assets against future pubic service pension liabilities was announced during the October 2004 election campaign. The budget puts clothes on the form, and assets in the fund. Importantly, Mr Costello has said the $ 30 bn plus proceeds from the sale of the government share of Telstra will be put in the fund, a commitment which will put him in a serious conflict with the National Party, and also with those in the government who believe the federal government can be doing more to build infrastructure. There are roughly 700, 000 working age Australians on disability support pensions, and 400, 000 on the supporting parents benefit. The budget includes measures intended to push a significant proportion of them into jobs. The tougher eligibility tests and lower effective marginal tax rates will be useful in slowing the growth of welfare dependence - but it is entirely implausible that single parents now minding children and older males on disability support pensions will make a big difference to the looming skills shortages in the Australian economy. It is a useful measure, but not for addressing labour supply constraints. The economic forecasts offered by the budget are towards the lower end of consensus range, but well within it. I think a 2 per cent real growth outcome for 2004 - 05 is about right, and since we have half of the data for the year it is not a bold forecast. The economy may do a little better in 2005 - 06 than the 3 per cent forecast in the budget, but not much better. The forecast composition of growth shows Treasury’s firm belief that exports will pick up sufficiently through 2005 and 2006 to offset the continuing fall in residential construction, a view I share. Behind the unexpectedly high <b>forecast</b> <b>revenues</b> is a high profit share of GDP, which reflects high commodity prices, productivity gains, and restrained growth in wages. Personal income tax has also been increased by rising incomes and employment, even allowing for the tax cuts announced during the last election. The swelling revenue stream was already strikingly apparent in last year’s Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO), which lifted the underlying surplus by roughly $ 12 billion over the four year forecast period, compared to the budget forecast only five months earlier. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook came out only two months after the PEFO, modestly raised revenue projections but also the spending projections, for minimal net impact on the underlying surpluses. The 2005 - 06 budget lifts the underlying surplus projections in each of the forecast years compared to the December estimate, after providing for $ 22 billion in tax cuts and considerable additional spending. THE POLITICS of this budget are as much between the treasurer and the prime minister as between the government and the opposition. In the past two weeks Mr Costello has challenged Mr Howard for the top job, and despite the temporary lift he will get from the budget publicity, he has already lost. This leadership challenge was conducted without a vote, a party room discussion, or any serious counting of numbers. It took the form of Mr Costello’s claim on the party leadership, advanced through the media and personally pressed in a meeting with the prime minister. Mr Howard called his bluff, and Mr Costello has discovered he has a poor hand. The public opinion polls suggest he could lose against opposition leader Kim Beazley, while Mr Howard would win. Party room opinion suggests the while Mr Costello would be elected leader virtually unanimously if Mr Howard chooses to leave, he would get very few votes in a contest against him. The budget is Mr Costello’s one chance to break through, but it is not big enough, fresh enough or convincing enough to change his standing. In the undeclared challenge, Mr Costello is the undeclared loser. • John Edwards is Chief Economist with HSBC.
