500|$|Several {{concepts}} and items of imagery {{have been used}} in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth {{is in the form of}} a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, [...] "All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the <b>good</b> <b>Lord</b> would see fit to give us a child," [...] which was compared to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
500|$|The law {{was applied}} so {{strictly}} {{that anyone who}} apprehended a thief with his property {{was not allowed to}} recover it unless the miscreant and the stolen goods were presented to the bailiff. The goods were otherwise forfeited to the lord of the manor, and their previous rightful owner was liable to find himself charged with theftbote, or conniving in the felony.

500|$|Noel Gallagher {{began working}} on [...] "Live Forever" [...] in 1991, while working for a {{building}} company {{in his hometown of}} Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he was listening to the Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: [...] "It was the bit from [...] "Shine a Light" [...] that goes , [...] "May the <b>good</b> <b>Lord</b> shine a light on you"", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to [...] "Maybe I don't really want to know". For a period afterwards, that was {{the only part of the}} song Gallagher had completed.|$|E

500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone noted [...] "the album de-emphasizes the (very) guilty pop pleasures of her 2004 debut {{in favor of}} leaden I-hate-you-Daddy laments such as [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "My Innocence". Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt commented that [...] "it's {{hard to imagine a}} more explicit snapshot of the highly publicized family problems that have plagued the star than [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)"". PopMatters's Whitney Strub said [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] "immediately commences with a line about 'wait for the postman to bring me a letter', which suggests songwriters dipping into the well of cliché without worrying about freshness," [...] while commenting that [...] "the world might not need another version of Britney Spears' 'E-Mail My Heart', but <b>good</b> <b>lord,</b> that song came out in 1999. Perhaps a text-message might arrive faster than snail-mail in late 2005, should Lohan's song-persona deign to enter the 21st century".|$|E
500|$|Barney Hoskyns {{describes}} [...] "Heylin's objections [...] {{the academic}} ones of a touchy Dylanologist: The Basement Tapes still contained {{some of the}} greatest music either Dylan or The Band ever recorded." [...] Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of The Band's songs: [...] "'Ain't No More Cane' may be included under false pretenses, but it is stirring stuff. ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song, a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th-century American music would only smile and thank the <b>Good</b> <b>Lord</b> for the gift of this song." [...] Of The Band's version of [...] "Don't Ya Tell Henry", he writes, [...] "True, the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two-LP set, as this wasn't from Woodstock or '67, and has no Dylan on it. ... But it is a song from The Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar. So give Robbie a break." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the battle}} was a minor engagement, the defense {{provided}} some additional time for Greene's main army of regulars to cross the Yadkin River without harassment near Salisbury, which allowed that force to regroup and resupply. [...] At {{the time of the}} skirmish, Greene was at a farm owned by David Carr (sometimes attributed as [...] "Cain"), approximately [...] from the tavern. [...] Carr's farm had been set as a secondary rendezvous point for the Patriot militia, but none of the expected units rallied to that location following the Torrence's Tavern engagement. [...] Upon reaching Salisbury after the loss, and finding nearly 1,700 stands of muskets rusted and in useless condition, Greene reportedly exclaimed [...] "These are the happy effects of defending the Country with Militia from which the <b>good</b> <b>Lord</b> deliver us!" [...] The tavern that stood at the location of {{the battle was}} burned to the ground the day after the engagement by the main British army, as it had been operated by the widow of a Patriot militiaman killed at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill.|$|E

500|$|Northumberland {{was tried}} on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall. The panels {{of the jury}} and judges were largely made up of his former colleagues. Dudley hinted that he had acted on the {{authority}} of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal. Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing, he asked [...] "whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges". After sentence was passed, he begged the Queen's mercy for his five sons, the eldest of whom was condemned with him, the rest waiting for their trials. He also asked to [...] "confess to a learned divine" [...] and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner, who had passed most of Edward's reign in the Tower and was now Mary's Lord Chancellor. The Duke's execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning; however, it was suddenly cancelled. Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula, where he took the Catholic communion and professed that [...] "the plagues that is upon the realm and upon us now {{is that we have}} erred from the faith these sixteen years." [...] A great propaganda coup for the new government, Dudley's words were officially distributed—especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt [...] "that I must prepare myself against tomorrow to receive my deadly stroke", as he wrote in a desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel: [...] "O my <b>good</b> <b>lord</b> remember how sweet life is, and how bitter ye contrary." [...] On the scaffold, before 10,000 people, Dudley confessed his guilt but maintained: ...|$|E
500|$|The Earl {{had always}} {{attempted}} to promote on merit rather than patronage {{and had become}} increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. At his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the King. The King asked if the navy were a better institution now {{than it had been}} on St Vincent's entrance into it. St Vincent replied that it was not. He stated: [...] "Sire I have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the Navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the Navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of Members of Parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old Officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on." [...] He continued on [...] "I would rather promote the son of an old deserving Officer than of any noble in the land." [...] In a letter dated 18 October 1806 to Viscount Howick, then the First Lord. [...] "If you will, my <b>good</b> <b>Lord,</b> bring a bill into Parliament to disqualify any Officer under the rank of Rear-Admiral to sit in the House of Commons, the Navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of Flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than I possess to command your fleets." [...] Presumably St Vincent was referring to a particular member of Parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.|$|E

Marty Stuart places the words [...] "If the <b>Good</b> <b>Lord's</b> willin' and the creek don't rise, we'll {{see you in the}} mornin'." [...] in Williams' mouth in his tribute album Hillbilly Heaven. In the Reed song and Cash cover the verses vary the rhyme, so the opening line commences: If the <b>good</b> <b>Lord's</b> willing and the creek stays down I'll be in your arms time the moon come around. But in following verses the rhyme changes through [...] "creeks don't rise", [...] "creek stay low", back to [...] "creeks don't rise".|$|R
