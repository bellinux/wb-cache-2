5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} Smith's wives, Emma Hale, {{gave birth to}} nine {{children}} during their marriage, five of whom died {{before the age of}} two. The eldest, Alvin (born in 1828), died within hours of birth, as did twins Thaddeus and Louisa (born in 1831). When the twins died, the Smiths adopted another set of twins, Julia and Joseph, whose mother had recently died in childbirth; Joseph died of measles in 1832. In 1841, Don Carlos, who had been born a year earlier, died of malaria. In 1842, Emma gave birth to a stillborn son. Joseph and <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> four sons who lived to maturity: Joseph Smith III, Frederick Granger Williams Smith, Alexander Hale Smith, and David Hyrum Smith.|$|E
5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by <b>Emma,</b> <b>had</b> broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with a wry sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E

25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> stayed as she was pregnant.

However at Scott's funeral, Alex is seen afar speaking to Emma that something does not make sense, leading to Emma filling Alex in on some unrevealed details. Black Bolt did not kill Cyclops, in fact, he never made it out of the facility at Muir Island, as he suffered an immediate reaction to the Terrigen mists, dying in Emma Frost's arms. Since then <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> been projecting an illusion of him to everyone else as a means of declaring war against the Inhumans in Scott's name.|$|E
25|$|Unbeknownst to everyone, a green mist {{flows from}} her pendant and re-enacts the time travel spell. Emma and Hook accidentally fall {{into it and}} {{end up in the}} Enchanted Forest of the past, and {{incidentally}} interrupt Prince Charming and Snow White's first meeting. They go to Rumpelstiltskin, who agrees to recreate the time travel spell while they ensure that Charming and Snow would fall in love. After a few mishaps, which included Emma being thrown in the Evil Queen's dungeon, they managed to set history back on its proper course, though <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> freed one of the Queen's prisoners who was due to be executed. Deciding to take the prisoner back to the present, Emma and Hook return to Rumplestiltskin for the fairy wand that can recreate the time travel spell, but it can only be done by a magic user who had used the spell before.

500|$|His wife Emma {{stated in}} her book, Mrs Charles Cruft's Famous Dog Book, {{published}} in 1949 {{that there was}} an unwritten rule that both herself and her husband couldn't own any dogs for fear of making others believe that they favoured one breed over another, even going as far to say [...] "we were determined to own a pet, so we took the least like of resistance and kept a – CAT!" [...] This was disproved in Cruft's memoirs, published posthumously in Charles Cruft's Dog Book in 1952, where Cruft explained that he had lived in households which had Alsatians and Borzois.

500|$|Historian Helena G. Allen {{noted that}} Liliʻuokalani and Kalākaua [...] "believed all {{religions}} had their 'rights' and {{were entitled to}} equal treatment and opportunities". Throughout her life, Liliʻuokalani showed a broad interest in the different Christian faiths including Catholicism, Mormonism, Episcopalianism and other Protestant denominations. In 1896, Liliʻuokalani became a regular member of the Hawaiian Congregation at St. Andrew's Cathedral associated with the Reformed Catholic (Anglican/Episcopal) Church of Hawaii, which King Kamehameha IV and Queen <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> founded. During the overthrow and her imprisonment, Bishop Alfred Willis of St. Andrew's Cathedral had openly supported the Queen while Reverend Henry Parker of Kawaiahaʻo had supported her opponents. Bishop Willis visited and wrote to her during her imprisonment and sent her {{a copy of the}} Book of Common Prayer.

500|$|She {{developed}} a contentious relationship with Queen Emma of Hawaii, {{the widow of}} Kamehameha IV and {{a close friend of}} Lunalilo. According to one of Emma's letters, an elderly palace attendant Waiaha and several other older women had given Lunalilo a [...] "piece of bananannah [...] stalk pressed to drink, medicated with love potions, to produce intense affections for Eliza Meek". Along with a group of Lunalilo's personal attendants and relatives (including his chamberlain and Eliza's brother-in-law Horace Crabbe), Eliza was present during the king's final months of illness. During this period, Eliza was notoriously hostile to Emma, who occasionally visited the ailing King to help nurse him. According to Dr. Georges Phillipe Trousseau, the King's personal physician, Lunalilo would have married <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> it not been for Eliza's interference. Eliza would refuse to leave Emma alone with Lunalilo even at the king's command. One night, in a fit of rage, Lunalilo threw a chair and a spittoon at Eliza's head after an argument with between the two. Emma recounted the instance in a letter to her cousin Peter Kaʻeo: ...|$|E
500|$|Stigand was {{appointed}} to the see of Elmham shortly after Edward the Confessor's coronation on 3 April 1043, probably on Emma's advice. This was the first episcopal appointment of Edward's reign. The diocese of Elmham covered East Anglia in eastern England, {{and was one of the}} poorer episcopal sees at that time. [...] He was consecrated bishop in 1043, but later that year Edward deposed Stigand and deprived him of his wealth. During the next year, however, Edward returned Stigand to office. The reasons for the deposition are unknown, but it was probably connected to the simultaneous fall from power of the dowager queen, Emma. Some sources state that <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> invited King Magnus I of Norway, a rival claimant to the English throne, to invade England and had offered her personal wealth to aid Magnus. Some suspected that Stigand had urged Emma to support Magnus, and claimed that his deposition was because of this. Contributing factors in Emma and Stigand's fall included Emma's wealth, and dislike of her political influence, which was linked to the reign of the unpopular Harthacnut.|$|E

The party visited Syracuse and then travelled on to Valletta, where Berry took Foudroyant {{so close to}} the harbour that the ship came under fire from the French batteries. No hits were scored, but Nelson was furious that <b>Emma</b> <b>had</b> been taken into danger and immediately ordered Berry to withdraw. His anger was exacerbated by Emma's refusal to retire from the quarterdeck during the brief exchange. From there, Foudroyant anchored at Marsa Sirocco, where Nelson and Emma lived together openly and were hosted by Troubridge and Graham. Sir William Hamilton, a prominent antiquarian as well as a diplomat, spent his time exploring the island. By early June, Nelson and his party had returned to Palermo, the beginning of a lengthy overland journey across Europe to Britain. Nelson also detached Foudroyant and Alexander from the blockade, again in defiance of Keith's explicit orders, to assist the Neapolitan royal family in their passage to Livorno. Enraged at Nelson's disobedience, Keith publicly remarked that [...] "Lady Hamilton has had command of the fleet long enough". In May, Troubridge returned to Britain and was replaced in command by Captain George Martin, while Graham was superseded by Major-General Henry Pigot.|$|E
