For example, many sewage treatment plants include a secondary treatment stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest organic compounds. In such biofilms, bacteria are mainly responsible for removal of organic matter (BOD), while protozoa and rotifers are mainly responsible for removal of suspended solids (SS), including pathogens and other microorganisms. Slow sand filters rely on biofilm development {{in the same way}} to <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> water from lake, spring or river sources for drinking purposes. What we regard as clean water is effectively a waste material to these microcellular organisms. Biofilms can help eliminate petroleum oil from contaminated oceans or marine systems. The oil is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities, in particular by a remarkable recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (HCB).|$|E
2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the <b>filter</b> <b>surface,</b> known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E

[...] Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 micrometre). [...] The microorganisms present in the water remain on the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] The filter is placed in a sterile petri dish with a selective medium, growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while other non--target organisms is suppressed. [...] Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the initial inoculum size can be determined. [...] Typically sample volumes of 100 ml will be used for water testing and filtered, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony density range of 20 to 60 colonies per filter. [...] Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a [...] "countable" [...] membrane. The filter is placed on a petri dish containing M-FC agar and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F). [...] This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth. [...] As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the aniline dye in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color.|$|E

This paper is aimed at identifying different patterns of surface EMG signals according to fractal dimension.

5000|$|In the 1970s, {{the product}} range was {{extended}} by backwash filters {{to protect the}} heat exchangers and condensers from macro fouling, like stones, pieces of wood, fibres, plastic sheeting, and mussels. Foreign matter will first settle on the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> As fouling builds up, differential pressure between filter inlet and outlet increases and the filter has to be cleaned by backwashing. For this purpose an electrically driven rotor covers the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> which is connected with a pipe leading outside. Installed in this pipe is a valve that is opened during the backwash process. The accumulated fouling is drawn off and discharged via the pipe which, downstream of the condenser, leads to the main cooling water pipe or a debris container.

40|$|Typical {{engineering}} {{rough surfaces}} show only limited {{resemblance to the}} artificially constructed rough surfaces {{that have been the}} basis of most previous fundamental research on turbulent flow over rough walls. In this article flow past an irregular rough surface is investigated, based on a scan of a rough graphite surface that serves as a typical example for an irregular rough surface found in engineering applications. The scanned map of surface height versus lateral coordinates is filtered in Fourier space to remove features on very small scales and to create a smoothly varying periodic representation of the surface. The surface is used as a no-slip boundary in direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow. For the resolution of the irregular boundary an iterative embedded boundary method is employed. The effects of the <b>surface</b> <b>filtering</b> on the turbulent flow are investigated by studying a series of surfaces with decreasing level of filtering. Mean flow, Reynolds stress and dispersive stress profiles show good agreement once a sufficiently large number of Fourier modes are retained. However, significant differences are observed if only the largest surface features are resolved. Strongly <b>filtered</b> <b>surfaces</b> give rise to a higher mean-flow velocity and to a higher variation of the streamwise velocity in the roughness layer compared with weakly <b>filtered</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In contrast, for the weakly <b>filtered</b> <b>surfaces</b> the mean flow is reversed over most of {{the lower part of the}} roughness sublayer and higher levels of dispersive shear stress are found...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{persistence}} of influenza A (IA) virus in aquatic habitats {{has been demonstrated}} to be a determinant for virus transmission dynamics in wild duck populations. In this study, we investigated virus strain-related variation in persistence in water for nine wild duck isolated IA viruses of three subtypes (H 3 N 8, H 4 N 6, and H 8 N 4). Results We experimentally estimated the loss of infectivity over time in three different types of water: distilled, <b>filtered</b> <b>surface</b> water, and intact surface water. All viruses persisted longest in distilled water followed by <b>filtered</b> <b>surface</b> water with markedly reduced durations of persistence observed in the intact surface water. Strain-related variations were observed in distilled and <b>filtered</b> <b>surface</b> water but limited variation was observed in the intact surface water. Conclusions Our {{findings suggest that the}} role of surface water for long-term (between years) maintenance of AI viruses in the environment may be limited, and suggest that the physico-chemical characteristics of water, as well as microorganisms, may be of strong importance. Results also indicate that the extent of strain-related variation observed in distilled water may overestimate persistence abilities for IA viruses in the wild and supports the need to develop experiments that account for these effects to assess subtype, genotype, as well as spatial and temporal variation in the {{persistence of}} IA viruses in aquatic habitats. </p...|$|R
50|$|With {{crossflow}} filtration the tangential {{motion of}} {{the bulk of the}} fluid across the membrane causes trapped particles on the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> to be rubbed off.

50|$|This type of {{filtration}} {{is typically}} selected for feeds containing {{a high proportion}} of small particle size solids (where the permeate is of most value) because solid material can quickly block (blind) the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> with dead-end filtration.

50|$|Backwashing of {{granular}} media filters involves several steps. First, {{the filter}} is taken off {{line and the}} water is drained to a level that is above {{the surface of the}} filter bed. Next, compressed air is pushed up through the filter material causing the filter bed to expand breaking up the compacted filter bed and forcing the accumulated particles into suspension. After the air scour cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through the filter bed continuing the filter bed expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above the <b>filter</b> <b>surface.</b> In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash. Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the turbidity of the backwash water is below an established value. At the end of the backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and the filter bed settles by gravity into its initial configuration. Water to be filtered is then applied to the <b>filter</b> <b>surface</b> until the filter clogs and the backwash cycle needs to be repeated.|$|E

Dogs {{were randomly assigned to}} experimental galactosemia or diabetes, or to a normal untreated group, and diabetic animals were then randomly assigned to either poor or good glycemic control. At five years duration, kidneys from the animals were compared by quantitative stereology. Glomerulopathy appeared in the poor control diabetes group, and the thickness of glomerular capillary basement membrane, the glomerular tuft volume, and the fraction of glomerulus occupied by mesangium were each significantly greater than normal. The capillary <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> area per glomerulus was supra-normal also, but nonetheless was subnormal relative to glomerular volume. The development of glomerulopathy was significantly inhibited in dogs assigned to good glycemic control. In galactosemic animals, the basement membrane thickness was greater than normal, but the glomerular volume, fractional and absolute volumes of mesangium, and capillary <b>filtering</b> <b>surface</b> area remained normal. The polyol concentration in renal cortex seemed elevated by galactosemia no less than by diabetes, and was highest in galactosemia. The galactosemic animals are known to have developed a retinopathy morphologically comparable to that of diabetic patients and diabetic dogs.

In these 14 males and 31 females, aged 13 - 52 yr, {{who had had}} IDDM for 2. 5 - 29 yr there was no strong relationship between either glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness or mesangial expansion and duration of IDDM. There was only a weak relationship between {{the thickness of the}} GBM and expansion of the mesangium. Thus, GBM thickening and mesangial expansion in IDDM occur at rates that often differ from one another and that vary greatly among patients. The clinical manifestations of diabetic nephropathy, albuminuria, hypertension, and decreased glomerular filtration rate related poorly or not at all to GBM thickening. In contrast, all light and electron microscopic measures of mesangial expansion were strongly related to the clinical manifestations of diabetic nephropathy, although in the absence of these clinical findings, {{it was not possible to}} predict the severity of any of the diabetic glomerular lesions.
