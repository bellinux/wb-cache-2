The hypoeutectoid graphitized <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> was proposed. The graphitizaion is difficult due to slow graphitization process, so it is curcial to accelerate the graphitization process. The results show that, through appropriate composition design and technology, the C atom can quickly transform to grahite within 4 hours. The microstructure of the graphitized <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> consists of ferrite, graphite and carbide. Moreover, the grain size of grapite is fine and the distribution is uniform, and the carbide mainly locate the ferrtie grain boundary or in the ferrite.

Conven-tionally, Pb {{has been added to}} free cutting steels to improve their machinability, but Pb in steel is thought to have a harmful effect on the human body. Therefore, as alternatives to Pb addition in free cutting steels, JFE Steel and NKK BARS & SHAPES studied graphite pre-cipitation in the steel and control of the sulfi de morphol-ogy by the chemical composition and developed new Pb-free free cutting steels based on these respective con-cepts. In the graphite-type <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> for machine structural use, JFE Steel realized machinability equal to that of the Pb-added steel by controlling the state of existence of C in the steel, and achieved an excellent balance of cold workability and high fatigue strength after quenching and tempering.

Enhanced machinability is characterised by low tool wear, short breaking chips, high surface quality and low cutting forces.

The EU-directive on end-of-life vehicles generally prohibits the use of lead for machinability enhancement but currently an exception for steels alloyed with up to 0. 35 % lead exists.

40|$|Hot {{cracking}} in welding {{is still}} an unresolved problem {{for a wide range}} of materials that restricts their use in production. Although <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steels</b> are a prominent example of hot cracking sensitivity, other industrially important materials like high strength aluminium alloys, many austenitic steel grades and several high-temperature alloys are also prone to hot cracking. In all cases the actual forming of a hot crack is not only the consequence of metallurgical reasons but also of special thermomechanical conditions, namely too much tensile strain on the not fully solidified regions. Therefore it is not only possible to avoid the cracks by avoiding the mentioned metallurgical reasons, but also by reducing or counteracting any stress / strain on the hot-cracking critical zones. As the latter approach is much less discussed in the literature and only seldom pursued industrial application research, this article wants to emphasize its importance by introducing a new technique against hot cracks on this basis. A new process technique is presented which aims at reducing or avoiding hot cracking during laser welding. It is based on a tailored temperature field around the molten pool that changes the thermomechanical conditions of the material during the solidification of the weld. The required additional volumetric heat input is realized by inductive heating. The technique was tested successfully on strongly hot cracking sensitive heat treatable <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steels.</b> The results of these tests show not only the relation between possible thermal and mechanical influences on the cracking intensity but also give important information about the possibilities and limits of the technique.

The unleaded variant showed in a distance of 6 – 8 mm from the surface a plane solidification line. The investigation showed that {{the root cause of}} the slivers was the wavy solidification line.

40|$|The {{effect of}} stress {{state on the}} {{initiation}} of damage for leaded <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> has been investigated under hot rolling conditions. Double notched (DN) circumferential tension samples were designed and used to simulate damage development at different stress states and deformation conditions using a Gleeble (3800) thermal-mechanical testing system. Two DN sample geometries with varying notch profiles were used to account for different states of stress. To simulate the conditions of hot rolling the samples were tested at high temperatures (900 – 1200  °C) and moderate strain rates (0. 1 – 1  s− 1). After testing to failure, which normally occurs at one notch of the specimen, the unfailed notch of each sample was sectioned to examine the sites where damage occurs since the material has been captured in a state very close to failure. Two of the cases examined have shown definitive damage paths occurring from ‘outside–in’ for a sharp notch deformed at T =  900  °C and from ‘inside–out’ for a blunt notch tested at T =  1200  °C for the same strain rate of 0. 1  s− 1.

40|$|AbstractAustenitic {{stainless}} steels are generally difficult to machine {{when compared to}} carbon or low alloy steels. The presence of Cr, Ni, and Mo raises {{the temperature in the}} flow zone during machining. These steels are strongly work hardening, and usually bond to the tool forming a build-up-edge. The increase of the tool life and better removal rates can be achieved through the use of <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> austenitic stainless <b>steels.</b> In these steels, sulfide and manganese can be added to form sulfide inclusions (MnS) that can induce stress concentration in the deforming material and facilitate the chip fracture. Finite element method simulation of the machining was carried out to investigate the influence of the inclusions in the machinability of the austenitic stainless steel. The simulation considers that the microstructure of the steel has two main constituents; the matrix of austenitic stainless steel and inclusions. Two simulation groups were carried out, the first one analyzing the machining cutting process of the workpiece and tool, and the second one was performed in a small area corresponding to a region inside the primary shear zone, where the stress concentrator effect of the inclusions in the austenitic stainless steel matrix was analyzed. This procedure was repeated for microstructures with different inclusions size, volume fraction and morphologies. The results obtained for the stress concentrations and strain near the inclusions showed that inclusions with elongated shapes usually give higher stresses than circular ones.

This is particularly of interest when investigating the effects of grain boundary sliding and decohesion of the material interfaces under hot deformation conditions. This can then be used to predict damage nucleation and growth at the grain boundaries applicable to both creep type damage and plasticity induced damage. A novel scheme was developed based on the Controlled Voronoi Poisson’s Tessellation technique (CVPT) to generate statistically equivalent microstructures based on the physical parameters of the microstructure in <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> under hot forming conditions. The generated microstructure was then used to study the effect of different parameters on the global response of the material. Furthermore, this model was utilised to calibrate the crystal plasticity material model using the experimental data available for high strain rate deformation of <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> at elevated temperatures. A micro-scale Representative Volume Element (RVE) was developed in which the grain boundaries and material interfaces have been represented by cohesive elements. The RVE consisting of an MnS inclusion surrounded by four austenitic grains was used to study the effect of inclusion orientation, grain orientations and the relative strength of grain boundaries and the matrix/inclusion interfaces on overall failure of the RVE. Furthermore, in the endeavour of finding the right modelling technique an extension to the conventional finite element method called XFEM proved to be capable of modelling strong and weak discontinuities independent of the FE mesh.

40|$|Continuous casting is used {{to solidify}} most of the steel {{produced}} in the world every year. The process reduces the number of required milling stages and results in qualitative semi-finished products such as billets, blooms and slabs which will later be rolled into more specific shapes. Extending the range of finished product sizes produced from a given concast bloom or billet section is often limited by the minimum area reduction required to ensure effective consolidation and final mechanical properties. Predicting effective consolidation or level of remnant porosity {{has always been an}} important issue for steel producers as it will affect the mechanical properties of final products (strength, ductility, etc.). It is known that partial or complete recovery of strength in such porous materials can be obtained by pore closure and diffusive healing processes at elevated temperature. Devising an appropriate healing process which does not cause discontinuity in the microstructure and mechanical properties at the healing sites and prevents distortion of the component during bonding requires an accurate choice of thermo-mechanical processing parameters. Although there has been considerable work on materials such as titanium alloys, aluminium alloys and copper, damage healing in <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> has not received much attention. The main aim of this research is to develop a realistic damage healing computational approach that can predict damage healing or recovery during soaking under different compressive stress levels, and be used for hot rolling applications. This study investigates the void elimination process through two stages of void closure and healing. An Abaqus/UMAT subroutine has been developed for the analysis of the material porosity elimination process including two stages of void closure and healing. This study uses the Gurson-Tvergaard model under hydrostatic compression to predict the void closure. A novel approach has been developed in the present work to identify the Gurson-Tvergaard model parameters using a non-gradient based optimisation search method (Pattern Search Method). The healing process is modelled based on a combination of diffusion bonding, creep and plasticity following the Pilling model and can be adapted to any other healing/diffusion bonding model. The material model has been calibrated for <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> and a stress state representative of the rolling process, and used to predict the closure and healing processes under rolling. The effect of parameters such as Roll Gap shape Factor (RGF), initial amount and distribution of void volume fraction on porosity elimination during rolling has also been investigated. An experimental technique has been developed to identify the conditions (temperature, pressure, time) required for void elimination in <b>Free</b> <b>Cutting</b> <b>Steel</b> (FCS). Different combinations of load and time were tested and optimum conditions have been obtained. Tensile tests on the bonded specimens have been carried out to measure the strength of the bonded region.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{influence}} of stress-state on ductile damage in <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> under hot forming conditions is examined. The industrial motivation for the project focuses on edge cracking in hot rolling. A brief outline of the hot rolling process conditions is necessary to define the important parameters affecting edge cracking. Triaxiality was, thus, identified as the key parameter relating to damage under hot rolling conditions. Based on a detailed literature review, the appropriate testing and modelling methodology were identified for this body of work. A high temperature, uniaxial tension test program was implemented to identify the effect of triaxiality on damage under hot forming conditions. Double notched bars with varying notch radii were utilised, thus inducing different stress triaxialities due to geometrical constraints. Based on the resultant stress-strain data the effect of triaxiality on ductility and the strain to failure was investigated. Subsequently, unbroken notches from tested double notched samples were sectioned and optically examined to reveal damage initiation sites. Interesting damage features were identified and correlated with sample geometry (i. e. triaxiality) and testing conditions. Finite element analysis of the double notched samples revealed the effect of triaxiality on the local stress-state. The accuracy of the mechanical analysis from such simulations was improved by incorporating the thermal gradients induced during high temperature Gleeble tests. Three stress parameters were examined {{in relation to their}} effect on the experimentally observed damage; maximum principal stress, effective stress and hydrostatic stress. The maximum principal stress and equivalent stress were most clearly correlated to damage development under multiaxial conditions for this particular <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel.</b> Based on the results of the stress-state investigation of the double notched samples, a multiaxial damage expression was developed that reproduced the experimentally observed damage characteristics. The new multiaxial damage model was calibrated using a combination of uniaxial and multiaxial stress-strain data and damage profiles. The model was shown to have good accuracy in predicting both the stress-strain data and the damage initiation sites as a function of geometry and damage conditions. Finally, an extensive range of temperature and strain rate conditions were simulated for all tested sample geometries, and an additional sample geometry, to fully understand how testing conditions affect damage characteristics and under what triaxialities this is prone to happen.

The novelty of the new design is its ability to maintain a constant spatial stress state during deformation, allowing a true correlation of the damage mechanism to the stress triaxiality; previous sample geometries had a large variation in stress during plastic deformation, which made it impossible to relate an observed damage mechanism to a particular stress state using a single sample. Continuum damage equations were calibrated using uniaxial tensile tests and implemented into finite element models of compressive test-pieces. The stress distributions in each test-piece geometry were compared and a single test-piece design was chosen with an optimised triaxial stress distribution.

In consequence, chemical dissolution of the tool into the chip occurs by a diffusion mechanism, causing chemical wear. Oxley incorporated the concept of seizure in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology. Oxley {{introduced the}} concept of equilibrium shear angle in his quantitative model for flow chip morphology, which incorporates the work of shear in the secondary shear zone instead of friction, once atomic contact is established, but Oxley’s model ignored potential interaction from metallurgical softening events in the secondary shear zone, which led to prediction of unrealistically high temperature at high cutting speeds. In fact, metallurgical softening events do occur particularly at high cutting speeds, causing shear localisation, which leads to significant deviation from Oxley’s model predictions. In this paper, Oxley’s model will be extended to capture the interaction of shear localisation in the secondary shear zone on the mechanics of metal cutting. Dynamic recrystallisation, phase transformation of the matrix and geometric softening owing to second phase particles are identified as important microstructural softening events causing shear localisation, which could intervene before the equilibrium shear angle is reached.

However, {{like any other}} manufacturing process, imperfections at various scales can appear during hot rolling therefore affecting product quality and cost effectiveness of the industrial process. Hot rolled FCS in particular suffers mainly from edge cracking taking place during the rolling process at high homologous temperature. Research {{studies have been conducted}} {{in order to understand the}} cause of such problem. Stress triaxiality and local microstructural inhomogeneities leading to damage formation are of particular interest in the current research. High temperature laboratory tests with specimen geometries specifically designed to generate stress triaxiality levels comparable to those experienced by the material during the hot rolling process have been conducted to initiate damage at the surface of these specimens. Particular attention has been paid to the influence of Manganese-Sulfide (MnS) inclusions on damage formation during these tests. A new experimental procedure has been developed to measure strain distributions at the scale of the microstructure in order to study the effect of strain localisation on damage formation and how this localisation is affected by the presence of MnS inclusions. A microgrid technique has been used to measure intra-granular strains in specimens deformed at temperatures up to 1200 ⁰C typical of a hot rolling process. Strain maps have been produced over relatively large areas of the microstructure in non-transformable austenitic stainless steels representative of the behaviour of FCS at high temperature and produced specifically for this research. Tests on FCS have also been conducted at lower temperatures including tensile tests inside a scanning electron microscope with full-field strain measurements obtained using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to study damage development over a range of temperatures and scales. Results have shown that local deformation and local damage at high temperature are highly influenced by the presence of grain boundaries and inclusions. Strain distribution maps highlight such influence on strain localisation. Moreover, the deformation temperature has a significant effect on the mechanism of local deformation and damage in FCS with damage nucleation along grain boundaries observed at the surface of the specimens deformed 1000 ⁰C as opposed to intra-granular cracking involving inclusions observed at the subsurface. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{available}} damage models do {{not accurately}} predict effective plastic {{strain to failure}} in low triaxiality stress states. A damage model was developed for low triaxiality that is appropriate to hot rolling of steel. This work focuses on nucleation and growth of damage {{as well as the}} effect of the strain and stress path. The latter is especially important for the rolling of bar and other complex cross-section products. A study of damage mechanisms and methods to model them has been undertaken. It is pointed out that the many models are only useful under certain conditions but can be used when the expected damage mechanisms are active. Several test types were evaluated to assess their ability to simulate stress state in rolling. A program has been written to evaluate the stress state for plane and axisymmetric tests, which allows one to choose the most appropriate test-piece geometry. A test has been designed and implemented. Thermal and mechanical data was gathered, which has been used to relate the stress triaxiality to damage growth and identify appropriate damage growth models. The size and spacing distributions of inclusions in free cutting steels have been measured. The different distributions {{have an effect on the}} ductility of the different steels. This effect has been found to change at different strain rates and temperatures. By better accounting for the effect of inclusions on damage growth under a range of test conditions, the damage model can be significantly improved. Free cutting steels that contained different additions of heavy metals were tested. The ductility and damage mechanisms were compared in each of the steels. The effect of the precipitation of the different heavy metals at the inclusion to matrix boundary was highlighted. The same damage mechanisms were observed in each steel but the ability to accommodate damage varied between the steels. Ex-situ synchrotron x-ray micro-tomography was used to better measure and quantify the distribution of inclusions and damage evolution in a <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel.</b> Localised damage coalescence away from the centre of the uniaxial tensile test-piece was attributed to the effect of inclusion clustering. This research was used to develop a realistic damage model, which can predict damage growth and coalescence for a range of forming parameters and different stress-state conditions related to hot rolling applications. The micro-mechanics based model includes the effects of inclusion distribution on damage. The model is calibrated using twenty six temperature based material constants.

Also, Ti {{is an important}} alloying element in stainless steels to stabilize C and N, and hence to improve the inter-granular corrosion resistance of the weld. Meanwhile, Ti alloyed steels can have severe nozzle clogging problems, which are detrimental to slab surface quality. The selenium added steels have been concerned to replace the conventionally lead added machinability steels because of environmental friendliness. Since the yield of Se addition into liquid steel is quite low due to its high vapor pressure at steelmaking temperatures, the improvement of Se yield becomes essential for its successful application to plant. In this thesis, in order to decrease the deleterious inclusions resulting in the nozzle clogging and increase the Ti yield, the effect of Ti addition between melt and refractory will be investigated. In case of Se, thermodynamics {{on the behavior of}} selenium based on dissolution reactions in liquid iron as well as selenium-containing slags will be investigated as well. In chapter II, the thermodynamic role of Ti in steels and the effect of Ca and Ti addition to the molten stainless steel deoxidized with Al on the formation of (Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) spinel inclusions were investigated. High melting point inclusions such as spinel(Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) are known to promote clogging of the SEN nozzle in a continuous caster mold. In particular, Ti alloyed steels can have severe nozzle clogging problems, which are detrimental to slab surface quality. The sequence of Ca and Ti additions after Al deoxidation was also investigated. The inclusion chemistry and morphology according to the order of Ca and Ti are discussed from the standpoint of spinel formation. The thermodynamic interaction parameter of Mg with respect to the Ti alloying element was determined. The element of Ti in steels could contribute to enhancing the spinel formation, because Ti accelerates Mg dissolution from the MgO containing refractory walls or slags due to its high thermodynamic affinity for Mg. Even though Ti induces also Ca dissolution from the CaO containing refractory walls or slags owing to its thermodynamic affinity for Ca, dissolved Ca plays a role in favoring the formation of calcium aluminate inclusions, which are more stable thermodynamically in an Al deoxized steel. The inclusion content of steel samples was analyzed to better understand fundamentals of (Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) spinel inclusion formation. The optimum processing conditions for Ca treatment and Ti addition in austenitic stainless steel melts to achieve the minimized spinel formation and the maximized Ti alloying yield is discussed. In chapter III, the standard free energy change of the dissolution reaction of Se vapor in liquid iron at steelmaking temperatures was determined. The Henrian activity constant of Se in Fe-Se system at 1873 K was also assessed. The self interaction parameter of Se was obtained as - 0. 045 by assuming the regular solution model in Fe-Se system using the values of the Gibbs free energy and the Herian constant. The interaction parameters between Se and second element i such as O, Cr, Ni, Mn, N, Mo, Si, Al, S, Bi and Te were also determined. The solute elements of O, Ni, Cr and Mn significantly increase the selenium solubility in liquid iron. The determined interaction parameters between Se and second elements in liquid iron at 1873 K will be addressed in terms of the economical and feasible ways of Se addition as well as the improvement of machinability owing to MnSe formation during the solidification stage. Using these values of interaction parameters, the further studies employing the refining slags and melt equilibrium reaction system need to be done to address a feasible processing way to produce an environmentally friendly free-cutting steels. However, there has not been much research on these slags system for optimization of the behavior of Se. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the processing methods to increase Se yield in steels enough to complete against the production cost of Pb containing steel grade. In order to increase the Se yield, the slag system of CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -MgO relevant to refining Se-containing steels such as <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> is thermodynamically assessed at 1873 K. The distribution ratio of Se has been determined in slag/melt system. Selenium capacity due to the basicity and oxygen potential was also researched. Besides, the effect of substitution of each slag component on the selenium capacity and the relationship between optical basicity and selenium capacity were researched as well. This thermodynamic assessment can be performed to understand the behavior of Se in slag/metal system and get the data of optimization for these slag systems. In chapter IV, based on the results from chapter II and III, this thesis suggested an application method of the present results to actual refining processes, in order to decrease the deleterious inclusions such as spinel(Al 2 O 3 -xMgO) as well as increase Se contents in steel melt...|$|E

The cutting torch was used for heating on the impingement surface, and it was used for <b>cutting</b> the <b>steel</b> plate samples. LPG at constant flow rate of 0. 14 kg/s was mixed with pure oxygen at varied flow rate corresponding to equivalence ratio, Φ = 0. 78, 0. 93 and 1. 16. The nozzle-to-plate distance was examined at h= 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 mm. Heat transfer rate on the impingement surface was measured using water cooled heat flux sensor. In order to investigate <b>cutting</b> quality, <b>steel</b> plate with 6 mm in thickness was cut by this flame jet with cutting speed at 260 mm/min. The surface roughness, slag quantity and kerf characteristics were considered for cutting quality. The results show that the flame jet for condition of Φ = 0. 78 at h= 4 mm gives the highest heat transfer rate. The flame jet for condition of Φ = 0. 93 at h= 6 mm is optimal for using <b>cutting</b> <b>steel</b> plate in this study...|$|R
