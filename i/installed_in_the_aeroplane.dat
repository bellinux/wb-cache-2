50|$|So {{long as the}} power-to-weight {{ratios of}} {{aircraft}} engines remained low and specific fuel consumption high, the airship had an edge for long-range or -duration operations.

5000|$|Jason Ankeny of AllMusic wrote, [...] "lo-fi yet lush, impenetrable yet wholly accessible, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Over <b>the</b> Sea {{is either}} {{the work of}} a genius or an utter crackpot, with the truth {{probably}} falling somewhere in between." [...] Ankeny also praised Mangum's vocals as [...] "far more emotive" [...] than they were on On Avery Island while noting the vagueness of the album's lyrics, concluding that while [...] "Mangum spins his words with the rapid-fire intensity of a young Dylan, the songs are far too cryptic and abstract to fully sink <b>in</b> — <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Over <b>the</b> Sea is undoubtedly a major statement, but just what it's saying is anyone's guess." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice rated the album a [...] "neither", and while he later wrote that the album [...] "convinced alt diehards that maturity can be just as weird as growing up", he also called it [...] "a funereal jape that gets my goat." ...|$|R
