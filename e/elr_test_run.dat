The GNP optimality {{focuses on the}} large deviation errors of tests, i. e., the convergence rates of the type I and II error probabilities under fixed alternatives. We derive (i) the GNP optimality of the empirical likelihood criterion (ELC) test against all alternatives, and (ii) a necessary and a sufficient condition for the GNP optimality of the empirical likelihood ratio (<b>ELR)</b> <b>test</b> against each alternative...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present and discuss the power of the exact {{likelihood}} ratio homogeneity testing procedure of the number of components k in the exponential mixture. First we present the likelihood ratio <b>test</b> for homogeneity (<b>ELR),</b> the likelihood ratio test for homogeneity against two-component exponential mixture (ELR 2), and finally the likelihood ratio test for homogeneity against three-component exponential mixture (ELR 3). Comparative power study of mentioned homogeneity tests against three-component subpopulation alternative is provided. Therein we concentrate on various setups of the scales and weights, which allow us to make conclusions for generic settings. The natural property is observed, namely increase of the power of exact likelihood ratio ELR, ELR 2 and <b>ELR</b> 3 <b>tests</b> with scale parameters considered in the alternative. We can state that the differences in power of ELR, ELR 2 and <b>ELR</b> 3 <b>tests</b> are small – therefore using of the computationally simpler <b>ELR</b> 2 <b>test</b> is recommended for broad usage rather than computationally more expensive <b>ELR</b> 3 <b>test</b> in the cases when unobserved heterogeneity is modelled. Anyhow caution should be taken before automatic usage of ELR 3 in more informative settings, since the application of automatic methods hoping that the data will enforce its true structure is deceptive. Application of obtained results in reliability, finance or social sciences is straightforward...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss {{homogeneity}} testing of the exponential distribution. We introduce the exact likelihood ratio test of homogeneity in the subpopulation model, ELR, and the exact likelihood ratio test of homogeneity against the two-components subpopulation alternative, ELR 2. The <b>ELR</b> <b>test</b> is asymptotically optimal in the Bahadur sense when the alternative consists of sampling from a fixed number of components. Thus in some setups the ELR is superior to frequently used tests for exponential homogeneity which are based on the EM algorithm. We demonstrate this fact by both theoretical comparisons and simulations...|$|R

Through the analysis of test data, the conclusions are as follows: the trapping performance of 25 PPI foamed ceramics is obviously better than the trapping performance of 10 PPI foamed ceramics; the trapping performance of foamed ceramics will be continually improved {{with the increase of}} the thickness; the increase of the space of the foamed ceramics is conducive to improve the efficiency of soot trapping.

40|$|The {{empirical}} likelihood (EL) {{technique is}} a powerful nonparametric method with wide theoretical and practical applications. In this article, we use the EL methodology {{in order to develop}} simple and efficient goodness-of-fit tests for normality based on the dependence between moments that characterizes normal distributions. The new empirical likelihood ratio (<b>ELR)</b> <b>tests</b> are exact and are shown to be very powerful decision rules based on small to moderate sample sizes. Asymptotic results related to the Type I error rates of the proposed tests are presented. We present a broad Monte Carlo comparison between different tests for normality, confirming the preference of the proposed method from a power perspective. A real data example is provided...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by drying 38 -mm thick beech timber, namely one control <b>test</b> <b>run</b> under usual, conventional drying schedule and four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> dried under the same schedule but with oscillations of equilibrium moisture content. During oscillation drying, temperature curve was identical with the temperature curve in the control <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> and the values of equilibrium moisture content oscillated according to previously set amplitudes and frequencies. Oscillation amplitudes were ± 10 % {{in the first two}} <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and ± 20 % in the second two <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> compared to the value anticipated in the schedule. Duration of each oscillation was 3 h in the first and third <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and 6 h in the second and fourth <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Special addition to the manufacturer’s software was developed for the realization of these oscillations. When comparing the results, drying time (for the same intervals of initial and final timber moisture content), energy consumption and drying quality were taken into consideration. Drying quality was determined {{at the end of each}} <b>test</b> <b>run</b> (both before and after conditioning), and based on the value of final timber moisture content, distribution of moisture content across thickness and gap size. Drying time was shorter in all four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillations, and energy consumption was lower than in the conventional <b>test</b> <b>run.</b> Slightly shorter drying period was recorded in <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillation frequency of 3 hours compared to the <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with 6 hour oscillations. Final timber moisture content was almost even in all <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Profiles of moisture content across timber thickness were also similar in the <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest difference between core and surface at the end of drying was achieved in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations. Before conditioning, average gap value of over 2 mm was recorded in all <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest average value was recorded in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations...|$|R
