(Proteaceae), it superseded the {{arrangement of}} George Bentham, which had stood for over a hundred years. It was overturned in 1996 by Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges, but restored by George in 1999. A recent publication by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele suggests that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>soon</b> be overturned again.|$|E

A more private liaison is treated in Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida's Messalina in the Arms of the Gladiator (1886). This takes place in an interior, with the empress reclining bare breasted against the knees of a naked gladiator.|$|E

"The {{enemies of}} the French language, of French civilization in Canada, are not the Boches {{on the shores of}} the Spree; but the English-Canadian anglicizers, the Orange intriguers, or Irish priests.

2500|$|Transhumanists {{and other}} {{supporters}} of human genetic engineering do not dismiss practical concerns out of hand, insofar {{as there is}} a high degree of uncertainty about the timelines and likely outcomes of genetic modification experiments in humans. However, bioethicist James Hughes suggests that one possible ethical route to the genetic manipulation of humans at early developmental stages is the building of computer models of the human genome, the proteins it specifies and the tissue engineering he argues that it also codes for. With the exponential progress in bioinformatics, Hughes believes that a virtual model of genetic expression in the human body will not be far behind and that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>soon</b> be possible to accelerate approval of genetic modifications by simulating their effects on virtual humans. Public health professor Gregory Stock points to artificial chromosomes as an alleged safer alternative to existing genetic engineering techniques.|$|E

In August 2016, Stone had cryptically tweeted [...] "Trust me, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>soon</b> [...] the Podesta's time in the barrel" [...] shortly after claiming to have been in contact with Wikileaks and before Wikileaks' release of the Podesta emails. Stone has denied having any advance knowledge of the Podesta e-mail hack or any connection to Russian intelligence, stating that his earlier tweet was actually referring to reports of the Podesta Group's own ties to Russia.|$|E

2500|$|According to scholar Leland S. Person, Poe {{is using}} the story as a {{critique}} of male military identity, which he knew well from his own military career and his studies at the United States Military Academy at West Point. It is a literal deconstruction of {{the identity of a}} military model of manhood that was given status after Indian removal campaigns of the 1830s. The story seems to suggest that the war hero has nothing left but the injuries he has received in battle to make up his identity. According to Shawn James Rosenheim, Poe also is questioning technology, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>soon</b> be difficult to distinguish man from machine. The story also has minor critiques of racism; the war hero was taken apart by Indians but is put together by his [...] "old negro valet" [...] named Pompey (a name Poe also uses in [...] "A Predicament"), arguably undermining the power of white male dominance. Poe may also have been reacting to the popular [...] "subversive" [...] humor of the day, exaggerating the technique {{to the point of being}} inane.|$|E
