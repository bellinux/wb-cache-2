5|$|Charles Brooke {{encouraged}} the immigration of the Chinese coolies, {{beginning in the}} 1860s, to expand the state's <b>gambier</b> and pepper industry. Chinese settlers in neighbouring Sabah and Pontianak also established <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations, although they existed as independent fiefdoms. These plantations rose {{to become one of}} the state's major industries as worldwide prices for <b>gambier</b> went up during the 1880s and 1890s. In the 20th century, as worldwide <b>gambier</b> prices took a dive, the Kangchu channelled their efforts into pepper and opium cultivation in the state. Sarawak's Kangchu system fell into obscurity in the 1920s, as the opium trade with Hong Kong steadily declined during the course of the decade.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s and 1860s, many Kangchu {{abandoned}} their plantations in Singapore as <b>gambier</b> produce declined due to over farming of the soil, {{and began to}} establish new <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations in neighbouring Johor. Nevertheless, many of these Kangchu settled down as merchants in Singapore and managed the <b>gambier</b> and pepper farms by proxy, mainly through the liaison body of the Ngee Heng Kongsi which had members in Singapore and Johor. Some of these merchants purchased the property rights of <b>gambier</b> and pepper farms from the Kangchu in Johor, who would then assume managerial tasks to ensure the smooth operation of the plantation and the settlement.|$|E
5|$|Variants of the Kangchu {{system also}} thrived {{in other parts}} of Maritime Southeast Asia, where <b>gambier</b> and pepper were {{cultivated}} and where there were significant Chinese populations. The Kangchu and coolies who worked in the <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations were mainly of Teochew origin, and were generally first- or second-generation Chinese immigrants. In 1917, the British colonial government in Johor implemented an act which abolished the Kangchu system in the state, and the value for <b>gambier</b> declined during the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gambier</b> {{and pepper}} farming were mainly {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct {{the operations of the}} plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese settlers and merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the <b>gambier</b> and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for <b>gambier</b> experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, WIN {{purchased}} two stations in South Australia, SES8 in Mount <b>Gambier</b> and RTS-5a in the Riverland region. They {{became known as}} WIN SA and until recently featured news bulletins presented from studios at both stations (bulletins are now presented from the set of studios in Mount <b>Gambier).</b> In 2002 supplementary licences were granted under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act, allowing the network to launch additional channels, using the callsigns MGS in Mount <b>Gambier</b> and LRS in the Riverland, and known as WIN Ten, thus converting SES/RTS into the sole Nine affiliate for regional viewers in SA. This was the case until the affiliation moved to the Seven Network due to advertising problems with Nine's then owners in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Returning to naval service {{some months}} after the action, Harvey was given the 80-gun HMS Tonnant as his first flagship, in which he {{remained}} until 1809. Serving under Lord <b>Gambier</b> in the Channel Fleet, Harvey was outraged not to be given command of the British ships in action at the Battle of Basque Roads. Harvey expressed his disgust that command {{had been given to}} the more junior Lord Cochrane in no uncertain terms to <b>Gambier,</b> and was dismissed from the admiral's council as a result. When the operation was initially successful, <b>Gambier</b> refused to support Cochrane and as a result an opportunity to annihilate the French Atlantic Fleet was lost. The ensuing dispute lasted years and involved a court martial that eventually acquitted <b>Gambier,</b> and only ended with Cochrane's dismissal from the service five years later.|$|E

5|$|The attack caused little direct damage, but in {{the narrow}} waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the French fleet and most of their ships {{grounded}} and were left immobile. Cochrane expected <b>Gambier</b> to follow his attack with the main fleet, which could then destroy the vulnerable French force, but <b>Gambier</b> refused. Cochrane continued {{the battle over the}} next several days, successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from <b>Gambier.</b> This allowed most of the French fleet to refloat and retreat up the Charente to safety. <b>Gambier</b> recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered fighting continued until 25 April. The increasingly marginalised French fleet was badly damaged and trapped in its home ports; several captains were court-martialed for cowardice and one was shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Kangchu system {{dates back to the}} mid-18th century, when early Chinese {{settlers}} in Penang experimented in cash crop plantations with various types of crops, including pepper, <b>gambier,</b> betelnut and clove. The plantations were abandoned by the late 18th-century, as Penang experienced wars from Buginese seafarers that resulted in many <b>gambier</b> plantations being destroyed; contributing to the decline in plantations was the growing popularity of the spice trade that reaped much greater profits. At the beginning of the 19th century, these Chinese settlers began to look south to Malacca and Singapore, where <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations had also been established.|$|E

50|$|Vice Principals {{focuses on}} ill-tempered, dogmatic, and disliked vice {{principal}} of North Jackson High School Neil <b>Gamby</b> (Danny McBride), and his ambitions of being {{promoted to the}} principal's chair when the principal is due to step down. However, when the current principal (Bill Murray) retires, he reveals that he trusts neither <b>Gamby</b> nor his scheming and seemingly sociopathic co-vice principal Lee Russell (Walton Goggins), and so has recommended neither of them as his successor; instead, outsider Dr. Belinda Brown (Kimberly Herbert Gregory) is hired. When <b>Gamby's</b> attempt to get the school faculty to veto the appointment backfires (as Brown quickly makes a positive impression on the staff with her goal-oriented agenda and amicability with students), he conspires with Russell {{to find some way}} of ruining Brown's reputation and installing himself as principal. The show chronicles the schemers' gradual self-destruction as their own biases and unlikable personalities increasingly alienate Brown and the rest of their co-workers.|$|R
5|$|The Kangchu system {{facilitated}} {{the growth of}} the <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations and developed Johor's and Singapore's economies in the 19th century. The development of Johor's inland towns were attributed to the efforts by the various Kangchu, who were responsible for drawing the settlement plan for the coolies living within the plantation they were working on, from which new towns were formed. The Chinese immigrant population in Johor and Singapore grew in size during this period; Riau also experienced a similar growth during the 18th century. As a result of mass immigration by the Chinese into Johor, the Chinese quickly outnumbered the Malays in the state, although many Chinese coolies relocated to Singapore or other parts of Malaya as the <b>gambier</b> and pepper industry declined in the 20th century. Several towns and other places in Johor and Singapore, built upon sites of former <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations, are named after former features of the Kangchu system, and are largely populated by ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>gambier</b> {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} appeared in Southern Johor, notably Skudai. Lau Lib Keng, a Chinese settler based in Skudai, {{was the first}} person to receive a Surat Sungai, whereby the river banks of Skudai were leased to Lau for the cultivation of <b>gambier</b> and pepper. More Chinese settlers came to Johor from the 1850s onwards, and forested areas in Southern Johor such as Tebrau, Plentong and Stulang were cleared for the cultivation of <b>gambier</b> and pepper. By the time Temenggong Ibrahim's son, Abu Bakar took office from his father in 1862, at least 37 Surat Sungai have been issued to various Kangchu, all of whom were collectively responsible for the operations of the 1,200 <b>gambier</b> and pepper farms in the state. Most of these Chinese leaders were also members of secret societies, and communal warfare often broke out in Singapore between different dialect groups as a result of conflicting economic interests. From the late 1850s onwards, the Kangchu began to exert political influence in the state affairs by establishing close ties with Temenggong Abu Bakar. In 1865, Abu Bakar granted official recognition to the Teochew-dominated Johor branch of the Ngee Heng Kongsi after a Kangchu, Tan Kee Soon, raised a small army to subdue Sultan Ali's forces, from whom Abu Bakar was facing considerable dissent but was unable to raise an organised army. Abu Bakar nevertheless called for the Ngee Heng Kongsi to accept Chinese settlers of other dialect groups to prevent possible communal warfare as a result of conflicting economic interests.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>gambier</b> {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} {{appeared in the}} Riau Islands in the 1730s, after the Buginese warrior and second Yamtuan Muda of Riau, Daing Chelak, brought Chinese coolies from Malaya to Riau {{for the purpose of}} <b>gambier</b> cultivation, which was then widely used for medication among the locals. Another exodus of Chinese migrated to Riau in 1740 following unrest which erupted in Batavia, during which many Chinese were massacred. Chinese settlement in Riau continued into the 18th century, the majority of them coming from the Chaoshan area in Guangdong province, along with a sizeable minority from the southern parts of Fujian province.|$|E

40|$|The {{collection}} primarily {{focuses on}} the immigration of Werner and Vera <b>Gamby</b> from Hamburg to New York. In addition, it documents the immigration of Vera <b>Gamby's</b> parents and the attempted immigration and later deportation of Werner's mother, aunt, and other family members. The collection also contains documentation and research on family genealogy and photographs of family members. The collection includes correspondence, photographs and photo albums, official documents, family trees, and unpublished manuscripts by family members. Werner Max Gembicki was born on November 15, 1915, the son of Ludwig and Camilla (née Kemlinski) Gembicki. He had two older siblings, a sister, Lizzie and a brother, Siegfried. Werner attended the private Bertram School in Hamburg and acquired his Abitur in 1935 at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. Although he had wished to study law and become a diplomat, that path was impossible for him once Jews were forbidden to attend university. He then found a position working for a Jewish import firm for leather and fur. During the 1930 s he also met a young woman, Vera Cohn, while playing tennis. Vera Cohn was born on June 15, 1915 in Frankfurt am Main. She {{was the daughter of}} Raphael and Erna Cohn and had an identical twin sister, Ilse. Raphael Cohn had served in World War I and in 1934 received the Ehrenkreuz für Frontkämpfer. After the years of inflation the Cohns moved to Hamburg. Vera Cohn had wanted to study architecture, but after the ban on attending university she attended a secretarial school instead. On April 9, 1937 she and Werner married. On August 8, 1937 their son Peter was born. On Kristallnacht Werner was arrested while at work and spent the next six weeks in the concentration camp Sachsenhausen. After his realeas the Hamburg Jewish Community helped him to enter the Kitchener Camp for refugees in Kent, England, where he stayed from February 1939 through April 1940. On November 22, 1939 Vera <b>Gamby</b> and her son Peter along with her parents sailed from Amsterdam to join her sister and brother-in-law in New Rochelle, New York. Vera <b>Gamby</b> found a position in domestic work in a private household. In May 1940 Werner arrived in New York as well. In his first years in the United States Werner held various jobs, iuntil he eventually found a position in an import firm as a clerk in the marketing department. Camilla Gembicki and her sister Toni Kemlinski still remained in Hamburg. Werner's sister Lizzie had died in 1937, and his niece and nephew Herma and Gerd Schwab were also still in Hamburg. In 1941, Camilla, Toni, and the children were deported to Riga, Latvia, where they perished. In 1945 Werner and Vera received American citizenship and changed their surname to <b>Gamby.</b> During the 1940 s they had two more children, Dorothy Lizzie and Monica Camilla. In 1968 the <b>Gamby</b> family moved to Mamaroneck, New York. Werner worked for decades in the textile import industry. He established his own firm, W. <b>Gamby</b> & Co. He died in 2014; Vera <b>Gamby</b> died in 2011. Finding aid available onlineProcesseddigitizedDigital Imag...|$|R

5|$|As the <b>gambier</b> {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} expanded in the 1870s, the more established Kangchu were entrusted with larger blocks of farms and made contracts with Chinese merchants from Singapore. The profits generated from harvests of these plantations formed {{the bulk of}} Johor's economy, and financed the development of Johor's infrastructure. Abu Bakar's relationship with the Chinese leaders was excellent, and he appointed many of them to political positions in the state. Of particular note, Abu Bakar appointed two Chinese leaders to the Johor State Council: a Kangchu from Chaozhou, Tan Hiok Nee, and a contractor from Taishan, Wong Ah Fook, who also owned <b>gambier</b> and pepper farms in Mersing in the 1880s. As the land along the river banks in Southern Johor was already taken by the earlier waves of Chinese settlers, newer Chinese settlers began migrating northwards in the 1870s and established new <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations further north; new plantations were established in Yong Peng, Batu Pahat, Benut, Endau and Kota Tinggi. In particular, Abu Bakar actively encouraged Chinese settlers to establish plantations in Muar, shortly after the British Colonial Government ruled in favour of Abu Bakar over Tengku Alam Shah (Sultan Ali's eldest son) and his family, and granted Abu Bakar control of Muar.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Channel in April 1807, Gibraltar {{joined the}} fleet under Admiral James <b>Gambier,</b> which fought the Battle of the Basque Roads in 1809. This was her last major action; {{the ship was}} taken out of service in 1813 and {{converted}} to a powder hulk.

5|$|Stopford {{had hoped}} that his attack on Jurien's {{squadron}} might draw Willaumez's fleet out of the anchorage in support, where they might be surprised and defeated by the British fleet. Willaumez however made no movement to prevent {{the destruction of the}} frigate squadron. Stopford returned to watch the French fleet from the anchorage at Basque Roads, where he was shortly after joined by the British fleet under Admiral Lord <b>Gambier,</b> and was present although not directly engaged in the Battle of Basque Roads in April at which the French fleet was defeated, losing five ships. Willaumez had been replaced in March by Zacharie Allemand, whose defensive positions were unable to prevent a major attack by fireships on 11 April followed by a bombardment by conventional warships. In the aftermath of the battle <b>Gambier</b> was accused of failing to effectively support the attack and faced a court-martial in July, although he was acquitted and returned to command.|$|E

5|$|The Teochew dialect {{became the}} lingua franca among the Chinese {{in many parts}} of Johor and Riau, as the {{majority}} of the Chinese from these areas were of Teochew origin, many of whom were descended from the Chinese coolies who had worked in the <b>gambier</b> and pepper plantations. The Teochews form the second-largest dialect group among Chinese Singaporeans, and many families can trace their family ancestry to immigrants who were Kangchu or coolies in these plantations.|$|E
5000|$|Three main factors {{explain the}} {{toponymy}} of the commune: the relief between the Albion plateau and the Lure mountain, its {{location in the}} Occitan linguistic area, {{and the people of}} the area. The terrain is very present: the Pié d'Enroux is formed from a local evolution of the Latin podium meaning [...] "height". The pey in Peymian has the same origin, the name of this hill meaning [...] "the mountain of the middle". The name of the Puy de Salve is formed from the most current evolution in France of podium and there is also the Crête de <b>Gamby</b> (<b>Gamby</b> Ridge). The Coueste Chaude (to the west of the village) is on the slope of a mountain, Occitan derived from the French côte. Other names are formed from the words adret (sunny side of a mountain) and ubac (shady side): thus there are the Adret and the Ubac of Grou de Ban, the hamlet of Adrech {{at the foot of the}} Grou, and the Ubac farm at the foot of the Pié d'Enroux. The Combe de Vaux is a pleonastic doublet to designate a valley.|$|R
50|$|The Fixations were a mod revival {{band from}} North London that formed in 1978. An early {{incarnation}} of the band, including Ken <b>Gamby</b> (drums), Paul Cathcart (vocals, lead guitar), Paul Cattini (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Noel Hughes (bass) started in summer 1976. The line-up changed in 1978 with Richard Sharp joining the band on rhythm guitar. Later Cathcart switched to lead guitar and taught Richard bass guitar, and gigs were lined up by November 1978, making them {{one of the first}} bands in the mod revival scene, and gaining a very early mention in Sounds.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{the local}} {{historian}} Fraser Mooney Jr. of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia published a book, Jerome: Solving the Mystery of Nova Scotia's Silent Castaway {{in which he}} offers {{a solution to the}} man's mysterious origins. He reports that across the bay from Nova Scotia in Chipman, New Brunswick in 1859 (a few years before Jerome's appearance) a young foreigner was reported as having fallen through river ice. He suffered gangrene in both legs due to the accident and they had to be amputated by a local doctor. Here he became known as “Gamby”, probably because on wakening he kept calling for “gamba”, Italian for “legs”. <b>Gamby</b> proved to be a burden for the people of Chipman, and it was rumoured that a passing schooner captain was paid to transport him away. The captain could possibly have just sailed to {{the opposite side of the}} bay to Nova Scotia, where he became Sandy Cove's problem. Mooney's account has been controversial. Notably, the writer Noah Richler has called the book speculative and a fiction.|$|R
