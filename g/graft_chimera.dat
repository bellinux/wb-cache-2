5000|$|Occasionally, a {{so-called}} [...] "graft hybrid" [...] or more accurately <b>graft</b> <b>chimera</b> can occur where the tissues {{of the stock}} continue to grow within the scion. Such a plant can produce flowers and foliage typical of both plants as well as shoots intermediate between the two. The best-known example this is probably +Laburnocytisus 'Adamii', a graft hybrid between laburnum and broom, which originated in a nursery near Paris, France in 1825. This small tree bears yellow flowers typical of Laburnum anagyroides, purple flowers typical of Chamaecytisus purpureus and curious coppery-pink flowers that show characteristics of both [...] "parents". Many species of cactus can also produce graft chimeras under the right conditions although they are often created unintentionally and such results are often hard to replicate.|$|E
40|$|<b>Graft</b> <b>chimeras</b> were {{generated}} using Lycopersicon pennellii and L. esculentum {{to determine the}} contribution of the three meristem layers (L 1, L 2, and L 3) to trichome density, sugar ester production, and aphid resistance. Sugar esters, in the form of triacylglucoses, have been implicated in the aphid resistance of pennellii. One chimera possessed the epidermal layer (L 1) of pennellii and the internal tissues (L 2 and L 3) of the aphid-susceptible esculentum. The second chimera had both the L 1 and L 2 of pennellii and the L 3 of esculentum. Type IV trichome densities did not differ significantly among the chimeras and pennellii. Both chimeras accumulated sugar esters with similar sugar and fatty acid composition as pennellii. The concentration of epicuticular sugar ester on the chimeras was also comparable with that of pennellii. Leaf cage and feeding studies demonstrated that both chimeras are as resistant to aphids as is pennellii. The resistance could be reduced similarly on all three types of plants by removal of the type IV trichome exudate. These results indicate that the presence and density of the type IV trichomes and the amount and type of sugar esters produced are features determined by the genotype of the epidermis. These epidermal features are sufficient to account for the aphid resistance observed in pennellii...|$|R
40|$|Homozygosity {{for either}} the lpr (lymphoproliferation) or the gld (generalized {{lymphoproliferative}} disease) mutation in mice causes the development of strikingly similar hyperglobulinemia and lymphoproliferative syndromes. Nevertheless, previous studies of various C 57 BL/ 6 chimeras obtained by reconstitution of irradiated recipients with hematopoietic cells (HC), differing at the bg, gld, lpr, and/or nu loci, showed that the lpr and gld syndromes had distinct etiologies. The [lpr [...] >lpr], [gld [...] >gld], and [gld [...] >wild] chimeras developed lymphoid hyperplasia, while the [lpr [...] >wild, bg, or gld] and [nulpr [...] >wild or bg] chimeras developed a severe persistent lymphoid aplasia. We now show that the serological status (immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and Ig isotype distribution) of the [lpr [...] >lpr], [gld [...] >gld], and [gld [...] >wild] chimeras were roughly equivalent to those of genetic lpr and gld mice. Despite their lymphoid aplasia, all the [lpr [...] >non-lpr] chimeras displayed surprisingly normal serum Ig levels, similar to [wild [...] >wild] control chimeras, although always with some abnormal isotype profile. In fact, an early but transient increase of serum IgG 1 levels was found in all [lpr [...] >wild, bg, or gld], [lpr [...] >lpr], [nulpr [...] >wild or bg], [wild [...] >lpr], and [gld [...] >wild or gld] types of chimeras. Despite a common early behavior, the host type and/or the gld or lpr HC origin may cause later divergences of the gld or lpr HC <b>grafted</b> <b>chimeras...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{have created}} several {{transgenic}} mouse strains that bear the human lambda light chain gene driven {{by its own}} promoter and a mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer. The transgene is expressed in many tissues, with particularly high levels of expression in the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes. One of these transgenic lines, B-less, displays a dramatic phenotype characterized by an acute susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections. Analysis of this strain shows it to be profoundly deficient in both immature (pre-B) and mature B cells, {{as well as in}} circulating immunoglobulin. The pre-B and B cell defects are cell autonomous, as judged by cell culture and bone marrow <b>graft</b> <b>chimeras.</b> Despite this B cell deficiency, the T cell lineage appears grossly normal as assessed by flow cytometric analysis and by its response to mitogen stimulation. Since an independently derived transgenic strain bearing the same human lambda construct displays a partial B-less phenotype, {{it is likely that the}} B lineage deficiency is due to a dominant effect of transgene expression rather than to the insertional perturbation of an endogenous mouse gene. It is interesting that the deficiency phenotype is fully expressed in the FVB/N genetic background, but is suppressed in F 1 hybrids formed between the FVB/N and C 57 BL/ 6 inbred strains. Evidently, there are one or more dominant genetic suppressors of B-less in the C 57 BL/ 6 genome...|$|R
40|$|Rejection of murine skin <b>grafts</b> by hematopoietic <b>chimeras</b> {{that are}} fully {{compatible}} genetically with the skin-graft donor has {{been attributed to}} a disparity in skin-selective alloantigens between the irradiated host and the skin graft donor, Monoclonal antibodies recognizing Skna alloantigen were produced and used in indirect immunofluorescent and immunoperoxidase tests with sections of skin to demonstrate and confirm the expression of Skna alloantigen on epidermal cells of Skna genotype and absence of Skna alloantigen from epidermal cells of non-Skna genotype...|$|R
40|$|Establishment {{of mixed}} chimerism through {{transplantation}} of allogeneic donor bone marrow (BM) into sufficiently conditioned recipients {{is an effective}} experimental approach for the induction of transplantation tolerance. Clinical translation, however, is impeded {{by the lack of}} feasible protocols devoid of cytoreductive conditioning (i. e. irradiation and cytotoxic drugs/mAbs). The therapeutic application of regulatory T cells (Tregs) prolongs allograft survival in experimental models, but appears insufficient to induce robust tolerance on its own. We thus investigated whether mixed chimerism and tolerance could be realized without the need for cytoreductive treatment by combining Treg therapy with BM transplantation (BMT). Polyclonal recipient Tregs were cotransplanted with a moderate dose of fully mismatched allogeneic donor BM into recipients conditioned solely with short-course costimulation blockade and rapamycin. This combination treatment led to long-term multilineage chimerism and donor-specific skin <b>graft</b> tolerance. <b>Chimeras</b> also developed humoral and in vitro tolerance. Both deletional and nondeletional mechanisms contributed to maintenance of tolerance. All tested populations of polyclonal Tregs (FoxP 3 -transduced Tregs, natural Tregs and TGF-beta induced Tregs) were effective in this setting. Thus, Treg therapy achieves mixed chimerism and tolerance without cytoreductive recipient treatment, thereby eliminating a major toxic element impeding clinical translation of this approach...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNormal {{patterning}} of {{the developing}} limb requires a tight restriction of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) mRNA to the posterior margin of the limb bud. While several positive and negative regulatory factors have been identified which serve to position the Shh expression domain in the distal posterior limb, these factors cannot in themselves explain the tight restriction of Shh to the posterior margin, nor can they explain the similarly tight restriction of Shh to the anterior margin when the regulatory factors are disrupted or misexpressed. We suggest that the transcription factors Tbx 2 and Tbx 3 are excellent candidates for positively-acting factors responsible for limiting Shh expression to {{the margins of the}} limb bud. These closely related factors are indeed expressed at the anterior and posterior limb margins over a wide range of limb bud stages. Moreover, previous reports indicate that in addition, misexpression of Tbx 2 beyond the limb margin is sufficient to anteriorly expand Shh, and conversely, antagonizing Tbx 2 function leads to loss of Shh. In contrast to this idea, previous models have placed Tbx 2 expression downstream of Shh and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling. We find, however, that Tbx 2 expression is neither affected by blocking Shh signaling with cyclopamine nor by genetic removal of several BMP activities in the limb bud. To understand the true source of the positional information responsible for limiting Tbx 2, Tbx 3 and Shh expression to the marginal mesenchyme of the limb bud, we undertook a series of grafting and extirpation experiments, which led to the identification of the dorsal–ventral (DV) border ectoderm exclusive of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) as a new signaling center in the limb bud. We find that maintenance of Tbx 2 expression in the limb mesoderm requires proximity to the non-AER D–V border. Using chick-quail <b>graft</b> <b>chimeras,</b> we find that a graft of the non-AER D–V border ectoderm to a location {{on the surface of the}} middle of the limb bud is sufficient to induce ectopic expression of Tbx 2 in underlying mesoderm. These data demonstrate that the non-AER D–V border ectoderm is necessary and sufficient for Tbx 2 expression at the anterior and posterior limb margins. Similarly, we find that a graft of the non-AER D–V border can expand the domain of Shh anteriorly when grafted just anterior to the ZPA. It is notable that Tbx 2 expression does not extend distally to the mesoderm underlying the AER. Moreover, we find that grafts of the AER to more proximal locations result in downregulation of Tbx 2 expression, suggesting that the AER produces a negatively-acting signal opposing the activity of the non-AER DV border ectoderm. Indeed, implantation of beads soaked in fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf 8), expressed in the AER, downregulates Tbx 2 expression. The data presented here identify the non-AER border of dorsal–ventral ectoderm as a new signaling center in limb development that localizes the ZPA to the limb margin. This finding explains the tight restriction of Shh expression to the posterior margin throughout limb outgrowth as well as the tight restriction of Shh expression to the anterior margin in many mutants exhibiting preaxial polydactyly...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of mice with {{a single}} donor-specific {{transfusion}} plus a brief course of anti-CD 154 mAb uniformly induces donor-specific transplantation tolerance characterized by the deletion of alloreactive CD 8 + T cells. Survival of islet allografts in treated mice is permanent, but skin grafts eventually fail unless recipients are thymectomized. To analyze the mechanisms underlying tolerance induction, maintenance, and failure in euthymic mice we created a new analytical system based on allo-TCR-transgenic hemopoietic chimeric <b>graft</b> recipients. <b>Chimeras</b> were CBA (H- 2 (k)) mice engrafted with small numbers of syngeneic TCR-transgenic KB 5 bone marrow cells. These mice subsequently circulated a self-renewing trace population of anti-H- 2 (b) -alloreactive CD 8 + T cells maturing in a normal microenvironment. With this system, we studied the maintenance of H- 2 (b) allografts in tolerized mice. We documented that alloreactive CD 8 + T cells deleted during tolerance induction slowly returned toward pretreatment levels. Skin allograft rejection in this system occurred {{in the context of}} 1) increasing numbers of alloreactive CD 8 + cells; 2) a decline in anti-CD 154 mAb concentration to levels too low to inhibit costimulatory functions; and 3) activation of the alloreactive CD 8 + T cells during graft rejection following deliberate depletion of regulatory CD 4 + T cells. Rejection of healed-in allografts in tolerized mice appears to be a dynamic process dependent on the level of residual costimulation blockade, CD 4 + regulatory cells, and activated alloreactive CD 8 + thymic emigrants that have repopulated the periphery after tolerization...|$|R
40|$|The {{anomalous}} {{survival of}} neonatal C 3 H skin grafts on CBA mice is {{correlated with the}} emigration of passenger leukocytes from the graft vasculature. Thus, newborn homografts whose leukocyte populations are eliminated by X-irradiation or by transient sojourn on an intermediate adult C 3 H host, do not display prolonged survival. Moreover, the continued presence of the newborn grafts is not requisite {{to the maintenance of}} the unresponsive state, an observation consonant with the demonstration that CBA mice bearing long-term neonatal C 3 H skin <b>grafts</b> are leukocyte <b>chimeras.</b> In contrast, neonatal male C 57 skin grafts may persist on C 57 females after heavy irradiation of the donor, or after passage on an intermediate adult male host. In addition, tolerance is broken by removal of long-persistant newborn grafts from hitherto unresponsive females, and chimerism is not detectable in female C 57 mice tolerant of infant male isografts. Finally, leukocytes of neonatal C 3 H origin, inoculated subcutaneously into CBA males, may occasionally render these animals unresponsive to subsequent adult C 3 H skin homografts, whereas those taken from infant C 57 males usually sensitize their adult female hosts. Thus, passenger leukocytes are implicated in the extended survival of C 3 H neonatal homografts on CBA recipients, but not in the persistence of H-Y-incompatible neonatal skin isografts on C 57 females...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe ontogenic {{source of}} {{definitive}} hematopoietic {{system has been}} identified in non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds and amphibians by orthotopic embryo grafting, but remains unclear for mammals because of technical difficulties. Here, we successfully generated mouse <b>chimeras</b> by <b>grafting</b> yolk sac (YS) on YS of the host embryos before establishing circulation between YS and embryo proper and cultured the whole embryo for 66  h. Donor YS were isolated from C 57 BL/ 6 Ly- 5. 1 and EGFP-transgenic mouse embryos, and recipient embryos from C 57 BL/ 6 Ly- 5. 2 mouse. Almost one-half of the <b>grafts</b> in YS–YS <b>chimeras</b> survived and had obvious blood flow; graft-derived cells comprised 12. 7 ± 0. 9 % of the blood cells in the circulation. These graft-derived blood cells consisted mainly of erythroid cells, some myeloid cells and a few blastic cells. In addition, CD 19 + B cells were generated from the graft-derived cells isolated from aorta–gonad–mesonephros (AGM) regions of the YS–YS chimeras; however, {{the frequency of the}} YS-derived B cell was low (1. 0 ± 0. 6 %) when co-cultured with OP 9 stromal cells. These results demonstrate that B cell potential exists in YS before the circulation. Although the major source for B cell is intra-embryonic AGM region, YS may contribute to definitive lymphopoiesis in vivo in mice...|$|R
