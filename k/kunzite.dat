2500|$|Pink beryl of fine {{color and}} good sizes was first {{discovered}} {{on an island}} {{on the coast of}} Madagascar in 1910. It was also known, with other gemstone minerals, such as tourmaline and <b>kunzite,</b> at Pala, California. In December 1910, the New York Academy of Sciences named the pink variety of beryl [...] "morganite" [...] after financier J. P. Morgan.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} anime adaptation, <b>Kunzite</b> and Zoisite are lovers {{as well as}} allies. After Queen Metaria's reawakening, <b>Kunzite</b> assists Zoisite in obtaining the Rainbow Crystals. After losing the Rainbow Crystals, <b>Kunzite</b> is spared when Zoisite is killed {{at the hands of}} Beryl. She forewarns <b>Kunzite</b> that if he harms Prince Endymion, she will kill him. He resents being forced to work with the brainwashed Prince Endymion, feeling {{responsible}} for Zoisite's death, and Beryl favoring him. Following Zoisite's death, <b>Kunzite</b> plans to exact revenge on the Sailor Soldiers, and turns humans into a Monster to help him. Eventually, he captures all of the Sailor Soldiers except for Sailor Moon. <b>Kunzite</b> is killed when Usagi reflects his own energy blade back at him.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} anime adaptation, Zoisite is <b>Kunzite's</b> lover. He is {{introduced}} along with Nephrite, mocking him in each episode. Later, he orders the Plant Sisters to kidnap Naru and kill Nephrite. After Queen Metaria's awakening, Beryl appoints Zoisite {{to find the}} Rainbow Crystals. He is more successful than either of his predecessors, obtaining the seven fragments of the Silver Crystal. Mamoru saves Usagi from certain death by intercepting Zoisite's attack. The two are then revealed to be Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion. Infuratied that Zoisite has injured Prince Endymion, Beryl fatally wounds Zoisite, who dies in <b>Kunzite's</b> arms. In some English adaptations of the anime, Zoisite's gender was changed from male to female {{in order to make}} their relationship more socially acceptable for the 1990s, when very few homosexual couples were portrayed in the media. This censorship has led to a great amount of criticism since then, with some pointing out that the changes were made to force the series into a heteronormative perspective.|$|R
5000|$|The Monsters (Yōma) are the Dark Kingdom's army of monsters {{in every}} {{version of the}} series, serving as the monster of the week in every adaptation. In the first anime adaptation, Jadeite's and Nephrite's monsters are conjured {{from out of the}} ground, with some of them taking the form of humans (such as Morga impersonating Naru Osaka's mother). These monsters are killed either by Sailor Moon using [...] "Moon Tiara Action" [...] or by other Sailor Soldiers' attacks {{at the end of each}} episode. Monsters such as <b>Kunzite's</b> minions and the Seven Great Monsters are human {{characters}} transformed by a King of Heaven using the Dark Crystal. Monsters created from humans are returned to their human form by Sailor Moon using [...] "Moon Healing Escalation", which restores the human while destroying the monster. In the DIC English adaptation, the Negaverse refers to the monsters as their [...] "servants", while the Sailor Soldiers and Tuxedo Mask call them [...] "monsters" [...] or sometimes [...] "Negamonsters".|$|R
50|$|Takeuchi once {{drew her}} {{in the arms of}} <b>Kunzite,</b> leader of the Four Kings of Heaven. In the Original Picture Collection Vol. I, Takeuchi expresses a desire to explore the {{possibility}} of such relationships; unlike the other characters, with Venus and <b>Kunzite</b> this is explored within the series. In one flashback, Minako blushes and seems flustered around <b>Kunzite</b> after a conversation about love, and in the last chapter of Codename: Sailor V, Princess Venus is shown as having had an infatuation with <b>Kunzite.</b> In Sailor Moon Crystal it is established that Sailor Venus and <b>Kunzite</b> were in love {{at the time of the}} Moon Kingdom. This is also stated in the stage musicals, as well as in the Another Story video game.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kunzite</b> is a pink to lilac colored gemstone, {{a variety}} of {{spodumene}} with the color coming from minor to trace amounts of manganese. Some (but not all) <b>kunzite</b> used for gemstones has been heated to enhance its color. It is also frequently irradiated to enhance the color.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the series, <b>Kunzite</b> is a military officer of Prince Endymion before being turned into the stone from which his name was derived. He is then revived by Queen Beryl. Introduced as Zoisite's advisor, <b>Kunzite</b> becomes Queen Beryl's henchman after the death of the other Kings of Heaven. He defeats the Sailor Soldiers at Tokyo Tower and nearly kills Usagi, but Mamoru takes the injury for her, and they are revealed to be Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion. Remembering that Endymion is his former master, <b>Kunzite</b> becomes uncertain about his loyalties causing Queen Beryl to plant a crystal in his forehead that reduces him to little more than a mindless slave. It takes the combined strength of all the Sailor Soldiers to defeat him. During that time, <b>Kunzite</b> tells Mamoru where Queen Metaria's weakness is. The piece of <b>kunzite</b> (along with the stones for the other three Kings of Heaven) were kept by Mamoru Chiba and he uses them to call upon his Kings of Heaven for advice.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{example of}} <b>kunzite</b> used in {{jewellery}} {{is in the}} Russian Palmette tiara and necklace worn by the Duchess of Gloucester.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kunzite</b> (Kuntsaito) is {{the fourth}} and final member of the Four Kings of Heaven. He carries a shortsword, and Takeuchi {{describes}} him as the greatest of the four, with the majesty of an Arabian king. She also admits to being very fond {{of him as a}} character. He is about 25-26 years old, leads the Dark Kingdom's Middle Eastern Division, and is named after the mineral <b>kunzite.</b> Unlike the others, he wears a white cape in addition to his uniform, with his tunic partially opened.|$|E
50|$|Pala was {{the site}} where {{morganite}} beryl was first discovered. In 1902 it {{was found to have}} the first commercially significant deposit of <b>kunzite,</b> named after George F. Kunz, the godfather of gemology.|$|E
50|$|Transparent {{material}} {{has long been}} used as a gemstone with varieties <b>kunzite</b> and hiddenite noted for their strong pleochroism. Source localities include Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Madagascar, Pakistan, Québec in Canada and North Carolina, California in the US.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kunzite</b> was {{discovered}} in 1902, and was named after George Frederick Kunz, Tiffany & Co's chief jeweler at the time, and a noted mineralogist. It {{has been found in}} Brazil, US, Canada, CIS, Mexico, Sweden, Western Australia, Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|E
50|$|The {{names of}} Queen Beryl and the Four Kings of Heaven {{are derived from}} minerals: beryl, jadeite, nephrite, zoisite, and <b>kunzite.</b> In some English adaptations, Kunzite's name is changed to Malachite. Several villains from {{subsequent}} arcs follow this pattern of using minerals as namesakes.|$|E
5000|$|Two American museums have {{acquired}} Ms. Picasso's work for their permanent collections. Housed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History is a 396.30-carat <b>kunzite</b> necklace designed by her. And visitors to The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago can view her 408.63-carat moonstone bracelet accented with diamond [...] "lightning bolts." ...|$|E

(Kuntsaito): A {{guardian}} knight {{hidden from}} the public by those currently using him, he is an ancient machine constructed with functions that mimic and understand human emotions, giving him {{the equivalent of a}} heart. He was created as Richea's guardian. His name is one of the names for spodumene. <b>Kunzite</b> is voiced by Hozumi Gōda.|$|E
50|$|Tiffany offers jewelry {{incorporating}} {{a wide variety}} of colored gemstones including gems it played a role in popularizing such as tsavorite, <b>Kunzite,</b> and morganite. In February 2015, a turquoise and aquamarine bib designed by Francesca Amfitheatrof, Tiffany’s design director, worn by Cate Blanchett at the 2015 Academy Awards, contrasted favorably with the white-diamond encrusted jewelry worn by other stars.|$|E
50|$|Spodumene is a {{pyroxene}} mineral {{consisting of}} lithium aluminium inosilicate, LiAl(SiO3)2, {{and is a}} source of lithium. It occurs as colorless to yellowish, purplish, or lilac <b>kunzite</b> (see below), yellowish-green or emerald-green hiddenite, prismatic crystals, often of great size. Single crystals of 14.3 m in size are reported from the Black Hills of South Dakota, United States.|$|E
50|$|In the live-action series, <b>Kunzite</b> {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{in the form of}} an amnesiac man named Shin, whom Usagi attempts to befriend. His memories are restored by Queen Beryl, causing him to be a ruthless and powerful warrior. His efforts to reawaken Queen Metaria are largely motivated by a desire for personal gain, and he is dismissive to Beryl, sometimes to the point of insubordination. He mostly works with her toward their shared goals, and he also transforms Sailor Mercury into Dark Mercury. <b>Kunzite</b> is awakened early on to the memory that Endymion was his master in his previous life, but he feels extreme contempt for the prince, believing he betrayed the Four Kings of Heaven in ages past and left them for dead. Eventually, at the cost of his life, he saves Endymion from an attack by Jadeite and professes his loyalty to the prince.|$|E
5000|$|In the live-action series, <b>Kunzite</b> {{attempts}} {{an experiment}} in which he turns one of the Sailor Soldiers evil. In Act 20, he kidnaps Ami Mizuno, {{who at the time}} is the loneliest and most vulnerable member of the team, and exposes her to the power of Queen Metaria, changing her into her evil alter ego, Dark Mercury. A black motif is added to her uniform, and she uses [...] "Dark" [...] powers and an icicle sword. <b>Kunzite</b> keeps her fairly close, being careful to withdraw her whenever Sailor Moon attempts a healing, but he does take advantage of her newly-sadistic personality by allowing her to attend school and antagonize Usagi. While a part of the Dark Kingdom, Mercury is as arrogant as her allies, but she does extend a small amount of kindness to Nephrite. Queen Beryl finds the experiment interesting, but does not entirely trust it. In the end, Dark Mercury is very nearly able to kill Sailor Moon, but the knowledge that she has injured her friend finally reverts her back to her true form.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{precious}} stones are mined and polished for local {{as well as}} export purposes. The centre point of this operation is Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa and most recently Gilgit-Baltistan. These include actinolite, hessonite, rodingite, agate, idocrase, rutile, aquamarine, jadeite, ruby, amazonite, <b>kunzite,</b> serpentine, azurite, kyanite, spessartine (garnet), beryl, marganite, spinel, emerald, moonstone, topaz, epidote, pargasite, tourmaline, garnet (alamandine), peridot, turquoise, grossular, quartz (citrine & others) and vesuvianite. The export earned from these gems is more than 200 Million dollars.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, Animage made a male anime {{character}} popularity poll, {{in which}} Zoisite was the tenth most popular, and Nephrite was the joint seventeenth, tying with a character from Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh. The first official Sailor Moon character popularity poll ranked Zoisite as the twentieth most popular character, <b>Kunzite</b> was the twenty third, Nephrite was twenty fourth, Jadeite was twenty sixth, Endou was twenty ninth, Beryl was thirtieth and Queen Metaria was thirty fourth, out of thirty eight choices.|$|E
5000|$|Dark Mercury has no {{intention}} of being a follower to anyone, and is always trying to pursue her own agenda, which is to kill her friends and become as strong as possible. She shows blatant disrespect to <b>Kunzite</b> and the other Kings of Heaven, even to Queen Beryl, perhaps because, unlike even the Four Kings of Heaven, she had been directly exposed to Metaria's power during her conversion, as opposed to having Queen Beryl or another [...] filtering it.|$|E
50|$|Dark Mercury {{is created}} when <b>Kunzite</b> manages to kidnap Ami {{in a moment}} of {{vulnerability}} while the other Sailor Guardians are busy. He exposes her directly to the power of Queen Metaria, causing drastic personality changes as well as the alterations to her uniform. She is self-confident to the point of egotism, and continues to attend school in civilian form, mainly to antagonize Usagi by brainwashing all of her former friends. Dressing predominantly in black, evil-Ami tends to move about slowly and dramatically, and when confronting the Sailor Guardians gives a sense of sadistic glee.|$|E
5000|$|George Frederick Kunz (1856-1932) {{assembled}} numerous important mineral collections {{throughout his}} life, {{such as a}} research collection for Thomas Edison. He also assembled the Morgan-Tiffany collection of gems which went to the American Museum of Natural History. He was mostly self-taught in regards to mineralogy and gemology, but his skills and knowledge landed him a position as a gem expert with Tiffany & Company {{at the age of}} 23. In 1903 the newly discovered violet pink variety of spodumene was named <b>kunzite</b> in his honor after his death.|$|E
50|$|In Sailor Moon Crystal, <b>Kunzite</b> {{calls out}} Jadeite for his failures. Later, he turns off Tokyo's power to provoke Minako into attacking him. However, he flees with Mamoru and is rejoined {{by the other}} Four Kings of Heaven. In his past life, he was the love {{interest}} of Sailor Venus, a fact which Venus desperately tries {{to remind him of}} each time they face off. In his last moment prior to being killed by Metaria, he manages to briefly acknowledge that he returns Venus's love. His spirit appears to Mamoru one final time to tell him of Metaria's weak spot.|$|E
5000|$|Afghanistan is {{endowed with}} {{a wealth of}} natural resources, {{including}} extensive deposits of natural gas, petroleum, coal, marble, gold, copper, chromite, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, precious and semi-precious stones, and many rare earth elements. In 2006, a U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Afghanistan has as much as [...] of natural gas, [...] of oil and condensate reserves. According to a 2007 assessment, Afghanistan has significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral resources. Geologists also found indications of abundant deposits of colored stones and gemstones, including emerald, ruby, sapphire, garnet, lapis, <b>kunzite,</b> spinel, tourmaline and peridot.|$|E
50|$|Afghanistan {{is known}} to have {{exploited}} its precious and semi-precious gemstone deposits. These deposits include aquamarine, emerald and other varieties of beryl, fluorite, garnet, <b>kunzite,</b> ruby, sapphire, lapis lazuli, topaz, tourmaline, and varieties of quartz. Corundum deposits (sapphire and ruby) in the country are largely exhausted, and very little gem quality material is found. The four main gemstone-producing areas are those of Badakhshan, Jegdalek, Nuristan, and the Panjshir Valley. Artisanal mining of gemstones in the country used primitive methods. Some gemstones were exported illicitly, mostly to India (which was the world's leading import market for colored gemstones and an outlet for higher quality gems) and to the domestic neighboring Pakistan market.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2009, the Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) {{published}} a ruling which stated that Rocks & Co. had misled viewers over {{the value of}} a Patroke <b>Kunzite</b> ring. The starting price of the auction was given as £46,552 and the auction closed at £1,499, a sum which R&C told the ASA had resulted in selling the ring at a loss. During the auction, the presenter referred to various sub-£5000 prices as [...] "a phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal price", [...] "a joke" [...] and [...] "a giveaway price". The ASA upheld a viewer's complaint that these comments, coupled with the artificially high starting point of the auction, misled viewers as to the actual value of the item. R&C stated that their starting prices were not intended to imply a worth or valuation of the items for sale, and that based the current wholesale prices for <b>kunzite</b> stones, the firm estimated the actual worth of the ring to be in the region of £4,432, and that this justified some of the comments ("a joke", et al.) made about prices lower than this level. The ASA, however, ruled that viewers may have interpreted the starting price as [...] "an amount materially related to the usual retail price or suggested valuation" [...] of the item. They also ruled that R&C's failure to provide independent substantiation for the stone's value contributed to the sale having been misleading. The sale was thus ruled by the ASA to have been in breach of TV Advertising Standards Code rules on 'misleading advertising'.|$|E
5000|$|The roscherite analog zanazziite {{was found}} in Lavar da Ilha {{deposits}} in Minas Gerais, Brazil. [...] Zanazziite grows usually along the surface of quartz minerals. It occurs in pegmatite in beds of the Jequitinhonha river valley. [...] The pegmatite consists of a wall zone rich in feldspar and muscovite, anda quartz core. [...] The core margin has small pockets and crevices which contain quartz crystals {{and a number of}} phosphate minerals (on which the roscherite minerals accumulate). [...] This is special to quartz and phosphate due to the rich locality of Minas Gerais. Minas Gerais contains the world’s most diverse concentration of complex granitic pegmatites. This region is responsible for the production of gem beryl, chrysoberyl, topaz, tourmaline, and <b>kunzite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Author Patrick Drazen {{described}} DIC's {{name change}} for Nephrite's disguise, Maxfield Stanton, as [...] "ridiculously soap-opera." [...] However, Drazen later made a later review about Nephrite's {{death at the}} hands of Zoisite's monsters, and stated that this scene must have been an unexpected development for viewers used to happy endings. Drazen also cited Nephrite's death in Naru's arms as a scene of redemption, saying that him smiling and laughing during his death [...] "would have been beyond him in the past, but love is turning him human." [...] Kotono Mitsuishi, the voice actress of Usagi Tsukino, said she was particularly touched by this sequence. Sara Roncero-Menendez from The Huffington Post stated that the homosexual relationship between Zoisite and <b>Kunzite</b> in the first anime adaptation was censored in the English versions by changing Zoisite's gender from male to female.|$|E
50|$|The Four Kings of Heaven {{appear in}} several musicals. In many of them, they are paired with the Sailor Soldiers. In musical adaptations {{of the last}} arc, the Four Kings are revived by Sailor Galaxia to work under her service, but in some {{versions}} they betray her. The musical Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin had a group that which called themselves the Neo-Four Kings of Heaven (Neo-Shiten'ō). The members of the Neo-Four Kings of Heaven were <b>Kunzite,</b> Hematite, Hiddenite, and Kalunite. Hematite, Hiddenite, and Kalunite looked identical to Zoisite, Nephrite and Jadeite respectively. In La Reconquista, the Four Kings of Heaven disguise themselves as a boy band known as Pandemic 4. The group consisted of Kunza, Jed, Nephra, and Zoi. The band appeared in the Pandemic Love game, in which they used the game to drain energy for Beryl, and had one song, Erosion Boy (Irōjon Bōi).|$|E
50|$|In Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon, the live-action series, Ami is briefly {{taken over}} by the power of the Dark Kingdom and becomes Dark Mercury (Aku no Mākyurī). This form first appears in Act 21, as a servant of <b>Kunzite.</b> Her sailor suit has black tulle and lace on the back bow and sleeves, and tribal designs appear on her tiara and boots. She also gains a chain with a black charm on it around her waist. Her {{transformation}} phrase is Dark Power! Make-up! and is said in a much darker tone. She wields a sword fashioned from an icicle, which she creates herself the first time her transformation is displayed. In promotional photos prior to her premiere, she was shown with a different sword, which seemed to have strings on it like a harp or violin; the latter seems more likely, as she is also seen holding a bow. This bow was redecorated and given to Zoisite for use as a sword.|$|E
5000|$|Yuji Toba (23): Souta's ex-partner {{from his}} {{times as a}} spy, kidnaping him in order to know the place where SGS kept the Imperial Pearl and steal it for the country. It's later {{revealed}} that he recruited the Questers to help him. Ley would forcefully extract from Souta's memory {{the location of the}} building so they could steal the Precious and Toba would receive the Imperial Pearl as payment. However, Toba soon got a change of heart after hearing's Souta intend to make up for his crime. When the Questers finally locate the building and try to break into it with Quester Robo Turbo, Toba detonated a bomb he installed in the cockpit previously, giving SirenBuilder and Ultimate DaiBouken the chance to destroy the robot.

5000|$|Zoisite first mocks Nephrite after Jadeite is killed, {{and then}} cries out in anguish {{when he is}} killed. However, he also works closely with <b>Kunzite,</b> sharing {{concerns}} and strategies as he works. Seeking the Silver Crystal, he uses news reports and press releases to make the population of Tokyo help with his search, then resorts to taking their energy when they fail. He very nearly defeats the Sailor Soldiers, but is killed by Minako Aino's Crescent Boomerang. Zoisite was briefly revived {{near the end of}} the [...] "Dark Kingdom" [...] arc and was able to remember the Golden Kingdom and his time as a military officer of Prince Endymion before being turned into the stone from which his name was derived. The piece of zoisite (along with the stones for the other three Kings of Heaven) were kept by Mamoru Chiba and he used them to call upon his Four Kings of Heaven for advice.|$|E
