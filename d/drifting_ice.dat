5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six {{messages from}} other ships warning of <b>drifting</b> <b>ice,</b> which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50years (which was {{the reason why the}} lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.|$|E
5|$|In September 1879 the Jeannette, an ex-Royal Navy gunboat {{converted}} by the US Navy for Arctic exploration, and {{commanded by}} George W. De Long, entered the pack ice {{north of the}} Bering Strait. She remained ice-bound for nearly two years, drifting {{to the area of}} the New Siberian Islands, before being crushed and sunk on 13 June 1881. Her crew escaped in boats and made for the Siberian coast; most, including De Long, subsequently perished either during the boat journey or in the wastelands of the Lena River delta. Three years later, relics from the Jeannette appeared {{on the opposite side of}} the world, in the vicinity of Julianehaab on the southwest coast of Greenland. These items, frozen into the <b>drifting</b> <b>ice,</b> included clothing bearing crew members' names and documents signed by De Long; they were indisputably genuine.|$|E
5|$|In {{a lecture}} given in 1884 to the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters Dr. Henrik Mohn, {{one of the}} founders of modern meteorology, argued that the finding of the Jeannette relics {{indicated}} the existence of an ocean current flowing from east to west across the entire Arctic Ocean. The Danish governor of Julianehaab, writing of the find, surmised that an expedition frozen into the Siberian sea might, if its ship were to prove strong enough, cross the polar ocean and land in South Greenland. These theories were read with interest by the 23-year-old Fridtjof Nansen, then working as a curator at the Bergen Museum while completing his doctoral studies. Nansen was already captivated by the frozen north; two years earlier he had experienced a four-month voyage on the sealer Viking, which had included three weeks trapped in <b>drifting</b> <b>ice.</b> An expert skier, Nansen was making plans to lead the first crossing of the Greenland icecap, an objective delayed by the demands of his academic studies, but triumphantly achieved in 1888–89. Through these years Nansen remembered the east–west Arctic drift theory and its inherent possibilities for further polar exploration, and shortly after his return from Greenland he was ready to announce his plans.|$|E
5000|$|Monbetsu {{is famous}} for <b>drift</b> <b>ice,</b> a yearly {{phenomenon}} which reaches the city every January or February from the northern Sea of Okhotsk. As such, the city {{has taken on the}} <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> as its symbol and has become a center for research on sea ice generally, with an international conference held in February (usually the time of peak sea ice) each year. There is also a yearly <b>Drift</b> <b>Ice</b> Festival that coincides with the Sapporo Snow Festival. The festival features impressive sculptures built out of <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> along with a large ice maze. Additionally, the Okhotsk Tower is a facility where one can observe sea ice from both high above, and from below the ocean. It is complete with an information center and aquarium. An icebreaker, the Garinko II, departs from nearby and makes regular sightseeing cruises through the <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> during the winter. Mombetsu is also home to the newly built <b>Drift</b> <b>Ice</b> Museum, which covers all aspects of sea ice and features a sub-zero room and [...] "frozen aquarium" [...] of various fish preserved in ice.|$|R
50|$|Sea ice can be {{classified}} according {{to whether or not}} it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between shoals or to grounded icebergs). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, fast ice (from fastened). Alternatively, and unlike fast <b>ice,</b> <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast <b>ice</b> and <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> is the fast <b>ice</b> boundary. The <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> zone may be further divided into a shear zone, a marginal ice zone and a central pack. <b>Drift</b> <b>ice</b> consists of floes, individual pieces of sea ice 20 m or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: small - 20 m to 100 m; medium - 100 m to 500 m; big - 500 m to 2000 m; vast - 2 km to 10 km; and giant - more than 10 km. The term pack ice is used either as a synonym to <b>drift</b> <b>ice,</b> or to designate <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> zone in which the floes are densely packed. The overall sea ice cover is termed the ice canopy from the perspective of submarine navigation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>ice</b> is any sea ice {{other than}} fast ice, {{the latter being}} {{attached}} ("fastened") to the shoreline or other fixed objects (shoals, grounded icebergs, etc.). <b>Drift</b> <b>ice</b> is carried along by winds and sea currents, hence its name. When <b>drift</b> <b>ice</b> is driven together into a large single mass (>70% coverage), it is called pack ice. Wind and currents can pile up that ice to form ridges up to several metres in height. These represent a challenge for icebreakers and offshore structures operating in cold oceans and seas.|$|R

25|$|Mikhail Vodopyanov and V. M. Makhotin {{carried out}} flights {{to the islands}} in 1936, in {{preparation}} for their expedition the following year, during which they hoped to reach the North Pole. The same year the icebreakers Rusanov and Hercen freighted in equipment for a <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> station on Rudolf Island. This was followed up {{with the construction of}} an airstrip on the island's glacier. The plans were executed in 1937, with four aircraft setting out on 18April and the establishment of North Pole-1 as a <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> station headed by Ivan Papanin. A transpolar flight by Sigizmund Levanevsky went astray and ships were dispatched to search for him in the archipelago. With poor ice conditions, they were forced to stay the winter, bringing the archipelago's winter population to 300.|$|E
25|$|During the interwar period Tarmo was {{stationed}} at the Gulf of Finland, where in addition to assisting ships she often had to rescue local fishermen trapped on <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> floes.

25|$|Soviet {{activities}} grew rapidly {{following the}} International Polar Year in 1932. The archipelago was circumnavigated, people were landed on Victoria Island, and a topographical map was completed. In 1934–35 geological and glaciological expeditions were carried out, cartographic flights were flown, {{and up to}} sixty people stayed the winters between 1934 and 1936, which also saw the first birth. The first <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> station was set up out of Rudolf Island in 1936. An airstrip was then constructed on a glacier {{on the island and}} by 1937 the winter population hit 300.|$|E
25|$|The 1930 Bratvaag Expedition was {{the last}} Western European {{presence}} on the islands until 1990, except for an undetected German weather station on Alexandra Land during World War II. From 1932 the Soviet Union operated weather stations at Tikhaya Bay, Hooker Island and on Rudolf Island. The 1930s also saw the development of complete topographical maps with the islands used as launching points for <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> stations. During the Cold War the islands became strategically important and aerodromes were constructed at Nagurskoye and Heiss Island. The Ernst Krenkel Observatory was established in 1957. From 1991 foreign scientists were again welcome to the islands, which were declared a nature reserve in 1994. Tourism commenced and the archipelago {{became part of the}} Russian Arctic National Park in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Mazuruk briefly {{served in}} the Soviet Air Force during the late 1920s and then became a Civil Air Fleet pilot. After {{becoming}} a polar aviator, he commanded a modified Tupolev TB-3 during the North Pole-1 <b>drifting</b> <b>ice</b> station mission, the first such mission. For his actions Mazuruk was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. He became head of the Glavsevmorput Polar Aviation Directorate. After rejoining the Soviet Air Force, Mazuruk flew combat missions in the Winter War and World War II. Between 1942 and 1944, he successively led the Krasnoyarsk Air Route and the 1st Ferry Aviation Division, both responsible for ferrying Allied Lend-Lease aircraft from Alaska to Siberia. Mazuruk reached the rank of Major General {{after the end of}} the war and continued to participate in polar expeditions, retiring from the Air Force in 1953. He worked at the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute after his retirement and died in 1989.|$|E
