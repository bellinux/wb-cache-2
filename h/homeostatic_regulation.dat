25|$|In the ultradian sleep cycle an {{organism}} alternates between deep sleep (slow, large, synchronized brain waves) and paradoxical sleep (faster, desynchronized waves). Sleep {{happens in the}} context of the larger circadian rhythm, which influences sleepiness and physiological factors based on timekeepers within the body. Sleep can be distributed throughout the day or clustered during one part of the rhythm: in nocturnal animals, during the day, and in diurnal animals, at night. The organism returns to <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> almost immediately after REM sleep ends.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{behavior}} undergoes {{substantial changes}} during adolescence. Some {{of these changes}} may be societal in humans, but other changes are hormonal.

50|$|The {{cycles and}} the {{deadlock}} states identified by this process are then analyzed by comparing {{them with the}} invitro and invivo findings. These results {{can be used to}} make important predictions about the system. Cyclic behaviors correspond to <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> that retain the level of a variable at or near a fixed or optimal value.

50|$|Dopamine, a known {{neurotransmitter}} {{responsible for}} mood cycling, {{has been shown}} to have increased transmission during the manic phase. The dopamine hypothesis states that the increase in dopamine results in secondary <b>homeostatic</b> down <b>regulation</b> of key systems and receptors such as an increase in dopamine mediated G protein-coupled receptors. This results in decreased dopamine transmission characteristic of the depressive phase. The depressive phase ends with <b>homeostatic</b> up <b>regulation</b> potentially restarting the cycle over again.|$|R
25|$|Copper is absorbed, transported, distributed, stored, and {{excreted}} in {{the body}} according to complex homeostatic processes which ensure a constant and sufficient supply of the micronutrient while simultaneously avoiding excess levels. If an insufficient amount of copper is ingested {{for a short period}} of time, copper stores in the liver will be depleted. Should this depletion continue, a copper health deficiency condition may develop. If too much copper is ingested, an excess condition can result. Both of these conditions, deficiency and excess, can lead to tissue injury and disease. However, due to <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation,</b> the human body is capable of balancing a wide range of copper intakes for the needs of healthy individuals.|$|E
25|$|Sleep is {{regulated}} by two parallel mechanisms, <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> and circadian regulation, {{controlled by the}} hypothalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), respectively. Although {{the exact nature of}} sleep drive is unknown, homeostatic pressure builds up during wakefulness and this continues until the person goes to sleep. Adenosine is thought to {{play a critical role in}} this and many people have proposed that the pressure build-up is partially due to adenosine accumulation. However, some researchers have shown that accumulation alone does not explain this phenomenon completely. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in the body, which has been shown to continue even in the absence of environmental cues. This is caused by projections from the SCN to the brain stem.|$|E
2500|$|Aldosterone, {{the main}} {{mineralocorticoid}} hormone, is a steroid hormone {{produced by the}} zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon. [...] It plays {{a central role in}} the <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> of blood pressure, plasma sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) levels. It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.|$|E

Elucidation of the spatiotemporal regulation of cyclic nucleotide signaling requires methods for tracking the dynamics of cyclic nucleotides and the activities of their regulators and effectors in the native biological context. Here we review a series of genetically encoded FRET-based probes for real-time monitoring of cyclic nucleotide signaling with a particular focus on their implementation in neurons.

40|$|Purpose ¿ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{artificial}} homeostatic system whose parameters are defined by means of an evolutionary process. The objective is to design a more biologically plausible system inspired by <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> observed in nature, which is capable of exploring key issues in the context of robot behaviour adaptation and coordination. Design/methodology/approach ¿ The proposed system consists of an artificial endocrine system that coordinates two spatially unconstrained GasNet artificial neural network models, called non-spatial GasNets. Both systems are dedicated to the definition of control actions in autonomous navigation tasks via the use of an artificial hormone and a hormone receptor. A series of experiments are performed in a real and simulated scenario in order to investigate the performance of the system and its robustness to novel environmental conditions and internal sensory disruptions. Findings ¿ The designed system shows to be robust enough to self-adapt to a wider variety of disruptions and novel environments by making full use of its in-built homeostatic mechanisms. The system is also successfully tested on a real robot, indicating the viability of the proposed method for coping with the reality gap, a well-known issue for the evolutionary robotics community. Originality/value ¿ The proposed framework is inspired by the <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> and gaseous neuro-modulation that are intrinsic to the human body. The incorporation of an artificial hormone receptor stands for the novelty of this paper. This hormone receptor proves to be vital to control the network's response to the signalling promoted by the presence of the artificial hormone. It is envisaged that the proposed framework is a step forward in the design of a generic model for coordinating many and more complex behaviours in simulated and real robots, employing multiple hormones and potentially coping with further severe disruptions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper we have {{examined}} the applicability of dimensionless and invariant numbers (DN & IN) {{to the analysis of}} the cardiovascular system of mammals, whose functions were measured at standard metabolic conditions. The calculated IN did not change when we compared these figures with those obtained in dogs while they were submitted to graded exercise on a treadmill. In both instances, rest and exercise, the constancy of the IN prevailed, in accordance with Cannon's principle of "homeostasis" (1929). On the contrary, when dogs were examined during a standardized hypovolemic shock, we observed a breakdown of the IN, and the resulting DN evolved as a reliable index of the condition of "heterostasis" as defined by H. Selye. The robustness of the <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> is based on high-gain integral feedback mechanisms, while "heterostasis" could be associated with low-gain integral feedback processes, when organisms are submitted to unitary step disturbances or to changes of the set-point at the entrance of the feedback loop...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{peripheral}} organs, the lymphatic system performs important immune functions, and runs {{parallel to the}} blood circulatory system to provide a secondary circulation that transports excess interstitial fluid, proteins and metabolic waste products from the systemic tissues back into the blood. The efficient removal of soluble proteins from the interstitial fluid {{is critical to the}} regulation of both colloidal osmotic pressure and <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> of the body's fluid volume. The importance of lymphatic flow is especially evident when the lymphatic system becomes obstructed. [...] In lymphatic associated diseases such as elephantiasis (where parasites occupying the lymphatic vessels block the flow of lymph), the impact of such an obstruction can be dramatic. The resulting chronic edema is due to the breakdown of lymphatic clearance and the accumulation of interstitial solutes. [...] In 2015, the presence of a meningeal lymphatic system was first identified by two independent studies by Louveau et al. and Aspelund et al..|$|E

Sleep physiology and the repercussions of experimentally induced sleep deprivation on sleep and waking electroencephalogram (EEG), vigilance and subjective state are highly variable, even in healthy individuals.

However, most of these models are not investigated with respect to the functionality of the neural code for the purpose of object recognition comparable to the framework of deep learning in the machine learning community. We developed a model of V 1 and V 2 based on anatomical evidence of the layered architecture, using excitatory and inhibitory neurons where the connectivity to each neuron is learned in parallel. We address learning by three different mechanisms of plasticity: intrinsic plasticity, Hebbian learning with <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations,</b> and structural plasticity. For evaluation, we trained the model on natural scenes and analyzed the resulting receptive fields, i. e. invariance properties, tuning characteristics and robustness to input variations, being of essential interest as they are showing the basic principles of feature extraction and invariant representation for object recognition. Further, we show the recognition accuracies of the model to the COIL- 100 dataset for all V 1 and V 2 layers to demonstrate the object recognition capability of each model layer...|$|R

5000|$|Vasodilation and {{vasoconstriction}} {{are complex}} phenomena; they are functions not merely of the fluid mechanics of pressure and tissue elasticity {{but also of}} active <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> with hormones and cell signaling, in which the body produces endogenous vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to modify its vessels' compliance. For example, the muscle tone of the smooth muscle tissue of the tunica media can be adjusted by the renin-angiotensin system. In patients whose endogenous <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> is not working well, dozens of pharmaceutical drugs that are also vasoactive can be added. The response of vessels to such vasoactive substances is called vasoactivity (or sometimes vasoreactivity). Vasoactivity can vary between persons because of genetic and epigenetic differences, {{and it can be}} impaired by pathosis and by age. This makes the topic of haemodynamic response (including vascular compliance and vascular resistance) a matter of medical and pharmacologic complexity beyond mere hydraulic considerations (which are complex enough by themselves).|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been known, in large part from animal studies, that the control of brown adipose tissue (BAT) {{thermogenesis}} is insured by the central nervous system, which integrates several stimuli {{in order to control}} BAT activation through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). SNS-mediated BAT activity is governed by diverse neurons found in brain structures involved in <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> and whose activity is modulated by various factors including oscillations of energy fluxes. The characterization of these neurons has always represented a challenging issue. The available literature suggests that the neuronal circuits controlling BAT thermogenesis are largely part of an autonomic circuitry involving the hypothalamus, brainstem and the SNS efferent neurons. In the present review, we recapitulate the latest progresses in regards to the hypothalamic regulation of BAT metabolism. We briefly addressed the role of the thermoregulatory pathway and its interactions with the energy balance systems in the control of thermogenesis. We also reviewed the involvement of the brain melanocortin and endocannabinoid systems as well as the emerging role of steroidogenic factor 1 neurons in BAT thermogenesis. Finally, we examined the link existing between these systems and the homeostatic factors that modulate their activities...|$|R
40|$|As binding {{sites of}} the alpha-amino butyric acid {{receptor}} complexes benzodiazepine-receptors offer a possibility to enhance hyperpolarization-based inhibition by allosteric modulation. Most of the hypnotic drugs are compounds that bind to benzodiazepine receptors. The effects of these drugs are usually characterized at a descriptive level, without deliberation of the basic processes involved in sleep regulation. This review follows the analysis of hypnotic's effect from a perspective of homeostatic, circadian, ultradian and microstructural regulation of sleep. In contrast to their expected effect benzodiazepines produce a decrease {{in most of the}} markers of <b>homeostatic</b> sleep <b>regulation.</b> Ligands with non-benzodiazepine structure (cyclopyrrolones, imidazopyridines, pyrazolopyrimidines) have a permissive or even stimulating effect in some measures of <b>homeostatic</b> sleep <b>regulation.</b> Some benzodiazepines have marked chronobiotic effects, while others interfere with circadian rhythms. The non- benzodiazepine-type hypnotics are mostly free of chronobiotic effects, although zaleplon may increase melatonin release. Given their acute hypothermic effect all hypnotic sedatives mimic the circadian signal of sleep initiation. Ultradian sleep regulation is largely unaffected by hypnotics. The microstructure of sleep as quantified by arousal instability is a sensitive measure of the effect of most of the hypnotics. Hypnotic sedatives decrease arousal instability. Zolpidem has the strongest effects in microstructural terms...|$|R

40|$|Intrinsic motivations, {{the topic}} of this paper, can be defined by {{contrasting}} them to extrinsic motivations. Extrinsic motivations are directed to drive and guide the learning of behaviour directed to satisfy <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> related to the organisms 2 ̆ 7 survival and repro- duction. Intrinsic motivations, instead, are motivations that serve the evolutionary function of acquiring knowledge (e. g., the capacity to pre- dict) and competence (i. e. the capacity to do) {{in the absence of}} extrinsic motivations: this knowledge and competence can be later exploited for producing behaviours that enhance biological fitness. While knowledge- based intrinsic motivation mechanisms have been widely modelled and studied, competence-based intrinsic motivation mechanisms (CB-IM), usable for guiding learning on the basis of competence level or improve- ment, have been much less investigated. The goal {{of this paper is to}} clarify the nature and possible roles of CB-IM mechanisms for learning, in particular in relation to the cumulative acquisition of a repertoire of skills underlying the capacity to accomplish multiple tasks in the environ- ment, and then to review a specific CB-IM mechanism. This mechanism (TD-CB-IM) measures the improvement rate of competence on the ba- sis of the Temporal-Difference learning signal (TD-error) used in several reinforcement learning (RL) models. The effectiveness of the mechanism is supported by reporting the results of some experiments where the TD- CB-IM mechanism is successfully exploited by a hierarchical RL model controlling a simulated navigating robot to decide when to train different skills in different environmental conditions.
