500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Noi doi", when {{translated}} to English, feature {{an invitation to}} a love interest: [...] "Baby/ Would you do me a favor/ <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the sea/ We would be both under the sun/ Under the sun, both of us". Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed myself with the sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, this movie is too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust– nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the conclusion that no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents {{in such a way as}} to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E

'You would have, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me {{for such}} a purpose,' said Mr Haredale calmly, 'some reason to assign for conduct so extraordinary, which--if one may {{entertain}} the possibility of anything so wild and strange--would have its weight, of course.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On 19 September 2006, Habibie {{explained}} to reporters {{that far from}} dismissing Singapore in 1998, he had meant to highlight Singapore's achievements despite its small size. He {{said that he had}} made the remark while speaking off-the-cuff with members of an Indonesian youth group and trying to [...] "give them spirit". He said that he had told them: [...] "If you look at the map of South-east Asia, you [...] are so big, and Singapore is just a dot. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Singapore, you see people with vision." [...] He also claimed that [...] "I have corrected [...] many times, but they have never put it [...] And I could not prove it in writing because I was talking freely." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{performances}} Bob Log {{will often}} call audience members (both male and female) on stage {{to sit on}} his knee while he plays. Log credits years of drumming with his feet {{for his ability to}} simultaneously drum and support the weight of multiple people: [...] "My legs are huge now. Sometimes I can get a girl on each knee and bounce 'em along." [...] Log has distinctively used breasts as a theme in his performance and hired two [...] "professional women" [...] to use their breasts as percussion instruments on his song [...] "Clap Your Tits". Log {{is quick to point out}} that all of these acts are carried out between consenting adults and individuals familiar with his brand of humor, stating, [...] "First of all, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> my show knowing I've got a song called [...] "Boob Scotch" [...] and you get offended, I'm sorry but I've got to say just get out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vanguard {{journalist}} Ochereome Nnanna wrote positively of the book, [...] "The simple impression I get is {{that the}} man is a very imaginative, straightforward, practical person; the ultimate Mr. Big Shot. He will be your friend <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> him with genuine friendship, but he will give you a fight of your life if you decide to fight. That is my kind of person." [...] Fashion designer Emilia Wickstead told the Financial Times the book inspired her at a young age to become an entrepreneur. Real Estate Weekly wrote, [...] "Think Big And Kick Ass is the title of one of Trump's books and the icon of everything Trump." [...] London Review of Books wrote that the work was a way to capitalize on the aspirations of consumers. The Washington Free Beacon rated the work's cover as the second best of all of Trump's book covers, and characterized the book as exemplifying [...] "The Trumpean Ideal".|$|E
