Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They create {{the impression of a}} shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They are made up of dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E

25|$|The {{fruit of}} hickory is pear shaped and {{enclosed}} {{in a thin}} husk developed from the floral <b>involucre.</b> The fruit ripens in September and October, and seeds are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and split away from the nut into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell.|$|E

25|$|The stem divides into ten or more branches, each {{of which}} is topped by a {{compound}} spiny ovoid inflorescence of 4–8cm in diameter, which may be covered in dense arachnoid hairs. This inflorescence is unusual for members of the Asteraceae family, as each true flowerhead is so far reduced as to only contain one floret, which is surrounded by its own <b>involucre.</b> Five to seven of these monofloral flowerheads combine into secondary flowerheads, each subtended by a spiny bract hardly or substantially longer than the secondary flowerheads, with only the centre floret developing a cypsela, and the surrounding ones only producing pollen. These secondary flowerheads later break free from the globose assembly of flowerheads that sit on the end of each branch of the stem during the tumbleweed-stage. Remarkable for a member of the Cichorieae tribe are also the disk florets, a trait that is further only present in Warionia saharae.|$|E
40|$|Poster presentado en el 18 th Symposium on Cryptogamic Botany celebrada en Barcelona del 13 al 16 de julio de 2011 Species of {{the genus}} Riella have been {{systematically}} divided into two subgenera, namely Euriella and Trabutiella depending on their smooth or winged <b>involucres.</b> Subgenus Trabutiella is less diverse currently including only 4 species and one variety. In {{the context of a}} worldwide revision {{of the genus}} Riella, complete revision of this subgenus was conducted in order to describe species morphological boundaries and to evaluate their taxonomic significance. After this revision 7 species are recognised. Riella affinis and R. heliospora, the only monoecious species of subgenus Trabutiella. Riella heliospora can be distinguished from R. affinis by the presence of a spore wing, the lower density of spines with distinct areolae in the distal face and by the conspicuous triradate mark in the proximal face. In the dioecious group, R. cossoniana is characterised by its obovate <b>involucres,</b> with 8 - 10 large wings extending from the tip to the base, > 6 cells high and spherical spores with concave proximal face and short distal face spines 7 μm. Riella gamundiae shows intermediate characters with <b>involucres</b> similar to those of R. echinata and spores as R. cossoniana. Riella paulsenii is characterised by its spore showing both truncate spines and papill ae. A new species is described as Riella mediterranea Segarra-Moragues, Puche, Sabovljevic, Infante & Heras, that is characterised by its acuminate <b>involucres</b> with 11 - 15 low wings < 5 cells high and its densely spinose spores with spines up to 15 μm with truncate and enlarged apices.

In southern California, larvae of the spring (F 1) generation develop singly in and feed on one or both ovules of young fruiting <b>involucres</b> of Ambrosia ilicifolia (Gray) Payne, with a small proportion infesting the staminate <b>involucres.</b> Adults emerge after ≈ 1 mo, with their reproductive organs immature. The F 2 generation develops in the <b>involucres</b> of fall-blooming Ambrosia acanthicarpa Hooker. The egg is described and illustrated {{for the first time}} for any species of Euaresta. First, second, and third instars and the puparium are described and illustrated for the first time for E. stigmatica. The posterior spiracular plates of all three instars bear only three interspiracular processes, whereas the larvae and puparia of all other nonfrugivorous tephritids described to date bear four such processes. Adult behaviors described from field and laboratory studies include courtship, copulation, and territoriality. Male courtship displays include three behaviors previously undescribed for Tephritidae: a side-to-side dance, rapid side stepping,and a middle leg abduction. Hymenopterous parasitoids of E. stigmatica include two solitary, primary larval-pupal, endoparasitoids, Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae) and Pteromalus sp. (Pteromalidae).

40|$|The genus Riella (Riellaceae, Sphaerocarpales) {{includes}} some 24 species of thalloid aquatic liverworts with unique morphological and ecological features among hepatics. These include {{the development of}} sporophytes enclosed within <b>involucres</b> and growing submerged in seasonal fresh or brackish water ponds. Riella subgenus Trabutiella includes species with winged <b>involucres.</b> Seven taxa have been described, however, four to five taxa have been recognized at a time depending on authors. In this study we have conducted a morphological revision of the species of this subgenus, based on 59 traits measured under light and Scanning Electron Microscopy analyses and that were the subject of statistical analyses. Taxonomically most informative traits were derived from female <b>involucres</b> and spores, whereas quantitative vegetative traits were of little relevance to taxonomy. Lectotypes are designated for subgenus Trabutiella and section Plicatae and for R. cossoniana. Our analyses support the recognition of six species, and support R. paulsenii as a synonym of R. cossoniana. A new species, R. mediterranea is described, and R. cossoniana var. echinata is raised to species rank. An identification key, detailed descriptions of the six accepted taxa, updated distribution maps, and full illustrations of four of the species, including the first for R. echinata are provided.

25|$|The flowerheads {{are seated}} {{at the end of}} the stem or in the limbs of the higher leaves, are {{arranged}} in a spike or a globose cluster and are subtended by two to more than five leaflike bracts. Each flowerhead is circled by an <b>involucre</b> that consists of many spine-tipped bracts in several rows, the outer papery and shorter than the inner ones, which are leaflike in consistency. These surround the common floral base (or receptacle), which is conical in shape and is set with ovate papery bracts called chaff or paleae. Inplanted are dorsally compressed cypselas, each enclosed by a palea, the outer rows higher than the inner ones. On top of the cypselas there may be two to five stiff scabrous bristles, which are equivalent to sepals (and are called pappus). Also, on top of the cypsela and within the pappus is a yellow, orange or white strap-like corolla which ends in five teeth, together comprising a ligulate floret.|$|E
25|$|Flowers {{occur in}} the {{dome-shaped}} head characteristic of B.ser. Dryandra. These occur {{at the end of}} branches or on short laterals, and consist of from 80 to 100 individual densely packed together and surrounded by a short <b>involucre</b> of narrow, tapering bracts. The hairless tips of these bracts are quite prominent; this is a distinctive characteristic of this species. As in all Proteaceae, individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry pistil. The pistil end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at anthesis. In B.fraseri, the perianth is 24–28 millimetres long, and pink to cream in colour; and the style 30–42mm long and cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the flower head, and usually containing two winged seeds. In this species each head may set an unusually large number of follicles.|$|E

40|$|Riella (Riellaceae, Sphaerocarpales) is a genus {{of aquatic}} liverworts with disjunct range {{in areas of}} Mediterranean-type climates. Riella has been {{traditionally}} subdivided into two subgenera, subgenus Riella, whose plants show smooth or papillose female <b>involucres</b> and Trabutiella, whose plants show winged female <b>involucres.</b> To date only three species of Riella are known in France, all belonging to subgenus Riella. During {{the course of a}} study of the plant diversity of temporary brackish ponds in the Camargue area (Southern France), soil sediments were collected from 10 localities and cultivated in the laboratory. From cultures of five of these localities emerged dioicous plants of Riella showing winged female <b>involucres</b> that unambiguously assigned them to subgenus Trabutiella. The study of those specimens with Light and Scanning Electron Microscopy allowed us to identify them as R. cossoniana var. cossoniana. Fresh materials allowed for detailed morphological analyses on these new French materials which were fully described and illustrated. These findings represent the first report of a species belonging to subgenus Trabutiella from France and the second European country where R. cossoniana is reported.

60|$|Even among plants which {{trust to}} the {{involuntary}} services {{of animals in}} dispersing their seeds, a great many varieties of detail may be observed on close inspection. For example, in hound's-tongue and goose-grass, two of the best-known instances among our common English weeds, each little nut is covered with many small hooks, which make it catch on firmly by several points of attachment to passing animals. These are the kinds we human beings of either sex oftenest find clinging to our skirts or trousers after a walk in a rabbit-warren. But in herb-bennet and avens each nut has a single long awn, crooked near the middle with a very peculiar S-shaped joint, which effectually catches on to the wool or hair, but drops at the elbow after {{a short period of}} withering. Sometimes, too, the whole fruit is provided with prehensile hooks, while sometimes it is rather the individual seeds themselves that are so accommodated. Oddest of all is the plan followed by the common burdock. Here, an <b>involucre</b> or common cup-shaped receptacle of hooked bracts surrounds an entire head of purple tubular flowers, and each of these flowers produces in time a distinct fruit; but the hooked <b>involucre</b> contains the whole compound mass, and, being pulled off bodily by a stray sheep or dog, effects the transference of the composite lot at once to some fitting place for their germination.|$|E
60|$|There is, however, another {{class of}} fruits or seeds, usually termed nuts, {{in which there}} is a large amount of edible matter, often very {{agreeable}} to the taste, and especially attractive and nourishing to a large number of animals. But when eaten, the seed is destroyed and the existence of the species endangered. It is evident, therefore, that it is by a kind of accident that these nuts are eatable; and that they are not intended to be eaten is shown by the special care nature seems to have taken to conceal or to protect them. We see that all our common nuts are green when on the tree, so as not easily to be distinguished from the leaves; but when ripe they turn brown, so that when they fall on to the ground they are equally indistinguishable among the dead leaves and twigs, or on the brown earth. Then they are almost always protected by hard coverings, as in hazel-nuts, which are concealed by the enlarged leafy <b>involucre,</b> and in the large tropical brazil-nuts and cocoa-nuts by such a hard and tough case as to be safe from almost every animal. Others have an external bitter rind, as in the walnut; while in the chestnuts and beech-nuts two or three fruits are enclosed in a prickly <b>involucre.</b>|$|E

Not that the spiral form actually adds to the strength of a Lombardic pillar, by imitating contortions of wood, any more than the fluting of a Doric shaft adds to its strength by imitating the canaliculation of a reed; but the perfect action of the imagination, which had adopted the encircling acanthus for the capital, adopted the twining stemma for the shaft; the pure delight of the eye being the first condition in either case: and it is inconceivable how much of the pleasure taken both in ornament and in natural form is founded elementarily on groups of spiral line.
