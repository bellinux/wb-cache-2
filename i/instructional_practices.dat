25|$|Project 720 was a {{high school}} reform program {{implemented}} for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth’s high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven <b>instructional</b> <b>practices</b> and {{to meet the needs of}} diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Lakeland School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $171,000 funding over three years. For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.|$|E

40|$|Educators, policy-makers, and {{researchers}} {{need to be}} able to assess the efficacy of specific interventions in schools and school Districts. While student achievement is unquestionably the bottom line, it is essential to open up the educational process so that each major factor influencing student achievement can be examined; indeed as a proverb often quoted in industrial quality control goes, “That which cannot be measured, cannot be improved”. <b>Instructional</b> <b>practice</b> is certainly a central factor: if student achievement is not improving, is it because <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> is not changing, or because changes in <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> are not affecting achievement? A tool is needed to provide snapshots of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> itself, before and after implementing new professional development or other interventions, and at other regular intervals to help monitor and focus efforts to improve <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> In this paper we review our research program building and piloting the Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA), a formal toolkit for rating instructional quality based primarily on classroom observation and student assignments. In the first part of the paper we review the need for, and some other efforts to provide, direct assessments of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> In the second part of this paper we briefly summarize the development of the IQA in reading comprehension and in mathematics at the elementary school level.

30|$|This {{research}} utilized a {{model for}} professional development {{that occurred in the}} classroom and involved collaboration with a reformed teaching coach, in this case a geoscience education graduate student. The model incorporates all three of the strategies that make up successful programs for changing <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> according to the NRC (2012): (1) sustained, focused efforts, (2) feedback on <b>instructional</b> <b>practice,</b> and (3) a deliberate focus on changing faculty conceptions about teaching and learning. The situated instructional coaching model tested was sustained, lasted an entire semester, and focused on revising a single course using a structured model (ICD model; Fink 2009). Second, providing feedback on <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> was possible by having a collaborator who assisted with the revisions and frequently attended class. Finally, the main objective of this research was to evaluate instructor M’s professional development as a teacher by supporting her change of teaching practice which served as a driver for changes to teaching beliefs.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{illustrates}} {{the case studies}} of three pre-service teachers and the interaction between their comprehension, confidence, and priorities of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> concerning fraction division. Though the participants matured {{in each of these}} three categories during an undergraduate mathematics course designed for future teachers, there are substantial differences between each person’s experiences and learning. This study finds a connection between a teacher’s confidence in the subject and their <b>instructional</b> <b>practice,</b> but does not show any relationship between comprehension of a subject and their perception of appropriate <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> or between comprehension and confidence. There are important implications of these finding concerning reform-based methods of teaching mathematics. Improving the instruction of mathematics for children is a common goal for researchers in mathematics education (Begle & Gibb, 1980, p. 3). Many researchers in mathematics education have proposed that certain styles of mathematics instruction may be more effective than others in terms of helping children learn in a classroom setting.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the interrelationship among student academic achievement, principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership style, parental involvement, school culture, student attendance, and teacher <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> of disadvantaged students in diverse elementary schools. This study examined principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership style, parental involvement, school culture, student attendance, and teacher <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> and how they affect student academic achievement. Overall, the study provided possible solutions to principals on ways to improve student academic achievement of disadvantaged students in diverse elementary schools. To make this study possible, the researcher developed and field-tested a questionnaire for administrators, teachers, and parents in order to measure the relationship among principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership style, parental involvement, school culture, attendance, and teacher <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> of disadvantaged students in six diverse elementary schools. Four statistical tests were performed and analyzed: A Pearson Correlation, t-test, factor analysis, and regression analysis. The findings of the study with respect to the Pearson Correlation Coefficient showed a significant relationship at the. 05 level with respect to the independent variables: principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership style, parental involvement, school culture, student attendance, teacher <b>instructional</b> <b>practice,</b> and the dependent variable, student academic achievement. The findings of the t-test showed a significant difference between school staff (administrators and teachers) and parents as it relates to school climate (principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership style, parental involvement, school culture, student attendance, teacher <b>instructional</b> <b>practice).</b> The data further showed that school staff (administrators and teachers) did not perceive parental involvement differently. The findings of the factor analysis showed the following variables were placed in the same factor as student academic achievement: school ranking, SES, and race. The following variables were placed together in Factor II: principals 2 ̆ 7 leadership style, parental involvement, school culture, student attendance, and teacher <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> The following variables were placed together in Factor III: gender and survey classification (administrator, teacher, and parent) :The results of the regression analysis showed that SES and school culture will contribute to the outcome (prediction) of student academic achievement, and student academic achievement and school culture will contribute to the outcome (prediction) of school ranking...|$|R

40|$|RESEARCHERS are {{interested}} in developing meth-ods to obtain better descriptions of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> on a large scale, {{for a number of}} reasons. First, research using value-added assessment me-thods suggests that some teachers are more effec-tive than other teachers (Ferguson & Ladd, 1996; Sanders & Rivers, 1996; Wright, Horn, & Sanders, 1997), although this research has not yet identi-fied the characteristics or practices that are asso-ciated with effectiveness. Second, many large-scale educational reforms, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) Systemic Initiatives, involve changes in instruction, {{and it is difficult to}} evaluate the progress of the reforms (e. g., the degree of implementation) without measures of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> Third, information about changes in practice is important in validating changes in test scores (Koretz, 2003). Fourth, with 101 increased demands for “highly qualified ” teachers, measures of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice</b> can inform im-provements in teacher education and professional development (King & Newmann, 2000). Despite the potential usefulness of objective measures of <b>instructional</b> <b>practice,</b> only recently have there been large-scale efforts to gather data about what actually transpires in classrooms (Mayer, 1999). Kennedy (1999) describes a con-tinuum for characterizing indicators of classroom processes in terms of their “distance ” from actual classroom events. Classroom observations (and by extension, video records of classrooms) are the most proximal indicators of instruction, pro-viding rich descriptions of activities that occur in the classroom. However, repeated classroom observations conducted over an extended period of time—which some might consider the “gol...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This {{dissertation}} takes a {{close look}} at how district-level instructional coaches support teachers in learning to shifting their <b>instructional</b> <b>practice,</b> related to the Next Generation Science Standards. This dissertation aims to address how re-structuring professional development to a job-embedded coaching model supports individual teacher learning of new reform-related <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> Implementing the NGSS is a problem of supporting professional learning {{in a way that will}} enable educators to make fundamental changes to their teaching practice. However, there are few examples in the literature that explain how coaches interact with teachers to improve teacher learning of reform-related <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> There are also few examples in the literature that specifically address how supporting teachers with extended professional learning opportunities, aligned with high-leverage practices, tools and curriculum, impacts how teachers make sense of new standards-based educational reforms and what manifests in classroom instruction. This dissertation proposes four conceptual categories of sense-making that influence how instructional coaches interpret the nature of reform, their roles and in instructional improvement and how to work with teachers. It is important to understand how coaches interpret reform because their interpretations may have unintended consequences related to privileging certain views about instruction, or establishing priorities for how to work with teachers. In this dissertation, we found that re-structuring professional development to a job-embedded coaching model supported teachers in learning new reform-related <b>instructional</b> <b>practice.</b> However, individual teacher interpretations of reform emerged and seemed to be linked to how instructional coaches supported teacher learning...|$|R
