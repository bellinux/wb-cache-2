40|$|There {{are about}} 11 million people above state pension age (60 for women, 65 for men), {{representing}} about 19 % of the UK population. The majority of pensioners are women, 63 %. Pension sources – state and private A longstanding {{policy has been}} to keep state pensions low (relative to international levels) and encourage saving through private (occupational or personal) pensions. Although most income is from state pensions, only those with substantial private pensions have a decent standard of living. Employees may {{opt out of the}} state second pension into a private pension. However access to a worthwhile private pension scheme is selective, depending on occupational status. The most generous occupational pension schemes (based on final salary and benefiting from employer contributions) are only available in large organizations, mainly public sector. The majority of occupational pensions are money purchase schemes with little or no contribution from the employer. Individual employees may instead contribute to a personal pension (including a stakeholder pension) but these also attract little or no employer contribution and also incur relatively high administrative and <b>investment</b> <b>charges</b> (up to 1. 5 % of the fund annually for a stakeholder pension). Both employer-sponsored money purchase schemes and personal pensions invest contributions in a fund and are therefore dependent on the performance of the stock market, exposing the employee to considerable risk of a lower than expected annuity. Thus, among those with private pension income, the amount depends on the type of scheme and timing of annuitisation as well as level and years of pension contributions. Less than half of women pensioners have any private pension, even after including widows ’ pensions, and women’s amounts are less than men’...|$|E

5000|$|There may be tax {{advantages}} {{obtained for the}} group if one member charges another member for services, even where the member bearing the charge derives no benefit. To combat this, the rules of most systems allow the tax authorities to challenge whether the services allegedly performed actually benefit the member charged. The inquiry may focus on whether services were indeed performed as well as who benefited from the services. [...] For this purpose, some rules differentiate stewardship services from other services. Stewardship services are generally those that an investor would incur for its own benefit in managing its <b>investments.</b> <b>Charges</b> to the investee for such services are generally inappropriate. Where services were not performed or where the related party bearing the charge derived no direct benefit, tax authorities may disallow the charge altogether.|$|R

The “Randomizer” program is written in the VB environment inside an Excel spreadsheet. The program determines the random effects of EPIC projects on the model’s parameters. Values for the effects on the parameters are drawn repeatedly from one of the few statistical or empirical distributions. Once a set of values are drawn for all the involved parameters, the modified RPS Calculator is run. The main modification is related to the demand responsiveness to electricity prices. Finally, changes in electricity prices, carbon emissions, and renewable portfolios from the base case (without EPIC projects) are reported as the outputs of the program. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{sovereign}} debt crises {{during the period}} 1993 - 2006 {{through the prism of}} the primary sovereign bond market. It finds that one cannot reject the hypothesis that investment banks price sovereign default risk well before crises emerge and well before investors do. <b>Investment</b> banks <b>charge</b> a much higher underwriting fee between three years and one year before a crisis than they do during tranquil periods. This result is statistically significant after controlling for sovereign bond spreads and other variables. Moreover, investment banks´ behavior differs {{depending on the type of}} debt crisis. Before crises, <b>investment</b> banks <b>charged</b> on average a higher underwriting fee to countries presenting bad fundamentals than to other {{sovereign debt}} crisis countries. Finally, underwriting fees can be used as early warning indicators of debt crises. These results show that underwriting fees provide valuable information. It is puzzling that investors do not use this potentially useful public information in order to allocate efficiently their portfolios of emerging market fixed-income assets. sovereign debt crises, primary bond market, underwriter spread, information...|$|R
