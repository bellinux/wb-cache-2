5|$|Foal: A {{horse of}} either sex {{less than one}} year old. A nursing foal is {{sometimes}} called a suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling. Most domesticated <b>foals</b> are weaned at five to seven months of age, although <b>foals</b> can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and <b>foals</b> are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. <b>Foals</b> are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. <b>Foals</b> are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E
5|$|Poco Pine's <b>foals</b> earned $14,794 in National Cutting Horse Association competition. He sired 37 AQHA Champions, 19 Superior Wester Pleasure Horses, 2 Superior Trail Horses, 15 Superior Halter Horses, 84 Performance Registers of Merit and 4 year end {{high point}} horses with the AQHA. He sired 19 <b>foals</b> crops, {{with a total}} of 464 <b>foals.</b> His son Poco Pecho was the sire of Pecho Dexter, who was {{inducted}} into the AQHA Hall of Fame. Another descendant inducted into the Hall of Fame was Zippo Pine Bar, who was out of a Poco Pine daughter.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the first}} {{postpartum}} heat, termed the <b>foal</b> heat, characteristics {{and performance in}} female donkey (jenny) of Martina Franca are described. To this end, the follicular development of 42 jennies during <b>foal</b> heat was {{compared with that of}} 31 jennies at the third estrus after <b>foaling.</b> Estrus length (7. 1 ± 0. 9 and 6. 8 ± 0. 7 days), follicular development and preovulatory follicle size (43. 7 ± 3. 5 and 45. 1 ± 2. 5 mm) were similar between jennies during the <b>foal</b> heat and during the third estrus after <b>foaling.</b> The pregnancy rate at day 14 was significantly lower in the <b>foal</b> heat jennies (57. 1 %) than the third estrus jennies (82. 3 %). However, the pregnancy rate at day 14 in <b>foal</b> heat jennies increased significantly when the onset of <b>foal</b> heat was ≥ 8 days after <b>foaling</b> (93. 8 %) or when the ovulation happened ≥ 12 days after <b>foaling</b> (85. 7 %). The data provided in the present study suggest that the <b>foal</b> heat in the endangered jennies of Martina Franca could be successfully utilized to reduce the interpartum period if the onset of <b>foal</b> heat occurs > 8 days after <b>foaling...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected <b>foals</b> are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. <b>Foals</b> with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in <b>foals.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. <b>Foals</b> of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa <b>foals</b> do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{has very}} low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new <b>foals</b> {{registered}} with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were covered, with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year. Over the past decade, {{the highest number of}} <b>foals</b> registered was 113 in 2008, and between 80 and 90 <b>foals</b> were registered in the other years. The majority of breeding farms are located in the Poitou area, including Vendée (especially around Fontenay-le-Comte and Luçon), Deux-Sèvres (especially near Melle), Vienna and Civray, and some in Charente, near Ruffec. There are National Studs located in Saintes and Vendée. There are a few breeders in Maine-et-Loire.|$|E

2500|$|Most mares <b>foal</b> {{at night}} or early in the morning, and prefer to give birth alone when possible. [...] Labor is rapid, often no more than 30 minutes, and {{from the time the}} feet of the <b>foal</b> appear to full {{delivery}} is often only about 15 to 20 minutes. Once the <b>foal</b> is born, the mare will lick the newborn <b>foal</b> to clean it and help blood circulation. In a very short time, the <b>foal</b> will attempt to stand and get milk from its mother. A <b>foal</b> should stand and nurse within the first hour of life.|$|R

5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected <b>foals</b> {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. <b>Foals</b> with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E

This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two purebred <b>foals</b> in New England, was sold to the remount, shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire. *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but that group of <b>foals</b> included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.|$|E
5|$|Orme was a bay colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands {{high and}} had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's first crop of <b>foals.</b> By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been {{exported}} to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few <b>foals</b> most years. However, he did also sire Goldfinch, a horse that was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.|$|E

5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such <b>foals</b> are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some <b>foals</b> having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because they are so accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|Chicado V started {{only six}} times because knee {{problems}} cut short her racing career. However, she won her first two starts while breaking or equaling track records, {{and was given}} the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1952. The next year she ran her last four races, winning once and setting one more speed record. After her last race, in , she was retired from the track to become a broodmare, and had nine <b>foals.</b> Two of her offspring were named Champion Quarter Running Horses, and all her <b>foals</b> had a total of seven stakes race wins. One of her daughters, Table Tennis, {{went on to become}} a noted broodmare herself, as did Table Tennis' daughter Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks. However, three of ChicadoV's sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—were her best known offspring; all three became leading sires and are the main cause of her fame. She was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base-narrow, {{where the}} legs are farther apart or closer {{together}} on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with the feet. Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as <b>foals</b> with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. <b>Foals</b> raised by humans {{have a better chance}} for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation problems can be transmitted to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock.|$|E
