25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantity</b> (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E

40|$|Models of {{inventory}} management contain different parameters. An issue is observable {{in the classical}} models which {{can be related to}} the determination of the <b>quantity</b> of the <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> and the <b>quantity</b> of the economic production. In these models, the parameters like setup and holding costs and also the rate of demands are fixed. This matter causes the <b>quantity</b> of the <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> in classic model to have some differences in comparison with the real-world conditions. It should be stated that holding cost of spoiled and useless products is not always fixed and so the costs increase by passing the time. This paper is an attempt to develop classical EOQ models by considering holding cost as an increasing function of the ordering cycle length. So the classical EOQ models are developed, and the related optimum <b>quantity</b> to the <b>ordering</b> cycle length, <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>quantity,</b> and the optimum total cost are determined...|$|R

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have developed various <b>economic</b> <b>ordering</b> <b>quantity</b> models by assuming an infinite time horizon and constant demand rate. However due to rapid technological advancement, shorter {{product life cycle}} and severe competition, those assumptions are no longer realistic. In this paper, we complement that shortcoming by considering an inventory model that satisfies a continuous time-varying demand rate for a finite time horizon when trade credit period and unit cash discount are allowed. The time horizon consists of n different cycles with equal or different cycles length. The trade credit period {{was assumed to be}} proportional to the cycle length.

Due to complexity of the models, simulation and Genetic Algorithm are used to solve the models. We then verify the models using a numerical example and sensitivity analysis.

This model was introduced supposing the limited production rate, the demand without waiting time, and the integrated production and inventory for perishable goods (Moon et al. 2005). Rau et al.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis project identifies current sources of cost savings and cost avoidance generated through Army foreign military sales (FMS). Using a comparative high-low case-study approach, a high-demand volume case and a low-demand volume case were selected in major weapons categories. The cases were analyzed on an internal basis to determine cost savings, cost avoidance, and public value. Once the cases were analyzed and compared against each other, advantages or trends in cost savings, cost avoidance, and public value became apparent. Upon completion of our analysis, we determined that cost savings were usually gained from reduced system unit costs due to higher <b>economic</b> <b>order</b> <b>quantities,</b> reduced overhead costs per unit, and reduced unit costs resulting from manufacturing learning curves. Additional costs were avoided by reducing gaps in production lines.

Additional numerical experiments are performed that show how the purchase cost must be decreased to allow a firm to maintain constant pricing and profit when lead times increase.
