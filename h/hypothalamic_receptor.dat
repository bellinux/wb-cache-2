Polymorphisms within the gene encoding for the melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC 4 R), a <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptor</b> with the primary function of regulating food intake, are a significant cause of severe human obesity. Studies have shown a correlation between the degree of MC 4 R dysfunction and the severity and age of onset of obesity. The accepted mode of inheritance for MC 4 R mutations is co-dominance with modulation of penetrance and expressivity, which would explain why homozygous carriers are more obese than heterozygotes. MC 4 R mutation frequency is also dependent on the ethnicity of the population. The use of genetic markers for diagnostic strategies and as predictors of therapeutic outcome will be of importance in the future management of obesity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Leptin is an adipocyte-derived {{hormone that}} acts via its <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptor</b> (LEPRb) to {{regulate}} energy balance. A downstream effect {{essential for the}} weight-regulatory action of leptin is the phosphorylation and activation of the latent transcription factor STAT 3 by LEPRb-associated Janus kinases (JAKs).

Here we have studied {{the roles of the}} intracellular tyrosine residues in the negative feedback regulation of LEPRb-signaling under chronic leptin stimulation. Results: Mutational analysis showed that the presence of either Tyr 985 and Tyr 1077 in the intracellular domain of LEPRb was sufficient for the attenuation of STAT 3 phosphorylation, whereas mutation of both tyrosines rendered LEPRb resistant to feedback regulation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} 10 {{peptides}} structurally {{related to the}} growth hormone (GH) releasing peptide hexarelin, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), on penile erection was studied in male rats. Six out of the 10 peptides tested induced penile erection in a dose-dependent manner. Among them, the most potent were EP 80661, EP 60761 and EP 91072, which were active at doses of 20 - 200 ng. The potency of these peptides in inducing penile erection is {{comparable to that of}} apomorphine, oxytocin and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid similarly injected into the PVN. Other peptides found active were EP 50885, EP 90101 and EP 91071, which induced penile erection at doses of zoo - 2000 ng. In contrast, EP 51322, EP 70555, EP 51216 and EP 91073 were inactive, as were hexarelin, EP 40904 and EP 40737 in a previous study. The majority of EP peptides found active when injected into the PVN induced penile erection, although to a lesser extent, also when given systemically (endovenously). The proerectile effect of EP peptides was prevented by the oxytocin receptor antagonist [d(CH 2) (5) Tyr(Me) (2) -Orn(8) ]-vasotocin given into the lateral ventricles but not into the PVN, by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N-G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester given either into the lateral ventricles or into the PVN, by the N-type Ca 2 + channel blocker omega -conotoxin GVIA and by morphine, but not by the dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol or by the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist dizolcipine, given into the PVN. As the structure - activity relationship of EP peptides for proerectile activity is different from those of other biological actions of these compounds, ie for GH release and eating behaviour, the present results suggest that EP peptides induce penile erection by acting on specific <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptor</b> sites that activate paraventricular oxytocinergic neurons projecting to extrahypothalamic brain areas that mediate this sexual function by a mechanism similar to that of dopamine receptor agonists, oxytocin and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid...|$|E
40|$|ASSOCIATION OF THE 5 -HTTLPR WITHPROLACTIN RESPONSE TO CITALOPRAMIN A COMMUNITY POPULATIONEloise Peet, BSUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2004 The {{serotonin}} transporter (5 -HTT) {{is a key}} mechanism regulating {{magnitude and}} duration of serotonergic transmission in the central nervous system, and {{is the site of}} action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) used for treating psychiatric conditions. Variation in treatment response to SSRIs has been correlated with a common bi-allelic length polymorphism in the 5 -HTT-promoter region (5 -HTTLPR), known to modulate transcriptional efficiency of the 5 -HTT gene in vitro. The alleles, designated long (l) or short (s), result in one of three possible genotypes: l/l, l/s, or s/s. The (s) allele has been hypothesized to have a dominant functional effect, and has been associated with decreased transporter transcription efficiency and poorer therapeutic response to antidepressants. Acute transporter blockade with SSRIs rapidly increases central nervous system serotonin levels, leading to <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptor</b> stimulation and the release of several hormones, including prolactin. The specific aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the prolactin response to acute 5 -HTT-reuptake blockade according to 5 -HTTLPR genotype, to further elucidate the effect of this polymorphism on serotonin transporter function in vivo. This study has been designed to test the hypothesis that, when compared to subjects with the l/l genotype, subjects with either the s/l or s/s genotype will experience a blunted prolactin response following acute administration of the highly selective reuptake inhibitor Citalopram. To accomplish this goal, a cohort of 206 community volunteers were intravenously administered a weight-adjusted dose of Citalopram. Each subject was genotyped for the 5 -HTTLPR, and blood samples were obtained for prolactin and Citalopram levels immediately before and at regular intervals for 2. 5 hours after the Citalopram injection. Results: Citalopram-induced prolactin response, reported as prolactin area under the curve (PRL AUC), was significantly associated with 5 -HTTLPR (F = 3. 08, p = 0. 048). Among individuals with the s/s genotype, PRL AUC response (M±SD: 84. 2 ± 51. 8 ng/ml * 150 min) was significantly lower (p = 0. 014) than the l/l group (246. 0 ± 40. 2 ng/ml * 150 min). The difference in PRL AUC between subjects with the l/l genotype and the l/s group (172. 5 ± 41. 3 ng/ml * 150 min) was not significant (p = 0. 21); the difference in PRL AUC between subjects with the l/s genotype and the s/s group also was not significant (p = 0. 23). When results were analyzed as the maximum change in prolactin, the Citalopram-induced PRL MAX was similarly associated with 5 -HTTLPR (p = 0. 034). Conclusions: Subjects with the 5 -HTTLPR s/s genotype exhibit significantly lower prolactin response in response to the SSRI Citalopram than subjects carrying two copies of the l allele. The s allele does not have a dominant effect on the prolactin response to Citalopram in a non-patient population...|$|E

40|$|Treatment {{with second}} {{generation}} antipsychotics (SGAs), notably olanzapine and clozapine, causes severe obesity side effects. Antagonism of histamine H 1 receptors {{has been identified}} as a main cause of SGA-induced obesity, but the molecular mechanisms associated with this antagonism in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain remain unclear. This review aims to explore the potential role of hypothalamic histamine H 1 receptors in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain/obesity and the molecular pathways related to SGA-induced antagonism of these receptors. Initial data have demonstrated the importance of <b>hypothalamic</b> H 1 <b>receptors</b> in both short- and long-term SGA-induced obesity. Blocking <b>hypothalamic</b> H 1 <b>receptors</b> by SGAs activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a well-known feeding regulator. During short-term treatment, <b>hypothalamic</b> H 1 <b>receptor</b> antagonism by SGAs may activate the AMPK—carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 signaling to rapidly increase caloric intake and result in weight gain. During long-term SGA treatment, <b>hypothalamic</b> H 1 <b>receptor</b> antagonism can reduce thermogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the sympathetic outflows to the brainstem rostral raphe pallidus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, therefore decreasing brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Additionally, blocking of <b>hypothalamic</b> H 1 <b>receptors</b> by SGAs may also contribute to fat accumulation by decreasing lipolysis but increasing lipogenesis in white adipose tissue. In summary, antagonism of <b>hypothalamic</b> H 1 <b>receptors</b> by SGAs may time-dependently affect the hypothalamus-brainstem circuits to cause weight gain by stimulating appetite and fat accumulation but reducing energy expenditure. The H 1 receptor and its downstream signaling molecules could be valuable targets for the design of new compounds for treating SGA-induced weight gain/obesity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe fat-derived hormone leptin binds to its <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors</b> to {{regulate}} glucose homeostasis. Leptin is also synthesized {{in the stomach}} and subsequently binds to its receptors expressed in the intestine, although the functional relevance of such activation remains largely unknown. We report here that intrajejunal leptin administration activates jejunal leptin receptors and signals through a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -dependent and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) -independent signaling pathway to lower glucose production in healthy rodents. Jejunal leptin action is sufficient to lower glucose production in uncontrolled diabetic and high-fat-fed rodents and contributes to the early antidiabetic effect of duodenal-jejunal bypass surgery. These data unveil a glucoregulatory site of leptin action and suggest that enhancing leptin-PI 3 K signaling in the jejunum lowers plasma glucose concentrations in diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Leptin is {{well known}} to be {{involved}} in the inhibition of feeding, thermogenesis, reproduction and neuroendocrine functions through its actions on the rodent <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Leptin facilitated the presynaptic transmitter release and postsynaptic sensitivity to the transmitters in the hippocampal CA 1 neurons. Thus longterm potentiation （LTP） and the phosphorylation of Ca 2 +/calmodulin protein kinase II （CaMK II） were facilitated in the CA 1 neurons. Therefore behavioral performance related to spatial learning and memory was improved by leptin in vivo applications. Orexin-A produced by glucose-sensitive neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area （LHA） and released during food intake facilitates feeding. Orexin-A suppressed LTP and CaMK II phosphorylation without affecting the presynaptic transmitter release. Therefore behavioral performance on learning and memory was impaired.

40|$|Viruses can induce {{progressive}} {{neurologic disorders}} associated with diverse pathological manifestations, and therefore, viral {{infection of the}} brain can impair differentiated neural functions, depending on the initial viral tropism. We have previously reported that canine distemper virus (CDV) targets certain mouse brain structures, including the hypothalamus, early and selectively. Infected mice exhibit acute encephalitis, with late disease, characterized by motor impairment or obesity syndrome, appearing {{in some of the}} surviving mice several months after the initial viral replication. In the present study, we show viral persistence in the hypothalami of obese mice, as demonstrated by low, but still significant, levels of CDV nucleoprotein transcripts, associated with a dramatic decrease in F gene mRNAs. Given the pivotal role of the hypothalamus in obesity (eating behavior, energy consumption, and neuroendocrine function) and that of leptin, the adipose tissue-derived satiety factor acting through <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors,</b> we analyzed the leptin networks in both obese and nonobese mice. The discrepancy found between the chronic and dramatic increase in blood leptin levels and the occurrence of obesity may be due to leptin resistance in the brain. In fact, expression of the long leptin receptor isoform, representing the functional leptin receptor, was specifically downregulated in the hypothalami of obese mice, explaining their inability to generate an adequate response to leptin in the brain. Intriguingly, during the acute phase of infection, its expression was increased in CDV-targeted structures in all infected mice and remained high in obese mice in all CDV-targeted structures, except for the hypothalamus.

40|$|Leptin is {{currently}} believed to control body composition largely, if not entirely, via <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors</b> that regulate food intake and thermogenesis. Here we demonstrate direct extraneural effects of leptin to deplete fat content of both adipocytes and nonadipocytes to levels far below those of pairfed controls. In cultured pancreatic islets, leptin lowered triglyceride (TG) content by preventing TG formation from {{free fatty acids}} (FFA) and by increasing FFA oxidation. In vivo hyperleptinemia, induced in normal rats by adenovirus gene transfer, depleted TG content in liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas without increasing plasma FFA or ketones, suggesting intracellular oxidation. In islets of obese Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats with leptin receptor mutations, leptin had no effect in vivo or in vitro. The TG content was ≈ 20 times normal, and esterification capacity was increased 3 - to 4 -fold. Thus, in rats with normal leptin receptors but not in Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats, nonadipocytes and adipocytes esterify FFA, store them as TG, and later oxidize them intracellularly via an “indirect pathway” of intracellular fatty acid metabolism controlled by leptin. By maintaining insulin sensitivity and preventing islet lipotoxicity, this activity of leptin may prevent adipogenic diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Leptin and insulin {{have been}} {{identified}} as fuel sensors acting in part through their <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors</b> to inhibit food intake and stimulate energy expenditure. As their intracellular signaling converges at the PI 3 K pathway, we directly addressed the role of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate-mediated (PIP 3 -mediated) signals in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons by inactivating the gene for the PIP 3 phosphatase Pten specifically in this cell type. Here we show that POMC-specific disruption of Pten resulted in hyperphagia and sexually dimorphic diet-sensitive obesity. Although leptin potently stimulated Stat 3 phosphorylation in POMC neurons of POMC cell-restricted Pten knockout (PPKO) mice, it failed to significantly inhibit food intake in vivo. POMC neurons of PPKO mice showed a marked hyperpolarization and a reduction in basal firing rate due to increased ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activity. Leptin was not able to elicit electrical activity in PPKO POMC neurons, but application of the PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002 and the KATP blocker tolbutamide restored electrical activity and leptin-evoked firing of POMC neurons in these mice. Moreover, icv administration of tolbutamide abolished hyperphagia in PPKO mice. These data indicate that PIP 3 -mediated signals are critical regulators of the melanocortin system via modulation of KATP channels...|$|R
40|$|THE GASTROINTESTINAL {{polypeptide}} hormones gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) {{are related}} peptides that {{share the same}} C-terminal sequence that carries the biological message. Eating a meal stimulates gastrin secretion from G cells in the antral part of the stomach (1) and CCK secretion from duodenal I cells (2 – 5). Both peptides activate the gastrin/CCK-B receptor, whereas only CCK activates the CCK-A receptor (6). In 1973, Gibbs and co-workers first reported that CCK, a brain-gut peptide (7, 8), suppressed food intake in rats, with the animals exhibiting the entire normal behavioral sequence of satiety (9). Further studies were also consistent with a physiological role for peripheral CCK in short term regulation of food intake (for review, see. Ref. 10). The effect is initiated by feeding, triggered by signals originating from the gastrointestinal tract and mediated by the vagus nerve (11, 12). Leptin, {{the product of the}} ob gene, was identified as an adipocyte-secreted protein (13). It is secreted into the blood by fat tissue to inform the brain about the adipocyte mass and thereby control appetite and body weight homeostasis (14 – 16). In contrast to that of CCK, the satiety effect induced by circulating leptin is only effective in the long term.

METHODS: From the age of 13 to 18 weeks, three groups of 20 animals were fed an average dose of 3. 5 + 0. 03 mg/ kg body weight (BW) haloperidol; 30. 6 + 0. 22 mg/kg BW clozapine; or 14. 9 + 0. 13 mg/kg BW ziprasidone in ground food pellets containing 15 % fat. Twenty control animals received no drugs. Blood samples were taken at week 14, 16, and 19. Locomotor activity and exploratory behavior were measured using the alcove test at weeks 15 and 17. The expression of the <b>hypothalamic</b> leptin <b>receptor</b> in rat brains was determined by using a Western blot. RESULTS: Rats medicated with haloperidol and ziprasidone showed a significantly decreased percentage weight gain and food consumption.

40|$|Objective: Leptin, {{the obese}} gene product, {{is thought to}} {{regulate}} body fat through its action on <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors</b> that influence satiety. The hormonal regulation of leptin is important, since it might affect adiposity. Leptin regulation in man is poorly understood. We studied the relation between endogenous cortisol and leptin levels {{as well as the}} acute and chronic effects of a low dose of dexamethasone (DEX) on plasma leptin levels in healthy male volunteers. Subjects and experimental protocol: The correlation between basal plasma levels of leptin and cortisol and the chronic effect of DEX treatment were studied in 12 subjects. Plasma leptin and cortisol levels were determined every other hour for 24 h, before and after 2 weeks of oral administration of 0. 1 mg DEX twice daily. The acute effect was studied in 20 subjects, who received 1 mg DEX at 2300 h. Fasting blood samples were taken at 0800 h on the same day (i. e. before DEX) and on the day after. Results: Under basal conditions, we found a correlation between mean plasma levels of leptin and cortisol (r 0. 7, P < 0. 02). Mean plasma leptin levels had increased by 50 % after 2 weeks of DEX treatment (P < 0. 05). The circadian rhythm of leptin was preserved, but the night peak occurred 2. 5 h earlier (P < 0. 05). Fasting plasma leptin levels were 20 % higher 9 h after 1 mg DEX orally than at the same time on the day before (P < 0. 002). Conclusion: Physiological variations in cortisol are involved in the regulation of leptin. European Journal of Endocrinology 139 615 – 62...|$|R
40|$|Interaction and {{cross-talk}} of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are {{of considerable}} interest because {{an increasing number}} of examples implicate a profound functional and physiological relevance of homo-or hetero-oligomeric GPCRs. The ghrelin (growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)) and melanocortin- 3 (MC 3 R) receptors are both known to have orexigenic effects on the hypothalamic control of body weight. Because in vitro studies indicate heterodimerization of GHSR and MC 3 R, we investigated their functional interplay. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry indicated {{that the vast majority of}} GHSR-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus also express MC 3 R. In vitro coexpression of MC 3 R and GHSR promoted enhanced melanocortin-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation compared with activation of MC 3 R in the absence of GHSR. In contrast, agonist-independent basal signaling activity and ghrelin-induced signaling of GHSR were impaired, most likely due to interaction with MC 3 R. By taking advantage of naturally occurring GHSR mutations and an inverse agonist for GHSR, we demonstrate that the observed enhanced MC 3 R signaling capability depends directly on the basal activity of GHSR. In conclusion, we demonstrate a paradigm-shifting example of GPCR heterodimerization allowing for mutually opposite functional influence of two <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors</b> controlling body weight. We found that the agonistin dependent active conformation of one GPCR can determine the signaling modalities of another receptor in a heterodimer. Our discovery also implies that mutations within one of two interacting receptors might affect both receptors and different pathways simultaneously. These findings uncover mechanisms of important relevance for pharmacological targeting of GPCR in general and hypothalamic body weight regulation in particula...|$|R
40|$|Endocannabinoids such as {{anandamide}} [N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) ] and 2 -arachidonoyl glycerol (2 -AG) {{are known}} orexigenic mediators that act via CB 1 receptors in hypothalamus and limbic forebrain to induce appetite and stimulate food intake. Circulating endocannabinoid levels inversely correlate with plasma levels of leptin, an anorexigenic mediator that reduces food intake by acting on <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors.</b> Recently, taste {{has been found}} to be a peripheral target of leptin. Leptin selectively suppresses sweet taste responses in wild-type mice but not in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice. Here, we show that endocannabinoids oppose the action of leptin to act as enhancers of sweet taste. We found that administration of AEA or 2 -AG increases gustatory nerve responses to sweeteners in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting responses to salty, sour, bitter, and umami compounds. The cannabinoids increase behavioral responses to sweet-bitter mixtures and electrophysiological responses of taste receptor cells to sweet compounds. Mice genetically lacking CB 1 receptors show no enhancement by endocannnabinoids of sweet taste responses at cellular, nerve, or behavioral levels. In addition, the effects of endocannabinoids on sweet taste responses of taste cells are diminished by AM 251, a CB 1 receptor antagonist, but not by AM 630, a CB 2 receptor antagonist. Immunohistochemistry shows that CB 1 receptors are expressed in type II taste cells that also express the T 1 r 3 sweet taste receptor component. Taken together, these observations suggest that the taste organ is a peripheral target of endocannabinoids. Reciprocal regulation of peripheral sweet taste reception by endocannabinoids and leptin may contribute to their opposing actions on food intake and play an important role in regulating energy homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is {{processed}} in an intracellular secretory pathway, primarily to enable release of ACTH from the pituitary and �-MSH from hypothalamic neurons and skin. However, processing is incomplete and unprocessed POMC is secreted {{from all three}} tissues. This review considers intracellular processing of neuronal POMC as a key checkpoint that controls flux through <b>hypothalamic</b> melanocortin <b>receptor</b> pathways. Regulation of the convertase, proprotein convertase (PC) - 1 / 3, which cleaves POMC is likely {{to determine the extent}} of POMC processing. Reduced PC 1 / 3 activity, in both humans and rodents, leads to reduced melanocortin signaling and hence obesity. In contrast to POMC, posttranslational processing of proagouti-related peptide, an endogenous melanocortin- 4 receptor antagonist, is efficient and is unlikely to represent a regulatory checkpoint. Because POM...|$|R
40|$|Although {{obesity is}} {{associated}} with a state of leptin resistance, {{it has been suggested that}} leptin may contribute to the patho-genesis of obesity-related hypertension. In previous studies, we reported that cafeteria diet feeding induces hyperleptinae-mia and hyperinsulinemia in both male and female rats, with hypertension occurring only in male rats. However, when fe-male rats were neonatally treated with testosterone (T), these animals develop hypertension when fed the cafeteria diet. These observations led us to investigate leptin signaling and some neuropeptides that are leptin targets in the hypothalamus of male, intact female, and T-treated female cafeteria diet-fed rats. A decrease in the <b>hypothalamic</b> leptin <b>receptors</b> (Ob-Ra and Ob-Rb) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was ob-served only in male hypertensive cafeteria diet-fed rats. Al...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to figure out the effect of {{ovulation}} induction on the levels of TNF-α and IL- 1 ß, and to investigate the possible interaction between the cytokines and hormones in respect to anovulation. Methods The study comprised of 53 women; 33 sub-fertile and 20 fertile. Their ages ranged from 17 – 39 years. The anovulation in the subfertile group were diagnosed based on the standard criteria (clinical and laboratory investigations). All patients were scheduled for the induction of ovulation by treatment with clomiphene citrate. The blood samples have been drawn on the 2 nd day of the menstrual cycle. The hormones and cytokines were measured. 2 – 4 weeks after commencing the treatment with clomiphene citrate (clomiphene, a nonsteroidal compound, structurally similar to oestrogen, blocks oestrogenic <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>receptors,</b> resulting in blinding of the hypothalamus– pituitary axis to endogenous circulating oestrogen), the second sample of blood was drawn again to re-measure the levels of the same cytokines measured before the treatment. By SPSS software for windows, version 20, IBM, US, 2010, data of all participants have been entered, descriptive data analysis, paired sample T test, one way ANOVA test and person’s correlations have been used as appropriate. Results In this study, the levels of TNF-α and IL- 1 ß before treatment were lower than those in after treatment; however, these differences were significant only in case of TNF-α (P = 0. 041). These results indicate that clomiphene citrate has a specific effect on TNF-α expression and to a lesser extent on other cytokines. Conclusion The results of this study may implicate a direct role of TNF-α in the fertility and, thus, could raise questions about the possibility of using immune modulation in the treatment of sub-fertility...|$|R
