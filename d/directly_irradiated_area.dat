40|$|DNA damage (caused {{by direct}} {{cellular}} exposure and bystander signaling) and the complex pathways involved in its repair are critical events underpinning cellular and tissue response following radiation exposures. There are limited data addressing {{the dynamics of}} DNA damage induction and repair in the skin particularly in areas not directly exposed. Here we investigate the mechanisms regulating DNA damage, repair, intracellular signalling {{and their impact on}} premature differentiation and development of inflammatory-like response in the <b>irradiated</b> and surrounding <b>areas</b> of a 3 D organotypic skin model. Following localized low-LET irradiation (225 kVp X-rays), low levels of 53 BP 1 foci were observed in the 3 D model (3. 8 ± 0. 28 foci/Gy/cell) with foci persisting and increasing in size up to 48 h post irradiation. In contrast, in cell monolayers 14. 2 ± 0. 6 foci/Gy/cell and biphasic repair kinetics with repair completed before 24 h was observed. These differences are linked to differences in cellular status with variable level of p 21 driving apoptotic signalling in 2 D and accelerated differentiation in both the <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> and bystander <b>areas</b> of the 3 D model. The signalling pathways utilized by irradiated keratinocytes to induce DNA damage in non-exposed areas of the skin involved the NF-κB transcription factor and its downstream target COX- 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{elucidate}} the mechanisms of the signal transmission for radiation-induced bystander response. The NF-κB-dependent gene expression of IL 8, IL 6, PTGS 2 /COX 2, TNF and IL 33 in <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> human skin fibroblasts produced the cytokines and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) with autocrine/paracrine functions, which further activated signaling pathways and induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression in bystander cells. As a result, bystander cells also started expression and production of interleukin- 8, interleukin- 6, COX- 2 -generated PGE 2 and interleukin- 33 (IL- 33) followed by autocrine/paracrine stimulation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. A blockage of IL- 33 transmitting functions with anti-IL- 33 monoclonal antibody added into the culture media decreased NF-κB activation in <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> and bystander cells. On the other hand, the IGF- 1 -Receptor kinase regulated the PI 3 K–AKT pathway in both <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> and bystander fibroblasts. A pronounced and prolonged increase in AKT activity after irradiation was a characteristic feature of bystander cells. AKT positively regulated IL- 33 protein expression levels. Suppression of the IGF-R 1 –AKT–IL- 33 pathway substantially increased radiation-induced or TRAIL-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. Taken together, our results demonstrated the early activation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression first in <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> and then bystander fibroblasts, the further modulation of critical proteins, including IL- 33, by AKT in bystander cells and late drastic changes in cell survival and in enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis after suppression of the IGF- 1 R–AKT–IL- 33 signaling cascade in both <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> and bystander cells...|$|R
30|$|In summary, RAAS {{has a high}} local {{recurrence}} rate even if {{the surgical}} margin was negative, because it spreads throughout the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> In the current case, the patient had repeated local recurrences of RAAS that arose in the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> on three successive occasions.

40|$|Abstract. Ternary lyotropic {{liquid crystal}} (LLC), was {{prepared}} by mixing tetradecyltrimethylamonium bromide (MTAB), water and azobenzene (Az). The phase transition of the LLC was induced from LC phase to isotropic (I) one upon Ar+ laser, which was {{owing to the}} trans-cis-trans phoisomerizaion cycle of Az during the irradiation. After that, the LC phase gradually recovered from I phase to nematic (N) phase when being exposed to dark condition. It was also suggested that the recovery time from I to N was different with the Az structures, temperature and ratio of MTAB/Az in the ternary system.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare levels of apoptosis, necrosis, mitotic cell death and {{senescence}} after treatment with both direct radiation and irradiated cell conditioned medium. Materials and methods: Human keratinocytes (HaCaT cell line) were irradiated (0. 005, 0. 05 and 0. 5 Gy) using a cobalt 60 teletherapy unit. For bystander experiments, the medium was harvested from donor HaCaT cells one hour after irradiation and transferred to recipient HaCaT cells.

Early apoptosis and necrosis was observed predominantly after direct irradiation. An increase in the number of cells in G 2 /M phase was observed at 6 and 12 hours which led to mitotic cell death after 72 hours following direct irradiation and ICCM treatment.

Limestone calcination-carbonation is an appealing reaction for thermochemical storage applications due to the cheapness of the raw material, and the interesting value of the reaction enthalpy at fairly high process temperatures. Moreover, limestone calcination-carbonation is intensively studied in Calcium Looping (CaL) application for post combustion CO 2 capture and sequestration. In this work, the dynamics of a <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> 0. 1 m ID {{fluidized bed}} reactor exposed to a 12 kWel simulated solar furnace is analyzed with specific reference to temperature distribution at the surface and in the bulk of the bed.

In this retrospective study, 76 women with RAAS were enrolled and randomized into two groups, the “radical group” and a “conservative group.” The “radical” resection was defined as resection of all the previously <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> plus mastectomy. Consequently, the “conservative group” was defined as standard resection such as mastectomy or tumorectomy without total resection of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> The radical surgery group had a lower 5 -year cumulative local recurrence incidence compared to the conservative surgery group (23 % vs. 76 %, P[*]<[*] 0.001) and distant metastasis incidence (18 % vs. 47 %, P[*]=[*] 0.02). Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) for the radical group was much higher than that for the conservative group (86 % vs. 46 %, P[*]<[*] 0.001). In addition, patients who underwent conservative surgery with negative margins had a worse DSS than those in the radical group [15].

It is further noted that single-pulse irradiation with fluence ranging from 400 to 1200 mJ/cm 2 gave rise to protrusion of the irradiated surface above the original surface, which is in contrast to usual expectation that irradiated surface is below the unirradiated surface. The surface protrusion is mainly attributed to the effect of surface tension.

40|$|Radiation-induced {{bystander}} effects {{refer to}} the induction of biological changes in cells not directly hit by radiation implying {{that the number of}} cells affected by radiation is larger than the actual number of irradiated cells. Recent in vitro studies suggest the role of extracellular vesicles (EV) in mediating radiation-induced bystander signals but in vivo investigations are still lacking. Here we report an in vivo study investigating the role of EVs in mediating radiation effects. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were total-body irradiated with X-rays (0. 1, 0. 25, 2 Gy), 24 hours later EVs were isolated from the bone marrow and were intravenously injected into unirradiated (so-called bystander) animals. EV-induced systemic effects were compared to radiation effects in the <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> animals. Similarly to direct radiation EVs from irradiated mice induced complex DNA damage in EV-recipient animals, manifested in an increased level of chromosomal aberrations and the activation of the DNA damage response. However, while DNA damage after direct irradiation increased with the dose, EV-induced effects peaked at lower doses. A significantly reduced hematopoietic stem cell pool in the BM as well as CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocyte pool in the spleen was detected in mice injected with EVs isolated from animals irradiated with 2 Gy. These EV-induced alterations were comparable to changes present in the <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> mice. The pool of TLR 4 -expressing dendritic cells was different in the <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> mice, where it increased after 2 Gy and in the EV-recipient animals, where it strongly decreased in a dose-independent manner.

Over the years, a number of non-targeted or epigenetic effects of radiation exposure have been reported where genetic damage occurs in cells that are not <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> but respond to signals transmitted from irradiated cells, a phenomenon termed the “bystander effects”. AimWe compared the direct and bystander responses of human A 549, BEAS- 2 -B and NHDF cell lines exposed to both photon (6 MV) and electron (22 MeV) radiation inside a water phantom. The cultures were <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> or exposed to scattered radiation 4 cm outside the field. In parallel, non-irradiated cells (termed bystander cells) were incubated in ICM (irradiation conditioned medium) collected from another pool of irradiated cells (termed donor cells). Materials and methodsIn <b>directly</b> <b>irradiated</b> cells as well as ICM-treated cells, the frequency of micronuclei and condensation of chromatin characteristic for the apoptotic process were estimated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test. ResultsIn all tested cell lines, radiation induced apoptosis and formation of micronuclei. A 549 and BEAS- 2 B cells cultured in ICM showed increased levels of micronuclei and apoptosis, whereas normal human fibroblasts (NHDF line) were resistant to bystander response. In A 549 and BEAS- 2 B cells placed outside the radiation field and exposed to scattered radiation the formation of micronuclei and induction of apoptosis were similar to that after ICM-treatment. ConclusionResults suggest that the genetic damage in cells exposed to scattered radiation is caused by factors released by irradiated cells into the medium rather than by DNA damage induced directly by X rays.
