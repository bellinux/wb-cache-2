50|$|The {{seismic hazard}} from induced {{seismicity}} {{can be assessed}} using similar techniques as for natural seismicity, although accounting for non-stationary seismicity. Subsequently, a risk assessment can be performed, taking account of the seismic hazard and {{the vulnerability of the}} exposed <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> (e.g. local population and the building stock). Finally, the risk can, theoretically at least, be mitigated, either through modifications to the hazard or a reduction to the exposure or the vulnerability.|$|E
30|$|Risk {{assessment}} always {{tries to}} answer the question: how safe is the <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk?</b> The risk is usually defined by the product of hazard probability and the undesirable consequence of loss: R[*]=[*]H[*]×[*]V[*]×[*]E in which H (stands for hazard) indicates the probability of the occurrence of a hazard, V represents vulnerability to specific hazard intensity, and E is the exposure of the <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> This expression shows that risk level {{is closely related to}} the probability and the intensity of hazard. We therefore developed a joint procedure by coupling the Newmark model and the RockFall Analyst model to identify the risk exposure of the object (road) to seismic landslides. Each model accomplishes specific objectives: the Newmark model is used for seismic landslide probability analysis, and the Rockfall Analyst model is used for further unstable mass movement trajectory simulation.|$|R
40|$|Seismic risk {{scenario}} {{has already}} been established for major urban centre by the past, but it is of importance to assess also the seismic risk in wide areas with sparse dwelling centres and few connecting roads. The concept developed consists in linking, for each <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> vulnerability values together with hazard values, {{in order to produce}} for a given scenario, risk values relative to road failure or building damage. We had to overpass two antagonistic specifications of wide area scenario : the scale of survey should be large enough to be economic and simple, but a very small element can be responsible for road failure or building collapse. Hazard is expressed in terms of maximum horizontal acceleration of soil, starting point of the risk analysis. Induced phenomena (liquefaction, landslide and rock fall) occurrence are evaluated from basic soil classifications and expressed in terms of minimum PGA value that can trigger it. For each of these hazard and for each <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> a simple vulnerability value is evaluated. A standard geographical information system allows gathering these data in order to produce maps pointing out road failure and building damage distribution.

40|$|Abstract – Quantification of {{landslide}} risk requires computation of landslide hazard and consequences. Computation of landslide consequences {{should be}} determined {{in terms of}} loss in a quantitative manner. The analysis of consequences involves determination of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and vulnerability of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The vulnerability of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> depends on {{the understanding of the}} interaction between a given landslide and the affected elements. In this study, a quantitative approach for mapping landslide vulnerability was developed for property at local scale. The approach focused on determination of quantitative vulnerability values for each element at risk by considering temporal and spatial impacts by adopting a “damage probability matrix ” approach. The spatial vulnerability of buildings were determined by modeling the landslide velocity. As a result risk to property was obtained by considering the roads and buildings on local scale...|$|E

These tasks were integrated in a quantitative risk assessment procedure supported by 3 D rockfall numerical modelling performed by the original code HY-STONE. The case study of Fiumelatte (Varenna, Italy), where a large rockfall in November 2004 resulted in 2 casualties, destruction of several buildings and damage to transportation corridors, is discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Flood damage {{estimation}} {{is essential}} to flood risk analysis. Flood hazards, values of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and vulnerability of elements determine flood damage. However, these determinants entail uncertainties. In this study, water depth, values of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and damage function are selected as three key parameters. The local sensitivity method, which changes the value of one parameter at one time, is adopted to determine the sensitivity degrees of parameters for flood damage estimation in downtown Shanghai, China. The variance of 25 % for water depth {{as a function of}} different return periods of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 10, 000 years, values of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and damage functions (piecewise function and square-root function) are uniformly taken into account in the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity value (SV) for three parameters, which stands for the influential degree to the results of flood damage, are obtained by the largest damage being divided by the smallest damage if only changing one parameter at one time separately. The results show damage function has largest influential degree among the three parameters with SV of 2. 69; while parameters of values of <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> (SV: 2. 22) and water depth (SV: 1. 81) are also significant.

40|$|For snow avalanches, passive defense {{structures}} are generally designed by considering high return period events. In this paper, taking inspiration from other natural hazards, an alternative method {{based on the}} maximization of the economic benefit of the defense structure is proposed. A general Bayesian framework is described first. Special attention {{is given to the}} problem of taking the poor local information into account in the decision-making process. Therefore, simplifying assumptions are made. The avalanche hazard is represented by a Peak Over Threshold (POT) model. The influence of the dam is quantified in terms of runout distance reduction with a simple relation derived from small-scale experiments using granular media. The costs corresponding to dam construction and the damage to the <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> are roughly evaluated for each dam height-hazard value pair, with damage evaluation corresponding to the maximal expected loss.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} flood defence, focused on reducing {{the probability of}} flooding through hard defences, has been gradually substituted by flood risk management approach, which accepts the idea of coping with floods, and aims at reducing both probability {{and the consequences of}} flooding. In this view, the concept of vulnerability becomes central, such as the (non-structural) measures for its increment. However, the evaluations for the effectiveness and methods of non-structural measure and the vulnerability are less studied, compared to the structural solutions. In this paper, we adopted the Longano catchment in Sicily, Italy, as the case study. The methodology developed in the work enabled a qualitative evaluation of the consequences of floods, based on a crisscross analysis of vulnerability curves and classes of exposure for assets <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> A GIS-based tool was used to evaluate each <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> inside an Exposure-Vulnerability matrix. The construction of an E-V matrix allowed {{a better understanding of the}} actual situation within a catchment and the effectiveness of non-structural measures for a site. Referring directly to vulnerability can also estimate the possible consequences of an event even in those catchments where the damage data are absent.

40|$|Introduction Flooding is {{a natural}} phenomenon, but human {{activity}} has significantly altered the natural drainage processes thereby occasionally causing greater flood risk. Urban flooding has become more frequent due {{to a number of}} factors including climate change, urban growth and an increase in paved surfaces. Pluvial flooding results from heavy rainfall when water that does not infiltrate into the ground ponds in hollows or flows over the ground. In flood damage estimation, the concept of damage curves or damage functions is applied. Such functions give the building damage due to inundation. Most damage assessment models have in common that the direct monetary damage is obtained from the type of the <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and the inundation depth. Problem definition Flood damage assessment models do not focus solely on pluvial flood damage estimation. In addition, the existing flood damage models and developed depth-damage curves have not been tested for application of pluvial flood events.

40|$|Abstract In {{quantitative}} risk {{analyses for}} natural hazards, vulnerability {{can be expressed}} as the ratio of reconstruction, replacement or reproduction expenses due to a damage caused by a certain process intensity and the original value of the <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> exposed. To discuss the building vulnerability under debris flow events, the ratio is mostly related to debris flow inundation height, building materials and building values. Different types of buildings would resist {{to the impact of}} debris flows differently, resulting in different damage levels even under the same inundation height. After debris flow events, the damages to a building include the content loss and the structure loss, which is also variable due to the individual building conditions. This study proposes a flowchart to establish building vulnerability curves through estimating the damages to buildings after debris flow hazards. The losses of content and structure are firstly calculated separately to obtain the loss ratios with respect to original buildings. Secondly, by combining the content and structure loss ratio, the building vulnerability function is derived. In this paper, the original building content value was obtained from governmental statistic records and was based on the market price, and the structure value was received from a regional architecture office...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{introduce}} a probabilistic approach to determine the components of the risk evaluation for rainfall-induced earthflows in medium scale. The Catakli catchment area (Cayeli, Rize, Turkey) was selected as the application site of this study. The investigations were performed in four different stages: (i) evaluation of the conditioning factors, (ii) calculation of the probability of spatial occurrence, (iii) calculation of the probability of the temporal occurrence, and (iv) evaluation of the consequent risk. For the purpose, some basic concepts such as “Risk Cube”, “Risk Plane”, and “Risk Vector” were defined. Additionally, in order to assign the vulnerability to the terrain units being studied in medium scale, a new more robust and more objective equation was proposed. As a result, considering the concrete type of roads in the catchment area, the economic risks were estimated as 3. 6 × 106 €—in case the failures occur on the terrain units including <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> and 12. 3 × 106 €—in case the risks arise from surrounding terrain units.

Research method applies hazard, vulnerability and risk analysis as an input for spatial modeling using Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE). Research reveals that in Girimulyo is susceptible towards rock fall. In the last decades, there were 16 occurrences of rock fall that impacted to physical damages. Fortunately, such disaster {{did not cause}} any harm to human life. Therefore, research argue that physical vulnerability analysis can be analyzed, while social vulnerability cannot be analyzed further, since it had less data support. According to the research, {{there are more than}} 48 housing units located in hazard zone. Hence, local government should initiate structural mitigation to avoid further loss. Research also reveals that areas with high susceptibility will not directly consider as high risk zone, unless it has high vulnerability index. Example: areas along escarpment, where it has high susceptibility, but it has no <b>element</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> in the area. Thereby, research tries to present zonation for prone hazard areas, using risk index. The result is quite representative, since possible areas to be developed is anywhere alongside road network.

40|$|Several steps {{need to be}} {{accomplished}} for a quantitative landslide risk assessment. First, {{an analysis of the}} hazardous process and intensity has to be performed. Afterwards, the physical consequences inflicted by the hazard need to be quantified, preferentially in monetary values. For that purpose, a hazard deterministic modelling has to be coupled with information about the value of the <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> and its vulnerability to the hazard intensity. Dynamic run-out models for debris flows are able to calculate physical outputs (extension, depths, velocities, impact pressures) and to determine the zones where the <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> could suffer an impact. These results can then be applied for vulnerability and risk calculations. The presented risk assessment has been conducted in the area of Tresenda in the Valtellina Valley (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy). Three quantitative hazard scenarios for different return periods were prepared using available rainfall and geotechnical data. The FLO- 2 D program was applied for the simulation of the debris flow propagation. FLO- 2 D uses an Eularian formulation with a finite difference numerical scheme that requires the specification of a discharge hydrograph as an input and the basal shear stresses are calculated using a quadratic model. The modelled hazard scenarios were consequently overlaid with the <b>elements</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> The prospective damage to the houses was estimated using proposed vulnerability functions (flow height and impact pressure).

This characteristic makes the proposed model effectively able to support a correct territorial planning and a suitable management of the emergency following natural disasters which trigger or mobilize again mass movements. This model, anchored in a GIS system, has been characterized by the following phases: 1. The first phase has aimed at the topological characterization of the studied territorial system and the assessment of the scenarios in terms of spatial landslide hazard. As concerns the assessment of the landslide hazard, a statistical method has been proposed, which is based on the neural networks; 2. the second phase has been characterized by the analysis of the direct consequences of a scenario event on the system; 3. the third phase has been focalized on the definition of the assessing model of the systemic vulnerability in landslide areas; 4. the forth phase aim at description of possible trigger of further risks beginning from a particular event; 5. the fifth phase aim at spatial analysis of elements.

While consequence analysis models have been used for years on local scales, their application on a global scale ¿ required for humanitarian disasters ¿ has been restricted by a lack of data. This chapter will describe how this has changed and will take the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) as an example. GDACS, jointly developed by the European Commission and the United Nations, combines existing web-based disaster information management systems with the aim to alert the international community in case of major sudden-onset disasters and to facilitate the coordination of international response during the relief phase of the disaster. This system shows that it is feasible to provide global disaster alerts based on consequence analysis models. In addition, such models can produce valuable information for decision making, such as reports on affected areas, expected damage, logistics, critical infrastructure nearby, potential secondary effects and weather forecasts.
