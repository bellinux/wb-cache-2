50|$|A major {{breakthrough}} came during 2005 when senior officers from West Yorkshire Police's Homicide and Major Inquiry Team (HMET), headed by Det Chief Supt Chris Gregg, decided {{to review the}} case. A small piece of the <b>gummed</b> <b>seal</b> {{from one of the}} envelopes was located in a forensic laboratory and following publicity about the cold case review the hoax tape was retrieved from a retired scientist who had worked on the original investigation.|$|E
5000|$|Promotion {{was carried}} out by: [...] "One million Exposition <b>gum</b> <b>seals,</b> more than 1700 monthly proof-sheets, 25,000 {{invitation}} booklets, and 100,000 postcards were printed and circulated; and 15,000 posters and window cards were distributed locally and through all cities and towns within a radius of 200 miles. A slogan competition drew out 3,000 participants." [...] A souvenir book of the Exposition contained a directory of the exhibitors, a [...] "classified" [...] list of Cleveland manufacturers, and [...] "other matter pertaining to local industries". Entertainment included the [...] "best" [...] local bands, J. Powell Jones and the boy chorus of 500, and [...] "other features of a high class character".|$|R
60|$|It is curious. Many a false, pandering {{word had}} sprung to my tongue when I was concocting this letter {{in my mind}} beside Mrs Bowater's bed, and even with Mrs Petrie's stubby, ink-corroded pen in my hand. Yet some last shred of honesty {{compelled}} me to be brief and frigid. I was simply determined to be utterly open with him, even though I seemed to myself like the dark picture {{of a man in}} a bog struggling to grope his way out. I dipped my fingers into a vase of wallflowers, wetted the <b>gum,</b> <b>sealed</b> down the envelope, and wrote on it this address: Mr ----, Lodging at a cottage near the Farm, North-west of Wanderslore, Beechwood, Kent. And I prayed heaven for its safe delivery.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, wedding invitations are mailed {{in double}} {{envelope}}s. The inner envelope may be lined, is not gummed, and {{fits into the}} outer envelope. The outer envelope is <b>gummed</b> for <b>sealing</b> and addressing. More recently, the inner envelope is often {{left out in the}} interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.|$|R
40|$|The Christmas {{season is}} the gift-giving season! Each gift-even the most practical, can be {{enhanced}} if it is wrapped suitable and attractively. By suitably-it is inferred that the package is appropriate for the gift and for {{the one who is}} to receive it. For instance, children are delighted with gifts that are wrapped in figured paper (such as that paper which has figures of a Santa Claus on it), or with packages enclosed with bright <b>gummed</b> Christmas <b>seals...</b>|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, the {{injection}} of electrolyte {{was conducted in}} an Ar-filled glove box (the concentrations of moisture and oxygen below 1  ppm). The last unclosed side of the assembled full cell was encapsulated with <b>seal</b> <b>gum.</b> The electrolyte was 1  mol L− 1 LiPF 6 /DMC[*]+[*]DEC[*]+[*]EC solution (1 : 1 : 1 in volume); the separator was Celgard 2300 film.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacture}} of wrappers for the sending of newspapers or periodicals {{began in the}} U.S. in 1861. The first wrappers were rectangular pieces of paper with <b>gum</b> to <b>seal</b> it on one end and an embossed envelope stamp or indicium on it. [...] By 1870, the form {{was that of a}} rectangle with the narrow side rounded and gummed at the top. They were manufactured from piles of 300 - 500 sheets of paper which were then cut to shape by a knife. After around 1900, they were cut individually from long ribbons of paper which had been printed with an embossed envelope die.|$|R
40|$|Jennerlan {{prophylaxis}} in man {{by means}} of intradermal inoculation of cultured vaccine virus was described (1) in 1935. Since then this type of prophylaxis against smallpox {{has been used by}} us, by many private physicians, and by physicians in a number of clinics. For the last 3 years the virus employed has been from generations 30 to 170 of the "second revived " strain of cultured vaccine virus, dried]From the frozen state in the presence of <b>gum</b> acacia and <b>sealed</b> in vacuo (1, 2). This strain (3) was originally derived from calf lymph vaccine virus supplied by the New York City Board of Health in 1931 and has been propagated since then by serial transfers in a medium consisting of Tyrode's solution and minced chick embryo tissue. Intradermal inoculation of the virus in rabbits reveals that it maintains a uniform potency during continued cultivation. Moreover, the lesions produced in rabbits are less severe than are those caused by other strains of vaccine virus. When inoculated intradermally in susceptible persons, culture...|$|R
40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. Bite-like skin lesions on harbour {{porpoises}} (Phocoena phocoena) have been suspected {{to be caused}} by grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), and a few field observations have been reported. Bite-like skin lesions observed on stranded animals were characterized by two main components: large flaps of loose or missing skin and blubber with frayed edges and puncture lesions. Definitive demonstration of predation by a grey seal was not reported so far in those stranded animals. In this study, five stranded porpoises with bite-like skin lesions were swabbed for genetic investigations. In addition, the head of a recently dead grey seal was used to mimic bite-like skin injuries on a porpoise carcass. Subsequently, the artificial skin injuries were swabbed, along with the <b>gum</b> of the <b>seal</b> used for inflicting them (positive controls). Total DNA was extracted from the swabs and was used to retrieve a fragment of mitochondrial DNA by PCR.

Total DNA was extracted from the swabs and was used to retrieve a fragment of mitochondrial DNA by PCR. Primers were designed to amplify a specific stretch of mitochondrial DNA known to differ between grey seals and porpoises. The amplicon targeted was successfully amplified from the positive control and from two of the stranded porpoises, and grey seal-specific mitochondrial DNA was retrieved from all those samples. We conclude that (1) it is possible to detect grey seal DNA from dead porpoises even after several days in seawater and (2) bite-like skin lesions found on dead porpoises definitively result from grey seals attacks. The attacks are most likely linked with predation although, in a number of cases, scavenging and aggressive behaviour cannot be excluded...|$|R
50|$|The final shaping {{was done}} {{closer to the}} papakainga to be nearer to food. A waka could take a year to make if the {{construction}} went smoothly, {{but it could be}} abandoned if there was an accident or a death of an important person. Such abandoned, uncompleted waka have been found in post-contact times. Most large waka were built in several main interlocking sections and stitched together with flax rope. Small pegs were put in the holes which swelled and sealed when wet. Tree <b>gum</b> could also <b>seal</b> the holes. A large finished waka weighed about three tonnes and could remain in use for many decades. All large waka had names and were objects of pride and admiration. The image above shows a waka taua with unusually high freeboard. A noticeable feature of a loaded waka taua was its very low freeboard of 400-500 mm which made the vessel unseaworthy in all but good weather, despite the presence of one or two young men on board dedicated to bailing. The normal timber used, Totara, is a lightweight native podocarp, which retains its natural oils even when cut down. This prevented the timber opening up and splitting. Angela Ballara noted that they only put to sea when it was fine. One voyage across the stormy Cook Strait, was delayed for a week while the travellers waited for fine weather. The missionary William Williams, son of Henry Williams, noted that the voyage of a waka taua was a leisurely affair due to the requirements of foraging for food and waiting for fine weather.|$|R
