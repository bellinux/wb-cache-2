5|$|In December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Khan, along with famed comedy group All India Bakchod, will be heading up a campaign against the recently reinstated ban on gay sex in India through a satirical video highlighting ignorance around gay issues. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Khan said: “I’ve always been involved with gay rights. The scenario in this country is disheartening and depressing. These are basic human rights that people are being denied of; they’re no minority. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> initiative is to show those who do not support homosexuality, how ridiculous their thinking is.” Other Bollywood stars have spoken out to condemn the reintroduction of the law.|$|E

Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

This comment is a joke about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects support the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

25|$|In a {{different}} direction, for compact operators on a Banach space, a result {{analogous to the}} Jordan normal form holds. One restricts to compact operators because every point x in the spectrum of a compact operator T, the only exception being when x is the limit point of the spectrum, is an eigenvalue. This is not true for bounded operators in general. To give some <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> generalization, we first reformulate the Jordan decomposition {{in the language of}} functional analysis.|$|E
25|$|When the Eastern State Penitentiary, or Cherry Hill as it {{was known}} at the time, was erected in 1829 in Francisville (the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new prison was created in a meeting held at Benjamin Franklin's house in 1787) {{it was the largest}} and most {{expensive}} public structure in the country. Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect John Haviland was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland. He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into those who thought of committing a crime.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1903, Straucher {{built on}} his {{friendship}} with intellectuals from Bukovina's other main communities, the Romanian Aurel Onciul, of the Democratic Peasants' Party, and the Ukrainian Nikolai von Wassilko. The three of them set up a Freisinnige Verband ("Freethinkers' Alliance", as in Germany's Freisinnige Partei), noted for condemning the spread of antisemitism. The unifying <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Verband was electoral reform, that is the attempt {{to reduce the number}} of seats allocated to boyars and reassign them according to Straucher's own system; all nationalities involved in the project agreed to follow their respective agenda to a greater emancipation. More likely to interpret political events as evidence of class conflict rather than national emancipation, the Verband notably criticized the regional conservative groups (who generally sought to stump Bukovina's devolution) and the newly founded Romanian National People's Party (PPNR) of boyar Iancu Flondor (whose platform was linked to the Romanian national revival).|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main types of resource: Gold, Stone, and Gems. Resources {{are used to}} {{construct}} rooms and traps, and summon minions. Stone and Gold (stored in a treasury) are produced by Stone Quarries and Gold Mines respectively. Resources are also found in dirt tiles (dug by the Imps), {{of which there are}} three types: Soft Rock, Gem Veins, and Hard Gem Veins, taking increasing amounts of time to dig respectively. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is to keep Imps busy while the player is away, and to reward players on returning. Imps can be slapped to speed up digging, and Gems can be spent to dig tiles instantly. Gems can also be spent to produce Imps, upgrade rooms, and instantly perform other actions that take time, such as room construction, and minion summoning, and can be purchased using real money within the game. Other resources include mana (produced by the Dark Library and used to cast spells (such as Dragon Breath, which conjures a dragon)), and combat points, obtained by raiding and defending dungeons.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the {{telephone}} {{dates back to the}} string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the air, as in the ear, and a string or wire can transmit such collected voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor {{to the development of the}} electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.|$|E
