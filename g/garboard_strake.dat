Pray don't move--I intend to change that chair for one more {{accustomed}} to polite society. To continue: I perfected myself in the language, and it was awfully jolly at first. Whenever I went by train, I heard not only all the engines said, but what every blessed carriage thought, that joined in the conversation. If you chaps only knew what rot those whistles can get off! And as for the brakes, they can beat any mule driver in cursing. Then, after a time, it got rather monotonous, and I took a short sea trip for my health. But, by Jove, every blessed inch of the whole ship--from the screw to the bowsprit--had something to say, and the bad language used by the <b>garboard</b> <b>strake</b> when the ship rolled was something too awful! You don't happen {{to know what the}} <b>garboard</b> <b>strake</b> is, do you?" ...|$|E
50|$|In an open boat or in {{a larger}} vessel, the hog is the {{structural}} member which lies immediately above the keel {{to which it is}} permanently and securely fastened so that the two form one member to which the lowest <b>strakes</b> (the <b>garboard</b> <b>strakes)</b> are fastened.|$|R
50|$|The hull, typically, {{consists}} of four strakes each side, the <b>garboard</b> <b>strakes</b> being wide giving a flat run to the transom whilst having a fairly sharp entry at the stem. There is a recessed rear deck level with side benches and a recessed foredeck. Some models have a small one or two-berth cabin.|$|R

60|$|For know, gentle reader, the staunchness of the Snark. She is forty-five {{feet long}} on the waterline. Her <b>garboard</b> <b>strake</b> is three inches thick; her {{planking}} two and one-half inches thick; her deck- planking two inches thick and in all her planking there are no butts. I know, for I ordered that planking especially from Puget Sound. Then the Snark has four water-tight compartments, {{which is to say}} that her length is broken by three water-tight bulkheads. Thus, no matter how large a leak the Snark may spring, Only one compartment can fill with water. The other three compartments will keep her afloat, anyway, and, besides, will enable us to mend the leak. There is another virtue in these bulkheads. The last compartment of all, in the very stern, contains six tanks that carry over one thousand gallons of gasolene. Now gasolene is a very dangerous article to carry in bulk on a small craft far out on the wide ocean. But when the six tanks that do not leak are themselves contained in a compartment hermetically sealed off from the rest of the boat, the danger will be seen to be very small indeed.|$|E

50|$|Broadly, {{the parts}} of the ship visible above the {{waterline}} were constructed from East India teak, while American rock elm was used for the ship's bottom. The keel (16.5 x 15 in) had on either side a <b>garboard</b> <b>strake</b> (11 x 12 in) and then 6 in planking decreasing to 4.75 in at 1/5 the depth of the hold.

40|$|Scotia, to England, several leaks {{became evident}} soon after sailing. She became {{separated}} from her charges during a gale and the high winds and heavy seas only made the leaks worse. By 5 th February 1783, there were eight feet {{of water in the}} hold and despite heaving overboard guns and heavy stores, little progress was made in reducing the water level. It was decided to make for the nearest land, which was judged to be the Azores. The frigate arrived off Faial on 10 th February, but contrary winds blew her out to sea again. By then all the crew, officers and men together were working the pumps and bailing to keep her afloat. On 12 th February, with the crew exhausted by constant employment at the pumps, she was run ashore on the island of São Jorge. The chance was taken to examine her when ashore and it was found that her keel and <b>garboard</b> <b>strake</b> were so badly worm-eaten, they hardly existed. For the next two weeks, stores and provisions – wine, brandy, tar, iron, copper and empty casks- were taken out of her before the wreck was burnt, and were stored in the house of José de Sousa Pedroso, before they were auctioned in 1786. On the 22 nd February, the Town Council of Calheta assembled in a hasty meeting. The officials had heard the rumour that the Captain of the stranded frigate wanted to set her ablaze and were afraid of the consequences because they had also heard that the ship had many barrels of gunpowder onboard. Parker was then intimate...|$|E
