5|$|Although {{twice as}} {{powerful}} as the Alpine, the Tiger is only about twenty per cent heavier, but the extra weight of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications. Nevertheless, the Tiger's <b>front-to-back</b> weight ratio is substantially similar to the Alpine's, at 51.7/48.3 front/rear.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, <b>front-to-back,</b> with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E
5|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} Discovery Channel's Unsolved History used modern {{technology}} {{to attempt to}} re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the <b>front-to-back</b> wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm {{was raised in the}} manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Clanton) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its <b>front-to-back</b> axis.|$|E
5|$|Three more eggs {{containing}} embryos {{from the}} same formation were described in 2016 by Wang et al. Though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble M. yaotunensis, they declined to refer them to any ootaxon lower than Elongatoolithidae because Macroolithus is not clearly defined and {{is in need of}} revision. The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny. The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (<b>front-to-back).</b> This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual is that, even at this early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
25|$|Farlow {{and others}} studied tyrannosaur tooth biomechanics, finding {{them to be}} more {{resistant}} to forces in both the <b>front-to-back</b> and side-to-side planes than the more blade-like teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from having}} a flat, nodal skull, the most {{prominent}} feature of Dracorex is the pair of huge and unrestricted superior temporal openings. The supratemporal fenestrae are much larger <b>front-to-back</b> and side-to-side than in Homalocephale, and larger than in Goyocephale. Only a fragmentary Wannanosaurus skull shows fenestrae as large as those of Dracorex. This fenestral architecture has been seen in ancient archosaurs, but not in other pachycephalosaurs.|$|E
25|$|The basic Bensen Gyrocopter {{design is}} a simple frame of square {{aluminium}} or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or special fittings, not the bolts. A <b>front-to-back</b> keel mounts a steerable nosewheel, seat, engine, and a vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for water operations.|$|E
25|$|Ornitholestes had a {{relatively}} short neck with a slight sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve. The tail was long and whiplike, comprising {{over half of the}} body's length. Not all of the vertebrae were preserved, but Osborn (1917) estimated that Ornitholestes had nine or ten cervical (neck) vertebrae, thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae, four sacral (hip) vertebrae, and 39 to 44 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Carpenter et al. (2005a) recorded that the specimen contained five sacral vertebrae. Ornitholestes was a short-bodied theropod, and this was reflected in the short <b>front-to-back</b> dimensions of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The bomb's orientation, {{positioned}} <b>front-to-back</b> and upward angled from horizontal, {{caused the}} blast to expand vertically and lengthwise. This configuration meant that Ikegami's body absorbed {{most of the}} blast force and the plane's outer structure was spared. The lower half of his body fell into the cargo hold and ten passengers sitting in the seats in front of and behind Ikegami were also injured; one needed urgent medical care. Additionally, the 38-minute delay in takeoff from Cebu meant the plane was not as far out to sea as anticipated, which contributed to the captain's options available for an emergency landing.|$|E
500|$|The modules {{were held}} {{together}} in an aluminum chassis known as a [...] "brick". The bricks were immersed in liquid fluorinert for cooling, as in the Cray-2. A four-processor system with 64 memory modules dissipated about 88kW of power. The entire four-processor system was about [...] tall and <b>front-to-back,</b> and a little over [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|A fossil braincase from Lo Hueco was {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} an unnamed species of Ampelosaurus, A. sp., in a 2013 {{article in the}} journal PLoS ONE. The braincase was found to share many features with A. atacis, such as a back of the skull that is flat. The braincase, MCCM-HUE-8741, is small in size overall, with a <b>front-to-back</b> length of , and the maximum width of the left half being [...] Parts of {{the bottom half of}} the braincase are missing. Even though section are missing, the specimen does not appear to have been deformed much, as the left and right halves are not very different.|$|E
500|$|The plane scene {{during which}} {{passengers}} die in mid-air was created inside {{a very large}} sound stage. The three-ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically. [...] "We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people," [...] special effects supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the on-board sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees <b>front-to-back,</b> realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. [...] Sawa said that [...] "the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real". [...] Wong said, [...] "You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, 'What have I done?' I was afraid we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting." ...|$|E
500|$|Lilienthal {{had made}} [...] "whirling arm" [...] tests on {{only a few}} wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a {{different}} shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, [...] "were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense". An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord—the wing's <b>front-to-back</b> dimension). Such shapes offered much better lift-to-drag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far.|$|E
500|$|Soundmirror also {{received}} compliments. Andrew Quint of The Absolute Sound described the sound as [...] "vivid, highly detailed, and dynamic" [...] {{as well as}} avoiding [...] "digital steeliness". Quint called the <b>front-to-back</b> layering outstanding. John Sunier said the recording's [...] "rich surround sonics" [...] bring together excellent performances and [...] "first-rate fidelity". He also noted the lack of audience interference, suggesting either good behavior by attendees or subtle work by audio engineers. Michael Miller complimented {{the quality of the}} recording for having [...] "no problems of intonation or ensemble" [...] and said the album [...] "belongs in the reference collection of any audiophile, whether they are inclined to multichannel playback or not". Miller specifically appreciated Alspaugh and the engineers for capturing the loudness and subtleties of Sinfonia da Requiem. International Record Review Nigel Simeone recommended the recording, calling it [...] "impressive" [...] and writing that the live sound is [...] "exceptionally vibrant". Kalman Rubinson of Stereophile commended the ensemble, PentaTone and Soundmirror for providing [...] "spacious, transparent, powerful sound". Rubinson, who designated the recording as the year's best concept album, praised the program for being [...] "thought-provoking and restorative" [...] and appreciated the range of emotions it summoned.|$|E
500|$|In Stegosaurus stenops {{there are}} 27 {{bones in the}} {{vertebral}} column anterior to the sacrum, a varying number of vertebrae in the sacrum, with four in most subadults, and around 46 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The presacrals are divided into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the total number being one greater than in Hesperosaurus, two greater than Huayangosaurus, although Miragaia preserves 17 cervicals and {{an unknown number of}} dorsals. The first cervical vertebra is the axis bone, which is connected and often fused to the atlas bone. Farther posteriorly, the proportionately larger the cervicals become, although they do not change greatly in anything other than size. Past the first few dorsals, the centrum of the bones become more elongate <b>front-to-back,</b> and the [...] processes become more elevated dorsal. The sacrum of S. stenops includes four sacral vertebrae, but one of the dorsals is also incorporated into the structure. In some specimens of S. stenops, a caudal is also incorporated, as a caudosacral. In Hesperosaurus there are two dorsosacrals, and only four fused sacrals, but in Kentrosaurus there may be as many as seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. S. stenops preserves 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the series both the centrums and the neural spines become smaller, until the neural spines disappear at caudal 35. Around the middle of the tail, the neural spines become , meaning they are divided near the top.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually selling 50,000 copies, {{the success}} of Through Being Cool helped Saves the Day to sign with Vagrant Records. It was named one of Alternative Press 10 most {{influential}} albums of 1999. To celebrate the album's 15th anniversary, the band played the album <b>front-to-back</b> on tour and Equal Vision re-pressed the album on vinyl. Vocalist Chris Conley considers it [...] "the most important record that we did".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} for Rolling Stone magazine, Jody Rosen found {{most of the}} album's songs [...] "unforgettable" [...] and stated, [...] "the {{combination}} of classicist songcraft, wild sound collage and a muse that partakes equally of the sensual and the silly makes Love vs. Money far {{more than just an}} accomplished genre piece". Alex Macpherson of The Quietus noted its cyclical thematic structure, but stated, [...] "it's how the wheel turns, endlessly and inevitably, which is what compels about Love vs Money." [...] Slant Magazine's Wilson McBee viewed it as an improvement over Love Hate and wrote that it [...] "keeps to the same aesthetic touchstones [...] while cranking up the gears of ambition". McBee called the album [...] "a cohesive, <b>front-to-back</b> artistic statement" [...] and commented on its studio and hook-oriented [...] "songcraft": [...] "What keeps all this over-production from being distracting is Nash's intelligent arrangements and a keen avoidance of clutter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cunning folk often {{produced}} written charms {{for their}} clients, {{which would be}} utilised {{in a wide variety}} of manners, such as to protect from witchcraft or to help procure love. These typically contained a series of words that were believed to have magical powers, and which were commonly drawn from either grimoires or from the Bible. These were produced on both paper, which was the cheaper option, or, in certain cases, parchment, which according to certain magical texts should have been made from the skin of a virgin or unborn calf. [...] "Most written charms contained a strong religious content", typically invoking various names of God (such as Elohim, Adonai, Tetragrammaton etc) or of His angels in order to help the particular charm to be effective. In some cases they quoted whole sections from the Bible, sometimes in either Latin, Greek or Hebrew rather than English, which was the common language of the period. At other times they made use of magic words, such as [...] "Abracadabra" [...] or [...] "sator arepo tenet opera rotas", the latter of which spells the same when read <b>front-to-back</b> or back-to-front. Such charms were then sometimes sewn into a bag, or placed within a bottle, and either carried about by the client or placed somewhere in their home.|$|E
2500|$|Basic Instinct received, on average, {{positive}} {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 8 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave it 4 out of 5 stars {{and called it}} Ciara's [...] "most consistent and unified release [...] one of 2010's finest pop-R albums". Entertainment Weeklys Simon Vozick-Levinson gave Basic Instinct a B+ rating and viewed that The-Dream and Tricky Stewart's contributions [...] "play towards Ciara's strengths" [...] due to their [...] "caffeinated synthpop beats and wiggling melodies". Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the album [...] "never deviates from an underlying two-bar, three-chord vamp, but its synthetic orchestrations vary unpredictably while Ciara's voice curls around the repeating chords on multiple paths". BBC Online's Matthew Horton called it [...] "one of the best RnB albums of the year [...] vibrant, addictive and sleek, a calling card for modern RnB shorn of filler and gauche imitation", writing that Ciara [...] "really becomes the new Janet Jackson, mixing sugary vocals and tempered aggression and rolling over the beats in time-honoured [...] Jackson fashion. Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a svelte and cohesive collection that serves up one glitzy guilty pleasure after another", stating [...] "It's pretty rare that a singles artist decides, seven years into her career, to make her first concerted effort at an album that works as a <b>front-to-back</b> listen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Closing out 2013, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Albums of the Year" [...] lists by major publications. The album was ranked at number 30 on Spins list of the 50 best albums of 2013. Complex positioned it at number 29, on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013.

It's tough to imagine 2 Chainz making a particularly ambitious record. His entire style is, after all, firmly middlebrow: never pretentious, but nor is it especially interested in the populist vanguard. While the ideal 2 Chainz album {{would probably be a}} hits compilation, B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time is probably the next best thing: a consistent, <b>front-to-back</b> listen that celebrates a very particular aspect of hip-hop as a craft." [...] Rolling Stone positioned in at number 11 on their list of the best hip hop albums of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "2 Chainz was inescapable this year, cresting on a string of show-stealing features and an impactful 2012 debut. On his follow-up, trap's reigning king expanded his domain: the Pharrell-produced [...] "Feds Watching" [...] evoked late-1970s car-chase melodrama as a soundbed for 2 Chainz' luxury raps, and album cuts explored a breadth of topics from fallen homies ("Live and Learn") to on-demand sextapes ("Netflix").
