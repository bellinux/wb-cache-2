40|$|In the {{framework}} of performance assessment, because of the involvement of many facets, the development of ways to detect differential item functioning or <b>differential</b> <b>facet</b> functioning (DFF) has lagged beyond the practical needs of test developers. To monitor the validity and fairness of an assessment, {{it is critical to}} discover a method that can detect multiple sources of potential DFF from raters, item, topics, and other facets. Many-faceted Rasch modeling with the FACETS software provides a powerful way to detect DFF in performance assessment. This study focuses on raters and topic types as two sources of DFF using the FACETS model. Data came from 1, 734 essays written by 867 students in grades 6, 8, and 10 as part of the Illinois Goal Assessment Program. A measurement model of eight facets was used. With the FACETS model, DFF analysis of raters identified biased raters. Evidence was also found that bias on the part of these raters affected students ' writing ability estimates. DFF statistics for topic types and student demography showed effects of performance of topic types on student subgroups and provided evidence of gender and age impacts on different topic types.

40|$|This study {{intends to}} {{investigate}} {{two ways to}} generalise differential item functioning (DIF) by grouping of items that share a common feature, or an item property as in the Linear Logistic Test Model (LLTM). An item “facet” refers {{to this type of}} grouping, and DIF can be expressed in terms of more fundamental parameters that relate to the facet of items. Hence the <b>differential</b> <b>facet</b> functioning (DFF) model, a particular version of the LLTM, helps to explain the DIF effects more substantively. Using the mathematics data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2003, this study shows that modeling the DFF effect through an interaction of the group-by-facet parameter rather than DIF effect on the individual item level can be handled easily with the NLMIXED procedure of SAS. We found that the results are more interpretable when the bias is interpreted on the facet level rather than the item level. Analogous to the multidimensional DIF model, one natural extension of the DFF model is to make the model multidimensional when DFF facets (i. e., LLTM facets) are considered as dimensions. This extension, multidimensional DFF (MDFF), is also investigated. The MDFF model allows individual differences to be modeled on the dimension that exhibits a DFF effect. However, it is always recommended to check the individual DIF estimates and construct a substantive analysis first before conducting DFF and MDFF analysis...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} quality of data {{it is one of}} the most {{relevant}} aspects in observational researches. The Generalizability Theory (GT) provides a method of analysis that allows us to isolate the various sources of error measurement. At the same time, it helps us to determine the extent to which various factors can change and analyze the effect on the generalizability coefficient. In the work shown here, there are two studies aimed to creating and purifying an observation instrument, Observation Protocol in the Teaching Functions (Protocolo de Funciones Docentes, PROFUNDO, v 1 and v 2), for behavioral assessment which has been carried out by instructors in a social-affective out-of-school program. The reliability and homogeneity studies are carried out once the instrument has been created and purified. The reliability study will be done through the GT method taking both codes (c) and agents (a) as <b>differential</b> <b>facets</b> in. The generalization will be done through observers using a crossed multi-faceted design (A × O × C). In the homogeneity study the generalization facet will be done through codes using the same design that the reliability study...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influences of}} different facets of psychological collectivism (Preference, Reliance, Concern, Norm Acceptance, and Goal Priority) on team functioning at 3 different performance depic-tions: initial team performance, end-state team performance, and team performance change over time. We also tested {{the extent to which}} team-member exchange moderated the relationships between facets of psychological collectivism and performance change over time. Results from multilevel growth modeling of 66 teams (N 264) engaged in a business simulation revealed <b>differential</b> effects across <b>facets</b> of psychological collectivism and across different performance measurements. Whereas facets concerned with affiliation (Preference and Concern) were positively related to initial team performance, reliance was negatively related to initial team performance. Goal Priority was a strong predictor of end-state performance. Team-member exchange moderated the relationship between performance change and 3 of the 5 facets of psychological collectivism (Preference, Reliance, Norm Acceptance). Implications for team composition and team training are discussed...|$|R

The framework development of this instrument by Miller (2013) combines 10 steps of developing instrument by McNamara (1996), Turner (2001) and Wortham (2012). The study also identified four facets of the items and domains, children, raters and the differential functionality facet with {{the age group of}} six domains. Generalizabiliti Theory (G-Theory) used to show the dependability of each domain. A total of 278 childrens aged two to four years from eight kindergartens were selected through the purposive sampling techniques. Items assessment’s analyzed using Facets 3. 71 and EduG 2. 0. The findings show six domains of early childhood development fulfill all the assumptions of the Facets-Rasch model. Four facet measurements showed significant differences in the degree of difficulty of the items and domains, the ability of the children's, the rater assessment and the <b>differential</b> <b>facet</b> functioning with the age group. The facets dependability explained by the G-Theory. This study has four implications. From the development of the instrument, this study contributes to building a more robust instrument through information sources of error that can be explained. From a methodological issues, child assessment process is done systematically for using model Facets-Rasch is obviously a fair and objective. From the pedagogical angle, this study contributes directly to open space for teachers to determine the levels of activity that are more specific and child development zone. From a design of an observation model in this study, the observation of the performance of children more clearly and have empirical findings, in line with the assessment in the context of Malaysia’s kindergarten...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{cognitive}} {{factor of}} Anxiety Sensitivity (AS; {{the fear of}} anxiety and related bodily sensations) is theorized {{to play a role}} in cannabis use and its disorders. Lower-order facets of AS (physical concerns, mental incapacitation concerns, and social concerns) may be differentially related to cannabis use behavior. However, little is known about the impact of AS facets on the immediate antecedents of cannabis use. Methods: This study used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to prospectively examine the relations between specific facets of AS, cannabis craving, state anxiety, and cannabis use in the natural environment using real-world data about ad lib cannabis use episodes. Participants were 49 current cannabis users (38. 8 % female). Results: AS-mental incapacitation fears were related to significantly greater severity of cannabis-related problems at baseline. During the EMA period, AS-mental incapacitation and AS-social concerns significantly interacted with cannabis craving to prospectively predict subsequent cannabis use. Specifically, individuals with higher craving and either higher AS-mental incapacitation or AS-social concerns were the most likely to subsequently use cannabis. In contrast to prediction, no AS facet significantly moderated the relationship between state anxiety and cannabis use. Conclusions: These findings suggest facets of AS (mental incapacitation and social fears) interact with cannabis craving to predict cannabis use. Findings also suggest <b>differential</b> relations between <b>facets</b> of AS and cannabis-related behaviors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTheory and {{empirical}} evidence suggest that North American-based measures of self-esteem, which measure individualistic positive self-regard, {{may be less}} applicable to Eastern cultures. In the present exploratory study, we examined how different conceptualizations of self-esteem, {{as measured by the}} Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and the Collective Self-esteem (CSE) Scale, predicted drinking behavior among three groups of American college students (N= 326) with varying ethnicities: White, Korean, and Chinese/Taiwanese. Hierarchical negative binomial regression was employed to evaluate these relations. Ethnic identity was controlled for in all analyses. Findings indicated that while global self-esteem was positively associated with drinking for the whole sample, ethnicity moderated this relationship such that global self-esteem was related to drinking for White participants but not for their Chinese/Taiwanese counterparts. In addition, while CSE did not associate with drinking for the whole sample, effects emerged for specific ethnicities. Specifically, private CSE was associated with less drinking for Korean and Chinese/Taiwanese participants. Depending on specific Asian ethnicity, public CSE served as a risk (Korean participants) or a protective factor (Chinese/Taiwanese participants) for drinking. Findings suggest that above and beyond ethnic identity, <b>differential</b> relationships between <b>facets</b> of self-esteem and drinking behavior may exist among White, Korean, and Chinese/Taiwanese young adults. Intervention and prevention programs should develop strategies to help Chinese/Taiwanese and Korean American young adults cultivate protective factors within domains of CSE...|$|R
