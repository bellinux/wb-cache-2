25|$|During {{the first}} stages of {{embryonic}} vascular remodelling, high-velocity flow {{is not present}} solely in large-diameter vessels, but this corrects itself due {{to the effects of}} vascular remodelling over the first two days of blood flow. It is known that embryonic vessels respond to increases in pressure by increasing the diameter of the vessel. Due to the absence of smooth muscle cells and the glycocalyx, which provide <b>elastic</b> <b>support</b> in adult vessels, blood vessels in the developing embryo are much more resistant to flow. This means that increases in flow or pressure can only be answered by rapid, semi-permanent expansion of the vessel diameter, rather than by more gradual stretch and expansion experienced in adult blood vessels.|$|E

This paper investigates the in-plane nonlinear elastic behaviour {{and stability of}} elastically supported shallow circular arches that are subjected to a radial load uniformly distributed around the arch axis. Analytical solutions for the nonlinear behaviour and for the nonlinear buckling load are obtained for shallow arches with equal or unequal <b>elastic</b> <b>supports.</b> It is found that {{the flexibility of the}} <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> and the shallowness of the arch play important roles in the nonlinear structural response of the arch. The limiting shallownesses that distinguish between the buckling modes are obtained and the relationship of the limiting shallowness with the flexibility of the <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> is established, and the critical flexibility of the <b>elastic</b> radial <b>supports</b> is derived. An arch with equal <b>elastic</b> radial <b>supports</b> whose flexibility is larger than the critical value becomes an elastically supported beam curved in elevation, while an arch with one rigid and one <b>elastic</b> radial <b>support</b> whose flexibility is larger than the critical value still behaves as an arch when its shallowness is higher than a limiting shallowness. Comparisons with finite element results demonstrate that the analytical solutions and the values of the critical flexibility of the <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> and the limiting shallowness of the arch are valid...|$|R

For estimating the im-portant {{problems in the}} railway tracks such as the effects of rail joints, rail supports, rail modeling in the nearness of bridge and other problems, the models of the axially beam model on the elastic foundation can be utilized. For study-ing the effects of axially beam on the elastic foundation, partial differential equations which represent the independent variables should be utilized because of the beams have infinite degrees of freedom. In this paper, solution algorithm and process of the axially beam on the elastic foundation by considering the <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> under moving load have been studied and equations have been analyzed as closed form. The beam model includes visco – elastic foundation and <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> conditions. For considering the beam element, axial force has been considered beside of shear and moment forces. The solution algorithm is that firstly the differential equations of beam on the elastic foundation with <b>elastic</b> <b>supports</b> are derived and then these equations are solved parametrically by using separation of variables and orthogonality properties of modes. This process and solution have been presented as closed form in this paper. This problem wasn’t investigated in the technical literature. This model can be utilized for the most problems in the railway tracks.

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{research}} of Remington and Witting, Thompson et al. [47, 48, 49] conducted many studies on a track–bridge vibration model.

Finally, discrete point supports were inserted between the track and the bridge to account for the random distribution of support stiffness, sleeper space, and beam mass. This model was used to study problems related to steel-bridge noise and validated SEA for calculation of low-frequency bridge-borne noise. The results showed that SEA is applicable for calculation of sound radiation above 40  Hz and that sound radiation calculation results below 40  Hz can be inaccurate.|$|E
