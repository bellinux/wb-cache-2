40|$|Laser beam {{cladding}} with powder mixtures, {{consisting of}} carbidic hard particles and metallic binders, {{is a very}} effective method for producing wear-resistant protection layers on highly stressed components. The resultant compound layer systems provide excellent wear-resistance, in particular on parts subjected to complex load conditions, such as abrasive wear, impact or fatigue. The wear behaviour is influenced by shape and material of the counterpart, abrasive type, abrasive grain size {{and size of the}} carbide particles within the dispersion structure. Large-scaled wear tests have shown, that the wear performance of laser hard metal claddings comes close to that of sintered WC/Co hard metal. Because of the relatively high binder content of up to 50 vol. %, the layers maintain ductile materials behaviour.

50|$|Rotary {{letterpress}} {{machines are}} still {{used on a}} wide scale for printing self-adhesive and non-self-adhesive labels, tube laminate, cup stock, etc. The printing quality achieved by a modern letterpress machine with UV curing is on par with flexo presses. It is more convenient and user friendly than a flexo press. It uses water-wash photopolymer plates, which {{are as good as}} any solvent-washed flexo plate. Today even CtP (computer-to-plate) plates are available making it a full-fledged, modern printing process. Because there is no anilox roller in the process, the make-ready time also goes down when compared to a flexo press. Inking is controlled by keys very much similar to an offset press. UV inks for letterpress are in paste form, unlike flexo. Various manufacturers produce UV rotary letterpress machines, viz. Dashen, Nickel, Taiyo Kikai, KoPack, Gallus, etc. - and offer hot/cold foil stamping, rotary <b>die</b> <b>cutting,</b> flatbed <b>die</b> <b>cutting,</b> sheeting, rotary screen printing, adhesive side printing, and inkjet numbering. Central impression presses are more popular than inline presses due to their ease of registration and simple design.

40|$|Tungsten carbide {{is one of}} the {{essential}} materials used in carbide <b>dies,</b> <b>cutting</b> tools and components under erosion. Although Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is suitable for handling this material, it is not ideal for micro-hole machining due to its hardness property. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the characteristics of EDM micro-hole tungsten carbide using Sodick 3 -axis die sinking machine with 0. 5 mm diameter copper as an electrode. In the current study, the effectiveness of the EDM process was evaluated in terms of material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear rate (EWR) and diameter overcut. Design of Experiment (DOE) method has been adopted and findings on the influence of the process parameters, namely peak current (Ip), pulse on time (ti) and polarity (ve) over MRR, EWR and diameter overcut is presented in this paper. The process employs different range of peak current (1. 5, 3. 0 (A)), pulse on time (3. 2, 6. 4 (μs)) and polarity ((+ve), (-ve)). Experimental results indicate that the MRR increased when the peak current with negative polarity is kept at high level whilst the EWR minimised when the negative polarity with low level of peak current setting is employed. In the case of diameter overcut, it has been found that the use of positive polarity associated with low level pulse on time setting will minimise the diameter overcut and produce a constant micro-hole shape...|$|R
