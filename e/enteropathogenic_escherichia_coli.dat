More specifically, Ler regulates {{the locus of}} enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island genes, which are responsible for creating intestinal attachment and effacing lesions and subsequent diarrhea: LEE1, LEE2, and LEE3. LEE1, 2, and 3 carry the information necessary for a type III secretion system. The transcript encoding the Ler protein is the open reading frame 1 on the LEE1 operon.|$|E
50|$|Yersiniabactin (Ybt) is a {{siderophore}} {{found in}} the pathogenic bacteria Yersinia pestis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica, {{as well as several}} strains of enterobacteria including <b>enteropathogenic</b> <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli.</b> Siderophores, compounds of low molecular mass with high affinities for ferric iron, are important virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. Iron, an essential element for life utilized by such cellular processes as respiration and DNA replication, is extensively chelated by host proteins like lactoferrin and ferritin; thus, the pathogen produces molecules with an even higher affinity for Fe3+ than these proteins in order to acquire sufficient iron for growth. As a part of such an iron-uptake system, yersiniabactin {{plays an important role in}} pathogenicity of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. entercolitica.|$|E
50|$|Tir (translocated intimin receptor) is an {{essential}} component in the adherence of the <b>enteropathogenic</b> <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> (EPEC) and enterohemorraghic Escherichia coli (EHEC) to the cells lining the small intestine. To aid attachment, both EPEC and EHEC possess the ability to reorganise the host cell actin cytoskeleton via the secretion of virulence factors. These factors are secreted directly into the cells using a Type three secretion system. One of the virulence factors secreted is the Translocated Intimin Receptor (Tir). Tir is a receptor protein encoded by the espE gene which {{is located on the}} locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island in EPEC strains. It is secreted into the host cell membranes and acts as a receptor for intimin which is found on the bacterial surface. Once Tir binds intimin, the bacterium is attached to the enterocyte surface.|$|E

40|$|Background: Enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) and <b>enteropathogenic</b> (EPEC) <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> {{epithelial}} cell adhesion is characterised by intimate attachment, and attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion formation. This event is mediated {{in part by}} intimin binding to another bacterial protein, Tir (translocated intimin receptor), which is exported by the bacteria and integrated into the host cell plasma membrane. Importantly, EPEC (O 127 :H 6) and EHEC (O 157 :H 7) express antigenically distinct intimin types known as intimin α and γ, respectively. EHEC (O 157 :H 7) colonises human intestinal explants although adhesion is restricted to the follicle associated epithelium of Peyer's patches. This phenotype is also observed with EPEC O 127 :H 6 engineered to express EHEC intimin γ...|$|R

Sixteen micrograms of CCL per ml inhibited 68 % of all aerobes tested and 80 % of the 211 <b>enteropathogenic</b> organisms (<b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli,</b> Salmonella, and Shigella) isolated from cases of infantile diarrhoea.

Methods: In this experimental study, methanol and aqueous extracts of Vaccinium arctostaphylos fruit were prepared by two methods, maceration and soxhlet. Antimicrobial effects of these extracts were examined by agar diffusion method on two strains of Escherichia coli (ATCC: 8739, ATCC: 25922) and 12 clinical strains of <b>enteropathogenic</b> <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli.</b> Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by microdilution method.

Results: All of the studied strains of Escherichia coli were sensitive to the methanol and aqueous extracts of Vaccinium arctostaphylos fruit. The mean zones of inhibition produced by the extracts were obtained in the range of 10. 6 - 18. 8 mm. Statistical analysis showed that there is a significant relationship between the increase in extracts’ concentrations and inhibition zone diameters (p< 0. 001).
