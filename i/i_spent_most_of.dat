60|$|My lameness, which dated {{from that}} ride down the Navajo cañon, persisted, which was another worriment; for Zulime {{was too busy}} with sewing-women to give much time to me and walking was very painful, hence <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> my day down at the bank, talking with my {{prospective}} father-in-law, who interested me {{much more than the}} sordid little village and its empty landscape. He was a sturdy, slow-moving man with long, gray beard, a powerful and strongly individual thinker, almost as alien to his surroundings as a Hindoo Yoghi would have been. With the bland air of a kindly teacher he met his customers in the outer office and genially discoursed to them of whatever happened to be in his own mind--what they were thinking about was of small account to him.|$|E

Fortune had always played into his hands, he said, and I had no little difficulty in convincing him that matters had passed from his hands into mine. In this I believe I was never entirely successful.

I moved from war to war, from the War of 1898 and U.S. participation in the Boxer Expedition and the Chinese civil war, to the Vietnam War, back to the Korean War, then further back to World War II and forward to the wars of the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Initially, I wrote about all these as if war and peace were discrete: prewar, war, peace, or postwar. Over time, this progression of wars has looked to me less like a progression than a continuation: as if between one war and the next, the country was on hold.|$|R

Haldane looked thoughtful at breakfast; Boone was silent and suspiciously stolid, for he betrayed himself by the very slowness with which he folded back the newspaper brought him to expose the commercial reports. He handed it to Haldane, who nodded, saying nothing. It was a relief to me, at least, when the meal was over, but afterwards the morning passed very heavily, for <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> it haunting a dark telephone box, where Haldane received and dispatched cabalistic messages.

60|$|From my infancy I {{was noted}} for the docility and {{humanity}} of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous {{as to make}} me the jest of my companions.

With these <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.|$|E
