50|$|The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the initial {{approach}} segment of an instrument approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one Initial approach fix and initial approach segment. The initial approach fix is usually a designated intersection, VOR, NDB, or <b>DME</b> <b>fix.</b> The initial approach fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the approach. When initial approach fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no initial approach segment.|$|E
5000|$|The IFR {{flights were}} {{required}} to remain {{within the confines of}} the Los Angeles Group 1 TCA, while smaller planes {{were required to}} remain outside of the TCA, until the designated entry point, which was specified in their assigned VFR TCA arrival. In the case of GW 261, it was to remain outside of the TCA until the 10 <b>DME</b> <b>fix</b> of runway 24 right localizer, and to enter at an altitude of 1,500 feet MSL. The top of the TCA was 7,000 feet, while the base varied, depending on the distance from LAX. That mixed it in with all the other small plane VFR traffic in the Los Angeles Basin, which did not have transponders. Most of those were not flying to LAX, so they were not in radio communication with LAX radar controllers. The only defense was the [...] "see and be seen" [...] method of collision avoidance. That deficient method of traffic separation, failed to work that day, as it has failed many other times in high density traffic areas.|$|E
50|$|DME {{is almost}} always used in {{conjunction}} with VOR, and is normally co-located at a VOR station. This combination allows a single VOR/DME station to provide both angle and distance, and thereby provide a single-station <b>fix.</b> <b>DME</b> is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military TACAN system, and their DME signals can be used by civilian receivers.|$|R
40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) is an {{alternative}} energy and environmentally friendly fuels including used to replace diesel fuel and LPG. Factory dimethyl ether (DME) is planned to be established in the area Bontang, East Kalimantan with a capacity of 20, 000 tons / year. The raw materials used are methanol as much as 30491. 34 tonnes / year from PT. Kaltim Methanol Industry in Bontang, East Kalimantan. Dimethyl ether (DME) is produced {{through a process of}} dehydration of methanol with the catalyst alumina (Al 2 O 3) at a pressure of 14. 9 atm and a temperature of 2500 C. The reactor used in the manufacture of <b>DME</b> is multitube <b>fixed</b> bed reactor. The reaction is exothermic and operates on a non-isothermal non-adiabatic conditions. Product dimethyl ether (DME) that comes out of the reactor into the distillation tower purified to reach a purity of 99. 5...|$|R
40|$|HZSM- 11 zeolite {{supported}} Zn catalysts {{with different}} Zn contents (xZn/HZSM- 11 A) were prepared. In the alkylation of benzene with dimethyl ether (<b>DME)</b> in a <b>fixed</b> bed reactor, the catalyst with Zn content of 6 wt% (6 Zn/HZSM- 11 A) showed appropriate performance. Focus {{was put on}} the comparison between 6 Zn/HZSM- 5 and 6 Zn/HZSM- 11 with the same crystal size of 600 - 800 nm, and also with the similar BET surface area, micropore volume, Si/Al 2 molar ratio, and acidity. In the alkylation of benzene with DME, the 6 Zn/HZSM- 11 showed better activity and stability, and especially enhanced the conversion of benzene and selectivities to xylene and trimethylbenzene, compared with the 6 Zn/HZSM- 5. This was mainly related to the higher adsorption capacity and adsorption-desorption rates to the three adsorbates (benzene, m-xylene and 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene) over the 6 Zn/HZSM- 11 in comparison with the 6 Zn/HZSM- 5...|$|R
