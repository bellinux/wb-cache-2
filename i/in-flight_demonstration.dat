Since there are significant similarities in the research and medical operational requirements, ELA hardware development has emerged as a joint effort between ExMC and HHC. In 2012, four significant accomplishments were achieved towards the development of exploration laboratory analysis for medical diagnostics. These achievements included (i) the development of high priority analytes for research and medical operations, (ii) the development of Level 1 functional requirements and concept of operations documentation, (iii) the selection and head-to-head competition of in-flight laboratory analysis instrumentation, and (iv) the phase one completion of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects under the topic Smart Phone Driven Blood-Based Diagnostics. To utilize resources efficiently, the associated documentation and advanced technologies were integrated into a single ELA plan that encompasses ExMC and HHC development efforts.

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) orbital Systems Test (HOST), an STS- 95 payload, was an <b>in-flight</b> <b>demonstration</b> of HST components to be installed during the next HST servicing mission. One of the components under evaluation was the cryocooler for the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS). Based on concerns about vibrations from {{the operation of the}} NICMOS cryocooler affecting the overall HST line-of-sight requirements, the Space Acceleration Measurement System for Free-Flyers (SAMS-FF) was employed to measure the vibratory environment of the STS- 95 mission, including any effects introduced by the NICMOS cryocooler.

40|$|With view to {{potential}} future space launchers or other hypersonic vehicles {{the demonstration of}} high speed airbreathing propulsion, and especially of the dual mode ramjet combining subsonic and supersonic combustion, is still of great interest. After the national hypersonic research and technology programs in Germany and France (German Hypersonic Technology Program and French Research and Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion - PREPHA (1), the mastery of high-speed airbreathing propulsion technologies {{is not sufficient to}} allow the development of an operational vehicle. Therefore, ONERA and DLR decided to join in a common research program that investigates an airbreathing propulsion system operating from Mach 4 to Mach 8. The general goal of this project, named JAPHAR (Joint Airbreathing Propulsion for Hypersonic Application Research), is to demonstrate the feasibility of the dual mode ramjet and to develop a methodology for on-ground and <b>in-flight</b> performance <b>demonstration.</b> Concurrently with engine studies, the project includes conceptional design studies to define an experimental vehicle for dual mode ramjet testing between Mach 4 and Mach 8 and to find a methodology to evaluate its in-flight performances. Furthermore, this vehicle is the leading configuration for the different component studies within the project and it is used for the global synthesis of the obtained results. In {{order to be able to}} obtain results at different Mach numbers between Mach 4 and 8, even if the scramjet thrust should be lower than expected, the vehicle is boosted up to Ma*= 8 and then performs a few combustion periods on a decelerating trajectory. In order to be representative for a full scale scramjet operation, the engine height was chosen equal to 100 mm. This results in a global vehicle length of 11. 5 m and a weight of about 2 tons. The vehicle is not reusable. During the first design cycle ONERA provided a first definition of the vehicle engine and the associated propulsion dataset. Using this engine ONERA studied a preliminary definition of a vehicle based on the wing-body concept (Fig. 1). Based on the given propulsion geometry DLR additionally defined a waverider configuration (Fig. 2). Using the experiences of former waverider studies (2), (3) which showed that waveriders are excellent designs for TSTO missions the aim is to reduce the required thrust for a horizontal flight at M*= 8. In order to choose the best solution for the project continuation both configurations were compared in detail. Trajectories were defined to compare the global performances. The goal was to obtain significant acceleration to demonstrate the dual mode ramjet thrust and the positive vehicle propulsion balance. The comparison of both vehicles included aerodynamic performances, weight estimations, vehicle global and structural design and trim calculations along the considered trajectories. Based on Navier-Stokes calculations special attention was paid to the flowfield at the entrance of the air intake. The proposed paper will present the details of this comparison...|$|R

The USAF Test Pilot School has traditionally used classroom in-struction followed by <b>in-flight</b> <b>demonstration</b> of test techniques to provide graduates with this understanding. Flying qualities simulation has traditionally seen little use at test pi-lot schools because high-quality simulators are exclusively designed to re-create particular aircraft. This type of simulator, while valuable for pilot training, adds little to a TPS curriculum except a reduction of fidelity and elimination of motion cues–it can only show how a particular aircraft behaves. Recent advances in desktop computer technology and electrically-driven inceptors have allowed the authors at the USAF TPS to create a han-dling qualities simulator that can used as a flying qualities laboratory, a handling qualities research device, and a force multiplier for increasingly valuable curriculum sorties. Built by the authors with off-the-shelf hardware, USAF-owned visual display technology, and open-source software, the TPS flying qualities simulation laboratory can provide everything from complex demonstrations on variable stability platforms to unsupervised operation of almost unlimited aircraft types. It can also be linked with control rooms for test team training.

An {{integral}} part of the required medical care consists of providing intravenous infusion of fluids, electrolyte solutions, and nutrients to sustain an ill or injured crew member. In terrestrial health care facilities, intravenous solutions are normally stored in large quantities. However, due to the station's weight and volume constraints, an adequate supply of the required solutions cannot be carried onboard SSF. By formulating medical fluids onboard from concentrates and station water as needed, the Fluid Therapy System (FTS) eliminates weight and volume concerns regarding intravenous fluids. The first full-system demonstration of FTS is continuous microgravity will be conducted in Spacelab-Japan (SL-J). The FTS evaluation consists of two functional objectives and an <b>in-flight</b> <b>demonstration</b> of intravenous administration of fluids.

40|$|Many common metal {{structures}} of industrial applications are recently optimized or even replaced by lightweight substitutes. Lightweight structures yield less weight at high stiffness and excellent fatigue resistance. Environmental pollution {{as well as}} operational and maintenance costs can thus be reduced in many areas, for example in automotive or aircraft sector. However, the persistence of components built of lightweight structures like carbon fiber reinforced plastics could be seriously affected by impact damages and lead to fatal failure within short, unpredictable time. To handle this concern, lightweight structures have to be monitored consistently by appropriate sensors and all structural information should be collected and analyzed by a suitable system. In this paper, the design and development of a comprehensive monitoring system for aircraft lightweight structures and the final implementation into a flight demonstrator is presented. An ATR 72 {{has been used as}} <b>in-flight</b> <b>demonstration</b> platform, thanks to the common work and support of Finmeccanica and ATR. This system combines two monitoring techniques: piezo-based structural health and optical Fiber Bragg grating-based load monitoring. The structural health monitoring approach is based on broadband acousto-ultrasonic measurements. Here, the structure to be monitored is excited to vibration in a broad frequency band and in parallel the transmitted structural response is acquired and analyzed. Structural changes are reflected in the acquired transfer functions. Damage is detected by the means of correlation functions between current and baseline measurements. For load monitoring optical fibres with integrated Bragg gratings collect strains applied to the monitored structure at crucial points. In this way a load history required for the estimation of the remaining structural service life is provided. Both methodologies have been implemented and tested under real flight conditions...|$|E

Payloads such as Hyperion, EnMAP, HyspIRI, and SCHYAMACHY are instruments with mass in excess of 100 Kg. Technologies recently developed in precision manufacturing of aspherical mirrors, detectors, and spectral filters allow to shrink a hyperspectral instrument in an envelope that will fit on a small satellite, or even in a CubeSat. The reduction of mass, volume, and power {{is not the only}} problems to be solved to successfully use a hyperspectral on board of a small satellite. The amount of data acquired over one orbit can be as high as 1 TB (terabyte). To store and download the data can be unmanageable tasks for the resources of a small satellite. The reduced mass and volume of a compact hyperspectral comes at the expenses of a decreased signal to noise ratio. Can digital image processing and the knowledge acquired with the hyperspectral already in orbit help to compress the data to a manageable size? What type of information can be extracted from a compact hyperspectral? The paper describes the results obtained with the PhytoMapper, a technology demonstrator of a Compact Hyperspectral Instrument recently developed. The instrument fits in a volume of approximately 15 cm^ 3 (6 cubic inches) and has a mass of approximately 2 Kg. The instrument has a spectral resolution of 10 nm, a field of view 34 degrees, and 2400 spectral bands. If flown on a 600 km polar orbit, it will provide 100 m spatial resolution and 3 days revisit time.
