5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the divine and most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user <b>has</b> <b>mastered</b> the full power of both of their eyes, regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it <b>has</b> <b>mastered</b> every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam can engage in precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E

Singing students (däqä mermur) become singers (däbtära) and some will eventually become masters (märigéta).

During fast passages, Satriani favors a legato technique (achieved primarily through hammer-ons and pull-offs) that yields smooth and flowing runs. He is also adept at other speed-related techniques such as rapid alternate picking and sweep picking. Satriani was influenced by blues-rock guitar icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Brian May, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore and Jeff Beck, as well as jazz fusion guitarist Allan Holdsworth.|$|E

500|$|Although this hunter was sharing meat, he was {{not doing}} so in the {{framework}} of reciprocity. The general model of costly signalling is not reciprocal; rather, individuals who share acquire more mates and allies. Costly signalling applies to situations in Kalahari foraging groups where giving often goes to recipients who have little to offer in return. A young hunter is motivated to impress community members with daughters so that he can obtain his first wife. Older hunters may wish to attract women interested in an extramarital relationship, or to be a [...] In these northern Kalahari groups, the killing of a large animal indicates a man who <b>has</b> <b>mastered</b> the art of hunting and can support a family. Generally, many women seek a man who is a good hunter, has an agreeable character, is generous, and has advantageous social ties. Since hunting ability is a prerequisite for marriage, men who are good hunters enter the marriage market earliest. Costly signalling theory explains seemingly wasteful foraging displays.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{declared}} the game's graphics {{to be some}} of the best on the Nintendo 3DS. Eurogamer reviewer Rich Stanton praised the environments for their lighting and particle effects, while GameSpot credited the highly detailed character models, especially those of Jill and some enemies. IGN also highlighted the sound design, saying that [...] "Capcom <b>has</b> <b>mastered</b> the ability to play up a soundtrack when appropriate, sometimes completely cutting to isolated noises in order to focus a player on something truly haunting." [...] Game Revolution stated similar pros, noting that the game is best experienced when played in the dark with headphones on. Tim Turi of Game Informer praised the story for its episodic structure and pacing, but also admitted that BSAA agents Quint and Keith are the worst characters in the series' history. The fact that the game supports the Circle Pad Pro was seen as a valuable feature, as it gives players the ability to move, shoot and control the camera at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Another critic, Maria Tatar, {{notes that}} there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a [...] "linguistic virtuoso", a {{creature}} who <b>has</b> <b>mastered</b> the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, [...] "it {{has something to do with}} inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters." ...|$|E
