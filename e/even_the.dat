5|$|The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> leanest {{concentrated}} deposits are {{at least}} 0.1% mercury, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore in the deposits.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into photons, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.|$|E
5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E

5|$|As seen in {{the credits}} for tracks Young has {{appeared}} on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> producer).|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is consequently one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community. Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive <b>even</b> <b>the</b> slightest empathy from it, {{and even a few}} years earlier his case might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.|$|E

5|$|Babb {{worked in}} various {{areas of the}} {{entertainment}} industry, in both traditional and exploitation genres. He claimed to have made twenty films, and produced for television, radio, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> stage. This is an incomplete collection of works owing {{to the nature of}} the exploitation genre. The titles are as they were finally presented by Babb, with earlier titles noted in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{predation}} of {{the adult}} cicada is common, with wrens and grey fantails, noisy miners, blue-faced honeyeaters, little wattlebirds, grey and pied butcherbirds, magpie-larks, Torresian crows, white-faced herons and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> nocturnal tawny frogmouth, all reported as significant predators. The frogmouths and bearded dragons have been observed feeding on emerging nymphs, however total nymphal mortality is estimated at under 10%.|$|E
5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the constitutional process {{than they had been}} in the decade prior, with <b>even</b> <b>the</b> federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus forms from {{tropical}} cyclones, and {{is commonly}} seen fanning {{out from the}} eyewalls of hurricanes.

5|$|Despite Gilbert's disclaimer, audiences, {{critics and}} <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister {{identified}} Sir Joseph Porter with W. H.
