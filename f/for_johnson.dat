5|$|Tennessee's {{delegation}} did {{not attend}} the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the states would endorse Van Buren. Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote <b>for</b> <b>Johnson,</b> giving him just more than twice the votes cast for Rives, and the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to play. After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Ring’s omission <b>for</b> <b>Johnson,</b> so McCool was left out. After Australia had taken a 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|In November 1955, {{while on}} the sick list for the 49ers due to a {{shoulder}} injury, Johnson carried two women to safety out of a blazing apartment building in Oakland, California. One of the women was his pregnant wife, Barbara Johnson. The couple divorced in 1959, and a bench warrant was issued <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> after he fell $2,360 behind on alimony payments, concurrent with his suspension from the Lions for missing the team plane. After retiring as a player, he worked for Columbia Gas and later for Warner Communications. He had aspirations of coaching football, but the opportunity never arose.|$|E
5|$|Harrison won 19 of the 26 states, {{including}} New York (home to Van Buren), Kentucky (to Johnson) and Tennessee (Jackson). Van Buren did win in Virginia, {{the state}} of birth of both Whig candidates, and in Illinois, with Lincoln defeated for elector. The electoral vote count was 234 for Harrison and 60 for Van Buren, with the popular vote closer at 1,275,390 for Harrison to 1,128,854 for Van Buren. Of the 60 Van Buren electors, 12 did not vote <b>for</b> <b>Johnson,</b> with 11 (all from South Carolina) choosing Littleton W. Tazewell for vice president, and one (from Virginia) favoring Governor James K. Polk of Tennessee. Turnout was 81 percent of eligible voters, setting a record since surpassed only in 1860 and 1876. The Whigs took both houses of Congress, {{and a majority of}} state governorships.|$|E

5|$|In July 2005, Johnson again {{moved on}} loan this time {{returning}} to Crewe Alexandra in a six-month deal. It took him eight games to score his first goal which {{came in a}} 1–1 draw with Plymouth Argyle on 13 September 2005. Three more goals followed {{by the end of}} 2005 including one on Boxing Day against Hull City, who then offered him a permanent deal. Hull and Manchester United agreed a fee <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> but he decided to extend his loan deal at Crewe {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. It was not until the last game of the season against Millwall that he scored another to bring his tally to five from 22games. Having failed to make an impact at Manchester United, Johnson was among seven United players given a free transfer at the end of the 2005–06 season. He was offered a contract at Crewe, but also attracted interest from Barnsley and Bradford City, the latter of whom he joined on a two-year deal in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{found himself}} in a {{difficult}} situation during the Indian leg of the tour. The team—mostly made up of RAAF personnel—had been ill with food poisoning and dysentery, and travelled across the Indian subcontinent by long train journeys. The airmen wanted to travel by air, and threatened to abandon the tour or replace Hassett, an AIF member, with either Keith Carmody or Keith Miller, who were RAAF fighter pilots. However, the standoff was ended when Sismey arranged for a RAAF plane to transport the team. On the playing arena, it was not a happy tour <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> and his men. They lost the three-match series against India 1–0 and recorded only one victory, against South Zone, in their nine matches.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{probably}} began {{fighting in}} June 1783, {{at the age}} of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, and his name {{came to the attention of}} professional fighters. At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27minutes and decided to become a professional.|$|E

5|$|Ring was rested for {{the match}} against the South of England. Australia {{declared}} at 7/522 before the hosts made 298; rain ended the match {{before the second}} innings could start. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the previous Australian tour of England in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team. He made only one change from the team that won the Fifth Test, dropping Ring <b>for</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Australia led by 312 runs on the first innings before persistent rain ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band {{received}} its record deal, the band underwent {{a series of}} misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams came down with health problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his left thumb. Robert Bolin substituted <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> during the band's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson's accident, Williams was water skiing {{with his family in}} Cookeville, Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The propellor slashed Williams' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg's brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} {{back in the}} top {{division}} {{proved to be a}} remarkable one <b>for</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Early in the season he scored five goals in a single match, a 6–2 win away to Everton. He continued to score frequently throughout the season, and by March 1929 he had become only the third Manchester City player to score 30 goals in a season, equalling the record previously set by Tommy Browell and Frank Roberts. He surpassed both in his next match, {{and by the end of}} the season he had scored 38 goals in 39 league appearances, a club record which still stands in 2011, 82 years later. His form during 1929 resulted in an England recall, three years after gaining his previous cap. Johnson scored twice in a 6–0 British Home Championship win against Wales. The other goals were scored by George Camsell (who scored a hat trick) and Hugh Adcock.|$|E

5|$|England batted for {{the second}} time, and after lunch on the fourth afternoon, Bradman set fields to {{restrict}} the scoring, as England passed 100 without loss. Washbrook then hooked Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. He repeated the shot soon after and Harvey took the catch at 1/129, so the Australian captain's miss cost little. Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 2/129. During most of the afternoon, Bradman used a strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, and set a defensive, well-spread field <b>for</b> <b>Johnson,</b> who had been repeatedly attacked by the batsmen. England then reached 8/362 at the close, a lead of 400. England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365. As the batting team is allowed to choose which (if any) roller can be used {{at the start of}} the day's play, this ploy allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia in order to make the batting conditions harder for England. At the start of any innings, the batting captain also has the choice of having the pitch rolled. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would disadvantage his batsmen.|$|E
5|$|England toured Australia in the 1954–55 season. Johnson was {{selected}} to lead an Australian XI in a tour match against the Englishmen before the Tests, {{an indication of the}} selectors' inclination. He took 6/66 in England's only innings. The build-up featured a media war, with Melbourne newspapers stumping <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> while the Sydney journalists trumpeted Miller. Miller warmed up for the Tests with 86 for New South Wales against England. On 18 November, the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain, with Morris as his deputy. Miller's irreverent nature was cited as a possible reason for the board's selection. Johnson was regarded as a superior diplomat, while Miller had a reputation for turning up late and being undisciplined. Miller had frequently been in dispute with Bradman, {{who was a member of}} the board and the chairman of selectors. Miller had also questioned where revenue that the board collected from ticket sales was being used. Others claimed that Johnson was appointed because he was part of the establishment; his father Bill was a former Australian selector. The decision was bitterly criticised by the Sydney press.|$|E
5|$|Supporters rallied and {{collected}} funds <b>for</b> <b>Johnson</b> to complete her {{education in the}} United States, and she enrolled at New York University, completing her Doctor of Education in 1962. When suffrage passed in 1961, Johnson immediately entered the fray, accepting a nomination as a PLP candidate for the Eleuthera District. She wrote a booklet entitled The Next Step: Votes for Women in which she explained useful information for voting, {{such as how to}} register to vote and cast a ballot. She lost the race, but three years later participated in a debate in the push for majority rule on the parliamentary imbalance in the Bahamas with a delegation from the PLP at the United Nations. At that meeting, she met the president of her alma mater from Virginia Union, and agreed to accept a teaching post at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A little over a year later, Johnson left Louisiana and came back to the Bahamas to participate in the 1967 elections. The PLP won the majority of seats and she became the first woman appointee to serve in the Bahamian Senate. One of her first acts was to form a committee to help the Haitian diaspora who had fled to the Bahamas because of unrest in their own country. With an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 refugees and a government decree to stop issuing work permits to Haitians, the situation was critical. The following year, PLP had a landslide victory in the 1968 election and Johnson was reappointed to the Senate, and appointed as the first woman to lead government business.|$|E
