5000|$|The {{components}} of the FBE formulation are weighed and pre-blended in <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mixers.</b> The mix is then transferred to a high-shear extruder. FBE extruders incorporate a single or dual screw setup, rotating within a fixed clamshell barrel. A temperature range from 50 °C to 100 °C is used within the extruder barrel. This setup compresses the FBE blend, while heating and melting it to a semi-liquid form. During this process, the ingredients of the molten mix are dispersed thoroughly. Because of the fast operation of the extruder and relatively low temperature within the barrel, the epoxy and hardener components will not undergo a significant chemical reaction. The molten extrudate then passes between cold-rollers and becomes a solid, brittle sheet. It then moves to a “Kibbler”, which chops it into smaller chips. These chips are ground, using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> grinders (classifiers) to a particle size of less than 150 micrometers (standard specifications requires 100% pass through in 250 micrometer sieves and maximum 3% retains in 150 micrometer sieve).

Short term flexural creep behaviors of the panels were studied at 10, 20, 30, and 40 % of maximum bending load. Results indicated that the composites containing virgin HDPE exhibited higher creep deflection and by increasing the recycled HDPE content the creep deflection decreased in all load levels.

In order to obtain a homogenous mixture, a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mixer</b> with vacuum was applied. Accelerated carbonation tests (10 % CO 2, 20 °C and 60 % RH) were performed on RPC, mixed under vacuum conditions, as a comparison to RPC mixed at atmospheric pressure. The evolution of the carbonation depth was determined by spraying phenolphthalein on a freshly split RPC surface at varying ages (1 to 16 weeks). The microstructure of RPC was investigated by a mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP). The pozzolanic activity of QCS was determined by the Chapelle test, taking into account the carbonation effect on the reference system. The results obtained, showed that no carbonation was detected after 90 days for the RPC containing copper slag both under vacuum condition and atmospheric pressure. The presence of copper slag in the RPC tends to increase the porosity reduction and decrease the strength enhancement when applying vacuum mixing to the mixture.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this project was to optimise extraction of cellulose nanofibres from banana tree and rye grass feedstocks and to investigate the potential use of these products as high value-reinforcing agents in thermoplastic polymers, particularly in polyvinyl alcohol (PV A) and polyethylene (PE). To this end, {{in association with the}} Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBr) in Belfast, the following extraction techniques were investigated to obtain cellulose nanofibres from these natural fibre sources: (i) chemical modification, involving mercerisation, acid hydrolysis and chemical bleaching; (ii) mechanical treatment, using a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> (Turrax) <b>mixer</b> and <b>high</b> pressure microfluidisation and (iii) chemical and mechanical (chemo-mechanical) processes, by combining TEMPO-oxidation and high pressure microfluidisation. The nanofibres produced were characterised using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, particle size measurement (static image analysis and laser diffraction), chemical analysis (zeta potential analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction), and thermogravimetric analysis. It was especially evident that the chemo-mechanical procedure yielded higher aspect ratio nanofibrils, a greater yield and higher crystallinity, than nanofibrils made by solely chemical or mechanical treatments. The cellulose nanofibres obtained were subsequently incorporated into PVA by a solution casting technique. The effect of different treated nanofibres on the mechanical, structural and thermal properties of these composites was determined. It was notable that banana nanofibres made by TEMPO-oxidation and high pressure microfluidisation showed phenomenal reinforcing effects in the PVA. Furthermore, ryegrass nanofibre, derived from the <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> Turrax <b>mixer,</b> was, incorporated into PV A and PE by using more commercially acceptable melt processing procedures, involving surface treatment of the nanofibres using silane coupling agents, their pre-dispersion in a PVA carrier, twin-screw extrusion compounding and compression lamination methodologies. Varying degrees of success were seen, from poor dispersion using cryogenically milled nanofibres, yielding little effect on mechanical properties, to very significant enhancement with melt processable PVA, being of a similar order to solution cast nanofibre-reinforced PVA To assess the relative reinforcing efficiency of cellulose nanofibres, conventional PE composites were also made using macro-scale banana and sisal fibres. To aid compatibility and enhance interfacial bonding between fibre and matrix in this system, maleic anhydride modified polyethylene was applied with both nano- and macro- fibre variants. By way of example, there was a 100 % improvement in tensile modulus of conventional banana fibre-reinforced PE composite with a 30 wt% loading of micron-sized banana fibres, whereas a 300 % improvement was recorded in tensile modulus for cellulose nanofibre-reinforced PVA with only 5 wt% of cellulose nanofibres.

Prior to composite production, the fibre was modified by acetylation {{in the presence}} of perchloric acid. The effect of acetylation of the fibre was assessed on the basis of moisture resistance and dielectric properties of the resulting composites.

Two different types of biocide were mixed with untreated flax fibre, and the samples were exposed to decay fungi for up to 3 months along with control polypropylene. The composites with acetylated fibres showed good protection against fungi, and biocide had less effect on biological resistance. The dielectric properties of the flax-polypropylene composites were also estimated as a function of aging period. The composites with modified fibre showed more improvement in dielectric properties compared to the composites with untreated fibres. The mechanical properties were investigated for those composites.

The finding indicates that this bitumen modification has the ability to enhance conventional and morphology properties of bitumen. In addition, the plasticity interval and Penetration Index (PI) values of bitumen were also increased. Therefore HDPE modified bitumen can resist the previously mentioned road failures.

The objectives of the study is to investigate the effects of EFB fillers, screw speeds and processing temperature on processability and mechanical properties of filled and impact modified PVC-U composite extrudates. To produce the composite extrudates, the PVC resin and the additives were firstly dry blended using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mixer</b> before being extruded into sheets using single screw extruder. Test specimens were prepared and shaped using cutter machine after which impact, flexural and tensile properties were determined. The results showed that only EFB-filled PVC-U composite incorporated with 10 phr of filler can be extruded with the smoother surface whereas at 20 phr the extrudates surfaces changed to be rough. The impact strength of acrylic-impact modified and EFB-filled acrylic-impact modified extrudates increased while CPE-impact modified and EFB-filled extrudates decreased as the screw speed increased. Meanwhile the flexural properties extrudates decreased as the screw speed increased. In terms of temperature effects, the maximum impact strength of impact modified occurred at temperature of 180 Â°C while EFB-filled and EFB-filled acrylic-impact modified occurred at 185 Â°C. The flexural modulus slightly increased while the flexural strength slightly decreased with the increase of temperature. The yield stress and yield strain of extrudates were insignificantly affected by screw speeds but slightly increased as temperature increased.

40|$|With the {{development}} of the oil and gas industry, people started to drill deeper wells to get oil and gas. New weighting materials have been developed to help solve the problem caused by the most commonly used barite. Ilmenite is among one of those with higher specific gravity. It can achieve the same density with adding less weighting materials than using barite. Less solids content in drilling fluid is an advantage in rheological properties. Recently, micronized ilmenite has again been tested in labs, after resolving the abrasiveness and magnetic problem that normal ilmenite created. Due to the composition of ilmenite, iron is likely to precipitate in acidic condition and cause formation damage when using acid to remove the filter cake. The effectiveness of using lower concentration of hydrochloric acid (HCl) as well as using 7. 5 wt% HCl and 7. 5 wt% hydroxyethyl ethylenediamine triacetic acid (HEDTA) to remove the filter cake generated by ilmenite water-based drilling fluids were investigated. To prepare the ilmenite water-based muds, a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mixer</b> was used. After preparing the fluid, the filter cake was generated by high pressure high temperature (HP/HT) filter press at 300 psi and 250 ?F on a sandstone core with 2. 5 in. diameter and 1 in. thickness.

40|$|Starch as a {{renewable}} and biodegradable polymer, is {{an essential}} alternative to synthetic polymers in production of films for food packaging and agricultural mulching applications. The major problem with the plasticized starch is its increased permeability to water vapor and oxygen and its low strength. To improve these properties, nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC), which has the Young’s modulus as high as 134 GPa, has been tried as nanofillers. The major concern in preparation of nanocomposites is the uniform distribution of nanofillers within the starch molecules, which in turn decides their performance characteristics. In this work, we have prepared NCC from microcrystalline cellulose by high pressure homogenization process. Due to high surface energy and hydrophilicity of formed NCC particles, they tend to form aggregates in water. To prevent this, during homogenization, solubilized starch was added as stabilizers. The starch macromolecule stabilized the formed NCC by steric hindrance. The average diameter of nanocellulose prepared without starch was 197. 8 ± 4. 0 nm (Polydispersity index: 0. 239) while that of stabilized by starch was 391. 7 ± 36. 2 nm (Polydispersity index: 0. 458). The increased size corresponds to the coating layer formed by starch molecules. To prepare starch film, soluble starch (4 %) having glycerol (2 %) as plasticizing agent were gelatinized by stirring in hot plate. For nanocomposite starch film, the nanocellulose was added in varying concentrations (2 % and 4 %) to starch / glycerol solution and mixed using a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>mixer</b> for uniform distribution. These solutions were casted on Teflon plates and dried at 50 ºC, overnight. The uniformity of distribution of NCC in the starch film was analyzed by FTIR at multiple locations of the film. Starch stabilized NCC showed comparatively uniform distribution throughout the film surface. The crystalline structure of NCC has {{profound effect on the}} performance characteristics of nanocomposites films. So, the percent change in its crystallinity (1 α and 1 β) is being analyzed during the various steps in processing of the nanocomposites. The water vapor permeability and mechanical strength analysis of films are in progress...|$|E
