40|$|Abstract. Many recent {{results are}} {{concerned}} with interpreting proofs of security done in symbolic models in the more detailed models of computational cryptography. In the case of symmetric encryption, these results stringently demand that no <b>key</b> <b>cycle</b> (e. g. {k}k) can be produced during the execution of protocols. While security properties like secrecy or authentication have been proved decidable for many interesting classes of protocols, the automatic detection of <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> has not been studied so far. In this paper, we prove that deciding the existence of key-cycles is NP-complete for a bounded number of sessions. Next, we observe that the techniques that we use are of more general interest and apply them to reprove the decidability of a significant existing fragment of protocols with timestamps. ...|$|R
40|$|Key-dependent message security, short KDM security, was {{introduced}} by Black, Rogaway and Shrimpton to address the case where <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> occur among encryptions, e. g., a key is encrypted with itself. It was mainly motivated by <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> in Dolev-Yao models, i. e., symbolic abstractions of cryptography by term algebras, and a corresponding soundness result was later shown by Adão et al. However, both the KDM definition and this soundness result do not allow the general active attacks typical for Dolev-Yao models and for security protocols in general. We extend these definitions {{so that we can}} obtain a soundness result under active attacks. We first present a definition AKDM as a KDM equivalent of authenticated symmetric encryption, i. e., it provides chosen-ciphertext security and integrity of ciphertexts even for <b>key</b> <b>cycles.</b> However, this is not yet sufficient for the desired soundness, and thus we give a definition DKDM that additionally allows limited dynamic revelation of keys. We show that this is sufficient for soundness, even in the strong sense of blackbox reactive simulatability (BRSIM) /UC and including joint terms with other operators. We also present constructions of schemes secure under the new definitions, based on current KDM-secure schemes. Moreover, we explore the relations between the new definitions and existing ones for symmetric encryption in detail, in the sense of implications or separating examples for almost all cases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In their seminal work, Abadi and Rogaway [2, 3] {{show that}} the formal (Dolev-Yao) notion of indistinguishability is sound {{with respect to the}} {{computational}} model: messages that are indistinguishable in the formal model become indistinguishable messages in the computational model. However, this result leaves two problems unsolved. First, it cannot tolerate <b>key</b> <b>cycles.</b> Second, it makes the too-strong assumption that the underlying cryptography hides all aspects of the plaintext, including its length. In this paper we extend their work in order to address these problems. We {{show that the}} recently-introduced notion of KDM-security can provide soundness even in the presence of <b>key</b> <b>cycles.</b> For this, we have to consider encryption that reveals the length of plaintexts, which we use to motivate a general examination information-leaking encryption. In particular, we consider the conditions under which an encryption scheme that may leak some partial information will provide soundness and completeness to some (possibly weakened) version of the formal model. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in applying formal methods for validating cryptographic protocols and many results have been obtained. In this paper, we re-investigate and extend the NP-complete decision procedure for a bounded number of sessions [33]. In this setting, constraint systems are now a standard for modeling security protocols. We provide a generic approach to decide general security properties by showing that any constraint system can be transformed in (possibly several) much simpler constraint systems that are called solved forms. As a consequence, we prove that deciding the existence of <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> is NPcomplete for a bounded number of sessions. Indeed, many recent results are concerned with interpreting proofs of security done in symbolic models in the more detailed models of computational cryptography. In the case of symmetric encryption, these results stringently demand that no <b>key</b> <b>cycle</b> (e. g. {k}k) can be produced during the execution of protocols.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a public-key encryption system that remains secure even encrypting messages {{that depend on}} the secret keys in use. In particular, it remains secure under a “key cycle ” usage, {{where we have a}} cycle of public/secret key-pairs (pk i, ski) for i = 1, [...] ., n, and we encrypt each ski under pk (i mod n) + 1. Such usage scenarios sometimes arise in key-management systems and in the context of anonymous credential systems. Also, security against <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> plays a role when relating “axiomatic security ” of protocols that use encryption to the “computational security ” of concrete instantiations of these protocols. The existence of encryption systems that are secure in the presence of <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> was wide open until now: on the one hand we had no constructions that provably meet this notion of security (except by relying on the random-oracle heuristic); on the other hand we had no examples of secure encryption systems that become demonstrably insecure in the presence of key-cycles of length greater than one. Here we construct an encryption system that is circular-secure against chosen-plaintext attacks under the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption (without relying on random oracles). Our proof of security holds even if the adversary obtains an encryption clique, that is, encryptions of ski under pk j for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. We also construct a circular counterexample: a one-way secure encryption scheme that breaks completely if an encryption cycle (of any size) is published. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For {{most basic}} {{cryptographic}} tasks, such as public-key encryption, digital signatures, authentication, key exchange, {{and many other}} more sophisticated tasks, ideal functionalities have been formulated in the simulation-based security approach, along with their realizations. Surprisingly, however, no such functionality exists for symmetric encryption, except for a more abstract Dolev-Yao style functionality. In this paper, we fill this gap. We propose two functionalities for sym-metric encryption, an unauthenticated and an authenticated version, and show {{that they can be}} implemented based on standard cryptographic assumptions for symmetric encryption schemes, namely IND-CCA security and authenticated encryp-tion, respectively, provided that the environment does not create <b>key</b> <b>cycles</b> or cause the so-called commitment problem.

40|$|Cell {{differentiation}} {{and cell}} cycle exit are coordinately regulated during development; however, the molecular logic underlying this regulation is not known. The Drosophila cdk inhibitor Dacapo (Dap) {{is one of}} the <b>key</b> cell <b>cycle</b> regulators that exhibit dynamic expression during development and contribute to the developmental regulation of the cell cycle. In this study, regulation of Dap expression during cell type specification was investigated. The expression of Dap in the R 2 and R 5 precursors of the developing eye and in the newly recruited leg disc femoral sense organ precursors was found to be controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling-regulated transcription factor Pointed (Pnt) and the proneural basic helix-loop-helix proteins Atonal (Ato) and Daughterless (Da). We show that Pnt, Ato, and Da regulate Dap expression directly through their respective binding sites precisely at the time when these transcription factors function to specify neural fates. These results show that Dap expression is directly regulated by developmental mechanisms that simultaneously control cell type specification. This is potentially a general mechanism by which the expression of <b>key</b> cell <b>cycle</b> regulators is coordinated with differentiation during normal development.

Recently significant progress was made in establishing computational soundness results: these results prove that Dolev-Yao style models can be sound with respect to actual cryptographic realizations and security definitions.
