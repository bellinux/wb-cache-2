5|$|<b>Damage</b> <b>was</b> also {{reported}} in Prince Edward Island {{as a result}} of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> {{also reported}} across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> quite localized; little <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{entered the}} Caribbean as a Category2 {{hurricane}} through the Saint Lucia Channel on August 17. It moved briskly between the Lesser Antillean islands of St. Lucia and Martinique, with its storm surge and rain bands reaching every {{island in the}} chain. <b>Damage</b> <b>was</b> most severe in Martinique where total <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> estimated at €400million and three indirect deaths, while nearby Guadaloupe suffered €400million of damage. In St. Lucia, <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> mostly caused by the high seas and was estimated at US$18million.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Cyclone Magda's arrival, several {{severe weather}} {{warnings}} were issued for the coastline of Western Australia. Although the storm made landfall with winds of 130km/h (80mph), <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> limited {{due to the}} sparsely populated region it struck. The most severe <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> defoliation around Kuri Bay. Following its usage, the name Magda was retired and replaced with Megan.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Madeline, 15,000 people {{evacuated}} form the coast, which had already been impacted by Hurricane Liza. Heavy <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> reported, along with seven fatalities. Two dams were flooded; extensive crop <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> reported.|$|E
5|$|Severe <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> done to {{the church}} in 1400 during the {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr; his forces also destroyed the Bishop's Palace at Llandaff. The <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> extensive enough to cause Bishop Blethyn to notify his fellow clergymen in 1575 that he believed the cathedral to possibly be damaged beyond repair. Most of the other <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> repaired, most notably by Bishop Marshall, whose reredos partly survives. The northwest tower, the one without a spire, was added by Jasper Tudor and is now named after him. He assumed the lordship of Cardiff after the accession to the throne of his nephew, King Henry VII of England.|$|E
50|$|At common law, <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> {{categorized}} into compensatory (or actual) damages, and punitive <b>damages.</b> Compensatory <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> further categorized into special <b>damages,</b> which <b>are</b> {{economic losses}} such as loss of earnings, property damage and medical expenses, and general <b>damages,</b> which <b>are</b> noneconomic <b>damages</b> such as {{pain and suffering}} and emotional distress.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Raymond Jack QC {{held that}} the Government {{had no right to}} {{rescission}} or damages. The contract could not have been rescinded because the plane had been sold. So counter restitution was impossible. It followed that s 2(2) <b>damages</b> <b>were</b> unavailable, because <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> dependent according to the provision's wording on the right to rescission. <b>Damages</b> <b>are</b> available only as a substitute for rescission when the court believes <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> more equitable as a solution. Judge Raymond Jack QC said, ...|$|R
50|$|Punitive <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> often awarded if {{compensatory}} <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> deemed {{an inadequate}} remedy.

5|$|There were 21deaths in New England, {{including}} eight drownings in Maine. Throughout the United States, <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> {{estimated at}} $42,815,000. <b>Damage</b> <b>was</b> less from Edna than from Carol, {{primarily due to}} its strongest winds not occurring {{at the time of}} highest tides, and its track farther to the east. Throughout New England, 260,000people lost power, most of whom in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|A major {{effect of}} this kind of {{structural}} <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> that it created fuel for fires that were started simultaneously throughout the severe destruction region.|$|E

50|$|Most damage {{occurs during}} the first instar, when the sod webworm only feeds on the foliage of the turfgrass. <b>Damage</b> <b>is</b> often seen as a small area of leaves that are yellow to brown.

Even though <b>damage</b> can <b>be</b> an eyesore, it does not hurt the turf because no <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> done to the crown of the plant. In closely mown turf and drought conditions, <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> more severe than in poorly maintained turf. In closely mown turf, symptoms will appear more quickly and prominently.

40|$|Radiation <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> {{reported}} on CCDs (charge-coupled devices) {{that have been}} primarily exposed to 1. 25 -MeV gamma rays (Co- 60 source).

5|$|<b>Damage</b> <b>was</b> {{heaviest}} in Salter Path, North Carolina {{and along}} the Outer Banks near that community, where (despite being only a Category 1 storm) many buildings suffered significant damage {{as a result of}} the storm surge, which has been described as worse than Hurricane Isabel in 2003 and even compared to Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Nearly all of the significant damage occurred on the sound side, or the side facing the mainland. In addition, several piers and many boats were damaged or destroyed by Ophelia's storm surge. <b>Damage</b> <b>was</b> generally lighter on the mainland, and overall structural <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> relatively light, although there was considerable flooding reported in the Wilmington area. <b>Damage</b> <b>was</b> initially estimated to be about $1.6billion, but in final analysis was dropped to only $70million (2005USD; $77.3million 2008USD).
