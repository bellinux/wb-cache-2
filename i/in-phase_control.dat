40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} turbulent flow {{in a plane}} channel using spanwise alternatively distributed strips (SADS) are performed to investigate the characteristics of large-scale streamwise vortices (LSSVs) induced by small-scale active wall actuations, and their role in suppressing flow separation. SADS control is obtained by alternatively applying out-of-phase control (OPC) and <b>in-phase</b> <b>control</b> (IPC) to the wall-normal velocity component of the lower channel wall, in the spanwise direction. Besides the non-controlled channel flow simulated as a reference, four controlled cases with 1, 2, 3 and 4 pairs of OPC/IPC strips are studied at M =[*] 0. 2 and Re =[*] 6, 000, based on the bulk velocity and the channel half height. The case with 2 pairs of strips, whose width is Δz+ =[*] 264 based on the friction velocity of the non-controlled case, {{is the most effective}} in terms of generating large-scale motions. It is also found that the OPC (resp. IPC) strips suppress (resp. enhance) the coherent structures and that leads {{to the creation of a}} vertical shear layer, which is responsible for the LSSVs presence. They are in a statistically steady state and their cores are located between two neighbouring OPC and IPC strips. These motions contribute significantly to the momentum transport in the wall-normal and spanwise directions showing potential for flow separation suppression...|$|E
40|$|The {{large-scale}} streamwise vortex (LSSV) generation {{mechanism in}} the {{turbulent boundary layer}} is {{closely linked to the}} turbulent mixing process and its potential to suppress flow separation. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of weakly compressible (Ma = 0. 2) turbulent channel ow using Spanwise Alternatively Distributed Strips (SADS) Control are conducted to investigate the characteristics of LSSV induced by small-scale wall actuation. The compressible DNS code ASTR is used as a solver and the mesh dimension is 392 x 192 x 256 for a channel of 2 pi x 2 x 2 pi size. The DNS of the unperturbed case is first validated against the incompressible DNS data of Moser et al. SADS are then obtained by applying out-of-phase control (OPC) and <b>in-phase</b> <b>control</b> (IPC), as presented in Figure 1 (a). The turbulent coherent structures in the channel using SADS are alternatively enhanced and suppressed by SADS, as presented in Figure 1 (b). Instantaneous and mean velocity fields, shown in Figure 2, present large-scale modes in the y-z plane. Large-scale low-speed regions are identified above the OPC strips and when observing the mean velocity field, the low-speed region exhibits a steady flow streak structure. Near-wall velocities increase above the IPC region because turbulence is enhanced there. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and Reynolds shear stress (RSS) both increasein the near-wall region above the IPC strips. This is attributed to the activated near-wall turbulence generated by IPC. However, in the region above the OPC strips, large-scale clusters are present, with higher values of TKE and RSS in the outer part of the channel, although the turbulence coherent structures in the near-wall region are supressed by OPC. Therefore, the LSSVs generated by the current small-scale wall actuation present a strong ability in enhancing momentum transport and mixing. All the simulations are conducted on the UK national facility ARCHER using 2, 400 cores...|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} of regulating power flow in Nigerian Grid System using UPFC {{is the main}} focus in this paper. Consequently, three control methods, namely, voltage control through shunt compensation, real power flow control through quadrature voltage injection and reactive power flow <b>control</b> through <b>in-phase</b> voltage injection for the UPFC were examined {{in order to improve}} the transient stability of the power system. The quadrature voltage control was found to be effective in reducing the transient swings whereas <b>in-phase</b> voltage <b>control</b> was effective in improving the transient stability margin. Finally, the overall performance of the UPFC was evaluated in a single-machine infinite bus system by nonlinear simulations, and results obtained showed the effectiveness of the controller in improving the dynamic stability of the system and provide better damping to electromechanical oscillations...|$|R
40|$|Many {{structural}} {{components of}} nuclear power plant systems are made of austenitic stainless steels. These structures undergo degradation by thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) caused by simultaneous cyclic straining and temperature cycling, particularly during start-up, shut-down and transient operations. The present work reports the cyclic deformation behavior and fatigue damage of austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L during TMF and isothermal fatigue (IF) testing in air. Total strain <b>controlled</b> <b>in-phase</b> TMF loading in the temperature range 200 - 600 °C and isothermal fatigue (IF) at 600 °C were performed. Hardening/softening curves, cyclic stress-strain response and fatigue life diagrams were obtained both for TMF and IF tests. Fatigue damage was documented using surface relief and fracture surface observations. Mean stress evolution and fatigue degradation data are employed to discuss the fatigue behavior of 316 L steel both in TMF and IF regimes...|$|R
40|$|Vector {{control is}} a most {{effective}} strategy to achieve rapid and accurate torque/speed control of AC motors. Its principle is to identify the machine rotor flux axis, and to then use this knowledge to <b>control</b> <b>in-phase</b> and quadrature current components to achieve precise torque control under varying load conditions. Accurate current regulation is essential for good vector control. However, while AC current regulation has been intensely researched over many years, designing a good current regulator still remains an uncertain mix of theory and practice. This paper presents a detailed comparison of four alternative PI and hysteresis based current regulation strategies, and compares {{the performance of a}} standard vector controller using these strategies. The results show that when properly tuned, all four strategies are essentially equivalent, and the choice between them need only be {{made on the basis of}} convenience and/or cost...|$|R
40|$|A fine {{balance between}} {{neuronal}} excitation and inhibition governs the physiological {{state of the}} brain. It has been hypothesized that when this balance is lost {{as a result of}} excessive excitation or reduced inhibition, pathological states such as epilepsy emerge. Decades of investigation have shown this to be true in vitro. However, in vivo evidence of the emerging imbalance during the &#x 22;latent period&#x 22; between the initiation of injury and the expression of the first spontaneous behavioral seizure has not been demonstrated. Here, we provide the first demonstration of this emerging imbalance between excitation and inhibition in vivo by employing long term, high temporal resolution, and continuous local field recordings from microelectrode arrays implanted in an animal model of limbic epilepsy. We were able to track both the inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic field activity during the entire latent period, from the time of injury to the occurrence of the first spontaneous epileptic seizure. During this latent period we observe a sustained increase in the firing rate of the excitatory postsynaptic field activity, paired with a subsequent decrease in the firing rate of the inhibitory postsynaptic field activity within the CA 1 region of the hippocampus. Firing rates of both excitatory and inhibitory CA 1 field activities followed a circadian- like rhythm, which is locked near <b>in-phase</b> in <b>controls</b> and near anti-phase during the latent period. We think that these observed changes are implicated in the occurrence of spontaneous seizure onset following injury...|$|R
40|$|A DSP-based {{control system}} has been {{designed}} {{for use in the}} ISAC pre-buncher. This system uses three harmonics of the 11. 667 Mhz fundamental to synthesize a sawtooth waveform for driving the pre-buncher cavity. A total of four DSPs are used, with a single 24 -bit DSP providing both <b>in-phase</b> and quadrature <b>control</b> of each harmonic. The complete system including low-level rf components is housed in a VXI rack. The supervisory control consists of a Windows-based server, which broadcasts system status using datagrams, and listens on control commands via TCP. JAVA-based control clients, running either as standalone applications or as WWW applets, interpret these messages to provide control and display of the system operating parameters. 1 Introduction This paper describes the hardware and software design of the pre-buncher control system. The conceptual and rf design were dealt with in an earlier paper [1]. Like the current TRIUMF cyclotron control system [2] and many similar systems elsew [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed for investigating boundary layer transition control for a flat plate boundary layer. Active control of a periodically forced boundary layer in an incompressible fluid is studied using surface heating techniques. The spatially evolving boundary layer is simulated. The Navier-Stokes and energy equations are integrated using a fully implicit finite difference/spectral method. Temperature perturbations are introduced locally along finite heater strips to directly attenuate the instability waves in the flow. A feedback control loop is employed in which a downstream sensor is used to monitor wall shear stress fluctuations. Active control of small amplitude two-dimensional and three-dimensional disturbances is numerically simulated. With proper phase <b>control,</b> <b>in-phase</b> reinforcement and out-of-phase attenuation are demonstrated. A receptivity study of the localized temperature perturbations is made. It is shown that narrow heater strips are more receptive in that they maximize the amplitude level of the disturbances in the flow. Active control of {{the early stages of}} the fundamental breakdown process is also numerically simulated. Control is achieved with either two-dimensional or three-dimensional control inputs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Various endometrial {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} associated with luteal phase deficiency: a significant dyssynchrony in the maturation of the glandular epithelium and the stroma and a prevalence of out-of-phase endometrial biopsy specimens. Out-of phase endometrium is a controversial disorder related to failed implantation, infertility and early pregnancy loss. Given that the regulation of the apoptotic process in endometrium of luteal phase deficiency is still unknown, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis and the levels of the main effector caspase, caspase- 3 in the luteal in-phase and out-of-phase endometrium. Methods Thirty-seven endometrial samples from sterile or recurrent abortion patients were included in this study: 21 <b>in-phase</b> samples (<b>controls)</b> and 16 samples with out-of-phase endometrium. Biopsy specimens of eutopic endometrium were obtained from all subjects during days 21 - 25 of the menstrual cycle. The endometrium with endometrial maturity of cycle day 25 or less at the time of menstruation was considered out-of phase. Endometrial tissues were fixed in 10 % buffered formaldehyde. For apoptosis quantification, sections were processed for in situ immunohistochemical localization of nuclei exhibiting DNA fragmentation, by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated dUTP digoxygenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique. Expressions of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) as a marker of cell proliferation, and of cleaved caspase- 3 as a marker of apoptosis, were assessed by immunohistochemistry in the luteal in-phase and out-of-phase endometrium from infertile and recurrent abortion patients. Results Luteal out-of-phase endometrium had increased apoptosis levels compared to in-phase endometrium (p Conclusions this study represents the first report describing variations at the cell proliferation and cell death levels in the out-of-phase endometrium in comparison with in-phase endometrium from infertile and recurrent abortion patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate a potential role of these alterations in the physiopathology of luteal phase deficiency. </p...|$|R

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2011. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 92 - 96. Synchronization is {{a phenomenon}} that is widely encountered in nature, life sciences and engineering. There exist various synchronization definitions in various research fields. The general definition for synchronization is the adjustment of rhythms of oscillating systems due to their weak interaction. Synchronization problem depends {{on the type of}} applications that require suitable properties and comparison functions. Different applications require different properties and comparison functions. Throughout our study, we choose the comparison function to be the difference of the states variables of the systems in hand. In this thesis, we will present types and methods of synchronization which has practical applications, i. e. mechanical systems. Then, we will investigate the passive <b>controlled</b> <b>in-phase</b> synchronization of spring-damper coupled single and double pendulum systems by using various stability analysis for both the system in hand and its appropriately defined error dynamics. We mostly achieved in-phase synchronization in these coupled pendulum systems with a few exceptions which are based on several conditions. Finally, we will explain the masterslave synchronization of two ball hoppers using two different gait controllers, namely, fully-actuated and under-actuated controllers. By using fully-actuated controller for the slave hopper, we achieved apex state synchronization and by using under-actuated controller for the slave hopper, we achieved apex position synchronization between these two hoppers in master slave configuration.

40|$|Patients with Parkinson’s disease {{have great}} {{difficulty}} in performing bimanual movements; {{this problem is}} more obvious when they perform bimanual anti-phase movements. The underlying mechanism of this problem remains unclear. In the current study, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to study the bimanual coordination associated changes of brain activity and inter-regional interactions in Parkinson’s disease. Subjects were asked to perform right-handed, bimanual in-phase and bimanual anti-phase movements. After practice, normal subjects performed all tasks correctly. Patients with Parkinson’s disease performed in-phase movements correctly. However, some patients still made infrequent errors during anti-phase movements; they tended to revert to in-phase movement. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the supplementary motor area was more activated during anti-phase movement than <b>in-phase</b> movement in <b>controls,</b> but not in patients. In performing anti-phase movements, patients with Parkinson’s disease showed less activity in the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area, and had more activation in the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus and cerebellum compared with normal subjects. The basal ganglia and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were less connected with the supplementary motor area, whereas the primary motor cortex, parietal cortex, precuneus and cerebellum were more strongly connected with the supplementary motor area in patients with Parkinson’s disease than in controls. Our findings suggest that dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia, abnormal interactions of brain networks and disrupted attentional networks are probably important reasons contributing to the difficulty of the patients in performing bimanual anti-phase movements. The patients require more brain activity and stronger connectivity in some brain regions to compensate for dysfunction of the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia in order to perform bimanual movements correctly...|$|R
