Jim rebukes Pam for listening to Roy when he is clearly wrong and acting selfish, which creates tension between them. Pam then tells the camera she is happy with her life now, and that they do not even make her dream house in Scranton. She then breaks down and cries <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> As the day comes to a close, Michael leaves the warehouse in complete disarray.|$|E

Several of the writers and researchers also occasionally appeared <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> including Punt, Jenner, George Sawyer and Susie Donkin, while actors Mathew Baynton and Ben Willbond sometimes contributed to the writing. Laurence Rickard was recruited solely as a writer, but found himself part of both the senior writing staff and starring cast after creating the character of Bob Hale, whose extended, convoluted monologues proved impossible to hand over to anyone else.|$|E

5|$|Thompson auditioned in 2006 for {{the role}} of Cameron McIntyre in the long-standing British soap opera Coronation Street. The part would have had him be {{on-screen}} friends with Chesney Brown, played by Sam Aston, who Thompson already knew from the Carol Godby Theatre Workshop. Producers for Coronation Street, however, were so impressed by Thompson that they asked him to audition for a different role. His try-out was successful and he was given a six-month contract, along with the option to extend it for up to a year. He was cast as Ryan Connor, a boy who moves to Weatherfield—the fictional Greater Manchester setting of Coronation Street—with his mother, Michelle (played by actress and former Hear'Say band member Kym Marsh), and her brothers, Liam (Rob James-Collier) and Paul (Sean Gallagher). The Bolton News reported that Thompson would spend between one and two days <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> and that he would be given an on-set tutor to help complete his school work.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
