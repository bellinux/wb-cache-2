500|$|McLachlan was {{appointed}} Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1959, before being posted to Washington, DC, as attaché {{heading up the}} Australian Joint Services Staff in 1961. During his term in the US, Australia ordered the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber {{as a replacement for}} the Canberra. Despite what was touted as a firm timetable and cost schedule for the order, McLachlan confided to a colleague that he had serious concerns about when and if the RAAF would actually get the F-111, and what the final cost would be. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, [...] "even for such a shrewd and sardonic man as McLachlan, that was to prove a painfully prescient observation", as the new bomber was delivered six years late and massively over budget. Following his return from Washington, McLachlan became Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE) in February 1964. As AMSE he sat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers, chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. In this position he worked to increase the proportion of tertiary educated supply officers, following similar achievements among engineering officers in the RAAF's Technical Branch. He {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1966 New Year's Honours, the citation noting particularly his chairmanship of the two [...] "historic" [...] committees that reorganised RAAF College and the Air Force's command structure in the late 1950s.

The pressure measurements were made for the following parameters velocity, angle of attack, mass flow, reduced frequency, and amplitude of oscillation of the engine performing pitch oscillations. For the wing/engine combination, the unsteady interference effects for engine oscillation on the pressure side of the wing are strongly affected by flow separation at the wing/pylon connection.
