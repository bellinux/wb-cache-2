5|$|In 1864, Rodin {{began to}} live with a young {{seamstress}} named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he would stay– with ranging commitment– {{for the rest of his}} life. The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard,</b> but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in Belgium, where they would work on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{graduated}} from Chorrillos in 1962 with a specialization in engineering. He returned to Panama {{and joined the}} Panama National Guard. Posted to Colón, {{he was given a}} commission as a second lieutenant in September 1962. His commanding officer in Colón was Omar Torrijos, then a Major <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard.</b> Torrijos became a patron and mentor to Noriega, protecting him when he ran into trouble. In a 1962 incident, according to journalist John Dinges, Torrijos helped Noriega avoid legal problems after a prostitute accused Noriega of beating and raping her. Soon after, Noriega's drinking and violence obliged Torrijos to confine him to his quarters for a month. Despite Noriega's problems, Torrijos maintained their relationship, ensuring they were always in the same command; he also brought Díaz Herrera into the same unit. Díaz Herrera and Noriega became both friends and rivals for Torrijos's favor. In 1966, Noriega was again involved in a violent incident, allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl and beating her brother. After this Torrijos transferred Noriega to a remote posting.|$|E

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Sampson worked to control {{government}} costs, but endorsed highway progression. A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of Kentucky's counties applying for federal aid. As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent, the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region. In 1931, mine owners began firing workers who joined the union. Many of these workers gathered in Evarts, Kentucky. The local sheriff added 26 deputies to his staff, helping enforce the blacklisting of these miners and discourage further organization. Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office. Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid-April 1931. On May 5, 1931, three guards and a miner were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts. Two days later, Sampson called <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Guard</b> to disarm both the mine guards and the union miners. All of the union's leaders were arrested, and the strike ultimately failed.|$|E
