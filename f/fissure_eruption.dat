25|$|On 29 August at 00:02, seismic tremor {{observations}} indicated lava had erupted approximately 5km {{north of the}} margin of the Dyngjujökull glacier and confirmed by visual observations. The <b>fissure</b> <b>eruption</b> breached the surface between Bárðarbunga and Askja, close to the northernmost point of the earthquake swarm, in the Holuhraun lava field 42km to the northeast of the caldera.|$|E
25|$|At 04:00 on 31 August another <b>fissure</b> <b>eruption</b> began {{along the}} same fissure previously, {{estimated}} to be about 1.5km long. By 07:00 the lava flow was 1km wide and 3km long, extending to the north-east and several metres thick; the lava output was approximately 1000 cubic metres per second. Gas emissions had increased but no ash cloud was detected. At about 13:00 a M5.1 earthquake occurred in the caldera. GPS measurements showed continuing changes {{to the north of}} the eruption, seismic activity had decreased but was otherwise similar to previous days.|$|E

25|$|The <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> continued, {{producing}} 100–200m3/s of lava which covered about 16km2 by 7 September. Lava had now {{reached the}} western part of the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of the historic eruptions recorded at Miyakejima volcano were <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> that occurred on the flanks of the volcano. During the last 1100 years, 17 <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> have been reported with a mean interval of about 76 – 78 years. In the last century, the mean interval between <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> decreased to 21 – 22 years, increasing significantly the threat of lava flowinundations to people and property. Herewe quantify the lava flow hazards posed by effusive eruptions inMiyakejima by combining field data, numerical simulations and probability analysis. Our analysis {{is the first to}} assess both the spatiotemporal probability of vent opening, which highlights the areas most likely to host a new eruption, and the lava flow hazard, which shows the probabilities of lava-flow inundation in the next 50 years. Future eruptive vents are expected {{in the vicinity of the}} Hatchodaira caldera, radiating from the summit of the volcano toward the costs. Areas more likely to be threatened by lava flows are Ako and Kamitsuki villages, as well as Miike port and Miyakejima airport. Thus, our results can be useful for risk evaluation, investment decisions, and emergency response preparation...|$|R
500|$|Kings Bowl Lava Field erupted {{during a}} single <b>fissure</b> <b>eruption</b> on the {{southern}} part of the Great Rift about 2,250 years ago. This eruption probably lasted only a few hours to a few days. The field preserves explosion pits, lava lakes, squeeze-ups, basalt mounds, and an ash blanket. The Wapi Lava Field probably formed from a <b>fissure</b> <b>eruption</b> at the same time as the Kings Bowl eruption. More prolonged activity over a period of months to a few years led to the formation of low shield volcanos in the Wapi field. The Bear Trap lava tube, between the Craters of the Moon and the Wapi lava fields, is a cave system more than [...] long. The lava tube is remarkable for its length and for the number of well-preserved lava cave features, such as lava stalactites and curbs, the latter marking high stands of the flowing lava frozen on the lava tube walls. The lava tubes and pit craters of the monument are known for their unusual preservation of winter ice and snow into the hot summer months, due to shielding from the sun and the insulating properties of basalt.|$|E
2500|$|Note that, {{according}} to contemporary records, Hekla did not erupt in 1783; its previous eruption was in 1766. The Laki <b>fissure</b> <b>eruption</b> was [...] {{to the east}} and the Grímsvötn volcano was erupting about [...] north east. [...] Additionally Katla, only [...] south east, was still renowned after its spectacular eruption 28 years earlier in 1755.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{detailed}} study and {{summary of the}} Quaternary volcanism of Anatolia, Yilmaz et al. recognized four phases {{to the construction of}} Mount Ararat from volcanic rocks exposed in glacial valleys deeply carved into it flanks. First, they recognized a <b>fissure</b> <b>eruption</b> phase of Plinian-subPlinian fissure eruptions that deposited more than [...] of pyroclastic rocks and a few basaltic lava flows. These volcanic rocks were erupted from approximately north northwest–south southeast-trending extensional faults and fissures prior to the development of Mount Ararat. Second, a cone-building phase began when the volcanic activity became localized at a point along a fissure. During this phase, the eruption of successive flows of lava up to [...] thick and pyroclastic flows of andesite and dacite composition and later eruption of basaltic lava flows, formed the Greater Ararat cone with a low conical profile. Third, during a climatic phase, copious flows of andesitic and basaltic lavas were erupted. During this phase, the current cones of Greater and Lesser Ararat were formed as eruptions along subsidiary fissures and cracks and flank occurred. Finally, the volcanic eruptions at Mount Ararat transitioned into a flank eruption phase during which a major north–south-trending fault offset the two cones developed along with a number of subsidiary fissures and cracks on the volcano's flanks. Along this fault and the subsidiary fissures and cracks, a number of parasitic cones and domes were built by minor eruptions. One subsidiary cone erupted voluminous basalt and andesite lava flows. They flowed across the Doğubeyazıt plain and along the southerly flowing Sarısu River. These lava flows formed black ʻaʻā and pāhoehoe lava flows that contain well preserved lava tubes. The radiometric dating of these lava flows yielded radiometric ages of 0.4, 0.48 and 0.81 Ma. Overall, radiometric ages obtained from the volcanic rocks erupted by Mount Ararat range from 1.5 to 0.02 Ma.|$|E
50|$|The {{volcanism}} in the Agua Poca area {{began as}} <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> that released {{large amounts of}} liquid lavas, forming Agua Poca, El Escorial, Payun Matru and other volcanoes. The volcano is located 530 km east of the Peru-Chile Trench, in the back-arc region.|$|R
50|$|The {{field is}} made up of 58 Pleistocene-Holocene tholeiitic cones. The two best {{preserved}} cones (Leihuling and Ma'anshan (马鞍山)) are on an East-West fracture line that contains 30 young cones in the Shishan (石山) and Yongzing regions. Historically, small <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> have been recorded from the Lingao and Chengmai areas.|$|R
40|$|<b>Fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> {{may provide}} {{important}} {{information on the}} shallow propagation of dikes at volcanoes. Somma-Vesuvius (Italy) consists of the active Vesuvius cone, bordered to the north by {{the remnants of the}} older Somma edifice. Historical chronicles are considered to define the development of the 37 <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> between A. D. 1631 and 1944. The 1631 fissure, which reopened the magmatic conduit, migrated upward and was the only one triggered by the subvertical propagation of a dike. The other 25 <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> migrated downward, when the conduit was open, through the lateral propagation of radial dikes. We suggest two scenarios {{for the development of the}} fissures. When the summit conduit is closed, the fissures are fed by vertically propagating dikes. When the summit conduit is open, the fissures are fed by laterally propagating dikes along the volcano slopes. Consistent behaviors are found at other composite volcanoes, suggesting a general application to our model, independent of the tectonic setting and composition of magma. At Vesuvius, the historical data set and our scenarios are used to predict the consequences of the emplacement of fissures after the opening of the conduit. The results suggest that, even though the probability of opening of vents within the inhabited south and west slopes is negligible, the possibility that these are reached by a lava flow remains significant...|$|R

40|$|Linear, hummocky pillow mound {{volcanism}} dominates at {{slow and}} intermediate spreading rate mid-ocean ridges. Volcanic hummocks {{are thought to}} be formed by low effusion rates or as a result of flow focussing during effusive <b>fissure</b> style <b>eruptions</b> in which the initial dike intercepts the seafloor and erupts along its entire length. In this study, high-resolution autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) bathymetry is used to accurately map the extents of four historical <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> of the Juan de Fuca and Gorda ridges: on the North Gorda, North Cleft, and CoAxial ridge segments. The four mapped eruptions take the form of pillow mounds, which are similar in both lithology and dimension to hummocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Pillow mounds may be isolated, or coalesce to form composite mounds, aligned as ridges or as clustered groups. In three of the four mapped sites, the eruptions were discontinuous along their lengths, with pillow mounds and composite mounds commonly separated by areas of older seafloor. This style of discontinuous eruption is inconsistent with typical en echelon <b>fissure</b> <b>eruptions</b> and is probably due to a mildly overpressured, fingering dike intersecting the seafloor along parts of its length...|$|R

40|$|Convective plumes {{that rise}} above Hawaiian-style fire fountains consist of {{volcanic}} gases, aerosols, fine ash, and entrained heated air.
