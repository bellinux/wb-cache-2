5000|$|In most countries, the {{aircraft}} call sign or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also known as registration marks) {{are linked to the}} <b>international</b> <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, {{the aircraft}} itself) receive call signs consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter call sign beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a call sign beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx call signs, and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx call signs. In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter call signs, such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian {{aircraft call sign}}s (see below).|$|E

It is also used in Amateur <b>Radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> such as XXØXX, XØXXX, and so on in the United States and in other countries.

50|$|On April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic station MGY, busily {{delivering}} telegram {{traffic from}} ship's passengers to the coastal station at Cape Race, Newfoundland (<b>call</b> <b>sign</b> MCE), would receive warnings of ice fields from Marconi stations aboard the M.V. Mesaba (<b>call</b> <b>sign</b> MMU) and the S.S.

50|$|As {{broadcast}} stations became {{commonplace in}} the 1920s, some original three and four-letter call signs were reassigned as the corresponding ships {{were removed from}} U.S. registry. The WSB call sign had been held by two ships (the SS Francis H. Leggett, shipwrecked off Oregon's coast on September 18, 1914, and later the Firwood, a ship destroyed by fire near Peru on December 18, 19195) before being assigned to the Atlanta Journal for use by its presumably unsinkable Atlanta, Georgia broadcast radio station in 1922. Similarly WEZU, the <b>international</b> <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of the ship SS Lash Atlantico, was assigned in 1997 to a broadcast station.6 Additional call signs would be reassigned to coastal stations or moved from marine radio to terrestrial broadcast radio when ships were sold for registration to foreign nations, as the new owners would obtain new, local call signs for any existing shipboard radio stations.|$|E

25|$|Also, in Taiwan, another contradiction was the <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for {{the fire}} trucks or rescue vehicles. For reasons to avoid {{unwanted}} attentions and to remain secrecy, all <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> for all police vehicles were uncorrelated with the missions of the subject vehicles, unnecessarily including fire trucks, rescue vehicles, and ambulances of fire brigades. When fire police teams were responding to an emergency situation, these confusing <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> inevitably led to chaos and time delay. A successful fire chief, Chao Kang (趙鋼), convinced the police high command to rearrange the <b>radio</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> assignment for all fire vehicles. Chao Kang then was appointed as the Commissioner of Taiwan Provincial Fire Administration, and the Director-General of National Fire Agency from 10 September 2000 to September 2002.|$|R
