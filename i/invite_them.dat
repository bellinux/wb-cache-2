5|$|Half-demon Callie Maggotbone's demon father Aldermach is {{pressuring}} her {{to break}} up with her boyfriend Mark Lilly and marry Twayne Boneraper, to fulfill an ancient magical blood pact; Aldermach gets paid by Twayne's family to deliver him a bride, {{and if he does}} not, he will get murdered. Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark is serious, she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at his and his zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him {{to break up}} with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when he comes back, Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E
5|$|Marge {{figures out}} what Homer saw from the {{movements}} of his pupil. They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E

He made a {{practice}} of {{going down to the}} harbour and asking arriving Japanese people if they practised karate; if they did, he would <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to training at the dojo. In 1959, Arneil left South Africa, bound for Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Forms, which {{amount to}} a {{personal}} and exclusive invitation, are sent to about three thousand selected individuals to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are {{they told that they}} have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. In practice, some nominees do become known. It is also common for publicists to make such a claim – founded or not.|$|E
25|$|The 1868 {{convention}} {{witnessed a}} meaningful {{discussion on the}} topic of pulpit and altar fellowship, one of the Four Points in American Lutheranism. Although there were several dissenting opinions, most of the pastors and lay delegates realized that they could not in good conscience exchange pastors with non-Lutherans or <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to commune at their altar. They felt that the position the General Council took on this subject was inadequate. They resolved that, unless it changed course, they would withdraw from the General Council.|$|E

25|$|Individuals with {{expertise}} in particular areas of human rights were appointed by {{the chair of the}} Commission to serve as Special Rapporteurs for a maximum of six years. They are unpaid, independent experts who receive personnel and logistical support from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for their work.

They are able to write to governments about reported violations and conduct fact-finding visits to countries that <b>invite</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} college {{football}} was different in 1986 as opposed to today. In 1986, there were far more independent schools than there are today; that season, twenty-four teams competed as independents as opposed to four in 2017. Some high profile programs were among those twenty-four teams, with Penn State and Miami being two of them. Since these teams had no ties to any conference, bowl committees were free to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> as they saw fit. For instance, Penn State was invited to the previous year's Orange Bowl while Miami received an invite to the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In early July it {{appeared}} that he had jinxed both their chances with Heath behind in the polls in the General Election and Kent {{at the bottom of}} the championship table. The change came when Sussex defeated them in the Gillette Cup, giving them two rest days which Cowdrey used to hammer out their difficulties in a team meeting. They decided to chase bonus points and won 7 and drew 5 of their last 12 games, often by close margins and it was a draw at the Oval, where Cowdrey made 112, that gave them the title with the newly elected Prime Minister Heath at the ground to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to a reception at Number 10 to celebrate.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{celebrate}} {{the foundation of the}} club, Isaias White sent a letter to Recreativo de Huelva, to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to play a football match in Seville. That letter was published by the Spanish newspaper La Provincia. Huelva Recreation accepted the invitation and the match took place on 8 March 1890, being thus the first official match ever played in Spain. Sevilla FC won that historical match 2–0, with the first goal in an official match in Spanish football history scored by the Seville team player Ritson. Isaias lived at Calle Bailen 41 in Seville (the house still exists but has since been renumbered) making this the first home of Sevilla FC.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 1956, the French Cabinet decided upon {{military}} action against Egypt in alliance with Israel, and Admiral Nomy of the French Naval General Staff was sent to Britain to inform the leaders of that country of France's decision, and to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to co-operate if interested. At the same time, Mollet felt very much offended by what he {{considered to be the}} lackadaisical attitude of the Eisenhower administration to the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. This was especially the case because earlier in 1956 the Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had offered the French a deal whereby if Moscow ended its support of the FLN in Algeria, Paris would pull out of NATO and became neutral in the Cold War.|$|E
25|$|Satan announces {{his plans}} to throw a huge Halloween costume party on Earth. Among other things, he decides upon a cake {{the size and shape}} of a Ferrari Enzo, which three notorious serial killers—Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and John Wayne Gacy—are {{entrusted}} with bringing to the party. Cardinal Roger Mahony and other Roman Catholic Church officials of Los Angeles, angered that Satan does not <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to the party, plan to call the fire marshal the night of the party to complain, thus ruining it. When they are unable to do so after discovering that the fire marshal was also invited to the party, the clergy decide to crash it. However, Satan's security make sure they do not get in at all.|$|E

25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson {{standing in front of a}} backdrop which includes a famous place in that country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter might be seen with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E
25|$|This was the two teams' 85th Big Game, and {{was played}} on Cal's home field, California Memorial Stadium. Although Cal was {{guaranteed}} {{a winning record}} (with bowl eligibility) for the season, no bowl game was looking to <b>invite</b> <b>them.</b> The implications of this game were far more important to Stanford, led by quarterback John Elway, playing in his last regular season game before heading off to become a future National Football League star enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. The Cardinal football squad {{was in the midst}} of an exciting season—they were 5–5 but had victories over highly ranked Ohio State and Washington—and needed a win to be eligible to play in a bowl game. Representatives of the Hall of Fame Classic committee were in attendance, apparently to extend an invitation to Stanford, if the Cardinal won.|$|E
25|$|When Alex, Chase, Gert, Karolina, Molly, and Nico witness {{their parents}} ("The Pride") {{sacrifice}} {{a girl in}} an occult ceremony, the group runs off. As the story progresses, the children learn of their heritage and abilities, and steal resources from their parents, including futuristic gauntlets, a dinosaur, and a mystical Staff. Using these resources, they manage to remove their parents from their criminal hold of Los Angeles, but they lose Alex in the final battle, due to Alex's true loyalty to his parents. With the Pride defeated, the Runaways now vow to prevent other villains from filling in the void left by their parents. They eventually meet cyborg Victor Mancha and shape-shifting alien Skrull Xavin, and <b>invite</b> <b>them</b> to join the team. Right before the Runaways defeat a new incarnation of the Pride and Alex's resurrected father, Gertrude is fatally wounded. Before she passes, she transfers her power to control Old Lace to Chase.|$|E
