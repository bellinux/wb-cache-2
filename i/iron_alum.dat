40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of cytological {{investigations}} in Hypochnus Sasakii SHIRAI, which were carried out through the several stages in its life cycle. In examination, the material was fixed in FLEMMING 2 ̆ 7 S weaker solution or formalin acetic alcohol and stained with HEIDENHAIN 2 ̆ 7 S <b>iron</b> <b>alum</b> hamatoxilin or aqueous safranin and light green. The vegetative mycelium in the host tissue and also on media, is consisted of multinucleated cells, 3 to 23, mostly 6 to 10 nuclei in each cell. Its growth and nuclear divisions are observed in the apex cells of the hyphae. When they reach to certain length, all the nuclei divide conjugately {{at one point in}} the cell, where the septum is provided without clamp connection, thus equal number of nuclei being resulted in two daughter cells. In this manner, almost the all cells originated from the same hypha contain equal number of nuclei. But sometimes, some of the nuclei behave in different way, specially in time or position of their divisions, consequently unequal number of nuclei are resulted. The change of the nuclear number results also from nuclear migration at hyphal fusion. The sclerotium appears in sections to be made of prosenchymatic structure, containing 6 to 8 nuclei in each cell. The fruiting hyphae creeping over the suit-ace of the host are consisted of binucleated cells. They are produced from the multinucleated cells of vegetative mycelia when come out from the host tissue. Basidia are produced in abundance directly from the branches of such fruiting hyphae. They are clavate in form and produce four sterigmata, each of which produces a obovate basidiospore, 5. 4 to 9. 8 by 4. 0 to 6. 6 μ in size. During the development of basidia two nuclei conjugate and then divide twice, thus resulting four nuclei which migrate into four spores. Subsequently basidiospore is uninucleate in the beginning, but gradually becomes multinucleate by the division of nucleus in the germination and further development. Usually the mycelia thus formed contain 4 to 6 nuclei.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to decrease membrane fouling of a ceramic microfiltration system {{and at the same time}} increase the recovery.

But the cake layer of <b>iron</b> or <b>alum</b> flocks can also protect the membrane for pore blocking and a frequent backwash can expose the membrane for particles that cause pore blocking.

In this research it was hypothesized that this cake layer worked as a membrane protecting layer and was accumulating on the top of membrane by long filtration backwash intervals (> 6 hours).

40|$|The heat {{capacity}} of a substance can be measured under adiabatic or non-adiabatic conditions. Modern experimental techniques allow measurements made under adiabatic conditions to yield values for the specific heat accurate to 0. 1 %. However, knowledge of the solid state at low temperatures {{is still in the}} prospecting stage and new information that is accurate only to 1 % or 2 % is valuable. The non-adiabatic method with its comparatively simple apparatus and ability to produce more rapid results is, therefore, a useful technique to employ. The measurements on solid hydrogen below 4 °K., and irradiated polythene from 15 °K. to room temperature, are good examples of the proper application of this method. The specific heat of solid hydrogen has been measured {{as a function of the}} ortho-para concentration from 0. 2 °K. to 4 °K. There are two species of hydrogen molecule: ortho-hydrogen and para-hydrogen. The ortho-hydrogen molecule in its ground state is nine-fold degenerate, being three-fold degenerate with respect to both the molecular rotation and the nuclear spin. The specific heat anomaly due to the lifting of the ground rotational level of the ortho-hydrogen was found by Simon, Mendelssohn and Buhemann (1929) below 10 °K. Hill (1956) repeated the measurements with improved experimental techniques, but was unable to make measurements below 2 °K. using standard calorimetric practices, due to the spontaneous heat of conversion of the ortho- into para-hydrogen. The total anomalous entropy per mole of ortho-hydrogen above 2 °K. was only 0. 8 E. U. of the expected 2. 18 E. U. (R Log 3). In consequence, the experiments reported here were undertaken to extend the temperature range of the measurements down to 0. 2 °K. This was accomplished by a novel design of calorimeter. The calorimeter was made with two compartments. The first contained liquid helium and had a large diameter pumping tube attached to it; the second contained a powdered paramagnetic salt, <b>iron</b> <b>alum,</b> and the hydrogen specimen, which was condensed between the grains of the salt. By rapid pumping on the liquid helium it was possible to reduce the temperature of the calorimeter to 1. 3 °K., after which a demagnetization of the <b>iron</b> <b>alum</b> reduced the calorimeter and the sample temperature to 0. 2 °K. A time-temperature curve was taken until the calorimeter was above 2 °K., as the rate of warm-up was too rapid for conventional specific heat points to be made. As it could be shown that the heating due to the ortho-para conversion was sensibly temperature independent, it was possible to calculate the specific heat of the sample from the slope of the heating curve and a knowledge of the heating rate. The heating rate was found from conventional specific heat measurements made above 2 °K. The results showed that at ortho-concentrations greater than 60 %, a modified λ-anomaly existed in the temperature range 1 °K. to 2 °K. The form, height, and the temperature of the maximum varied with concentration. For 73 % ortho-hydrogen, the peak is at 1. 60 °K. and 5 calories. degree - 1. mole - 1 high, while with a sample of 63 % ortho-hydrogen, a small peak, 1 calories. degree - 1. mole - 1 high, appears with a maximum as 1. 12 °K. At ortho-concentrations below 60 %, there is no λ-anomaly. The specific heat becomes appreciable at about 0. 2 °K., rises steeply until a temperature of about 0. 6 °K. has been reached, after which it rises slowly to a maximum between 1 °K. and 2 °K., before falling steadily towards the triple point. Whether a λ-peak occurs or not, the total entropy of the anomaly is the same within experimental error. The arithmetical average of the entropy for the different runs is 2. 14 E. U., which is in excellent agreement with 2. 18 E. U. expected theoretically from a lifting of three-fold degenerate state. The existence of a λ-point is consistent with the changes in the nuclear resonance spectrum reported by Hatton and Rollin (1949) and Reif and Purcell (1953) for normal hydrogen, and Sugawara et al (1955) for other ortho-hydrogen concentrations. These experiments only indicate whether or not transitions occur among the substates. They would have obtained the same low temperature resonance pattern, indicating now transitions among states, if the molecules were frozen into arbitrary substates. It is only the existence of the specific heat anomaly of the correct entropy, that indicates that an ordered state is obtained at very low temperatures. These experiments also show that there is no indication of the entropy of mixing of the ortho- and para-molecules. Further, the rate of change of ortho-concentration was found from the libration of heat due to the ortho-para conversion. If o is the ortho-concentration expressed in percent and t is the time in hours, then d o ⁄ dt = 1. 79 × 10 - 4 o 2. The constant is in good agreement with Cremer and Polanyi's value of 1. 9 × 10 - 4. The specific heat of irradiated Polythene was measured from 15 °K. to room temperature with standard calorimetric methods. This sample was the most heavily irradiated out of a set, the remainder of which was measured by Smith (1955). The specific heat per gram was smaller over the whole temperature range than the other polythenes. A theoretical calculation of the specific heat of normal polythene was made, which seemed to indicate that the rapid rise in specific heat of the polythene above 180 °K. was due to molecular vibration at natural CH 2 characteristic frequences, and not to a disorder change in the crystallites of the polythene, as had been assumed by previous workers. The specific heat of Potassium Bromide was measured from 4 °K. to room temperature. A comparison with the measurements of Clusius, Goldman and Perlick (1949) indicated that their values between 40 °K. and 80 °K. were probably too high. The change in the Debye θ at low temperatures could be explained qualitatively with reference to Blackman's (1933, 1937) calculations. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper gives {{a general}} {{overview}} {{of the nature and}} important mechanisms behind internal loading of phosphorus (P), which is a phenomenon appearing frequently in shallow, eutrophic lakes upon a reduction of the external loading. Lake water quality is therefore not improved as expected. In particular summer concentrations rise and P retention may be negative during most of the summer. The P release originates from a pool accumulated in the sediment when the external loading was high. In most lake sediments, P bound to redox-sensitive iron compounds or P fixed in more or less labile organic forms constitute major fractions forms that are potentially mobile and eventually may be released to the lake water. The duration of the recovery period following P loading reduction depends on the loading history, but it may last for decades in lakes with a high sediment P accumulation. During the phase of recovery, both the duration and net P release rates from the sediment seem to decline progressively. Internal P loading is highly influenced by the biological structure as illustrated by lakes shifting from the turbid to the clearwater state as a result of, for example, biomanipulation. In these lakes P concentrations may be reduced to 50 % of the pre-biomanipulation level and the period with negative retention during summer can thus be reduced considerably. The duration of internal loading can be reduced significantly by different restoration methods such as dredging to remove accumulated P or addition of <b>iron</b> or <b>alum</b> to elevate the sorption capacity of sediments. However, an important prerequisite for achieving long-term benefits to water quality is a sufficient reduction of the external P loading...|$|R

The colours of the stalactites are produced by the minerals in the mine. In 1717 the merchant Johann Leonard Morassi bought the mine and named it Morassina. In 1750 the Leipzig trading firm of Frege bought it and became extremely wealthy from it; in 1816 they were able to buy back the Crown Jewels of Saxony, carried off by Napoleon, from Amsterdam. However, the bottom fell out of the market after chemical methods of synthesizing alum and sulfuric acid were introduced around 1850. The mine was not worked after 1860, and was closed up and forgotten. In 1851, miners seeking uranium discovered it and the stalactite formations, but because of its location near the Inner German Border, the East German authorities refused until 1998 to allow it to be opened to visitors. It was finally opened in 1993. There is a mining museum (opened in 1995) and the St. Barbara licensed spa (opened in 1997); radium cures are offered.|$|R
30|$|Being {{primarily}} metallic salts, a mordant {{acts as a}} sort of {{glue that}} fixes fiber firmly with dye resulting in a durable color on the textile substrate. The process of mordanting usually enhanced the performance of dye besides achieving a wide spectrum of colors on both natural and synthetic textile fibers having extended shade ranges associated with colorfastness properties (Kadolph and Casselman 2004). Different types of metallic mordants (such as potash <b>alum,</b> <b>iron,</b> tin, copper and chrome) either individually or in combination are applied to the dyebath of natural colorants as well as henna in order to obtain the desired performance of dyed fibers (Kamel et al. 2011). However, to some extent, these metallic mordants are hazardous and normally generate wastewater that contains residual toxic metal ions from metal salts which may adversely impact the environment as well as public health (Shahid and Mohammad 2013; Lee et al. 2010). Hence, the main objectives of this study were to explore the scope of dyeing polyester fiber with henna dye at a high temperature and pressure without using any mordants followed by the analysis of color strength and colorfastness properties of the resulting dyed fabrics.|$|R

The extract of fresh mangosteen peel is tested on cotton fabric by using alum as mordanting agent which processed by pre mordant dyeing procedure and fixation using 3 (three) different types of fixer. To obtain optimum interaction of fabric, mordant, dye and fixer, washing procedure has been performed using Turkish Red Oil (TRO) before mordanting stage with varying washing time and repeated dyeing procedure with varying frequency of dyeing. As a result, the application of pre mordanting dyeing method and fixation using iron (II) sulphate (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O), alum (KAI (SO 4) 2. 12 H 2 O) and lime (CaO), produced very good color from  mangosteen peel dyes extract. Cotton fabric that has been through the pre-mordanting dyeing procedure using dyes extract of mangosteen peel consecutively bring green, light brown, and dark brown color each on the fixation result using <b>iron</b> (II) sulfate, <b>alum,</b> and lime. Preliminary evaluation and instrumentation allows us to determine whether the application of washing time varies, the repeated frequency of immersion, and the use of different fixer compound using dyes extract with similar concentration and dyeing procedure affect the color intensity of the fabric sample...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Alum-coagulation, Iron-coagulation and Iron-NH 4 {{enhanced}} with ascorbic acid were {{used on the}} samples that were synthetically prepared and treated in reactors at ambient temperature to meet the Brazilian water quality discharge limits or to be reused. A series of jar test experiments was run at 150 rpm for 2 min and 30 min for settling. 95 mg/L dose of traditional coagulant (<b>alum,</b> <b>iron</b> or iron-NH 4) was applied at pH ranging from 4 - 10. The coagulation was enhanced by adding doses of ascorbic acid resulting in three concentrations: 2. 38, 7. 14 and 11. 9 g/L. Raw and coagulated greywater samples were analyzed for their turbidity, TS and conductivity {{as a function of}} time. The jar test experiments provided evidence that coagulation process could not provide sufficient TS removal efficiency in the greywater except at an iron-NH 4 + acid in all concentrations of the acid reaching a maximum removal after 4 - 5 h decanting. Turbidity was better removed when the small concentrations of ascorbic acid was employed. Generally, enhanced coagulation process using ascorbic acid was not sufficient to meet turbidity (< 20 mg/L) and TS (100 mg/L) limits. The highest turbidity removal (95 %) was obtained at the range of 2. 0 – 4. 3 pH values, whereas turbidity removal was lesser in the greywater treated with Iron Chloride in the 11. 90 g/L concentration. All experiments with controlled pH resulted in treated greywater with increasing in conductivity. Conductivity was found significantly high when controlled pH was used in the coagulation process...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{phosphorus}} removal was studied using as coagulant spent alum sludge from a {{water treatment plant}} of EYDAP (Athens Water Supply and Sewerage Company) and compared to alum (Al- 2 (SO 4) (3) center dot 18 H(2) O), iron chloride (FeCl(3) center dot 7 H(2) O), iron sulfate (Fe- 2 (SO 4) 10 H(2) O) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) (2)) at a constant pH (equal to 6). The comparison was based on their efficiency to remove phosphorus in synthetic wastewater consisting of 10 mg/L P as potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 50 mg/L N as ammonium chloride. The experiments were carried out using a jar-test apparatus and the measurements were performed according to the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater. Pure <b>alum,</b> <b>iron</b> chloride and iron sulfate were much more efficient in phosphorus removal than the spent alum sludge {{but in the case}} of calcium hydroxide, phosphorus removal was very low in pH = 6. Specifically, orthophosphate were totally removed by alum using 15 mg/L as Al, by alum sludge using 75 mg/L as Al and by FeCl(3) center dot 7 H(2) O or Fe- 2 (SO 4) center dot 10 H(2) O using 30 mg/L of Fe while in the case of calcium hydroxide P removal was actually zero. pH measurements showed that the uptake of phosphates is associated to the release of OH ions in the solution and that the end of P uptake is accompanied by the stabilization of pH. Finally this spent alum sludge was tested on municipal wastewater and proved to be effective as apart from phosphorus it was shown to remove turbidity and COD...|$|R
40|$|The meat {{processing}} industry requires {{large quantities of}} water, much of which is discharged as wastewater containing high levels of COD and nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). These nutrients must be removed to very low levels before any discharge into local waterways to avoid causing eutrophication in receiving aquatic systems. Reliable biological COD and nitrogen removal systems have been developed and applied for abattoir wastewater treatment using continuous activated sludge systems. However, P removal is achieved primarily through chemical precipitation {{with the addition of}} large amounts of <b>iron</b> or <b>alum</b> salts. Biological P removal is often consider as being a cheaper and more sustainable option as no chemical dosing is required {{and the quality of the}} excess sludge is usually suitable for land fertilisation purposes. Compare to well established continuous wastewater treatment systems, sequencing batch reactor (SBR) technology offers a great deal of operational flexibility and appears to be a promising vehicle for achieving high levels of N and P removal from abattoir wastewater. The overall objective of this thesis is to develop a biological process that achieves high level of COD, N and P removal from abattoir wastewater, producing effluent suitable for being discharged into river systems (i. e. over 95 % of the N and P contents removed). Achieving stable and reliable biological P removal from a wastewater containing high level of nitrogen is the main obstacle to overcome to achieve this objective. This study also investigate the feasibility of using two innovative technologies, namely the simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal (SNDPR) process and the aerobic granular sludge technology, to further enhance the performance of the SBR system designed. In this thesis, three different lab-scale SBRs were operated to demonstrate the feasibility to achieve high-levels of biological COD, N and P removal from abattoir wastewater. The first SBR was employed to experiment novel strategies, which can easily be implemented to current water treatment facilities used by the meat industry, to produce an effluent suitable for river discharge. The second SBR was operated to provide a platform for an in-depth investigation of the previously proposed SNDPR process, which has the potential for application to the treatment of abattoir wastewater. The third SBR was operated for the treatment of abattoir wastewater by combining together the aerobic granular sludge technology and the SNDPR process. A wide range of techniques was employed in this thesis which includes reactor process studies, microbial investigations (fluorescent in-situ hybridisation combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy) and several micro-scale techniques (e. g. microsensors, electron microscopy and light microscopy). The combination of these multi-disciplinary techniques has helped deliver significant insightful information. The main contributions of this thesis are as follow. An SBR system was demonstrated to effectively remove 95 %, 97 % and 98 % of the total COD, total N and total P present in abattoir wastewater. It could provide a real alternative to chemical P removal, which is the common practice in the meat industry. A multi-step feeding strategy was employed to prevent the accumulation of nitrate or nitrite in the SBR providing the right condition for the development of a stable biological P removal. The incorporation of a high-rate pre-fermentor as an integrated component of the nutrient removal system was found to be important. This stream, which contains a high-level of volatile fatty acids, provides supplementary carbon sources critical for both P and N removal. Further, an aeration control strategy consisting of stopping the aeration in the SBR immediately after ammonia is fully oxidised was effective in achieving stable N removal via the nitrite pathway. It benefited the nutrient removal performance of the SBR by saving some valuable amount of COD. The investigation of the SNDPR process revealed that the production of N 2 O, often observed in lab-scale SNDPR bioreactors and source of concern due to the high global warming potential of N 2 O, was found to be linked to the loss of diversity amongst the denitrifying microbial community due to the use of synthetic wastewater containing only a single carbon source. N 2 O accumulation is unlikely to be an issue in a SNDPR bioreactor treating real wastewater which contains a large variety of different carbon sources. The SNDPR process and the aerobic granular sludge technology were successfully combined in a single SBR process. The size and the dense structure of aerobic granules positively contributed to the oxygen mass transfer limitation required to achieve reliable SNDPR. It was also demonstrated that the minimum hydraulic retention time (HRT) for a granular sludge system is not governed by the sludge settleability, as is the case in a system with floccular sludge. Mass transfer limitations in granules are an important factor to be considered in the design of the HRT and the COD and nutrient loading rate in a granular sludge system. The in-depth study of the structure and function of these aerobic granules fed with abattoir wastewater revealed interesting structural features that have not been reported in synthetic-fed granules. These observations initiated new hypotheses regarding the microbial structure and the fate of mature granules, the effect of pH on the granule structure stability and the role played by protozoa in the overall system performance. It also provided some new directions and recommendations for further experimental studies on aerobic granules in relation to their structure and behaviour in real systems...|$|R
40|$|La {{filtration}} successive des eaux, préalablement filtrées sur membrane de porosité 0, 45 µm puis acidifiées à pH 2, sur deux colonnes de résines XAD 8 et XAD 4 placées en série, caractérise la matière organique {{en trois}} grandes classes : les substances hydrophobes, les acides hydrophiles et les hydrophiles non retenus. Cette étude s'est intéressée à déterminer et à analyser l'impact sur la distribution hydrophobe/hydrophile des traitements conventionnels utilisés dans les usines de production d'eau potable. En ce qui concerne l'effet de la clarification, la distribution hydrophobe/hydrophile du COD a été inchangée dans le cas de sept prélèvements sur dix, indiquant une isoélimination de chaque fraction. Dans le cas des eaux R 1. 2, R 4 et R 6. 1, une diminution de la fraction hydrophobe est obtenue entre l'eau brute et son eau clarifiée. L'étude de différents coagulants indique que la distribution de la matière organique des eaux clarifiées dépend de sa composition initiale mais aussi de la nature du coagulant mis en oeuvre. Le chlorure ferrique permet une meilleure élimination de chaque fraction comparativement à un sel d'aluminium. Un traitement d'oxydation à un taux de 1, 5 mg Oxydant/mg COD et {{quel que soit}} l'oxydant mis en oeuvre (O 3, Cl 2, ClO 2) diminue significativement les substances hydrophobes et augmente les substances hydrophiles. Ces résultats sont logiques si nous nous référons au mode d'action de ces trois oxydants. L'ozonation d'eaux brute et clarifiée s'accompagne aussi d'une augmentation du CODB, soulignant que les substances hydrophiles générées par l'étape d'ozonation seraient biodégradables. Des campagnes de prélèvements ont indiqué que les traitements de finition (ozonation, filtration sur CAG) en configuration industrielle ont une légère influence sur la distribution interne de la matière organique. Les résultats, du fait de taux de traitement plus faibles, sont moins nets que ceux obtenus en laboratoire. Une filtration sur CAG, précédée d'une étape d'ozonation, conduit à une augmentation de la fraction hydrophobe et à une diminution du CODB. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in natural waters {{is a mixture of}} compounds. Some authors have fractionated this organic matter into large classes (humic substances, hydrophilic acids...). Humic substances have been defined as the fraction of organic matter retained on XAD 8 resin at acidic pH (THURMAN and MALCOLM 1981); this isolation procedure is recommended by the International Humic Substances Society. Only a few investigators have dealt specifically with hydrophilic substances which are not adsorbed on XAD 8 resin at acidic pH. The "hydrophobic/hydrophilic" distribution can be determined by a simple method of organic matter fractionation, using two superimposed XAD 8 and XAD 4 resin columns (CROUE et al. 1993). This procedures, carried out at pH 2, consists of first isolating hydrophobic substances (essentially humic acids) on an XAD 8 resin and then isolating the hydrophilic acids from the XAD 8 effluent on an XAD 4 resin. The aim of this work was to study the evolution of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic distribution during water treatment steps as applied in waterworks. The analytical procedure was first applied to determine the change in the DOM distribution of ten surface waters after clarification. The results obtained after clarification were completed by the study of the effect of the coagulant nature (ferric chloride, aluminium sulphate, prehydrolyzed salt (WAC)). In the second phase, oxidation experiments using ozone, chlorine and chlorine dioxide were conducted on raw and clarified waters to determine their effect on the DOM distribution. Finally the fractionation procedures were carried out on two water treatment plants to compare our laboratory data with results obtained in a working plant and to observe the change in DOM distribution during granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were analysed using a Dohrman DC 80 apparatus. UV absorbance was measured with a one or five centimeter cell using an Uvikon spectrophotometer. Oxidation experiments were carried out in a batch procedure. The study of different coagulants was made in the laboratory with a Jar Test procedure described elsewhere (LEFEBVRE 1990). Biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) was analyzed according to the suspended bacteria method (SERVAIS et al. 1987, 1989). The hydrophobic/hydrophilic distributions of raw and clarified waters were found to be unchanged by the clarification step in seven of ten test waters. These results indicate that for a studied water, the relative reduction in DOC of one fraction was of the same order of magnitude as the other fraction. The distributions of R 1. 2, R 4 and R 6. 1 were significantly modified by the clarification treatment. In these three cases, the hydrophobic substances showed the greater DOC reduction. The "non-retained" hydrophilic substances became predominant in the R 6. 1 clarified water, whereas in the cases of R 4 and R 1. 2 the total hydrophilic fraction and the hydrophilic acids increased, respectively. The results obtained in the laboratory on three different raw waters, clarified by different coagulants (ferric chloride or aluminium salts), showed that the nature of the coagulant (<b>iron</b> or <b>alum)</b> can influence the hydrophobic/hydrophilic distribution. A marked influence was found in the case of R 6 and less significant results were obtained for R 1. 2. Powdered activated carbon had no real effect on the DOC distribution, under our experimental conditions (applied dosage 25 mg/L). If the removal of each fraction is considered, and if it is assumed that each removal is independent from the others, ferric chloride appears to be the best coagulant. It removes humic substances efficiently as well as hydrophilic acids (> 72 %), but is less efficient for the "non-retained" hydrophilic fraction. The DOC distribution of a clarified water depends on the distribution in the original raw water {{and the nature of the}} coagulant. Under our experimental conditions (applied dosage: 1. 5 mg oxidant / mg DOC), ozone, chlorine and chlorine dioxide significantly affected the DOM distribution of the R 1. 2 water. The hydrophobic substances showed the higher relative DOC reduction, which can be correlated with an increase in the hydrophilic fraction. The greatest change was obtained for treatment with ozone. In the case of chlorine and chlorine dioxide, an increase of the "non-retained" hydrophilic fraction was observed whereas for ozone the two hydrophilic fractions increased. These results are in agreement with current knowledge about the action of ozone, chlorine and chlorine dioxide. An increase in the BDOC fraction was observed with the applied ozone dosage. In the case of R 1, ozonation of raw and clarified waters appeared to shift the dissolved organic carbon distribution towards the "non-retained" hydrophilics. A good correlation exists between the BDOC increase (BDOC/BDOCo) and the decrease of hydrophobic acids or the increase of "non-retained" hydrophilics (slopes are respectively 12. 3; - 16. 5 and 15. 5). In the case of another sample of R 1. 2, the comparison of BDOC in the XAD 4 effluents of raw and ozonated waters indicated that at least 62 % of BDOC produced by ozonation was in this fraction. This result indicates that the "non-retained" hydrophilics of this raw water are not biodegradable compared with those induced by ozonation. Results obtained on samples taken on two water treatment plants indicate that ozonation and GAC filtration have a small effect on the hydrophobic/hydrophilic DOM distribution. Intermediate ozonation at the industrially applied dose slightly modifies the distribution; a slight decrease of hydrophobic substances is observed. GAC filtration induces an increase of the hydrophobic fraction. The water treatment process includes clarification (EFS), inter-ozonation (EFSO 3), and GAC filtration (EFCAG). GAC filters A and B had been respectively running for one and three years; filter C has been regenerated one month before. Good organic matter removal is obtained during clarification (removal of DOC and UV-absorbance: 75 % and 88 %). This treatment step changes the DOM distribution: increase of the hydrophobic fraction and decrease of the hydrophilic fraction. BDOC was completely removed. Intermediate ozonation (0. 7 mg O 3 /mg DOC) modifies the DOC distribution and creates BDOC. This BDOC, in absolute value (0. 36 mg/l), is equal to the increase of hydrophilic fraction. On the oldest filters (A and B) BDOC was completely removed, but this was not the case for filter C, probably because the bacterial biomass was insufficient. On GAC filters hydrophilic substances were found to be better removed than humic substances. The age of the GAC bed seems to have an effect on DOC distribution: the effluent from the oldest GAC filter contained less of the hydrophobic fraction than did the effluent from the youngest filter...|$|R
