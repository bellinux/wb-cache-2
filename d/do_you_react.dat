40|$|Do you {{remember}} how {{the first time you}} visit the library? Do you recall how you adapt with the new ambience while looking for the information you need? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>react</b> and cope with all the services and facilities serve in the library? Do you aware that library patron's behavior can affect the librarian to achieve the library's objectives? Based on Jordan P. (1974), the librarians need to achieve specific objectives but the behavior of the library user's and staffs become the barrier to fulfill the objectives. The research or investigation of patron's behavior cannot be done by observations alone. As an example, the assumptions of a boy is sleeping is not true for a boy who is thinking hard for his problem. It may look simple but sometimes it can be more complicated. The user and patron are the essential element of the library and the librarian should be empathetic and understand their users and have to control many types of user's. However, some of the users have some problems regarding their attitude and it becomes some sort of challenges for the librarians to handle it...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt} Organizations {{are often}} {{challenged}} {{to identify and}} resolve workplace problems. The Critical Incident technique gives them a starting point and a process for advancing organizational development through learning experiences. It helps them study “what people do” in various situations. One might think there are no answers to the following questions: How fast can you think on your feet? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>react</b> {{in the face of}} the unexpected? How can you prepare if you cannot predict? And yet, there are. Evidently, some behaviors contribute to the successor failure of individuals—and organizations—in specific situations. And so, responses to the unforeseen lie in identifying before the fact events or circumstances, or series of them, that are outside the range of ordinary human experiences. The questions posed earlier are as old as mankind; but our ability to address them owes largely to the relatively recent work of John Flanagan. These days critical incidents can be harvested to provide a rich, personal perspective of life that facilitates understanding of the issues and obstacles people face every now and then and illuminates avenues for improvement (or replication if outcomes are effective) —avenues that may not be apparent through purely quantitative methods of data collection. This should matter to high-performance organizations...|$|E
