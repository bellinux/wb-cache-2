5000|$|Bright left Palace for Sheffield Wednesday in September 1992 in a cash plus player {{exchange}} deal involving fellow striker Paul Williams. He finished as the club's top-scorer {{for three}} consecutive seasons, taking pressure off club stalwart David Hirst. He eventually became the [...] "Owls" [...] highest goalscorer in the Premier League to date, scoring 48 goals between 1992 and 1996. After scoring six {{goals in the}} League Cup, Bright played in the League Cup Final, which ended in a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal. One of Bright's notable goals came in the All-Sheffield FA Cup semi-final in 1993, Bright's extra-time <b>header</b> <b>sealing</b> {{a place in the}} final. He fared far less well in the final itself, controversially elbowing Arsenal defender Andy Linighan in the face, causing a broken nose. Later, with the scores level in the last minute of extra time, a heavily bandaged Linighan out-jumped Bright from a corner to score the winning goal.|$|E

While Liverpool's 2-0 loss to Middlesbrough at the Riverside returns Chelsea to second place, Michael Mancienne makes his first ever Premier League start at right back, John Terry's goal makes him the highest scoring defender in Chelsea history, and Frank Lampard joins George Mills as Chelsea's joint sixth all-time scorer with 125 goals.|$|R

He scored in 2008 season debut against D.C. United as a substitute. Villafaña made his first career start the following week against the Colorado Rapids and scored on a glancing <b>header</b> to <b>seal</b> the game for Chivas. Villafaña scored again the following week against the Columbus Crew. While with Chivas, Villafaña appeared in 86 league matches and scored 7 goals.|$|R
50|$|Grouped with Bolivia, Japan and Peru, the Albirroja {{played their}} first match of the {{competition}} on 29 June at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco, drawing 0-0 against Bolivia. On 2 July, Paraguay faced Japan, playing again at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco. A double each from Miguel Ángel Benítez and Roque Santa Cruz (both of his goals being <b>headers)</b> <b>sealed</b> a 4-0 victory for Paraguay. In Paraguay's third and last group stage fixture against Peru on 5 July, Roque Santa Cruz was played through one-on-one with the goalkeeper which saw the striker dribble past the opponent {{to the left side}} of goal and score his third goal {{of the competition}}, which Paraguay ultimately won 1-0. The match was disputed at the Monumental Río Parapití in Pedro Juan Caballero. The Albirroja were undefeated, topping the group with seven points, scoring five goals and conceding none. Paraguay were drawn against Uruguay at the quarter-final stage. The fixture was disputed on 10 July at the Estadio Defensores del Chaco in Asunción. In the 15th minute of the first half, Benítez received the ball in the 18-year box before turning his opponent and giving Paraguay the lead. Marcelo Zalayeta equalised for Uruguay in the 65th minute and the match was ultimately decided via a penalty shootout, which saw Paraguay defeated 5-3. One month following the conclusion of the competition, Roque Santa Cruz was sold to Germany's Bayern Munich, despite having the chance to have joined Real Madrid. The striker was ultimately awarded with the Paraguayan Footballer of the Year award in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Everton began October at St Andrew's {{and came}} away with their first league win of the season, a 2-0 victory over Birmingham City, whose top-flight club record of 18 undefeated home matches came to an end. The Toffees {{dominated}} possession and chances {{throughout much of the}} game, though the club's first away goal of the season continued to prove elusive until Roger Johnson knocked in an own goal to put Everton ahead in the 54th minute. A Tim Cahill <b>header</b> <b>sealed</b> the victory in added time. After the international break, Everton hosted Liverpool in the 214th Merseyside Derby. Liverpool's new owners, John W. Henry and Tom Werner, attended the match mere days after buying the club. Despite having less possession and less shots on target, Everton won the match 2-0 with goals from Tim Cahill, who became Everton's highest post-War, Merseyside derby goalscorer, {{in the first half and}} Mikel Arteta with a strike from just outside the 18-yard box in the second half. The following week Everton travelled to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham. Everton took the lead in the 17th minute after Leighton Baines converted a free-kick following Younès Kaboul's foul on Yakubu on the edge of the 18-yard box. Everton's lead was short lived however with Spurs levelling three minutes later after Tim Howard's goalkeeping error gifted Rafael van der Vaart a tap-in finish. Everton next faced Stoke at Goodison with the knowledge that a victory would see them rise into the top half of the Premier League table. After a goalless first half, Yakubu scored the only goal of the match in the 67th minute with a left-footed finish after Tim Cahill's shot hit the woodwork, handing Everton the win and also breaking his own six-month goal drought. Everton's successful form in October - three wins and one draw - turned their season around, and led to David Moyes being awarded the Manager of the Month award.|$|R

50|$|For {{the secure}} archival of audio files {{complete}} with metadata headers, PARADISEC uses the Quadriga system, developed by Cube-Tec, which {{conforms to the}} BWF specifications of the European Broadcast Union (EBU). BWF files are archived with a digitally sealed 'header' comprising metadata exported from the Paradisec catalog. This <b>sealed</b> <b>header</b> also acts as a security device and prevents the archived BWF from any unauthorised edits, thus preserving the audio signal for posterity. It is also standard practice to produce smaller, more easily transported mp3 copies of each BWF, {{for the purpose of}} access. These too, are archived with the master BWF copies.|$|R
50|$|Jean Michel N'Lend was {{the third}} foreign player to join Al Shorta in its history {{following}} the signings of fellow Cameroonian Innocent Awoa and Ivorian defender Suwaria Mohammed. He made an instant impression at Al Shorta, scoring in friendly matches against Al Naft and Naft Al Junoob. His first league goals came against Al Shorta's fierce rivals Al Quwa Al Jawiya at the Al Shaab Stadium, where N'Lend scored a hat-trick of <b>headers</b> to <b>seal</b> a 4-1 victory. This was when N'Lend became a fan favourite and wrote his name into the history books, becoming the first ever non-Iraqi to score a hat-trick in the Iraqi Premier League. He {{then went on to}} score again at the Al Shaab Stadium against Al Naft in a 2-2 draw, followed by the winning goal against Naft Al Junoob in a 2-1 win. He continued his impressive record of scoring in every game he had played at Al Shaab Stadium with the winning goal in a 2-1 win over huge rivals Al Zawraa, however that record ended five days later in a 1-1 draw with Al Talaba, a game in which he missed an open goal. He eventually left the club in May 2013 after a dip in form; Al Shorta's vice-president Adnan Jafar stated that the club had several players that were capable of filling in his position.|$|R
