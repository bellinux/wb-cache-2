25|$|In 2006, {{recording}} as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt {{teamed with}} her new friend, musician and musical scholar Ann Savoy, to record Adieu <b>False</b> <b>Heart.</b> It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But Adieu <b>False</b> <b>Heart</b> was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It {{was the last time}} Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as the result of Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in December 2012. Adieu <b>False</b> <b>Heart,</b> recorded in Louisiana, features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of the Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell, and Joel Savoy, as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush, and guitarist Bryan Sutton. The recording earned two Grammy Award nominations: Best Traditional Folk Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.|$|E

2500|$|Molloy {{never again}} held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, {{one of the}} daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to {{circulate}} that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had pressed her {{to bring an action}} for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon she said to him [...] "Captain Molloy, you are a bad man. I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your <b>false</b> <b>heart</b> fail you!" [...] Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed {{to be the result of}} her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: I, Anthony James Pye MolloyCan burn, take, sink and destroy;There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life!And that is, to stop the d-d tongue of my wife.|$|E

60|$|We {{have now}} to enter upon a sad episode of our revolutionary history--the treason of Arnold.

60|$|And now {{the case}} is but very little better with most men, than it was with Hazael; however it comes to pass, they are wonderfully unacquainted with their own temper and disposition, and know very little of what passes within them: For of so many proud, ambitious, revengeful, envying, and ill-natured persons, {{that are in the}} world, where is there one of them, who, {{although}} he has all the symptoms of the vice appearing upon every occasion, can look with such an impartial eye upon himself, as to believe that the imputation thrown upon him is not altogether groundless and unfair? Who, if he were told by men of a discerning spirit and a strong conjecture, of all the evil and absurd things which that <b>false</b> <b>heart</b> of his would at one time or other betray him into, would not believe as little, and wonder as much, as Hazael did before him? Thus, for instance; tell an angry person that he is weak and impotent, and of no consistency of mind; tell him, that such or such a little accident, which he may then despise and think much below a passion, shall hereafter make him say and do several absurd, indiscreet, and misbecoming things: He may perhaps own that he has a spirit of resentment within him, that will not let him be imposed on, but he fondly imagines that he can lay a becoming restraint upon it when he pleases, although 'tis ever running away with him into some indecency or other.|$|E

Methinks the spirit of Charlotte Corday has entered my soul now. I shall carve my name on the world, and be ranked among the great heroines. Ay! the spirit of Charlotte Corday beats in each petty vein, and nerves my woman's hand to strike, as I have nerved my woman's heart to hate. Though he laughs in his dreams, I shall not falter.

60|$|Alas! alas! I {{fear that}} justice was outraged in the welcome that Harry {{received}} on that evening. I {{have said that}} he would be called upon to own his sins, and so much, at least, should have been required of him. But he owned no sin. I have said that a certain degradation must attend him in that first interview after his reconciliation. Instead of this, the hours that he spent that evening in Onslow Terrace were hours of one long ovation. He was, as it were, put upon a throne as a king who had returned from his conquest, and those two women did him honor, almost kneeling at his feet. Cecilia was almost as tender with him as Florence, pleading to her own <b>false</b> <b>heart</b> the fact of his illness as his excuse. There was something of the pallor of the sick-room left with him--a slight tenuity in his hands and brightness in his eye which did him yeoman's service. Had he been quite robust, Cecilia might have felt that she could not justify to herself the peculiar softness of her words. After the first quarter of an hour he was supremely happy. His awkwardness had gone, and as he sat with his arm round Florence's waist, he found that the little pencil-case had again been attached to her chain, and as he looked down upon her he saw that the cheap brooch was again on her breast. It would have been pretty, could an observer have been there, to see the skill with which they both steered clear of any word or phrase which could be disagreeable to him. One might have thought {{that it would have been}} impossible to avoid all touch of a rebuke. The very fact that he was forgiven would seem to imply some fault that required pardon. But there was no hint at any fault. The tact of women excels the skill of men and so perfect was the tact of these, that not a word was said which wounded Harry's ear. He had come again into their fold, and they were rejoiced and showed their joy. He who had gone astray had repented, and they were beautifully tender to the repentant sheep.|$|E
