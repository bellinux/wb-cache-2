500|$|Critical {{response}} to the first episode was not favourable; in The Independent, Nicholas Barber called it the most depressing TV programme he had ever seen. He wrote of the six main characters, [...] "Are we supposed to care about these people? The theory, I think, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> relate to them, because their lives are as prosaic as our own, and because Cold Feet is a portrait of urban life as it really is in the Nineties. This {{is another way of}} saying the writer hasn't bothered with research or imagination." [...] He criticised the conclusion of Episode 1 but praised the other five, which he had seen on preview tapes. On The Late Review, Germaine Greer and Tony Parsons singled out Nesbitt's acting; Greer called him [...] "especially awful" [...] and Parsons wished that he had plunged to his death from the scissor lift Adam appears on {{at the beginning of the}} episode. General reaction improved as the first year went on. At the conclusion of the first series, Andrew Billen compared it with Vanity Fair in the Evening Standard and was pleased that it offered a televisual outlet for the [...] "forgotten" [...] twentysomethings. Paul Hoggart for The Times wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing and looked forward to how Rachel's pregnancy plot would be resolved in the second series.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, Appiah {{introduces}} two ideas that [...] "intertwine {{in the notion}} of cosmopolitanism" [...] (Emerging, 69). The first is the idea that we have obligations to others that are bigger than just sharing citizenship. The second idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never take for granted the value of life and become informed of the practices and beliefs of others. Kwame Appiah frequents university campuses to speak to students. One request he makes is, “See one movie with subtitles a month.”.|$|E
2500|$|Lessig has {{repeatedly}} taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that {{seen in the}} 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications {{is not the best}} way to help the Internet grow. He said, [...] "When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place," [...] "My claim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?" [...] "The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Old Caldigate, too, is very obstinate; {{but it may}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able {{to persuade}} him. He will know that {{she ought to be}} with her mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The ruling <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> witness things [...] And not dispute them. To the drama, then. [...] Emprizes over-Channel {{are the key}} [...] To this land's {{stir and}} ferment.--Thither we.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adam, when I {{came with}} {{you into the}} open, my main wish <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{together}} if anything serious happened. You wouldn't deny me that right, would you, dear?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Destour {{executive}} committee pursued its campaign {{to discredit the}} new generation of nationalists. In response, Bourguiba replied with more violence, aggression and contempt in his speeches. As for El Materi, they should not stoop to the elders' level; He advocated for reforming the party's methods in peace and understanding or split up from the movement and found their own one. He stated: [...] "My opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> let them cry in the wilderness, only a few people took them seriously". Sfar also criticized the Destour leadership writing: [...] "Too much conservatism harms society because it is a factor of immobility and death; it solidifies everything, destroyes all initiative spirit, opposes any vivifying and creating force and therefore stops any progress, breaks the momentum and growth of individuals and groups".|$|E
2500|$|In The New Jerusalem, Chesterton made {{it clear}} that he {{believed}} that there was a [...] "Jewish Problem" [...] in Europe, in the sense that he believed that Jewish culture (though not Jewish ethnicity) separated itself from the nationalities of Europe. He argued that he was quite in favour of a Jew becoming Prime Minister or Lord Chancellor, under the condition, though, that [...] "every Jew must be dressed like an Arab [...] The point applies to any Jew, and to our own recovery of healthier relations with him. The point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land." [...] He suggested the formation of a Jewish homeland as a solution, and was later invited to Palestine by Jewish Zionists who saw him as an ally in their cause. Later he grew out of the notion of Palestine as a Jewish homeland, and suggested somewhere in Africa instead.|$|E
60|$|Another <b>is,</b> <b>That</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{also look}} well to our tongues, {{that they be}} not rash in uttering {{anything}} before God.|$|E
5000|$|What {{would the}} United Kingdom do? Would it {{discharge}} Polaris, Trident or whatever against the main centres of {{population of the}} Continent of Europe or in European Russia? If so, {{what would be the}} consequence? The consequence would not <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> survive, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> repel our antagonist—nor would it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> escape defeat. The consequence would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would make certain, as far as is humanly possible, the virtual destruction and elimination of the hope of the future in these islands.... I would much sooner that the power to use it was not in the hands of any individual in this country at all.|$|R
6000|$|Is {{not this}} enough, my friends? Then why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> bite and tear {{each other about}} <b>that</b> which <b>is</b> over and above this? If any man {{believes}} this, and acts on it, let us hail him as a brother. After all, let our differences be what they will, have we not one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all? If this is not bond enough between man and man, what bond would we have? Oh, my friends, when we consider this our little life, how full of ignorance it is and darkness; within us, rebellion, inconstancy, confusion, daily sins and shortcomings; and without us, disappointment, fear of loneliness, loss of friends, loss of all which makes life worth having,--who <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> deny proudly one single tie which binds us to any other human being? Who <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> refuse one hand stretched out to grasp our own? Who <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> say, 'Stand back, for I am holier than thou?' Who <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> judge another? to his own master let him stand or fall--'yea, and he shall stand,' says the Apostle, 'for God is able to make him stand.' ...|$|R
60|$|The next idea <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> stop where <b>we</b> were, {{one which}} I rather welcomed, as I {{should have been}} glad to abide in peace with Marie until the six months of {{probation}} had gone by.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] resumed the Captain hastily, [...] "I do {{not think}} the danger so great. All I would urge <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not delay going to their rescue--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing {{could be}} easier,' said I. 'There are several casks {{of oil in}} the corner. My only {{objection}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> ourselves be nicely toasted, like two little oyster pâtés.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] exclaimed Harry, [...] "your advice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> by {{all means}} be happy, and if we can't be happy, be as happy as we can. Is that it?" ...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{conclusions}} of Bada et al.'s white paper <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> look for organics with nitrogen on Mars. Nitrogenous organics {{are likely to be}} rare because there are few sources of nitrogen on Mars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} it is very good for us not to have our {{ambition}} gratified," [...] said her mother. [...] "There are so many troubles worse than these failures, that it only shows how happy <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> take them so much to heart." ...|$|R
60|$|B. and I hurried {{on board}} at Dover, and were {{just in time}} to secure the last two berths in the boat; and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> glad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had managed to do this because our idea <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should,</b> after a good supper, turn in and go comfortably to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know as to that, Whitewing, but my advice, {{whatever}} it's worth, <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> try {{to fall on}} the reptiles {{in front}} and rear at the same time, and that you and I should go out in advance to scout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Walmsley," [...] he said, [...] "a {{week ago}} we were rather proud of having inveigled away {{one of your}} adherents. All I can say at the present moment <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have been better {{satisfied}} if you had left Mr. Bundercombe in town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My surmise, as you saw, {{proved to}} be correct," [...] said he, {{speaking}} {{from the depths of}} his easy-chair. [...] "There has been a substitution of lodgers. What I did not foresee <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> find a woman, and no ordinary woman, Watson." ...|$|E
6000|$|Deronda was {{a little}} startled by this clear-sightedness; {{but before he could}} reply Mordecai added--"it is all one. Had you been in need of the money, the great end would have <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> meet again. But you are rich?" [...] he ended, in a tone of interrogation.|$|R
6000|$|... "By my faith, {{were there}} {{but a couple}} of score of my old companions here, we would don our armour, mount our warhorses, and ride at them. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> slain, but before <b>that</b> came about <b>we</b> would make such {{slaughter}} of them that they would think twice before they took another step towards London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{call that}} hard," [...] Mrs. Rintoul said. [...] "The only thing I was glad {{we were going}} for <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> under Mr. M'Alaster, who is very pleasant, and quite {{understand}}s my case, while Dr. Wade {{does not seem to}} understand it at all, and is always so very brusque and unsympathetic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because we {{have not}} yet made our weapons, {{and it may be that}} we shall have some good chances of getting {{supplies}} at the very beginning of our travels. My opinion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> arm ourselves before starting, for the pork and cakes cannot last long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No need {{to trouble}} him, Margaret. He has given it already. His great desire <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> marry, for {{he seeks to}} leave this trade and {{to live with us}} in the Vale of Dedham, in Essex, where he has bought back my father's land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But as I {{know that}} this would not suit you,--as I feel sure that such delay would gall you every day, as I doubt whether it would not make you sick of me long before the four years be over,--my advice <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> let this matter drop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} {{exceedingly}} glad, Mr. Laverick," [...] he said dryly, [...] "to {{get rid of}} your packet. Your instructions <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> disregard all orders to hand it over to any person whatsoever, and I may say <b>that</b> they have <b>been</b> strictly adhered to. We have, however, had two applications in your name this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|And here it <b>is</b> fit <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{follow the}} example of the three sisters, and retire also.|$|R
60|$|It had <b>been</b> {{arranged}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> go to San Gabriel late in {{the afternoon}} of Christmas Day.|$|R
6000|$|... "My idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{stay here}} to-day (our {{supply of water}} won't last much longer), and start early to-morrow morning. That would be time enough to prove whether the boats are coming, {{and give us a}} chance to get the traps into proper shape for carrying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is unlikely,' said I, 'that those rascals know {{anything}} about our coming. I have seen no signs of scouts along the road. My own plan <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> conceal ourselves in some neighbouring wood, and then, when they open their gates, charge down upon them and take them by surprise.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When Christ {{answered}} the rich {{young man and}} said for him {{to give to the}} poor all he possessed or he could not gain everlasting life, He did not mean it in the literal sense. My interpretation of His words <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> part with what comes between us and Christ.|$|E
60|$|Then Komba, after {{consultation}} with his companions, gave way. Evidently he <b>was</b> anxious <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> visit Pongo-land.|$|R
6000|$|One evening [...] "Who <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> live?" [...] cried Hal. [...] "The spider is less cruel; {{the very}} pig less greedy, gluttonous and foul; the tiger less tigerish; our cousin ape less monkeyish. What are we but savages, clothed and ashamed, nine-tenths of us?" ...|$|R
