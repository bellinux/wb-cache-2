Since DEA-type indicators based on nonparametric production analysis are simply point estimates without any standard error, we provide a methodology {{to assess the}} performance of strip mining operations {{by means of a}} DEA bootstrapping approach. This methodology is applied to a sample of fifteen Illinois strip coal mines using publicly available data (Thompson et al., 1995). The applied approach uses a mixed mine <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> (MMEPI) that is derived by means of a VRS DEA environmental technology treating overburden as an undesirable output under the weak disposability assumption, and we compare this measure with a traditional output-oriented mine performance indicator (MPI) omitting overburden.

The confidence intervals derived by the bootstrapping of the proposed MMEPI point estimates indicate that significant inefficiency has taken place in the analyzed sample of Illinois strip mines.

40|$|We define <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> as {{analytical}} {{tools that}} allow one to compare various plants in a firm, or various firms in an industry, {{with each other}} and with respect to certain environmental characteristics. We start from a reflection about the kind of information that should be incorporated into such indicators, and the extent to which that information should be aggregated. Existing approaches are both rare and dissimilar. They range from oversimplified indicators to more sophisticated ones, in which there is a trend to take somewhat arbitrary viewpoints. In the scope of the theory of productive efficiency, three categories of factor are taken into account, i. e. inputs, desirable production outputs and pollutants in the form of ''undesirable'' outputs. Non-parametric efficiency measures easily and usefully lend themselves to the derivation of <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> They are the duals of indicators that can be obtained in the traditional framework of data envelopment analysis. We use data envelopment analysis to define standardised, aggregate <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> that is, quantities comprised between 0 (bad performance) and 1 (good <b>performance).</b> Such <b>indicators</b> do not require the specification of any a priori weight on the environmental impacts that are being aggregated.

ISO 14001 certification {{in this regard is}} widely considered the tool of choice for driving waste minimisation efforts. To this day, however, the evidence remains mixed as it pertains to the effectiveness of ISO 14001 in helping firms reduce waste, especially in developing countries. This paper explores the waste minimisation efforts among Indian small and medium enterprises. Specifically, improvements in waste minimisation are analysed from small and medium enterprises operating in the cities of Delhi and Noida. Our proposed model is tested for a model-fit, and the hypotheses are tested through regression coefficient (β) scores to determine the influence of ISO 14001 on the degree of waste minimisation among certified and non-certified companies. The data reveal that ISO 14001 certification alone helped account for a 25 % increase in waste minimisation in certified companies after controlling for other critical factors (correlated to the variable ‘waste minimisation’) that may influence this relationship. The analytical tools described in this paper lend themselves to be applied to similar research problems in future studies.

The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions imposed by buildings have been studied rather extensively, but less is known about other impacts.

In addition, the use of effective EPIs may contribute to cost and risk reduction, review of the effectiveness of an authority’s Environmental Management System, and act as an early warning system. The thesis identifies a comprehensive inventory of existing <b>Environmental</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Indicators</b> in use in the seaport sector for monitoring performance of operational (e. g. dust, noise, dredging, waste), managerial (e. g. certification, compliance, complaints) and environmental condition (e. g. air, water, soil, sediment and ecosystems).

40|$|Owing to new {{regulations}} starting from 2025, all commercial canal boats have to comply to zero local emission standards in Amsterdam. It is therefore vital that a clear emission indicator is {{made available for}} vessels with a varying operational profile, such as canal boats. In this paper, {{it is argued that}} current indicators, such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index, are not suitable for these (passenger) vessels. This paper proposes environmental performance indicators that can quantify emissions, (non-dimensional) energy and fuel usage based on an operational profile set in the design phase. This profile includes part load operation and auxiliary consumers and it can compare new designed concepts with current baseline vessels based on the ‘benefit for society’ of different vessel types. In the proposed environmental performance indicators, several operational modes can be defined, in contrast with the currently proposed Energy Efficiency Design Index, which is a point index at 75 % of installed power. To gauge not only local emissions but also global emissions, the <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> methodology is used to determine a minimum efficiency from any power generation method. This minimum efficiency follows from a comparison between baseline vessels and concepts that are more energy efficient and emission friendly. The proposed environmental performance indicators were validated using measurements on typical propulsion configurations of canal boats in Amsterdam. Three full electric concepts were designed and compared with the measured baseline vessels. As full electric concepts do not have local emissions, the method of power generation must satisfy the requirement to have less global emissions than the mechanical baseline. Furthermore, an energy efficiency of at least 33 % is calculated from a fossil-fuelled land-based power plant (including transport) to the boundary from quay to boat to be required for newly designed electric concepts to be more energy efficient than the mechanical baseline.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{is ultimately}} driven by societal consumption. Individuals, corporations and governments are increasingly {{interested in making}} environmentally preferable purchasing and investment decisions. To do so requires an ability to comprehensively evaluate the environmental performance of products. Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) can produce a detailed record of the environmental burdens attributed to a product {{as a result of}} its production, distribution, use and disposal. However, comprehensively evaluating products based on this multi-attribute data can be challenging. There is no formal guidance on how to aggregate LCA results, and no axiomatically defensible consensus methodology has emerged. The principal objective of this research is to develop a methodologically sound approach to a composite <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> (CEPI) for evaluating decision alternatives. This is achieved using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and multivariate analysis methods. First, this research examines the variety of MCDA methods that can be used to explicitly interpret multi-attribute data, highlighting alternatives to the ubiquitous weighted sum. The author elucidates the hidden assumptions of MCDA models and presents a systematic approach to help analysts make appropriate methodological choices, bridging the gap between the rhetoric and mathematics of environmental and sustainability assessment. Second, this research investigates the problem of criteria interaction, which can lead to &# 145;double counting&# 146; by aggregation models that assume independence (e. g. weighted sum). The Choquet integral is an aggregation model based on a fuzzy measure, which can account for criteria interaction. However, estimating the criteria weights has been problematic. The author develops and demonstrates a novel method of criteria weight estimation that overcomes limitations of existing approaches. Third, this research considers how to aggregate multi-attribute data into a readily understood metric that enables a comprehensive judgement on the environmental performance of decision alternatives.

40|$|In the Philippines, the {{semiconductor}} and electronic industry contributes about 70 % of export earnings. More {{than half of}} the companies inside industrial estates in the country are semiconductor and electronic firms. These firms are among the major contributors of hazardous wastes released through different media, notably solid and semi-solid wastes. The <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator,</b> amount of hazardous waste generated per employee, was selected in this study since it is the main environmental problem of SEF and it can be a surrogate of environmental performance when the volume generated has been reduced by way of treatment, disposal or waste minimization efforts. A model equation was derived which identifies the 10 significant variables in terms of affecting the hazardous waste generation. Out of the 10, only four were found to be significant to reduce or increase amount of hazardous waste generated. These are a) ISO accreditation, b) price of treatment and disposal, c) location of firm, whether inside an industrial estate or not, and, d) number/frequency of inspection by regulatory agency. From the regression results, it was shown that there would be less hazardous waste generation if the firm were more automated with less number of employees. Proper handling and transporting of raw materials and products to minimize waste, increasing quality control to minimize rejects, and recycling could also reduce waste generation. Price has also an effect in that increasing the cost charged by ESPs could result to a substantial reduction in hazardous waste generation, which was found to be price elastic. The location of the SEF was also found to be a significant variable since SEF located inside an industrial estate appear to produce more hazardous waste perhaps because the SEFs inside the IEs are more transparent in reporting compared to their counterparts outside IEs. More frequent inspection was also shown to positively affect the environmental performance by reducing hazardous waste generation. Thus, as in other types of industry, inspection is a powerful tool in improving environmental performance within {{the semiconductor}} and electronic industry. waste management, Philippines...|$|E

This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the construction of environmental indicators, serving investors for the assessment of com-plex performance of companies in accordance with social and corporate governance indicators, the so-called ESG <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> The research project “Construction of Methods for Multifactor Assessment of Company Complex Performance in Selected Sectors”, solved by the team of authors has been introduced. In recent years, investment managers have preferred the importance of ESG indicators showing long-term sustainable performance of those companies in which they have invested their financial resources. The objective of presented contribution is the proposal of environmental indicators, i. e. key ESG <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> <b>Environmental</b> indicators are used not only for decision-making, but also for determination of sustainable value. A number of successive steps have been taken to construct environmental indicators and a combination of various statistical methods has been employed. An empirical analysis of <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for the companies operating in the processing industry according to CZ-NACE has been carried out {{on the basis of the}} analysis of sources, suggested by inter-national organisations and voluntary <b>environmental</b> instruments. <b>Environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> facilitating investors to decide on their investment activities and forming the part of key ESG-performance indicators, represent expected results o...|$|R

40|$|Demonstrating {{the success}} of {{watershed}} management efforts is critical for securing future funding, gaining public support, and communicating water quality results to stakeholders. However, many community-based watershed management groups find that the monitoring methods they are using cannot effectively show {{the impact of their}} project. <b>Environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> also known as <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> measures or <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> can be used to assess the impacts of watershed planning and implementation projects on water quality outcomes. The overall goal of this research was to develop a framework that watershed groups can use to examine the impacts of watershed management through the use of <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Specific objectives were to (1) identify how watershed groups within Indiana are using indicators to document water quality outcomes, and determine what group, watershed, or project characteristics relate to water quality indicator use, (2) identify a set of core <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> of watershed management success for Indiana, (3) compare estimated load reductions to target values based on project 2 ̆ 7 s goals and eco-regions, (4) assess the capacity of watershed groups to achieve a detectable change in water quality. ^ Existing watershed management plans were assessed and telephone interviews were conducted to determine how Indiana watershed groups used indicators to document water quality outcomes, and which group, watershed, or project characteristics were related to water quality indicator use. Logistic regressions found that the number of environmental problems was the only significant characteristic related to tracking indicators after controlling for other factors. The study found that only 17 out of 30 watershed projects tracked any environmental indicators. Other projects attributed their inability to track <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> to lack of funds, personnel turnover, issues with data storage methods, and especially the lack of BMP implementation. ^ An expert panel process was used to gain statewide input for determining environmental indicators to track watershed management success in Indiana. Although this participatory process was not sufficient to achieve consensus on the best environmental indicators, it added value by bringing together practitioners 2 ̆ 7 experience on what indicators are feasible to collect, and experts 2 ̆ 7 scientific knowledge, which may result in improved acceptance of using the selected environmental indicators in the future. Eight core indicators were selected to guide future monitoring efforts. ^ In order to compare water quality outcomes to water quality goals, load reductions from BMPs implemented in eleven watersheds were evaluated and compared to load reduction targets. Results showed that load reductions from BMPs implemented were rarely adequate to meet water quality targets, achieving only 1 to 5...|$|R
