50|$|To reach a {{specific}} station, the caller enters the ALE Address. On many ALE radios {{this is similar}} to dialing a phone number. The ALE controller selects the best available <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> for that destination address. After confirming the channel is indeed idle, it then sends a brief selective calling signal identifying the intended recipient. When the distant scanning station detects ALE activity, it stops scanning and stays on that channel until it can confirm whether or not the call is for it. The two stations' ALE controllers automatically handshake to confirm that a link of sufficient quality has been established, then notify the operators that the link is up. If the callee fails to respond or the handshaking fails, the originating ALE node usually selects another frequency either at random or by making a guess of varying sophistication.|$|E
5000|$|A typical FM {{two-way radio}} carrier squelch circuit is noise operated. It {{takes out the}} voice {{components}} of the receive audio by passing the detected audio through a high-pass filter. A typical filter might pass frequencies over 4,000 Hz (4 kHz). The squelch control adjusts the gain of an amplifier which varies the level of noise {{coming out of the}} filter. The audio output of the filter and amplifier is rectified and produces a DC voltage when noise is present. The presence of continuous noise on an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> creates a DC voltage which turns the receiver audio off. When a signal with little or no noise is received, the noise-derived voltage goes away and the receiver audio is unmuted. Some applications have the receiver tied to other equipment that uses the audio muting control voltage as a [...] "signal present" [...] indication, for example in a repeater the act of the receiver unmuting will switch on the transmitter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a theoretical estimation for <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> {{time in a}} multi-hop environment. <b>Idle</b> <b>channel</b> time is the time proportion of a node during which the channel state is idle. Thus, {{it can be used}} to evaluate the available bandwidth. Major related work considers a cross-layer model, where the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time measure is available at the MAC layer, but it is rarely implemented. Furthermore, this measure is not very flexible: it cannot differentiate the traffic’s priorities and it works under the hypothesis that flows are strictly policed. Estimating instead of measuring the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time prevents these drawbacks. This estimation is computed in three steps by (1) calculating the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time bounds, (2) evaluating the probability of a given <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time value, (3) computing the expected value of this distribution and deducing the average <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time. We show by simulation that our estimation is accurate. I...|$|E

30|$|To {{ensure that}} a large set of common <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> is in each cluster and provide a graceful {{trade-off}} between the cluster size and cluster-based common <b>idle</b> <b>channels,</b> Liu et al. [12] formulated the clustering problem using a bipartite graph. In this study, we incorporate the same methodology for cluster formation. Despite of employing the same clustering as [12], proposed gateway selection mechanism (GSM) can work independent of underlying clustering scheme. However, the performance of GSM is still dependent on the underlying clustering technique. SUs are partitioned into clusters based {{on the set of}} <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> that are common to all cluster members. The main goal of this cluster formation methodology is to cluster SUs {{in such a way that}} there is a large set of common <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> between the cluster members. The benefit associated with this sort of clustering is that a cluster has more options for choosing a control channel. As a result, the control channel can migrate to another channel without performing clustering again, even if the current one becomes occupied by a PU.|$|R

40|$|In a {{wireless}} network using CSMA for MAC, packet collisions can result {{either because of}} the vulnerability stemming from the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> detection delay of the radio device or because of the hidden terminal problem. Both of these collision scenarios can be addressed by applying some additional structure to carrier sense-based channel access, sacrificing throughput to improve collision protection. Specifically, we assign a unique time slice to each contending transmitter {{that is designed to}} allow collision-free access to each data slot while still using carrier sense as the mechanism to determine channel state. The width of each time slice is equal to the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> detection delay of the radio. We prepend a fixed-length time interval to each transmitted packet whose length is proportional to the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> detection delay of the radio device and the node density.

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{utilization}} of LAA UL data transmission, a scheme called multi-subframe scheduling (MSS) was proposed in 3 GPP RAN 1 meeting [17, 18]. Different from the traditional scheduling scheme where a UL grant always indicates the resource allocation on a single subframe, MSS allows a UL grant to indicate resource allocation across multiple subframes. There {{are two kinds of}} MSS. The first one is that a UL grant can indicate data transmission on multiple subframes. That is, the UE which receives the grant can transmit data for multiple subframes rather than a single subframe as long as it has found an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> before transmission. One may expect an increase of throughput as the number of subframes permitted for transmission increases. The second kind of MSS is that a UL grant can indicate multiple channel-sensing opportunities where UE can transmit data on a single subframe as long as it has found an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> in one of the granted opportunities. By allowing more channel sensing opportunities, the probability for a UE to detect an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> increases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} a new carrier–sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol for multihop wireless networks, sometimes also called ad hoc networks. The CSMA protocol divides the available bandwidth into several channels and selects an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> randomly for packet transmission. It also employs {{a notion of}} “soft ” channel reservation as it gives preference to the channel that {{was used for the}} last successful transmission. We show via simulations that this multichannel CSMA protocol provides a higher throughput compared to its single channel counterpart by reducing the packet loss due to collisions. We also show that the use of channel reservation provides better performance than multichannel CSMA with purely random <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> selection. ...|$|E

30|$|In this work, we have {{proposed}} a parallel sensing scheme for the cognitive radio ad hoc networks that efficiently discovers more <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> from the primary user band, consequently leading to improved spectrum utilization, lower power consumption, and higher throughput. We have investigated the performance of proposed parallel sensing scheme through both mathematical analysis and simulations. Comparison with the SMC-MAC protocol [27] shows that the proposed parallel sensing scheme outperforms the SMC-MAC sensing scheme by finding more <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> from the primary user band and also improves energy efficiency during the sensing phase by {{increasing the number of}} parallel groups. Most importantly, the proposed scheme provides higher system throughput as the duration of sensing phase is reduced through parallel sensing, resulting in increased transmission time for the SUs in a given cycle. The proposed parallel sensing scheme is particularly suitable for delay-sensitive applications in ad hoc cognitive radio networks as it discovers higher number of <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> in less time, consumes lower energy, and affords enhanced throughput.|$|R
