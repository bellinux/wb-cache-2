5|$|With the {{improvements}} to the River Witham, the final section of Earl Fitzwilliam's <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> Lodewick Gowt was filled in, and the channel was diverted to join the South Forty-Foot Drain. Renamed the North Forty-Foot Drain, it now supplies Cook's Lock and Holland Fen pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|A new main <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Although Coatbridge has {{no major}} river running through it, the North Calder Water runs east-west {{to the south}} and the now defunct Monkland Canal used to run {{straight}} through the centre of the town toward Glasgow. The canal route through Coatbridge can still be seen today. There are also several smaller burns which run through Coatbridge, most of which <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> the North Calder Water. Coatbridge has four significant public parks. Dunbeth park, West End park, Whifflet park and Drumpellier Country park. Woodend and Witchwood Loch are situated on the north-west edge of Coatbridge.|$|E

A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor <b>Drain</b> <b>to</b> help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night.

5|$|In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the {{coordinator}} of the Saw Mill River Coalition, received a three-year, $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants, the group cleans up garbage, removes invasive species, and plants native trees along the river. The group also marks storm drains that <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> the river. On September 25–26, 2009, the Saw Mill River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and bacteria in the river and its watershed. The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands along the river {{in order to reduce}} flooding.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{its course}} is through low-lying {{land that is}} at or just above sea level, and regular {{flooding}} has been a long-standing problem along the waterway. Drainage schemes to alleviate it were constructed {{on both sides of}} the river. The Holderness Drainage scheme to the east was completed in 1772, with a second phase in 1805, and the Beverley and Barmston <b>Drain</b> <b>to</b> the west was completed in 1810. Since 1980, the mouth of the river has been protected by a tidal barrier at the estuary, which can be closed to prevent tidal surges entering the river system and causing flooding upriver.|$|E

5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> the White Salmon River.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a sizable}} Serbian American {{diaspora}} in the United States; in 2007 {{a total of}} 172,834 people of Serbian nationality or descent were recorded to be inhabiting the U.S. The first documented wave of Serbian immigrants to the United States was recorded in the 1970s when many Serbian factory workers emigrated to Detroit to manufacture automobiles for Ford. In 2011, Serbia was ranked second in the world (after Guinea Bissau) in human capital flight according to USAID. Brain <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> the United States and Canada has been cited as a chronic phenomenon in Serbia, especially from 1990 to 2000 during the decade of UN sanctions and war.|$|E
5|$|For a short stretch, the Colorado {{watershed}} {{meets the}} drainage basin of the Snake River, {{a tributary of}} the Columbia River, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming. Southwest of there, the northern divide of the Colorado watershed skirts the edge of the Great Basin, bordering on the closed drainage basins of the Great Salt Lake and the Sevier River in central Utah, and other closed basins in southern Utah and Nevada. To the west in California, the Colorado River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert, the largest of which is the Salton Sea drainage north of the Colorado River Delta. On the south, the watersheds of the Sonoyta, Concepción, and Yaqui rivers, all of which <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> the Gulf of California, border that of the Colorado.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} hit by severe floods in 1794, {{as a result of}} which the Commissioners of Sewers {{obtained}} the Brue Drainage Act in 1801, which allowed them to improve the course of the River Brue by the straightening of major loops at Highbridge and East Huntspill, and to construct the North and South Drains, which collected water from the peat moorlands and channelled it into the lower River Brue. Under the terms of the Act, two small canals, called Galton's Canal and Brown's Canal, were built near the North <b>Drain</b> <b>to</b> serve peat extraction workings. The drainage works were not wholly successful in preventing flooding, and the Commissioners often failed to obtain the levies they required to finance their operations.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E

5|$|Two drains were built, {{of which}} the most {{successful}} was the Swinefleet Warping Drain, pioneered by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and authorised by an Act of Parliament. Opened in 1821, poor-quality land was reclaimed for around forty years. The other scheme was Durham's Warping <b>Drain,</b> <b>to</b> the north of Thorne, which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don. The drain was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham, but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors. He died in 1882, just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture. The change was brought about by an agricultural depression and {{the high price of}} straw for animal bedding.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{continues}} {{parallel to}} the state line from the Marensico area through the national forest toward Watersmeet. That unincorporated community {{is the home of}} the Watersmeet High School Nimrods, the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel. The area is also where the waters meet; the rolling hills <b>drain</b> <b>to</b> Lake Superior via the Ontonagon River, to Lake Michigan via the Brule and Menominee rivers, or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. Also located in the area are the Sylvania Wilderness, and the Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation, which includes the Lac Vieux Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County. US2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH16) near Golden Lake in Stambaugh Township {{in the middle of the}} national forest. The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M‑73. In town, US2 intersects M‑189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city.|$|E
