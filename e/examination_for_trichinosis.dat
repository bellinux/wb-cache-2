In one study, microwaved Trichinella larvae were used to immunize mice, which were subsequently infected. Depending on the dosage and frequency of immunization, results ranged from a decreased larval count to complete protection from trichinosis.|$|R

40|$|The {{environment}} of the Osijek-Baranja County's hunting grounds is a potential source of parasitically disease, trichinellosis. In the hounting grounds where wild boar is mostly dwelling, other animals which act as potential disease vectors (rats, foxes, badgers, jackal's etc.), dwells too. Despite of the continuous zoohygienic control, trichinellosis at wild boar has been observed. Their migration out of the hunting grounds makes possible the contact with pigs, which are in extensive breeding, and spreading of disease in both directions is possible. Due to many reasons, of which the war-situation {{in the recent past}} is the main, the Osijek-Baranja County become an endemic area <b>for</b> <b>trichinosis.</b> Our research has confirmed trichinellosis at wild boar, so it requires further and continuous monitoring of disease. ...|$|R
40|$|Trichinosis is a food-borne {{zoonotic}} disease {{caused by the}} nematode, Trichinella spp., and had been reported several times in Korea. Recently, there was an additional outbreak, involving 5 patients, the findings from which are reported herein. On 30 November 2010, 8 persons ate sashimi of the meat of a wild boar. Then, 2 - 3 weeks later, they complained of myalgia and fever. Unfortunately, muscle biopsy was not performed, but ELISA was performed using their sera. Two people among 8 were positive for Trichinella on the 34 th day post-infection (PI), and 3 patients who initially revealed negative ELISA were additionally proved to be positive <b>for</b> <b>trichinosis</b> on the 42 nd day PI. Hence, the confirmed patients of trichinosis were 5 in total in the present outbreak. They were treated with albendazole and discharged uneventfully.

40|$|DATA on its {{incidence}} establish trichi-nosis as {{the most}} prevalent helmin-thic infestation of man. Autopsy informa-tion (1) and corroborative skin testing (2) indicate that 30, 000, 000 Americans, or {{one out of every}} 6, harbor Trichinella spiralis. Obviously the overwhelming majority are asymptomatically parasitized. Although it is difficult to predict the number of symptomatic cases because of varying de-grees of host resistance and sites of larval dissemination, it is estimated that 16, 000 Americans yearly will consume sufficient viable larvae to cause detectable illness. The mortality rate <b>for</b> <b>trichinosis</b> is gen-erally regarded as 5 to 6 per cent (3), from which 800 deaths annually would be ex-pected. A review of the English literature within the past 20 years does not confirm this figure, for either endemic or epidemic cases. Either this figure is too high, or many fatal cases are clinically misdiag-nosed. The fatal complications of trichinosis are myocardial and neurologic involve-ment.

30|$|In Germany, {{becoming}} a certified auditor (comparable to a CPA) requires passing an exam on four topics: auditing, business administration, commercial law, and taxation. The state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> auditors enables auditors, once qualified, to advise non-listed corporate clients on various issues including taxation. However, {{it is common}} practice for auditors to also take a state <b>examination</b> specifically <b>for</b> taxation {{so they can be}} fully certified chartered tax consultants. This particular exam goes beyond tax issues dealt with in the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> auditors and is very challenging. The failure rate regularly lies at around 50 %. This exam {{can be seen as a}} further education of auditors that broadens individual auditors’ knowledge and allows to differentiate among auditors. Consequently, since this tax certification expands the knowledge acquired with the audit examination, audit exam candidates who have already passed the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> chartered tax consultants are permitted to bypass the exam on taxation. However, candidates <b>for</b> the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> chartered tax consultants who are already certified auditors may only bypass the accounting portion of the state <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> tax consultants.|$|R
