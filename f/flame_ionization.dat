25|$|The {{number of}} various {{molecules}} in an oil sample {{can be determined}} by laboratory analysis. The molecules are typically extracted in a solvent, then separated in a gas chromatograph, and finally determined with a suitable detector, such as a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector or a mass spectrometer. Due to {{the large number of}} co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the water associated fraction of the oil.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical fluid {{chromatography}} (SFC) {{can be used}} on {{an analytical}} scale, where it combines many of the advantages of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). It can be used with non-volatile and thermally labile analytes (unlike GC) and can be used with the universal <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (unlike HPLC), as well as producing narrower peaks due to rapid diffusion. In practice, the advantages offered by SFC have not been sufficient to displace the widely used HPLC and GC, except in a few cases such as chiral separations and analysis of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. For manufacturing, efficient preparative simulated moving bed units are available. The purity of the final products is very high, but the cost makes it suitable only for very high-value materials such as pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|These two components, used together, allow a much finer {{degree of}} {{substance}} identification than either unit used separately. It {{is not possible}} to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample while gas chromatography using a traditional detector (e.g. <b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector) cannot differentiate between multiple molecules that happen to take {{the same amount of time}} to travel through the column (i.e. have the same retention time), which results in two or more molecules that co-elute. Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error, as it is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, when an identifying mass spectrum appears at a characteristic retention time in a GC-MS analysis, it typically increases certainty that the analyte of interest is in the sample.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> {{detectors}} {{are used}} very widely in gas chromatography {{because of a}} number of advantages.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> {{detector}} varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but the principles are the same. Most commonly, the FID {{is attached to a}} gas chromatography system.|$|E
50|$|Autozygome {{analysis}} and biochemical evaluations of urinary sugars and polyols {{can be used}} to diagnose Transaldolase Deficiency. Two specific methods for measuring the urinary sugars and polyols are liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography with <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detection.|$|E
50|$|Methanizer is an {{appliance}} used in gas chromatography, {{which allows}} to detect very low concentrations {{of carbon monoxide}} and carbon dioxide. It consists of a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector, preceded by a hydrogenating reactor, which converts CO2 and CO into methane CH4.|$|E
50|$|The {{separated}} gases are {{detected by}} thermal conductivity detector for atmospheric gases, by <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector for hydrocarbons and oxides of carbon. A methanator {{is used to}} detect oxides of carbon by reducing them to methane, {{when they are in}} very low concentration.|$|E
5000|$|The Polyarc reactor is a {{scientific}} instrument for {{the measurement of}} organic molecules. The reactor is paired with a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (FID) in a gas chromatograph (GC) to improve {{the sensitivity of the}} FID and give a uniform detector response for all organic molecules (GC-Polyarc/FID).|$|E
50|$|The first <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> {{detectors}} {{were developed}} simultaneously and independently in 1957 by McWilliam and Dewar at Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ, see Orica#History) Central Research Laboratory, Ascot Vale, Melbourne, Australia. and by Harley and Pretorius at the University of Pretoria in Pretoria, South Africa.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> {{detector}} (FID) is {{a scientific}} instrument that measures {{the concentration of}} organic species in a gas stream. It is frequently used as a detector in gas chromatography. Standalone FIDs {{can also be used}} in applications such as landfill gas monitoring, fugitive emissions monitoring and internal combustion engine emissions measurement in stationary or portable instruments.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the small}} width of the peak in the second {{dimension}} suitable detectors are needed. For example, <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (FID), (micro) electron capture detector (µECD) and mass spectrometry analyzers such as fast time of flight (TOF). Several authors have published work using quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (qMS), though some trade-offs have to be accepted as these are much slower.|$|E
50|$|Gaseous ammonia is {{continuously}} monitored in industrial refrigeration processes and biological degradation processes, including exhaled breath. Depending on the required sensitivity, {{different types of}} sensors are used (e.g., <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector, semiconductor, electrochemical, photonic membranes). Detectors usually operate near the Lower Exposure Limit of 25ppm; however, ammonia detection for industrial safety requires continuous monitoring above the fatal exposure limit of 0.1%.|$|E
50|$|Analytical {{techniques}} for gas samples comprise gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (TCD), <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detection (FID) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for gases, and various wet chemical {{techniques for}} dissolved species (e.g., acidimetric titration for dissolved CO2, and ion chromatography for sulfate, chloride, fluoride). The trace metal, trace organic and isotopic composition is usually determined by different mass spectrometric methods.|$|E
50|$|In the oil {{industry}} katharometers {{have been used for}} a long time for hydrocarbon detection but have a history of unstable calibrations in non-stationary oil-related applications. In normal drilling practice, 5 hydrocarbon gases, plus a couple of non-hydrocarbon gases, are expected in normal samples resulting in cross-talk between the methane absorption line and the ethane. Hence the current use of <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detectors.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main methods to obtain SARA results. One has lately {{emerged as the}} most popular. That {{technology}} {{is known as the}} Iatroscan TLC-FID, it combines TLC with <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detection (TLC-FID). It is referred to as IP-143. Other analysis giving SARA numbers might not correspond to the numbers obtained in IP-143. It is therefore always important to know the analysis method when comparing SARA numbers.|$|E
50|$|The 351 acre campus {{has many}} {{computing}} and research laboratories, including student computing labs, fabrication labs, science research labs, group instruction labs, fine arts labs, a circuits and microprocessors lab, computer-aided drafting lab and a writing center. The science resources and instrumentation {{possessed by the}} campus consist of GC/MS, HPLC (UVvis), DNA sequencer, TOC/N, RT-PCR, <b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector, and a confocal microscope, along with supporting equipment.|$|E
50|$|The DGA {{technique}} involves extracting or {{stripping the}} gases {{from the oil}} and injecting them into a gas chromatograph (GC). Detection of gas concentrations usually {{involves the use of}} a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Most systems also employ a methanizer, which converts any carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide present into methane {{so that it can be}} burned and detected on the FID, a very sensitive sensor.|$|E
5000|$|Alkali Flame Detector, AFD or Alkali <b>Flame</b> <b>Ionization</b> Detector, AFID. AFD {{has high}} {{sensitivity}} to nitrogen and phosphorus, similar to NPD. However, the alkaline metal ions are supplied with the hydrogen gas, {{rather than a}} bead above the flame. For this reason AFD does not suffer the [...] "fatigue" [...] of he NPD, but provides a constant sensitivity over long period of time. In addition, when alkali ions are not added to the flame, AFD operates like a standard FID.|$|E
50|$|The TCD {{is a good}} {{general purpose}} {{detector}} for initial investigations with an unknown sample. Since the TCD is less sensitive than the <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector and has a larger dead volume it will not provide as good resolution as the FID. However, in combination with thick film columns and correspondingly larger sample volumes, the overall detection limit can be {{similar to that of}} an FID. The TCD is not as sensitive as other detectors but it is non-specific and non-destructive.|$|E
50|$|Because gases {{produced}} by landfills are both valuable and sometimes hazardous, monitoring techniques have been developed. <b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detectors {{can be used}} to measure methane levels as well as total VOC levels. Surface monitoring and sub-surface monitoring as well as monitoring of the ambient air is carried out. In the U.S., under the Clean Air Act of 1996, it is required that many large landfills install gas collection and control systems, which means that at the very least the facilities must collect and flare the gas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>ionization</b> {{detectors}} cannot detect {{inorganic substances}} and some highly oxygenated or functionalized species like infrared and laser technology can. In some systems, CO and CO2 {{can be detected}} in the FID using a methanizer, which is a bed of Ni catalyst that reduces CO and CO2 to methane, which can be in turn detected by the FID. The methanizer is limited by its inability to reduce compounds other than CO and CO2 and its tendency to be poisoned {{by a number of}} chemicals commonly found in GC effluents.|$|E
50|$|The {{ease and}} {{efficiency}} of gas chromatography for separating organic chemicals spurred the rapid adoption of the method, {{as well as the}} rapid development of new detection methods for analyzing the output. The thermal conductivity detector, described in 1954 by N. H. Ray, was the foundation for several other methods: the <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector was described by J. Harley, W. Nel, and V. Pretorius in 1958, and James Lovelock introduced the electron capture detector that year as well. Others introduced mass spectrometers to gas chromatography in the late 1950s.|$|E
50|$|During an IGC {{experiment}} a pulse or constant {{concentration of}} a known gas or vapor (probe molecule) is injected down the column {{at a fixed}} carrier gas flow rate. The retention time of the probe molecule is then measured by traditional GC detectors (i.e. <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector or thermal conductivity detector). Measuring how the retention time changes {{as a function of}} probe molecule chemistry, probe molecule size, probe molecule concentration, column temperature, or carrier gas flow rate can elucidate a wide range of physico-chemical properties of the solid under investigation. Several in depth reviews of IGC have been published previously.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the analyte, an ECD can be 10-1000 {{times more}} {{sensitive}} than a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (FID), and one million times {{more sensitive than}} a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). An ECD has a limited dynamic range and finds its greatest application in analysis of halogenated compounds. The detection limit for electron capture detectors is 5 femtograms per second (fg/s), and the detector commonly exhibits a 10,000-fold linear range. This {{made it possible to}} detect halogenated compounds such as pesticides and CFCs, even at levels of only one part per trillion (ppt), thus revolutionizing our understanding of the atmosphere and pollutants.|$|E
50|$|Analysis by gas {{chromatography}} (GC) is {{the method of}} choice for FAME analysis. The GC is coupled with either a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) or a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (FID). The GC-MSD system is more expensive to purchase and to maintain as well as requiring considerable skill in operation. Identification of fatty acids using the GC-FID system is dependent on comparison of retention times of the compounds in comparison to purchased standards of fatty acid esters. A commercially available, fatty-acid based microbial identification system (using GC-FID), which reproducibly names and quantitates the FAMEs, has been widely adopted for PLFA analysis.|$|E
50|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} determinations of the phenolic acids by reverse phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (RP HPLC) show relatively small amounts of rosmarinic, chlorogenic, and caffeic acids in the basal leaves and the roots of intact plants, and greater concentrations in E. planum from in vitro cultures. Qualitative {{and quantitative}} analyses of the essential oil compounds performed by gas chromatography with a <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector linked to a mass spectrometer (GC-FID-MS) show {{the main components of}} stalk leaf oil, and rosette leaf oil, as monoterpenes (limonene, and α- and β-pinene), sesquiterpenes, and hydrocarbons. (Z)-Falcarinol was found as the major component of root essential oil.|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used detectors are the <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detector (FID) and the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Both are sensitive {{to a wide range}} of components, and both work over a wide range of concentrations. While TCDs are essentially universal and can be used to detect any component other than the carrier gas (as long as their thermal conductivities are different from that of the carrier gas, at detector temperature), FIDs are sensitive primarily to hydrocarbons, and are more sensitive to them than TCD. However, a FID cannot detect water. Both detectors are also quite robust. Since TCD is non-destructive, it can be operated in-series before a FID (destructive), thus providing complementary detection of the same analytes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>Ionization</b> {{detector}} (FID), in {{this common}} detector electrodes are placed {{adjacent to a}} flame fueled by hydrogen / air near the exit of the column, and when carbon containing compounds exit the column they are pyrolyzed by the flame. This detector works only for organic / hydrocarbon containing compounds due {{to the ability of}} the carbons to form cations and electrons upon pyrolysis which generates a current between the electrodes. [...] The increase in current is translated and appears as a peak in a chromatogram. FIDs have low detection limits (a few picograms per second) but they are unable to generate ions from carbonyl containing carbons. FID compatible carrier gasses include helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon.|$|E
50|$|In the helium photoionization mode, the PDD is a universal, non-destructive, high {{sensitivity}} detector. The {{response to}} both inorganic and organic compounds is linear {{over a wide}} range. Response to fixed gases is positive (increase in standing current), with an MDQ in the low ppb range. The PDD in helium photoionization mode is an excellent replacement for <b>flame</b> <b>ionization</b> detectors in petrochemical or refinery environments, where the flame and use of hydrogen can be problematic. In addition, when the helium discharge gas is doped with a suitable noble gas, such as argon, krypton, or xenon (depending on the desired cutoff point), the PDD can function as a specific photoionization detector for selective determination of aliphatics, aromatics, amines, {{as well as other}} species.|$|E
