5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin <b>degradation</b> <b>product,</b> and an {{elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clotâ€”or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E

Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a <b>degradation</b> <b>product</b> of lignin.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In fibrotic {{diseases}} such as pulmonary fibrosis there is evidence suggesting enhanced synthesis and degradation of lung connective tissue components, including collagen. It has therefore been hypothesised that <b>products</b> of collagen <b>degradation</b> may {{have a role in}} the promotion of collagen deposition. In support of this hypothesis, it has recently been shown that intravenous injection of lung collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> in experimental animals stimulated collagen synthesis leading to increased collagen deposition and diffuse interstitial lung disease. METHODS [...] Rabbit and human fibroblast cultures from lung and skin were used as an in vitro model to study the responses of these cells to rabbit collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products.</b> The effects of an acute exposure to collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> on synthesis of collagen and noncollagenous protein have been studied in confluent cultures by [3 H]-proline incorporation. The effects of collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> on fibroblast proliferation and production of genetic types of collagen have also been investigated. RESULTS [...] The acute exposure of rabbit lung fibroblast cultures to collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> significantly increased collagen synthesis without affecting non-collagenous protein synthesis. This effect was dose related, specific for lung fibroblasts, and species specific. Collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> altered the rate of synthesis of genetic types of collagen with a consequent decrease of type III/I+III collagen ratio (0. 26 (0. 04) treated with collagen degradation products; 0. 45 (0. 02) controls). These effects occurred without the intervention of serum factors. In addition, collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> neither affected fibroblast proliferation nor selected specific clones emphasising one type of collagen. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> can influence lung collagen metabolism by stimulating collagen synthesis. The regulation of collagen mass by collagen <b>degradation</b> <b>products</b> may be of importance in lung collagen homeostasis in vivo...|$|R

25|$|Baltic amber {{yields on}} dry {{distillation}} succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest {{in the pale}} opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via IR spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a <b>degradation</b> <b>product</b> of abietic acid.|$|E
