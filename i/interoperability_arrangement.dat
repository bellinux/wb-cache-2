40|$|The {{complexity}} of installations {{in the oceans}} to carry out observations on specific processes and for detecting long-term trends have grown significantly in the past years. This applies also to the type and number of sensors that are in use in observing systems. In these days, sensors shall be compatible to different platforms that are in use like floats, gliders or moorings, and accordingly also different data acquisition systems. Facilitating the integration process in existing or newly established observing systems comes with a real benefit for the operators and {{is important for the}} broader application of different sensors. However, how to achieve the goals is under debate. The most serious obstacle for all initiatives is the willingness of stakeholders to adopt a strategy and, even more so, to adopt a specific architecture to enable interoperability across platforms and observing systems. Therefore, the situation {{at this point in time}} is characterized by the fact that parallel approaches have been developed (IEEE 1451, the OGC set of standards, etc.) that are ready to be evaluated but still lacking the support by the community.

40|$|Drought {{is one of}} {{the major}} weather-related disasters. Persisting over months or years, {{droughts}} can affect large areas and may have serious environmental, social and economic impacts. Over the last decades many European countries have repeatedly been affected by droughts, resulting in considerable ecological and economic damage. Climate change studies further indicate a trend towards increasing climate variability in many parts of the world, most likely resulting in more frequent drought occurrences also in Europe. The need for an adequate monitoring and management is, therefore, evident and has recently triggered action at different political and management levels. An adequate management of droughts requires up-to-date information on the occurrence and severity of drought episodes as well as information on possible impacts and the probability of their duration. JRC, therefore, develops the prototype of a European Drought Observatory (EDO) to monitor, assess and forecast drought events across the entire European continent. As droughts can affect the entire water cycle (e. g., precipitation, soil moisture, stream flow and groundwater) and have direct impacts on the vegetation cover, all these components need careful monitoring. To do so, a suite of indicators is calculated from different data sources in order to capture various aspects of a drought event and to forecast its probable evolution. In order to provide information at different operational scales, close collaboration with national and regional observatories needs to be ensured through adequate <b>interoperability</b> <b>arrangements,</b> thus providing comparable information at different spatial and temporal resolutions. At the core of the European Drought Observatory (EDO) are a web portal and map server presenting up-to-date drought relevant information for entire Europe to the public and to decision makers in policy and water resources management. The current version of the EDO map server publishes continental information based on data processed and analysed at JRC. Available drought products include a monthly updated Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), daily updated modelled soil moisture anomalies, and remote sensing observations on the state of the vegetation cover (i. e. anomaly of the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR), Normalized DifferenceWater Index (NDWI)). A one-week soil moisture anomaly forecast complements the picture. First <b>interoperability</b> <b>arrangements</b> allow accessing more detailed information at national and river basin scale. In addition, time series of drought indices can be retrieved for all administrative regions in Europe, visualizing the temporal evolution over several years. Current research work is focusing on validating the available products, extending the interoperability with national and regional drought information systems and testing medium-range probabilistic drought forecasting products. Probabilistic forecasts are attractive in that they provide an estimate of the range of uncertainty in a particular forecast. Longer-term goals include the development of long-range drought forecasting products, the development of methodologies for monitoring drought impact and the integration of EDO in a global drought monitoring system.

40|$|Presently, {{solutions}} for geo-information sharing are mainly based on Web technologies, implementing service-oriented frameworks, and applying open (international or community) standards and <b>interoperability</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Such frameworks take {{the name of}} Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). The recent evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW), {{with the introduction of}} the Semantic Web and the Web 2. 0 concepts and solutions, made available new applications, architectures, and technologies for sharing and linking resources published on the Web. Such new technologies can be conveniently applied to enhance capabilities of present SDIs—in particular, discovery functionality. Different strategies can be adopted in order to enable new ways of searching geospatial resources, leveraging the Semantic Web and Web 2. 0 technologies. The authors propose a Discovery Augmentation Methodology which is essentially driven by the idea of enriching the searchable information that is associated with geospatial resources. They describe and discuss three different high-level approaches for discovery augmentation: Provider-based, User-based, and Third-party based. From the analysis of these approaches, the authors suggest that, due to their flexibility and extensibility, the user-based and the third-party based approaches result more appropriate for heterogeneous and changing environments such as the SDI one. For the user-based approach, they describe a conceptual architecture and the main components centered on the integration of user-generated content in SDIs. For the third-party approach, the authors describe an architecture enabling semantics-based searches in SDIs. JRC. H. 6 -Digital Earth and Reference Dat...|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how geographic and environmental information created and maintained by different organisations in Europe can be embedded in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) and reused in various applications by different people. The main challenge related to this task is to deal with the heterogeneity of data managed by others. The core concept of SDIs is interoperability, which “means the possibility for spatial data sets to be combined and for services to interact, without repetitive manual intervention, {{in such a way that}} the result is coherent and the added value of the data sets and services is enhanced”. INSPIRE, which is used as the main SDI initiative from which this report draws its examples and best practices, is built on the existing standards, information systems and infrastructures, professional and cultural practices of 27 Member States of the European Union in more than 23 languages. The main part of this report describes the conceptual framework for the development of interoperability specifications that define the targets to which existing data should be transformed. The conceptual framework is composed of two fundamental parts: the Generic Conceptual Model (GCM) and the methodology for data specification development. The GCM defines 26 aspects or elements for achieving data interoperability in an SDI. These include registers and registries, coordinate reference systems, identifier management, metadata, maintenance, to name just a few. The description of the methodology for developing data specifications for interoperability includes a detailed discussion of the relevant actors, steps and the overall workflow – from capturing user requirements to documenting and testing the specifications that emerge from this process. The GCM and the methodology together help to understand the organisational and technical aspects how the data component of an SDI can be established, how <b>interoperability</b> <b>arrangements,</b> data standardisation and harmonisation contribute to this process. Since 2005 INSPIRE has been pioneering the introduction, development, and application of a conceptual framework for establishing the data component in an SDI. This experience shows that the conceptual framework described in this report is robust enough to reinforce interoperability across the 34 data specifications developed for the infrastructure. Moreover, because the framework is platform and theme independent, able to deal with the cultural diversity, and based on best practice examples from Europe and beyond, it may provide solutions for SDI challenges in other environments too.

40|$|The report {{summarizes}} the presentations, discussions, and {{conclusions of the}} Citizen Science and Smart Cities Summit organised by the European Commission Joint Research Centre on 5 - 7 th February 2014. In {{the context of the}} Summit, the label Citizen Science was used to include both citizen science projects, and others that are about user-generated content, not necessarily addressing a scientific process or issues. The evidence presented by 27 different projects shows the vitality and diversity of the field but also a number of critical points: •	Citizen science project are more than collecting data: they are about raising awareness, building capacity, and strengthening communities. •	Likewise, smart cities are not only about ICT, energy and transport infrastructures: Smart cities are about smart citizens, who participate in their city’s daily governance, are concerned about increasing {{the quality of life of}} their fellow-citizens, and about protecting their environment. Technology may facilitate, but is no solution per se. •	Unfortunately to date there seems to be little synergy between citizen science and smart cities initiatives, and there is little interoperability and reusability of the data, apps, and services developed in each project. •	It is difficult to compare the results among citizen science, and smart cities projects or translate from one context to another. •	The ephemeral nature of much of the data, which disappear short after the end of the projects, means lack of reproducibility of results and longitudinal analysis of time series challenging, if not impossible. •	There are also new challenges with respect to the analytical methods needed to integrate quantitative and qualitative data from heterogeneous sources that need further research. •	Building and maintaining trust are key points of any citizen science or smart city project. There is a need to work with the community and not just for, or on, the community. It is critical not just to take (data, information, knowledge) but to give back something that is valued by the community itself. The development of citizen science associations in Europe and the US are important developments that may address some of the points above. There are also actions through which the European Commission Joint Research Centre can make an important contribution: •	Map citizen science and smart cities projects, and generate a semantic network of concepts between the projects to facilitate search of related activities, and community building. •	Provide a repository for citizen science and smart cities data (anonymised and aggregated), software, services, and applications so that they are maintained beyond the life of the projects they originate from, and made shareable and reusable. •	Develop regional test beds for the analysis and integration of social and environmental data from heterogeneous sources, with a focus on quality of life and well-being. •	Undertake comparative studies, and analyse issues related to scaling up to the European dimension. •	Support citizen science and smart cities projects with the JRC knowledge on semantic interoperability, data models, and <b>interoperability</b> <b>arrangements.</b> •	Partner with the European Citizen Science Association, and contribute to its interoperability activities. •	Work towards making the JRC, and the European Commission, a champion of citizen participation in European science.

40|$|The Bushfires Royal Commission Implementation Monitor is {{responsible}} for monitoring and reviewing {{the progress of the}} State in implementing the recommendations of the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission 2 ̆ 7 s Reports. The tabling of the  2014 Annual Report concludes the BRCIM 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities under theBushfires Royal Commission Implementation Monitor Act 2011  (BRCIM Act).  A proposal for monitoring the implementation actions which remain ongoing at 31 July 2014 is provided in the  2014 Annual Report. Executive summary This 2014 Annual Report addresses the implementation actions  that were reported in the 2013 Annual Report as ‘In Progress’  or subject to further monitoring. This report does not address  all of the 305 implementation actions that the State committed  to implement in response to the VBRC’s 67 recommendations.   However, a summary of the status of each of the actions can be  found at Appendix 1. A more detailed account of the response  undertaken by the State to the actions can be found in the  2012 Final Report. The 2013 - 14 fire season was the busiest and most challenging  since 2009. Major bush and grass fires occurred across the  state, including in remote locations in mountainous and Mallee  country, on the urban fringe and in a large open cut coal mine at  Hazelwood. Some of these major fires are the subject of review,  including the independent Hazelwood Mine Fire Inquiry. As a  consequence of post-season reviews of the 2012 - 13 and 2013 - 14 fire seasons, the BRCIM has had an opportunity to consider  the efficacy of the implementation of several actions undertaken  by the State since 2009. Some of these actions, although implemented in previous  years, had not been tested in an operational environment since  first introduced. Of particular interest to the BRCIM was the  exercise of new evacuation policy and procedures that occurred  {{on a number of occasions}} during the 2013 - 14 fire season.   The successful evacuation of Halls Gap during the Grampians  fire in particular has provided valuable learnings which  have already been captured and shared with emergency  management practitioners across the state. Further, the BRCIM was able to examine evidence of joint  agency operations on a greater scale than in previous years.   For example, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) was tasked  to support the Country Fire Authority (CFA) and the Department  of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) at fires in Wallan,  the Grampians and the Hazelwood Mine and spent extended  periods working under new <b>interoperability</b> <b>arrangements.</b> During the 2013 - 14 fire season it was clear to the BRCIM that  many of the measures addressed since 2009 had delivered  positive outcomes. For example, the pre-determined dispatch  of aircraft greatly enhanced air response capability. The BRCIM  is pleased to note the State ’s commitment to pre-determined  dispatch as the standard aircraft dispatch procedure during  all future fire seasons. There was clear evidence of improved  command and control arrangements at the State Control Centre  (SCC) and at regional level. The governance arrangements for emergency management  in Victoria have been significantly improved since the  establishment in 2013 of the State Crisis and Resilience Council  (SCRC). The BRCIM has attended the meetings of the SCRC  and has observed that this council functions effectively as the  peak body for emergency management in Victoria. The introduction of Emergency Management Victoria  (EMV) and the Emergency Management Commissioner  (EMC) on 1 July 2014 should provide greater impetus for  effective emergency management under the all hazards,  all agencies philosophy. The introduction on the same  date of the office of the Inspector-General for Emergency  Management (IGEM) should for the first time provide Victoria  with a robust, audit and review assurance capacity.   The BRCIM is able to report that there has been significant  progress during the past year in the implementation of several  actions. Of particular note are > the successful implementation of Emergency Alert (EA)   Phase 2   > the successful completion of the Community Fire Refuges  Pilot Program (CFRPP) and the construction and opening  of three community fire refuges (CFRs) > the positive progress of the powerline reform program under  the direction of the Powerline Bushfire Safety Oversight  Committee (PBSOC) > the progress made in developing a risk based approach  to planned burning. While a small number of actions are progressing more slowly  than was initially forecast, the BRCIM is satisfied that there is  evidence of adequate progress. However, one matter remains  problematic; implementation action 49 (i) – develop guidelines  for retrofitting class 9 buildings. This is well overdue and the  BRCIM has received no evidence of progress of this action  during 2013 - 14. Given the heavy workload on the fire agencies this past fire  season, it is noteworthy that this has not detracted from the  Fire Services Commissioner (FSC) and the fire agencies’  commitment to deliver on the VBRC recommendations. Despite the significant number of Victorians directly threatened  by bushfire during 2013 - 14, only one death occurred at Rose’s  Gap. This is important as it indicates that finally we may be  witnessing some evidence that our community is beginning  to respond to the enhanced level of warnings and advice  communicated to them by the fire authorities. Nevertheless,  the BRCIM remains very concerned about the level of  community complacency regarding the risk of fire that has  been highlighted in previous reports. The BRCIM urges the  State to retain an ongoing focus on community education  and participation in mitigating the risk of fire. A great deal of work has been done by the State to address  the many shortcomings identified by the VBRC and much of  this remains ongoing. This work should now become part of  the daily business activities of the agencies that, under the  new emergency management arrangements, must adopt a  more cooperative, coordinated and proactive approach to  risk management. As discussed elsewhere in this report, it is  important to understand that all 67 VBRC recommendations  are inextricably interdependent. No single recommendation  is effective in its own right. Fully implementing all of the  recommendations will only reduce the overall risk of bushfire.   The risk can never be eliminated and bushfire safety in Victoria  remains the ongoing shared responsibility of us all. As this report concludes a five year undertaking to report  on the progress and efficacy of the implementation of  the recommendations of the VBRC, the BRCIM records  appreciation for the high level of support and cooperation from  all departments and agencies involved in delivering  these outcomes...|$|R
