40|$|The use of {{traditional}} eye medicines {{as a form}} of eye care in Africa is very common.   However, there is concern about the harmful effects of some traditional medicines on the eyes. This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted in Benin-City, Edo state, Nigeria. Sixty-eight traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs) who treated eye conditions participated in this study.   Most (87 %) were males and 13 % were females. Their age ranged between 25 to 65 years {{with a mean age of}} 42. 25 ± 2. 14 years.   Information was obtained through one-on-one oral interviews and a structured questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions. The most common method of training (46 %) was by father-to-son tutelage. Conjunctivitis, itching and poor vision were the most common conditions treated by all practitioners. The majority of the TMPs (62 %), practiced full time while 38 % practiced part time. Forty six percent considered patients’ case histories as more important than physical examination of the eye while 54 % felt both history and examination were equally important. Thirty-six percent of practitioners reported inverting the upper eyelids as part of their <b>examination.</b> <b>Couching</b> of cataracts was done by 38 %. While 49 % had referred ‘difficult’ or ‘stubborn’ cases to orthodox hospitals, 51 % had never referred a case.   Traditional healers are well accepted in their communities and will continue to be consulted by the people.   Health education programs with emphasis on safe eye care practices need to be established for traditional healers. Working with healers and training them to recognize cases needing urgent referral and encouraging the use of non-harmful practices may provide a more sustainable health care structure in the community. Cooperation between these two aspects of medicine is extremely important for the provision of primary eye care services in rural Africa. (S Afr Optom 2013 72 (4) 167 - 172)    </p...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} (3 D) {{models of}} deceased and injured people {{in combination with}} 3 D scans of injury causing objects can assist forensic investigations in reconstructing event scenes. Medical imaging techniques, such as post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) and post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (PMMR), have been successfully applied to forensic investigations and can add beneficial value to standard autopsy examinations. These imaging modalities can be helpful for 3 D reconstructions, especially when internal findings, such as bone fractures, organ damage and internal bleeding, are relevant for the investigation. However, none of these techniques can adequately visualize pattern injuries, such as boot prints and bite marks, or any type of blunt force trauma that forms distinct discolorations on the body’s surface. This is why 3 D surface imaging techniques have been introduced to the forensic community. Unfortunately, many commercially available optical scanning systems are cost intensive, time consuming and can only be applied before or after a CT scan has been performed. In this article, we present a mobile, multi-camera rig based on close-range photogrammetry that is inexpensive, fast in acquisition time and can be combined with automated CT scanning protocols. The multi-camera setup comprises seven digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras that are mounted on a mobile frame. Each camera {{is equipped with a}} remote control that can trigger the shutter release of all cameras simultaneously. In combination with a medical CT scanner, image acquisition of the multi camera setup can be included into an automated CT scanning procedure. In our preliminary study, textured 3 D models of one side of the body were created in less than 15 minutes. The photo acquisition time combined with the modified CT scanning protocols lasted 3 : 34 minutes whereas the subsequent computation of a textured 3 D model based on a low resolution mesh lasted 10 : 55 minutes. The mobile, multi-camera setup can also be used manually in combination with <b>examination</b> <b>couches,</b> lifting carts and autopsy tables. Finally, the system is not limited to post-mortem investigations but can also be applied to living people and may be used in clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of biaxiality of the loading on the crystallographic orientation dependence of crystal stress distributions is examined for polycrystalline solids deformed {{well into the}} elastoplastic regime. The <b>examination</b> is <b>couched</b> in terms of two decompositions of the stress. The first is a split of the tensor into its hydrostatic and deviatoric components; the second is a spectral decomposition of the deviatoric stress from which we express the relative values of the principal components {{as a function of}} the biaxiality of the stress. Using the framework provided by these decompositions, we investigate trends observed in the lattice strains in polycrystals subjected to biaxial loadings, comparing strains measured by neutron diffraction with finite element simulations. We conclude by showing how the orientation dependence of the stress distributions is influenced by the load biaxiality and by connecting features of the distributions to the elastic and plastic properties of the crystals. Implications of the results are discussed relative to the modeling of strain hardening and defect initiation. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5000|$|... "As a {{physician}} {{committed to a}} full-time career in fertility control I am often asked the question: When did you first become interested in family planning. I can quote the year, the month, the day."I was visiting an aid post in a rural, remote jungle area of New Guinea. Towards {{the end of a}} long day, a woman of about 30, in a grass skirt, shyly laid a small crying baby on the crude bamboo table which served as an <b>examination</b> <b>couch.</b> The baby, a three-month-old boy with a distended abdomen, had a small hernia. He was dehydrated and like many babies in that region, underfed, for mothers are often unable to obtain the adequate protein diet so necessary for a good flow of breast milk. Besides, she was still suckling another child of about two-and-a-half years."I reduced the size of the hernia, but it was obvious that if it was not operated on it would recur and evenutally strangulate. In that case, unless the mother was able to walk the 10 miles or so to the river and then bring the baby by canoe to the hospital, or unless a doctor or nurse was traveling in the area, the baby would die."As I handed back the baby and the little bundle of rags which passed for nappies, I gently explained to the mother the need to perform a small operation at our little district hospital; otherwise the swelling would return and the child might die. in Pidgin English, lingua franca of New Guinea, the phrase for death has a brutal finality about it: 'Pininin belon' you'e die pinish' - die finish."Without emotion the mother began to tell me of her troubles. She had four young children and her husband had recently died. She was unable to spend enough time finishing or preparing sago - the staple diet of the area - and the sale of copra from her few coconut trees did not raise enough cash to meet the meagre needs of her family. She ended her sad monologue of tragedies by saying that she could not leave the family to take this baby to a distant hospital."I pleaded, cajoled, even threatened; but she was adamant. She would not leave her other children, nor would she let me take the baby down the river with me to the hospital. Eventually we compromised. I would perform the operation right there in the crude village dispensary."The operation went well despite my inexperience in this field and the primitive conditions. We anaesthetised the infant with ether and gauze. The wound was neat, bleeding had not been a problem, and we finished before the evening swarm of mosquitoes had become unbearable."I was deeply satisfied and success had released the tension of the operation. Proudly I carried the limp and still sedated baby out to the mother, who was squatting in the shade of a tree with her children. As I handed her the baby and she saw he was still alive her face fell in obvious disappointment."My shock was absolute. My immediate reaction was one of utter indignation. The gulf separating my life experience and that of this pitifully poor native woman was complete. She had wanted the baby to die - not live - during the operation."I suddenly realised that I had presented her not only her baby, but with another mouth to feed - another dependent human being to whom she could offer nothing: no father, no education, no future - merely the cruel ritual of her bare survival."It was at that moment that I began to realise that preventing a birth could be as important as saving a life" ...|$|E

40|$|A medical <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> is {{a primary}} piece of {{equipment}} {{in the health care}} delivery system. Unfortunately, the current design of examination couches used by Australian general and nursing practitioners is inadequate. Incompatibility of the couches with physical (anthropometric) dimensions and a majority of medical procedures contribute to risks of Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs) or musculoskeletal problems among practitioner-users. The inappropriate height, width and gynaecological attachments of the existing couches also cause patient discomfort. This research aimed to develop a new <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> design in order to improve practitioners' effectiveness, efficiency, health and safety while enhancing patient comfort. Ergonomics and user inclusivity were implemented in the vital stages of the couch development process. Practitioner and patient surveys, reviews of patient positions, medical procedures and equipment, Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) and an ergonomic analysis of couches in the Australian market were conducted to develop design criteria. The design criteria development demonstrated that adjustable height, head, body and foot sections were the major features, and adjustable gynaecological footpads and instrument placement (drawers) were the most important attachments. A wide variety of anthropometric data was applied to the development of design specifications and adjustments. To produce a prototype for a new <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> design developed from the ergonomic research and initial user surveys, the researcher collaborated with a medical couch manufacturer, Metron Medical Australia Pty Ltd. Through this collaboration, the developed criteria and specifications were applied to actual production processes. User trials (a focus group, practitioner and patient surveys and personal communication) were conducted to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of the couch prototype in a real clinical environment. From the trials, modifications to particular couch features were identified if they were considered difficult to operate, unnecessary or uncomfortable for patients. For example, the mechanism of the gynaecological footpads, which comprised three different adjustment controls, had to be simplified in order to avoid confusion and time consumption. The footpads had also to be equipped with straps or half a shoe to increase patient comfort and security. The collaborating manufacturer will need to adapt the design modifications from the user trials and conduct more extensive engineering research and value analysis for a final production couch model. Nevertheless, this research succesfully demonstrated the significance of ergonomics and user-centred design in developing design criteria more effectively, detecting usability problems before the couch is brought to the market, and in saving the manufacturer's overall product development costs...|$|E

5000|$|The University College Hospital, (UCH) Ibadan was {{established}} {{by an act of}} parliament in November 1952 in response to the need for the training of medical personnel and other healthcare professionals for the country and the West African Sub-Region. The establishment of the Hospital followed a Visitation Panel in 1951 to assess the clinical facilities for the clinical postings of medical students registered for M.B.B.S. degree of the University of London. The visitation panel, led by Dr. T.F. Hunt of the University of London rejected the enhanced facilities provided by the Government/Native Authority Hospital at Adeoyo, Ibadan following the establishment of a Faculty of Medicine in the University College, Ibadan (now University of Ibadan) in 1948. The University College hospital (UCH) was strategically located in Ibadan, then the largest city in West Africa which is also the seat of the first University in Nigeria. The physical development of the Hospital commenced in 1953 in its present site and was formally commissioned after completion on 20 November 1957. The University College Hospital, Ibadan was initially commissioned with 500-bed spaces. Currently, the hospital has 850 bed spaces and 163 <b>examination</b> <b>couches</b> with occupancy rates ranging from 55-60%. The Hospital, at inception in 1948, prior to the Act of parliament, had two clinical Departments (Medicine and Surgery). However, the Hospital has evolved to accommodate about 60 Departments among which is the first Department of Nuclear Medicine in Nigeria commissioned by the Honourable Minister of health, Professor Eyitayo Lambo on 27 April 2006. The Hospital and the University of Ibadan, function in excellent symbiosis and it is impossible to think of one without the other, in the areas of health manpower training, research and clinical service. This functional interdependence was emphasized from inception through the appointment of the Chairman of the Provisional Council of the University College, (now University of Ibadan as the first Chairman of the Board of Management of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. In addition to undergraduate medical programme (Based in the College of Medicine of the University of Ibadan), the UCH also provides for: Postgraduate Residency Training Programmes in all specialties of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Pediatrics, Otorhinolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Anesthesia, Laboratory Medicine, Psychiatry, Community Medicine, General Medical Practice, Radiology, Radiotherapy and Dentistry. The University College Hospital also provides diploma /professional programmes in the School of Health Records & Statistics, Environmental Health Officers Tutors Course; Primary Health tutors Course, Nurse/Midwife/Public Health Nurse, Nurse Tutors Course, Post registration Courses in nursing e.g. Peri Operative nursing and Occupational Health Nursing. [...] The hospital is primarily a tertiary institution with appendages of community-based outreach activities at Igbo Ora, Abedo, Okuku, Sepeteri, Elesu, and Jago where it offers primary and secondary health care services. The Hospital has 56 service and clinical departments and runs 96 consultative out-patient clinics a week in 50 specialty and sub-specialty disciplines. In addition to the College of Medicine, the Hospital [...] "houses" [...] a Virology Research laboratory, a W.H.O Collaborating Centre in Immunology and an Institute of Advanced Medical Research and Training.(IAMRAT). The Hospital also houses the Special Treatment Clinic (STC), a state-of-the-art clinic for research, training, and treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and runs clinics for people living with HIV/AIDS. Accreditation has been given for the setting up of a department of nuclear medicine whilst approval has also been given by the federal Ministry of Health for the establishment of an institute of Neurosciences. Satellite Pharmacies are provided on each specialty floor for easy access for the procurement of drugs for patients on admission. A pain clinic and a Hospice service are also on site for the care of terminally ill patients.|$|R

40|$|Background: Injuries to the posterolateral {{corner of}} the knee (PLC) can be {{difficult}} to diagnose and are often missed. The prone dial test {{can be difficult to}} perform in the acute setting and the supine dial test requires an assistant. Purpose: We present a simple single person seated dial test that can easily be performed in all patients with a suspected diagnosis of PLC injury. Study Design: Case Series. Method: The patient is seated {{on the edge of the}} <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> with their knees flexed over the side and their calves pressed against the couch to reduce any posterior tibial sub-luxation. The patients ’ knees are placed together ensuring the pelvis is square; the knees are at the same level, and the patellae are facing anteriorly. The patients place their hands against the side of their knees and hold their knees together in this position. The examiner then grasps the patient’s feet, approximates the medial malleoli and exerts a lateral rotational force at 30 and 90 degrees of knee flexion. Results: This test has 100 % accuracy for diagnosing PLC injury in our in-stitution. Conclusion: We present a sample to use alternative to traditional dial testing that does not require an assistant and also does not require the patient to be prone, thus limiting discomfort in the acute setting...|$|E

Although various systems for 3 D surface imaging have been introduced in the forensic field, most techniques are both cost-intensive and time-consuming. In this article, we present the VirtoScan, a mobile, multi-camera rig based on close-range photogrammetry. The system can be integrated into automated PMCT scanning procedures or used manually together with lifting carts, autopsy tables and <b>examination</b> <b>couch.</b> The VirtoScan is based on a moveable frame that carries 7 digital single-lens reflex cameras.

The selection of this venue was a key decision in the curatorial approach, setting outputs from the DOME project alongside historic artefacts in the permanent collection that addressed similar issues of patient safety. For example, the CareCentre (West REF Output 2) was {{in close proximity to}} the leather <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> used by Joseph Lister (1827 - 1912), a pioneer of safer and cleaner hospitals. ‘Make It Better’ took place in the centenary year of Lister's death. DOME involved a multidisciplinary collaboration between designers, clinicians, psychologists, ergonomists, business academics and patient safety experts. The exhibition sought to demonstrate how evidence-based, collaborative processes could generate new designs to improve patient safety. Concepts on show included a communication campaign to promote hand hygiene, a redesign of the staff handover room and a new approach drug packaging to improve patient compliance. The exhibition was formally opened by President of the Royal College of Surgeons, Norman Baker, and resulted in media coverage on BBC News (www. bbc. co. uk/news/health- 16812137), New Scientist and The Lancet, whose reviewer commented: ‘The DOME project suggests a pragmatic approach to care that is efficient, patient-centred, safe, and—in its own way—beautiful. ’ The exhibition subsequently travelled to North Wales in March 2012 to be shown at the Management Centre, University of Bangor, for one week as part of the Bangor Science Festival 2012.

30|$|Mdm of the rectus femoris, {{vastus intermedius}} and vastus lateralis muscle {{of the right}} and left leg was {{measured}} by real-time ultrasound imaging prior to and after training on day 25 in LP of the second control cycle and the third training cycle, analysing the distances between the outer and inner muscle fasciae using a Vivid I CE 0344 ultrasound device (GE Medical System, Solingen, Germany) with a parallel scanner (8  L-RS, 4.0 – 13.3  MHz) which provides 10  cm penetration depth of the sound wave and enables diagrams of deep lying muscles. The linear measurement of the shortest distance of the muscle depth was used. Previous studies showed that muscle cross-sectional area might reliably be measured using real-time ultrasound imaging (Martinson and Stokes 1991). Subjects prevented long-lasting static muscular tension for at least 30  minutes prior to the measurement in order to avoid alterations in Mdm (Reimer et al. 2004). All subjects lay supine with stretched legs on an <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> without any pad, cushion or pillow underneath. Ultrasound images were obtained half-way between hip bone and knee cap and the transducer was placed gently on thighs to avoid compression and distortion of the underlying tissue. The transducer was held at an angle of 90 ° to the muscle borders to ensure a clear image. The images were displayed and frozen on the screen and they were photographed to measure the muscle diameter. The positions of transducer were recorded for each muscle to reproduce the exact position after training intervention. The means of three measurements of M. vastus medialis, M.vastus intermedius and M. vastus lateralis were taken at the same site for all subjects and the sum of three muscles diameters was calculated and used for data analysis (Mdm). Reliability analysis was performed for Mdm determination. The obtained ICC was 0.997, indicating a high reliability of the ultrasound imaging of Mdm used in this study.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: To {{decrease}} waiting times within {{accident and}} emergency (A&E) departments, various initiatives {{have been suggested}} {{including the use of}} a separate stream of care for minor injuries ("fast track"). This study aimed to assess whether a separate stream of minor injuries care in a UK A&E department decreases the waiting time, without delaying the care of those with more serious injury. Intervention: A doctor saw any ambulant patients with injuries not requiring an <b>examination</b> <b>couch</b> or an urgent intervention. Any patients requiring further treatment were returned to the sub-wait area until a nurse could see them in another cubicle. Method: Data were retrospectively extracted from the routine hospital information systems for all patients attending the A&E department for five weeks before the institution of the separate stream system and for five weeks after. Results: 13 918 new patients were seen during the 10 week study period; 7117 (51. 1 %) in the first five week period and 6801 (49. 9 %) in the second five week period when a separate stream was operational. Recorded time to see a doctor ranged from 0 - 850 minutes. Comparison of the two five week periods demonstrated that the proportion of patients waiting less than 30 and less than 60 minutes both improved (p< 0. 0001). The relative risk of waiting more than one hour decreased by 32 %. The improvements in waiting times were not at the expense of patients with more urgent needs. Conclusions: The introduction of a separate stream for minor injuries can produce an improvement in the number of trauma patients waiting over an hour of about 30 %. If this is associated with an increase in consultant presence on the shop floor {{it may be possible to}} achieve a 50 % improvement. It is recommended that departments use a separate stream for minor injuries to decrease the number of patients enduring long waits in AE departments...|$|E
