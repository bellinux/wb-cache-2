5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend {{was caused by}} a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> repertoire.|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either {{canister}} shot from the British artillery or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He {{was able to make}} <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed or injured, while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost {{sight of the fact that}} the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon in the first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E

5|$|Many {{amphibians}} {{catch their}} prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth before seizing the item with their jaws. Some use inertial feeding {{to help them}} swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E
5|$|After an {{extended}} period with no activity {{across much of the}} Indian Ocean, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) rebuilt toward the end of February, and spawned an area of convection on March1 in the extreme eastern portion of the basin. The next day, a circulation was noted on satellite imagery to the northeast of the convection, which indicated that a tropical disturbance had developed. The influence of the monsoon trough steered the disturbance to the southeast into the Australian basin, where moderate wind shear prevented quick development. A building ridge to the south turned the system to the southwest, bringing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> south-west Indian on March3 as a tropical depression. With decreasing wind shear, the depression slowly intensified as convection increased, becoming Tropical Storm Davina on March4. An eye developed the next day, signaling Davina had intensified into a tropical cyclone, or reaching 10-minute winds of at least 120km/h (75mph). On March7, Davina became an intense tropical cyclone, with sustained 10-minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). At around the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 205km/h (125mph).|$|E

25|$|From the 1960s onwards, {{significant}} suburban {{development and}} growth {{took place in}} the area and the Council was providing new facilities and infrastructure.

25|$|This {{accumulation}} of ice {{had no effect}} on the flight until the final stages of the approach into Heathrow, when increased fuel flow and higher temperatures suddenly released <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fuel. This formed a slush of soft ice which flowed forward until it reached the Fuel-Oil Heat Exchangers (FOHEs) where it froze once again, causing a restriction in the flow of fuel to the engines.|$|E
25|$|A waste exchange, or virtual exchange, {{facilitates}} {{the use of}} a waste product from one process as a raw material for another. As with new life reuse of finished items, this avoids the environmental costs of disposing of the waste and obtaining new raw material, and may still be possible if the nature of the process makes avoiding production of the waste or recycling <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> original process impossible.|$|E

25|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{may also}} be used to increase fuel efficiency without increasing power. This is achieved by recovering waste energy in the exhaust and feeding <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> engine intake. By using this otherwise wasted energy to increase the mass of air, it becomes easier to ensure that all fuel is burned before being vented {{at the start of the}} exhaust stage. The increased temperature from the higher pressure gives a higher Carnot efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The venue {{was damaged}} by a {{thunderstorm}} {{on the afternoon}} of 6 March 2010 during the 2010 Victorian storms. The external roof (not the main retractable roof) caved in, causing damage and flooding in one of the stadium's entertainment precincts. Because of the damage the St Kilda v Fremantle NAB Cup semi-final was delayed due to WorkSafe inspections. Only around 5000 people made <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arena when it was safe to return.|$|E
25|$|Motion picture {{evidence}} from Lae suggests that an antenna mounted underneath the fuselage {{may have been}} torn off from the fuel-heavy Electra during taxi or takeoff from Lae's turf runway, though no antenna was reported found at Lae. Don Dwiggins, in his biography of Paul Mantz (who assisted Earhart and Noonan in their flight planning), noted that the aviators had cut off their long-wire antenna, due to the annoyance of having to crank <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> aircraft after each use.|$|E

25|$|At {{least two}} Egyptian newspapers, Al Gomhuria and Al-Musawar, offered {{theories}} that the aircraft was accidentally {{shot down by}} the US. Other theories were advanced by the Egyptian press as well, including the Islamist Al Shaab, which speculated that a Mossad/CIA conspiracy was to blame (since, supposedly, EgyptAir and El Al crews stayed at the same hotel in New York). Al Shaab also accused US officials of secretly recovering the FDR, reprogramming it, and throwing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water to be publicly recovered.|$|E
25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi NPS {{has several}} {{seawater}} piping trenches which were {{originally designed to}} house pipes and cables running from the Unit 24 turbine buildings to their seaside, which doesn't directly connect to the sea. Inside the trench, radioactive contaminated water has been accumulating since the accident. Due {{to the risk of}} soil or ocean contamination from these trenches, TEPCO has been trying to remove the accumulated water in the trenches by pumping <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turbine buildings, as well as backfilling the trenches to reduce or prevent further incursion of contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|The mandibular stylet tips {{have small}} teeth, and through {{alternately}} moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts {{a path through}} tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel. Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood in three to five minutes. The bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place. It takes between five and ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged with blood. In all, the insect may spend less than 20 minutes in physical contact with its host, and does not try to feed again until it has either completed a moult or, if an adult, has thoroughly digested the meal.|$|E

25|$|A new rite for Thanksgiving after Adoption {{preceded the}} {{revision}} of the Old 'Churching of Women' service. Baptism could now {{be incorporated into the}} main Sunday service, the result of other influences intended to bring <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mainstream of worship. The Baptism of those able to answer for themselves was much more prominent, a result of the influence of those who questioned infant baptism in a post-Christian society. The questions, however, now addressed to the godparents or the person baptised directly, no longer required the renunciation of the devil or 'the vain pomp and glory of the world' or 'the carnal desires of the flesh' but instead a turning to Christ, a repentance from sin and a renunciation of evil. Likewise the ancient Apostles Creed was replaced by three tritheistic questions, which were criticised (by, among others, John Habgood, sometime Archbishop of York) as being unknown to the credal discussions of the Church, Eastern or Western, modern or ancient.|$|E
500|$|Featuring tracks such as [...] "Too Much Love Will Kill You" [...] and [...] "Heaven for Everyone", {{the album}} also {{contains}} the song [...] "Mother Love", the last vocal recording Mercury made {{prior to his}} death, which he completed using a drum machine, over which May, Taylor and Deacon later added the instrumental track. After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he [...] "wasn't feeling that great" [...] and stated, [...] "I will finish it when I come back, next time." [...] However, he never made <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.|$|E
500|$|In {{a system}} that {{consists}} of multiple energy domains, transfer matrices are required that can handle components with ports in different domains. [...] In robotics and mechatronics, actuators are required. [...] These usually consist of a transducer converting, for instance, signals from the control system in the electrical domain into motion in the mechanical domain. [...] The control system also requires sensors that detect the motion and convert <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> electrical domain through another transducer so that the motion can be properly controlled through a feedback loop. Other sensors in the system may be transducers converting yet other energy domains into electrical signals, such as optical, audio, thermal, fluid flow and chemical. [...] Another application is the field of mechanical filters which require transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains in both directions.|$|E
