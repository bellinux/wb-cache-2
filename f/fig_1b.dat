Spike trains were then constructed at 1 kHz with unit impulses at each spike time (Fig. 1 B) and zeros elsewhere.

50|$|In 2011 Roman Zubarev {{formulated}} the isotope resonance hypothesis. It {{originated in}} the following, unexpected observation.

ΔMm is a constant in the whole Universe. Define ΔMis = Mav - Mmono, where Mav is the average isotopic mass (e.g. O = 15.999 Da on Earth). Obviously ΔMis depends on the precise isotopic composition for a given molecule. Finally define NMD = 1000ΔMm/Mnom and NIS = 1000ΔMis/Mnom, where NMD units of ‰ and NIS units of ‰ are the normalized isotopic defect and shift, respectively. If NIS is plotted {{as a function of}} NMD for a large number of terrestrial peptides, one would anticipate a homogenous distribution of data points (as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1B).</b> This is not what was found by Zubarev’s team, instead they found band gap in the distribution with a narrow line in the middle (Fig. 1A).|$|E
50|$|Studies {{conclude}} that HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) increase histone acetylation and improve synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (Fig 1A). CREB, a cAMP response element-binding protein and transcriptional activator, binds CBP forming the CREB: CBP complex. This complex activates genes involved in synaptic formation and long-term memory.(Fig 1B) TSA treatments in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice increased acetylation levels and enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism involved in learning and memory (<b>Fig</b> <b>1B).</b> However, TSA treatments in CBP mutants lacking KIX domains did not effect LTP in mice (Fig 1D). The KIX domain allows for interaction between CREB and CBP, so knocking out this region disrupts {{formation of the}} CREB: CBP complex. Knock outs of CREB produced similar results to those of mutant CBP mice (Fig 1C). Therefore, HDAC inhibition and CREB: CBP association are both necessary for memory development. TSA treatments showed increased expression levels of Nr4a1 and Nra2 genes while other CREB regulated genes were unaffected. HDAC inhibitors improve memory through activation of specific genes regulated by CREB: CBP complex.|$|E
50|$|The {{structural}} part is a naturally occurring gene, {{which is used}} as a skeleton to encode the input and the transitions of the automaton (Fig. 1A). The conserved features of a structural gene (e.g., DNA polymerase binding site, start and stop codons, and splicing sites) serve as constants of the computational gene, while the coding regions, the number of exons and introns, the position of start and stop codon, and the automata theoretical variables (symbols, states, and transitions) are the design parameters of the computational gene. The constants and the design parameters are linked by several logical and biochemical constraints (e.g., encoded automata theoretic variables must not be recognized as splicing junctions). The input of the automaton are molecular markers given by single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. These markers are signalling aberrant (e.g., carcinogenic) molecular phenotype and turn on the self-assembly of the functional gene. If the input is accepted, the output encodes a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule, a functional gene which should be successfully integrated into the cellular transcription and translation machinery producing a wild type protein or an anti-drug (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1B).</b> Otherwise, a rejected input will assemble into a partially dsDNA molecule which cannot be translated.|$|E
5000|$|A {{positron}} annihilating with {{an electron}} yields {{two or three}} photons. The positron detector, comprising 16 rows each containing 12 scintillating, pure CsI crystals, is designed to detect the two-photon events, consisting of two 511 keV photons which are always emitted back-to-back. The energy resolution of the detector is 18% FWHM at 511 keV, and the photo-peak detection efficiency for single photons is about 20%. The maximum readout rate of the whole detector is about 40 Hz. Ancillary detectors include large scintillator paddles external to the magnet, and a thin, position sensitive, silicon diode through which the incident antiproton beam passes before entering the catching trap. To produce antihydrogen atoms, a positron well in the mixing region is filled with about [...] positrons and allowed to cool to the ambient temperature (15 K). The nested trap is then formed around the positron well. Next, approximately 104 antiprotons are launched into the mixing region by pulsing the trap from one potential configuration (dashed line, <b>Fig.</b> <b>1b)</b> to another (solid line). The mixing time is 190 s, after which all particles are dumped and the process repeated. Events triggering the imaging silicon detector (three sides hit in the outer layer) initiate readout of both the silicon and the CsI modules.|$|E
5000|$|The mixing trap has the axial {{potential}} {{configuration of}} a nested Penning trap (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1b),</b> which permits two plasmas of opposite charge {{to come into}} contact.

Typical conditions are: [...] stored positrons, a radius of 2 - 2.5 mm, a length of 32 mm, and a maximum density of 2.. Key to the observations reported here is the antihydrogen annihilation detector (Fig. 1a), situated coaxially with the mixing region, between the trap outer radius and the magnet bore. The detector {{is designed to provide}} unambiguous evidence for antihydrogen production by detecting the temporally and spatially coincident annihilations of the antiproton and positron when a neutral antihydrogen atom escapes the electromagnetic trap and strikes the trap electrodes. An antiproton typically annihilates into a few charged or neutral pions. The charged pions are detected by two layers of double-sided, position sensitive, silicon microstrips. The path of a charged particle passing through both layers can be reconstructed, and two or more intersecting tracks allow determination of the position, or vertex, of the antiproton annihilation. The uncertainty in vertex determination is approximately 4 mm and is dominated by the unmeasured curvature of the charged pions’ trajectories in the magnetic field. The temporal coincidence window is approximately 5 microseconds. The solid angle coverage of the interaction region is about 80% of 4π.|$|E
50|$|Under natural {{conditions}} {{a prerequisite for}} an optimal tissue development is a cell-specific interaction with the extracellular matrix, while under in vitro conditions {{a substitute for the}} extracellular matrix has to be selected. However, the crucial problem is that a biomaterial can influence the development of functional features within a maturing tissue in a good and in a bad sense. In consequence, the suitability of a decellularized extracellular matrix, newly developed synthetic polymers, biodegradable scaffolds, ceramics or metal alloys cannot be predicted but must be tested. To meet parameters positively influencing cell adhesion and communication, the technical concept is based on a Minusheet tissue carrier (Fig. 1). By the help of this tool cell adhesion and development of tissue can be tested with individually selected biomaterials. These experiments can be performed first under static (Fig. 2) and then under dynamic (Fig. 3) culture conditions 6. In both cases a Minusheet tissue carrier prevents damage but supports development of contained cells or tissues during experimentation. To stay compatible with a conventional 24 well culture plate a selected biomaterial must be punched in a diameter of 13 mm. In this format many materials are also commercially available. Further materials can be applied in form of filters, foils, nets, fleeces and scaffolds (Fig. 1a). For an easy handling and to prevent damage during development the selected specimens are placed in the base part of a Minusheet tissue carrier (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1b).</b> Pressing down a tension ring the biomaterial is held in position (Fig. 1c).

5000|$|Klf4 (Fig. 2A), known also as gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF) {{acts as a}} {{transcriptional}} activator or repressor {{depending on}} the promoter context and/or cooperation with other transcription factors. For example, Klf4 transactivates the iNOS promoter in cooperation with p65 (RelA), and the p21Cip1/Waf1 promoter in cooperation with p53, but it directly suppresses the p53 promoter and inhibits ornithine decarboxylase promoter activity by competing with specificity protein-1 (Sp-1). Klf4 also interacts with the p300/CBP transcription co-activators. Klf5, also known as intestinal enriched Krüppel-like factor (IKLF) or basic transcription element binding protein 2 (Bteb2) has been assigned purely transcriptional activation activity (Fig. 1A) but, similar to Klf4, binds p300 which acetylates the first zinc finger conferring a trans-activating function. Importantly for Klf4 & Klf5, the amino acids that are predicted by the Klevit model to interact with DNA are identical (<b>Fig.</b> <b>1B</b> and Fig. 2) and the two compete for the same CACCC element found {{in a wide variety}} of promoters. Klf4 & Klf5 can act antagonistically during cellular proliferation, differentiation, and promoter activation, either via direct competition or via alterations in their own gene expression. The expression of Klf4 in terminally differentiated, post-mitotic intestinal epithelial cells as opposed to proliferating crypt cells which contain high levels of Klf5 is one example of such opposing effects [...] Klf4 inhibits proliferation through activation of p21Cip1/Waf1, and direct suppression of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1 gene expression. Both Klf4 & Klf5 proteins act on the Klf4 promoter where Klf4 increases expression and Klf5 decreases expression of Klf4 mRNA.|$|E
5000|$|The I-V curve {{shown in}} <b>Fig.</b> <b>1b</b> shows steps {{covering}} the {{range from about}} -1 mV to +1 mV and is for a junction driven by a nearly optimum level of microwave current. At lower microwave current the steps cover a smaller range of voltage and at higher microwave current the steps become smaller and begin to move off the zero current axis. In a large array, every junction must generate a large zero crossing step and thus the microwave power must be adjusted to a value low enough to accommodate the one junction receiving the largest microwave drive. Thus, {{in order to obtain}} the largest voltage from the smallest number of junctions, an array standard requires a circuit design that can deliver nearly uniform microwave power to many thousands of junctions, all of which are connected in series. The solution to this problem is a simple extension of Fig. 3 to a series of junctions in a line over a ground plane as shown in Fig. 5a. This results in a microwave stripline that can propagate microwave power with relatively low loss.The capacitive impedance of the junctions is so small (approximately 1 m Ω [...] ) relative to the strip line impedance (approx. 3 Ω) that each junction has a very minor effect on the propagation of microwave power in the strip line. Typically, each junction will absorb about 0.02% to 0.04% of the power propagating through it. It is thus possible to connect several thousand junctions in series and still achieve a power uniformity of about ±1.5 dB. With careful design, striplines with as many as 4800 junctions have been used.|$|E
50|$|The two {{branches}} of the APES for the case of strong PJTE resulting in the instability of the ground state (when the condition of instability (11) holds) are illustrated in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1b</b> {{in comparison with the}} case when the two states have the same energy (Fig. 1a), i. e. when they are degenerate and the Jahn-Teller effect (JTE) takes place. We see that the two cases, degenerate and nondegenerate but close-in-energy (pseudodegenerate) are similar in generating two minima with distorted configurations, but there are important differences: while in the JTE there is a crossing of the two terms at the point of degeneracy (leading to conical intersections in more complicated cases), in the nondegenerate case with strong vibronic coupling there is an “avoided crossing” or “pseudo crossing”. Even a more important difference between the two vibronic coupling effects emerges {{from the fact that the}} two interacting states in the JTE are components of the same symmetry type, whereas in the PJTE each of the two states may have any symmetry. For this reason the possible kinds of distortion is very limited in the JTE, and unlimited in the PJTE. It is also noticeable that while the systems with JTE are limited by the condition of electron degeneracy, the applicability of the PJTE has no a priori limitations, as it includes also the cases of degeneracy. Even when the PJT coupling is weak and the inequality (11) does not hold, the PJTE is still significant in softening (lowering the corresponding vibrational frequency) of the ground state and increasing it in the excited state. When considering the PJTE in an excited state, all the higher in energy states destabilize it, while the lower ones stabilize it.|$|E
5000|$|Although the ac Josephson effect {{provides}} {{a much more}} stable voltage reference than Weston cells, the first single-junction Josephson standards [...] were difficult to use because they generated very small voltages (1-10 mV). Several {{attempts were made to}} raise the voltage by connecting two or more junctions in series. The most ambitious of theseused 20 junctions in series to realize a voltage of 100 mV with an uncertainty of a few parts in 109. Ensuring that every junction was on a constant voltage step required individually adjusting the bias current to each of the 20 junctions. The difficulty of this procedure makes arrays of significantly more than 20 junctions impractical. [...] In 1977, Levinson et al.made a suggestion that would ultimately lead to a solution to the multiple-bias problem. Levinson pointed out the importance of the parameter [...] in determining the characteristics of rf-induced Josephson steps.

In particular, he showed that junctions with a large capacitance [...] and a large [...] could generate an I-V curve with hysteretic constant-voltage steps like those shown in <b>Fig.</b> <b>1b.</b> These steps have become known as zero-crossing steps because they cross the zero-current axis of the I-V curve. The lack of stable regions between the first few steps means that for small dc bias currents, the junction voltage must be quantized. With a common bias current at or near zero, the voltage across a large array of these junctions must also be quantized. The possibility of obtaining constant-voltage steps at zero current over a wide range of junction and operating parameters suggested the possibility of building a voltage standard using large arrays of junctions.|$|E
5000|$|An imaging cycler {{microscope}} (ICM) is a {{fully automated}} (epi)fluorescence microscope which overcomes the spectral resolution limit resulting in parameter- and dimension-unlimited fluorescence imaging. The principle and robotic device {{was described by}} Walter Schubert in 1997 [...] and ever since has been further developed with his co-workers within the human toponome project. The ICM runs robotically controlled repetitive incubation-imaging-bleaching cycles with dye-conjugated probe libraries recognizing target structures in situ (biomolecules in fixed cells or tissue sections). This results in the transmission of a randomly large number of distinct biological informations by re-using the same fluorescence channel after bleaching for the transmission of another biological information using the same dye which is conjugated to another specific probe, a.s.o. Thereby noise-reduced quasi-multi channel fluorescence images with reproducible physical, geometrical, and biophyscial stabilities are generated. The resulting power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) per data point is given by 65,536k, where 65,536 {{is the number of}} grey value levels (output of a 16-bit CCD camera) and k is the number of co-mapped biomolecules and/or subdomains per biomolecule(s). High PCMD has been shown for k = 100, and in principle can be expanded for much higher numbers of k. In contrast to traditional multi-channel-few parameter fluorescence microscopy (Fig 1a) high PCMDs in an ICM lead to high functional and spatial resolution (<b>Fig</b> <b>1b).</b> Systematic ICM analysis of biological systems reveals the supramolecular segregation law that describes the principle of order of large, hierarchically organized biomolecular networks in situ (toponome). The ICM is the core technology for the systematic mapping of the complete protein network code in tissues (human toponome project). The original ICM method [...] includes any modification of the bleaching step. Corresponding modifications have been reported for antibody retrieval [...] and chemical dye-quenching [...] debated recently. The Toponome Imaging Systems (TIS) and Multi-Epitope-Ligand cartographs (MELC) represent different stages of the ICM technological development. Imaging Cycler Microscopy received the American ISAC best paper award in 2008 for the three symbol code of organized proteomes.|$|E
