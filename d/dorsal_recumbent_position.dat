Transthoracic echocardiography was performed by an expert (IPR) blinded to group allocation, using a 7.5 -MHz probe (Esaote model, CarisPlus, Firenze, Italy). Images were obtained from the parasternal views. The left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening were calculated in one-dimensional mode analysis of the left ventricle guided by the parasternal short-axis view. Pulsed-wave Doppler was used to measure pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAT) and pulmonary artery ejection time (PET), and the PAT/PET ratio was used as an indirect index of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

30|$|The {{experimental}} design was a randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel-group study. The animals were treated {{in accordance with}} recommendations from the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Research and were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee. Sexually mature female Sprague–Dawley rats, aged 6 – 8  weeks and weighing 240 – 300  g, were housed {{for a minimum of}} 1  week before surgery. The animals were maintained under standard laboratory conditions (temperature 20 – 22 °C, relative humidity 50 – 70 %, 12 : 12  h light/dark ratio) and were fed a standard laboratory diet and had free access to food and water before and after the operative procedures. In the event of a rat dying before the second operative procedure, the rat was replaced for laparoscopy {{in order to maintain the}} same number of rats in each group. Before each procedure, all instruments were sterilized by rubbing with 70 % isopropanol. On the day of the surgery, each rat was anesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital at 0.08  mg/g (Nembutal, Sanofi Santé Animale, Brussels, Belgium) and was branded (metallic clip on ear and color marking on tail). Rats were placed in <b>dorsal</b> <b>recumbent</b> <b>position,</b> abdominal operative surface was shaved (electric shaver), and disinfection of the abdominal operative surface was carried out with dermic polyvidone (Viatris, Mérignac, France).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is {{increased}} in the right compared to the left <b>recumbent</b> <b>position.</b> Esophageal acid exposure {{is related to the}} acidity at the cardia, but the effect of body position on the acidity at the cardia has not yet been investigated. We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying increased esophageal acid exposure in the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>position.</b> METHODS: On 2 separate days a 4 -h combined esophageal and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) manometry and pH recording of esophagus, gastric cardia, and corpus was performed in the right and left <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> after a high fat meal in 10 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> a prolonged esophageal acid exposure (7. 0 % vs 2. 0 %, p < 0. 03), a higher incidence of reflux episodes (3. 8 vs 0. 9 /h, p < 0. 03), more transient LES relaxations (TLESRs) (6. 5 vs 3. 2 /h, p < 0. 03), and higher percentage TLESRs associated with reflux (57. 0 % vs 22. 4 % p < 0. 03) was recorded than in the left supine position. Acidity at gastric cardia and corpus was not affected by body position. CONCLUSIONS: Increased esophageal acid exposure in the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> relative to the left <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> {{is the result of a}} higher incidence of GER episodes caused by an increased incidence of TLESRs and higher percentage of TLESRs associated with GER.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) {{is characterized}} by arterial hypoxemia, and prone position (PP) is one possible management strategy. The objective here was to evaluate the effects of PP on oxygenation. DESIGN AND SETTING: Non-randomized, open, prospective, controlled clinical trial, in a surgical intensive care unit at a tertiary university hospital. METHODS: Forty-one ARDS patients underwent PP for three-hour periods. Arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO 2) was measured immediately before changing to PP, after 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes in PP and 60 minutes after returning to <b>dorsal</b> <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> (DP). The paired-t and Dunnett tests were used. RESULTS: A notable clinical improvement in oxygenation (> 15 %) was detected in 78. 0 % of patients. This persisted for 60 minutes after returning to DP in 56 % and lasted for 12 and 48 hours in 53. 6 % and 46. 3 %, respectively. Maximum improvement was seen after 30 minutes in 12. 5 % of responding patients and after 180 minutes in 40. 6 %. No statistically significant associations between PP response and age, gender, weight, PEEP level, tidal volume, respiratory rate, PaO 2 /FiO 2 or duration of mechanical ventilation were detected. One accidental extubation and four cases of deterioration through oxygenation were detected. The 48 -hour mortality rate was 17 %. CONCLUSIONS: For {{a significant number of}} ARDS patients, PP may rapidly enhance arterial oxygenation and its inclusion for management of severe ARDS is justified. However, it is not a cost-free maneuver and caution is needed in deciding on using PP...|$|E
30|$|Left {{ventricular}} {{function in}} response to dobutamine after exposure to MWCNTs was evaluated by a pressure-volume loop catheter placed in the left ventricle in the anesthetized rat. At 1 and 7  days post-exposure, the rat was anesthetized with 3 % isoflurane with 2  l per minute of oxygen in an induction chamber and maintained at 1 – 2 % isoflurane with 1  l per minute of oxygen during the surgery. Cardiopulmonary response (heart rate, breath rate, and depth) and toe pinched spinal reflex were examined as intraoperative monitoring techniques. The normal body temperature was maintained by a temperature-controlled heating pad and was monitored via an anal probe during the entire procedure. The rat was placed in <b>dorsal</b> <b>recumbent</b> <b>position,</b> and the incision sites were clipped and then aseptically prepared with povidone-iodine, followed by 70 % alcohol. Millar’s Mikro-Tip® ultra-miniature PV loop catheter (SPR- 901, Millar, Inc. Houston, TX) was inserted into the left ventricle through the carotid artery. The correct position of the catheter tip in the left ventricle was confirmed by the waveform of pressure-volume loop visualized on a computer monitor. After stabilization for 20  min, the signals of left ventricular function were continuously recorded at a sampling rate of 1000 samples/s using a PV conductance system (MPVS-Ultra, Millar Instruments, Houston, TX, USA) connected to the PowerLab 4 / 30 data acquisition system (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). Dobutamine, USP grade (Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL), was prepared in pharmaceutical sterile saline solution (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10  μg/kg/ 50  μl) and applied through jugular vein by a Pump 11 Elite Programmable Syringe Pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) for 30  s for each dose.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a constant rate infusion (CRI) of romifidine on the requirement of isoflurane, cardiovascular performance and recovery in anaesthetized horses undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Study design: Randomized blinded prospective clinical trial. Animals: Thirty horses scheduled for routine arthroscopy. Methods: After premedication (acepromazine 0. 02 mg kg- 1, romifidine 80 mu g kg- 1, methadone 0. 1 mg kg- 1) and induction (midazolam 0. 06 mg kg- 1 ketamine 2. 2 mg kg- 1), anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Horses were assigned randomly to receive a CRI of saline (group S) or 40 mu g kg- 1 hour- 1 romifidine (group R). The influences of time and treatment on anaesthetic and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated using an analysis of variance. Body weight (t-test), duration of anaesthesia (t-test) and recovery score (Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test) were compared between groups. Significance was set at p < 0. 05. Results: All but one horse were positioned in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> and ventilated from the start of anaesthesia. End tidal isoflurane concentrations were similar in both groups at similar time points and over the whole anaesthetic period. Cardiac output was significantly lower in horses of the R group, but {{there were no significant differences}} between groups in cardiac index, body weight or age. All other cardiovascular parameters were similar in both groups. Quality of recovery did not differ significantly between groups, but more horses in group R stood without ataxia at the first attempt. One horse from group S had a problematic recovery. Conclusions and clinical relevance: No inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect or side effects were observed by using a 40 mu g kg- 1 hour- 1 romifidine CRI in isoflurane anaesthetized horses under clinical conditions. Cardiovascular performance remained acceptable. Further studies are needed to identify the effective dose of romifidine that will induce an inhalation anaesthetic sparing effect in anaesthetized horses...|$|E

The maximum isokinetic muscle strength in the <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> was 210. 0 ± 29. 2 Nm at 300 °/s, 158. 4 ± 19. 8 Nm at 480 °/s, and 110. 6 ± 13. 2 at 660 °/s. In contrast, the muscle strength in the supine position was 229. 3 ± 36. 7 Nm at 300 °/s, 180. 7 ± 20. 3 Nm at 480 °/s, and 129. 6 ± 14. 0 Nm at 660 °/s. Thus, the maximum isokinetic muscle strength showed significantly higher values in the supine position than in the <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> at all angular velocities. The knee and hip joint angles were measured at peak torque using a goniometer; the knee joint angle was not significantly different between both positions, whereas the hip joint angle was greater in the supine position than in the <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> (Supine position: 137. 3 ± 9. 33 degree at 300 °/s, 140. 0 ± 11. 13 degrees at 480 °/s, and 141. 0 ± 9. 61 degrees at 660 °/s. Recumbent position: 99. 5 ± 12. 21 degrees at 300 °/s, 101. 6 ± 12. 29 degrees at 480 °/s, and 105. 8 ± 14. 28 degrees at 660 °/s). Peak oxygen uptake was higher in the <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> (50. 3 ± 4. 43 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1) than in the supine position (48. 7 ± 5. 10 ml·kg- 1 ·min- 1).

Our population consisted of 35 elderly subjects and 35 adults. 15 of the elderly subjects were male (43 %) and 20 female (57 %). 16 of the adult group were male (46 %) and 19 female (54 %). The sample was mapped in terms of age, weight, height, abdominal girth and clinical data, to exclude factors which could distort the results. Results: The difference between the two study groups attained statistical significance for all parameters measured. The linear relationship was also significant between age and all parameters and a negative and significant correlation was seen. Expansion of the chest in females was the parameter most inversely correlated with age (60. 37 %). The lung function testing variable with the greatest difference between the groups was peak expiratory flow rate (35. 77 % in females and 36. 17 % in males).

40|$|Today, modern imaging {{procedures}} {{complete the}} studies of the body with scalpel and tweezers. By this development {{a lot of new}} opportunities both in diagnostic and in therapeutic practice came up. The non-invasive techniques are rapidly accepted in medicine and veterinary medicine. Indeed, the veterinary medicine profits from the rapid development in human radiology. Due to the permanent improvement in the MRI, equipments are often renewed. Therefore a quite expensive technology may be available to the veterinary medicine in close future. Thus the standard in the field of research as well as diagnosis and therapy of small animals has clearly risen. As a consequence, modern imaging methods are also a part in veterinary education. In order to interpret the images obtained, solid knowledge of the two-dimensional normal anatomy becomes very important for veterinarians. On CT and MR pictures, the radiologist is confronted with detailed anatomical sections instead of two-dimensional shadow pictures as on conventional radiographs. These new developments have caused difficulties when evaluating CT and MR images. The knowledge of the normal topographical and applied anatomy has to serve as a basis for recognizing structural details. This paper contributes to the great need for more investigations in this field, particularly on the detailed cross-sectional anatomy of the cat as seen on MR images. Five adult cats of different age and sex were imaged with a "Siemens Magnetom GBS II" with a commercial extremities coil in the Department of Radiology of the "Universitätsklinikum Benjamin Franklin der Freien Universität Berlin". The cats were placed in a ventral or <b>dorsal</b> <b>recumbent</b> <b>position.</b> To prevent motion artefacts the animals were anaesthesized by means of an intramuscularly administered Ketamin-Rompun injection. The MRI-studies were performed using horizontal, transverse and saggital scanning with a slice thickness of 3 mm. T 1 -weighted sequences gave the best results for anatomical description. For comparison, frozen sections of other 5 cats in corresponding layer orientations were made in approximately 0, 5 - 1 cm intervals with a bandsaw and immediately photographed. Anatomical structures on MR images and frozen slices were marked by lines which were labeled according the Nomina anatomica veterinaria. MR pictures and frozen slices clearly delineated the abdominal organs and large blood vessels. Motion artefacts appear more in the upper abdominal region due to the proximity of the heart and respiratory motion of the diaphragm. 3 -D-reconstruction of a series of images enables the presentation of the course of the big blood vessels in the abdomen. In general T 1 -weighted sequences showed clearly delineated structures. The liver, spleen and kidneys were visualized with good contrast of the parenchyma and blood vessels and medulla/cortex respectively. The alimentary canal was delineated also well with good contrast between the intestine wall, surrounding fat and the intestinal content. Interesting anatomical structures in the living cat could be presented like the often controversially discussed "Impressio renalis". The inherent high level of soft tissue contrast makes MRI a highly sensitive and specific modality for detection of normal anatomical structures of the cat...|$|E

In a horizontal position, the IOP TonoPenXL (17. 5 � 5. 0 mm Hg) was 0. 5 mm Hg higher as the IOP Draeger (17. 0 � 5. 3 mm Hg; regression analysis: IOP TonoPen = 0. 34 + 1. 016 IOP Draeger). Using the TonoPenXL, the IOP was 0. 8 mm Hg higher in <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> than in a sitting position (regression analysis: IOP TonoPen <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> = - 2. 27 + 1. 19 IOP TonoPen sitting position). We found no relationship found between central corneal power, central corneal thickness and IOD measured with the TonoPenXL. Conclusions: The TonoPenXL is useful for IOP measurement in a sitting and <b>recumbent</b> <b>position.</b> The results are reproducible in 92 % with the Goldmann-applanation tonometer. The ophthalmologist has a comfortable measurement and screening tool for consultations or IOP investigation under general anaesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Does {{delivery}} position {{affect the}} frequency or severity of perineal lacerations? Evidence-Based Answer: There {{is no significant}} difference between upright and <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> during the second stage of labor on the incidence of third and fourth degree perineal lacerations, but the incidence of second-degree lacerations is increased in women delivering in upright positions (SOR: A, meta-analysis). Among women with an epidural, there is no difference between upright or <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> in the incidence of any perineal laceration requiring suturing (SOR: A, meta-analysis). Delivering with or without stirrups does not affect the incidence or severity of perineal lacerations (SOR: B, single RCT) ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} impact of the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>{{position}}</b> with the sitting position on gastric emptying of water. METHODS: In eight healthy male volunteers, the 13 C acetate breath test was performed twice to assess gastric emptying of 100 mL tap water. Subjects were seated in one test and lying on their right side in the other. In both positions, pulmonary 13 CO 2 exhalation curves were obtained by plotting breath data against time. Percent gastric retention curves were created by analyzing data using the Wagner-Nelson protocol. RESULTS: No significant posture effect was found in pulmonary 13 CO 2 output curves (P = 0. 2150), whereas a significant effect was seen in gastric retention curves (P = 0. 0315). The percent retention values at 10 min and 15 min were significantly smaller when subjects were in the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> compared with the seated position (P < 0. 05). Our results verified the accelerating effect of the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> on gastric emptying of non-nutritive solutions. Concerning clinical implications, this study suggests that placing patients with acute pain on their right side after oral administration of analgesic drugs in solution is justified as an effective practice for rapid pain relief. For patients with gastrointestinal reflux symptoms, sleeping in the right <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> may reduce nocturnal symptoms, as delayed gastric emptying can cause reflux symptoms. CONCLUSION: Gastric emptying of water occurs more quickly when a subject lies on the right side compared with sitting...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sweeping is an {{important}} cleaning practice that is done either in standing or in <b>recumbent</b> <b>position,</b> but no empirical data exists {{on the scale of}} cardiovascular responses in these sweeping positions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the cardiovascular responses and rated perceive exertion following sweeping in <b>recumbent</b> and standing <b>positions.</b> Methods: One hundred healthy volunteers (Mean age 25. 07 + 2. 24) performed sweeping in <b>recumbent</b> or standing <b>positions</b> at their self-selected pace using the natural fibre broom or plastic broom for a duration of five minutes each. Cardiovascular responses were monitored at rest and immediately after sweeping in each position. Results: This study showed significant increase in rated perceived exertion score following recumbent compared to standing and higher values of systolic blood pressure and heart rate following recumbent sweeping compared to the values in standing position. No significant difference in diastolic blood pressure at rest and following sweeping in <b>recumbent</b> and standing <b>position</b> was however observed. Conclusion: From ergonomic standpoint, sweeping in standing position could be preferable to sweeping in <b>recumbent</b> <b>position...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recommendation}} to measure cerebrospinal fluid opening {{pressure in the}} extended, rather than the flexed lateral <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> to avoid false elevation of the opening pressure has not been formally evaluated in children. This single-center prospective cohort study includes 53 children who had their opening pressure measured in both the flexed and extended lateral <b>recumbent</b> <b>positions</b> prior to removing any cerebrospinal fluid (mean age 11. 7 years; 60 % male). The mean opening pressure was higher in the flexed (25. 1 + 9. 2 cm H 2 O) compared with the extended (24. 4 + 8. 4 cm H 2 O) position (mean difference 0. 6 + 2. 2 cm H 2 O; Z 2. 021, P <. 03). Most (92. 4 %) opening pressure measurements had less than a 5 cm H 2 O difference between positions. Lumbar puncture performed in the extended, rather than the flexed lateral <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> results in a statistically significant decrease in cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure, although {{the magnitude of the}} difference is small and of doubtful clinical significance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{aimed to}} clarify which <b>recumbent</b> <b>position</b> is {{preferred}} by patients with {{congestive heart failure}} (CHF) and to evaluate whether cardiac autonomic nervous activity is different among three <b>recumbent</b> <b>positions</b> (supine, left lateral decubitus, right lateral decubitus) in patients with CHF. BACKGROUNDIt remains unclear whether cardiac autonomic nervous activity is different among three <b>recumbent</b> <b>positions</b> in patients with CHF. METHODSWe studied 17 male CHF patients (66 ± 7 years) and 17 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (66 ± 7 years). Each subject underwent 24 -h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. A channel was used to record the CM 5 lead, and another to record the signal of the patient’s posture with use of a newly developed small-sized detector (3. 2 cm × 3. 2 cm). By using spectral analysis of heart rate variability, frequency-domain measures were calculated and compared among the three <b>recumbent</b> <b>positions.</b> Normalized high-frequency (HF: 0. 15 to 0. 40 Hz) power {{was used as an}} index of vagal activity and the low frequency (0. 04 to 0. 15 Hz) /HF power ratio was used as an index of sympathovagal balance. RESULTSIn patients with CHF, the time for the right lateral decubitus position was two-fold longer than that for the supine and left lateral decubitus positions. The increased cardiac sympathetic activity and decreased vagal tone in CHF patients were normalized in the right lateral decubitus position. CONCLUSIONSThe right lateral decubitus position in patients with CHF may be a self-protecting mechanism of attenuating the imbalance of cardiac autonomic nervous activity...|$|R
