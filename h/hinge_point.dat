The umbo generally and the beak specifically represent the oldest portion of the shell, with extra material gradually being laid down along the margins on the opposite sides. The <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> or line is the dorsal region of the shell, and the lower, curved margin is the ventral region. The anterior or front of the shell is where the byssus (when present) and foot are located, and the posterior of the shell is where the siphons are located. With the umbones/ hinge uppermost and with the anterior edge of the animal towards the viewer's left, the valve facing the viewer is the left valve and the opposing valve the right.|$|E
25|$|The bending of {{the neural}} plate {{involves}} {{the formation of}} hinges, where the neural plate is connected to surrounding tissues. The midline of the neural plate is referred to the median <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> (MHP). Cells in this area, known as medial <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> cells because of their involvement with this structure, are stabilized and connected to the notochord. They are derived from {{the area of the}} neural plate anterior to primitive knot. The notochord will begin the shape changes in MHP cells. These cells will decrease in height and become wedge-shaped. Another type of <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> occurs dorsal-laterally, referred to as dorsal-lateral <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> (DLHP). These regions furrow and change shape {{in the same way as}} MHP cells do before connecting together to form the neural tube. It was seen in an experiment that without the notochord, the MHP characteristics did not develop correctly, so the neural plate and neural tube formation did not happen properly. The communication between the neural plate and the notochord is important for the future induction and formation of the neural tube.|$|E

25|$|Low pSMAD 1, 5, 8 levels allow {{a greater}} {{mobility}} at the median <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> than in lateral neural plate cells. This flexibility {{allows for the}} pivoting and hinging that allows the buckling and lifting of the neural plate when formatting the neural tube. The neural plate has to be rigid enough for morphogenic movements to occur while being flexible enough to undergo shape and position changes for the transformation to the neural tube.|$|E

40|$|A three {{dimensional}} body-fitted {{coordinate system}} developed {{for use in}} the calculation of inviscid flows over ablated, asymmetric reentry vehicle nosetips is described. Because of the potential geometric asymmetries, no standard coordinate system (e. g., spherical, axisymmetric reference surface-normal) is capable of being closely aligned with the nosetip surface. To generate a 3 -D, body-fitted coordinate system an analytic mapping procedure is applied that is conformal within each meridional plane of the nosetip; these transformations are then coupled circumferentially to yield a three dimensional coordinate system. The mappings used are defined in terms of <b>hinge</b> <b>points,</b> which are points selected to approximate the body contours in each meridional plane. The selection of appropriate <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> was automated to facilitate the use of the resulting nosetip flow field code...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} of Explorer 34 {{encounters with the}} neutral sheet reveals a much broader arching of the neutral sheet at 30 earth radii than closer to the earth at 20 earth radii. The location of the neutral sheet <b>hinging</b> <b>point</b> in the geomagnetic equatorial plane {{is found to be}} a strong function of geomagnetic activity. For Kp less than 2 the apparent hinging distance is close to 11 earth radii. For Kp greater than 4 the apparent hinging distance is close to zero. This dependency reflects a negligible return of the neutral sheet to the solar magnetospheric equatorial plane with distance behind the earth at quiet times but reflects a rapid return at disturbed times, in addition to possible variations in the location of the <b>hinging</b> <b>point</b> in the geomagnetic equatorial plane...|$|R
2500|$|A fold surface seen {{in profile}} {{can be divided}} into hinge and limb portions. The limbs are the flanks of the fold and the hinge is where the flanks join together. The <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> is the point of minimum radius of {{curvature}} (maximum curvature) for a fold. The crest of the fold is the highest point of the fold surface, and the trough is the lowest point. The inflection point of a fold is the point on a limb at which the [...] reverses; on regular folds, this is the midpoint of the limb.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} folding begins when {{the cells in}} the central region of the neural plate, the medial <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> cells, bind to the {{notochord}} beneath them. [...] This creates a central anchoring point for the process of folding to occur, and subsequently creates the neural groove. [...] As the neural folds continue to extend, dorsolateral hinge points form, allowing the folds to curve into a tube-like structure. [...] When the peaks of the folds (known as the neural crest regions) touch, they merge and involute, creating the neural tube beneath the newly formed epidermal layer.|$|E

A thin trim piece at the roof's edge simulated a convertible's fold-down <b>hinge</b> <b>point.</b> The D/L package, now the middle trim level, was extended to the hatchback, which was given a brushed aluminum Targa-like roof band and a half-vinyl roof to differentiate it from the base model hatchback.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{structure}} of actin in its various conformational states is important for understanding the diverse motile activities carried out by eukaryotic cells. Profilin:actin crystals provide a unique system for studying conformational states of actin, because they exhibit a high degree of polymorphism in response to environmental conditions while maintaining crystalline order. A preliminary comparison of two states of profilin:beta-actin crystals shows that crystal polymorphism involves movements of actin subdomains at <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> homologous to those found in hexokinase, a protein whose polypeptide fold is related to actin. The homology of the <b>hinge</b> <b>points</b> in actin to those in hexokinase suggests that actin subdomain movements in profilin:beta-actin crystals have functional significance.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{and stability of}} a spin stabilized spacecraft with a hinged appendage system are treated analytically and numerically. The hinged system consists of a central hub with masses attached to (assumed) massless booms of fixed length whose orientation relative to the main part can change. The general three dimensional deployment dynamics of such a hinged system is considered without any restriction on {{the location of the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>points.</b> The equations of motion for the hinged system, with viscous damping at both <b>hinge</b> <b>points,</b> are linearized about the nominal equilibrium position where the booms are orthogonal to the nominal spin axis for the case of two dimensional and three dimensional motion.

2500|$|The P-38 {{is known}} as a [...] "John Wayne" [...] by the United States Marine Corps, either because of its {{toughness}} and dependability, or because of an unsubstantiated story that the actor had been shown in an as-yet-unidentified training film opening a can of K-Rations. The can opener is pocket-sized, approximately [...] long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle, with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid. A notch just under the <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is [...] "walked" [...] around to cut the lid out. A larger version called the P-51 is somewhat easier to operate. The handle portion can also double as a makeshift flat-blade screwdriver, with limited ability because of the rather soft sheet metal used. The P-51 is not an official Army can opener although it is often marketed as such.|$|E
2500|$|The Platz glider {{was built}} around a central, two part boom. A curved, {{circular}} cross-section steel tube reached from the nose {{at least as far}} aft as the welded sockets which received the ends of the main wing spars. A solid, circular section wood beam was inserted into this steel tube, extending it rearwards. The wing spars were also circular, solid and wooden, set with strong dihedral which took their tips to the height of the extreme nose so that the foreplanes, elevators or jibs could be attached between these three points. [...] Their inner trailing edges were directly controlled by the pilot, who sat over the central beam-wing spar joint. They were initially hinged together at their leading edges, but later the <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> was moved rearwards towards the aerodynamic centre to reduce pilot load and separated only behind the hinge. [...] Since there were no ribs, the airfoil was determined by the airflow and the pilot, as for the sloop's jib. [...] The main wing, a [...] single surface stretched between the spars and the extreme tail, also had its camber determined by the airflow, like the mainsail of the sloop. [...] Both wing sheets were produced by sewing together narrow strips of material; the longitudinal joints between them are prominent in some back lit, better quality images.|$|E
2500|$|Another unusual {{feature of}} the DMC-12 is its gull-wing doors. The common problem of {{supporting}} the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and a hydraulic pump in the Bricklin SV-1, although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DMC-12 features heavy doors supported by cryogenically preset torsion bars and gas-charged struts. These torsion bars were developed by Grumman Aerospace (and built by Unbrako in the UK, a division of SPS Technologies of Jenkintown, PA) to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors. A popular misconception of the DMC-12's gull-wing doors is that they require far more side clearance to open relative to ordinary side-hinge doors, such as when parked in a parking lot. In fact, the opposite is true: the DMC-12 requires far less clearance than side-hinge doors, and this can be physically demonstrated. This misconception of side clearance may stem from a misunderstood location of the <b>hinge</b> <b>point</b> of the doors by persons unfamiliar with DMC-12s. These doors, when opening, only require [...] clearance outside {{the line of the}} car, making opening and closing the doors in crowded spaces relatively easy. Much like the doors fitted to the Lamborghini Countach, the DMC-12 doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels. Additionally, the doors featured red and amber [...] "safety" [...] lights around the perimeter. These lights illuminated when the door was open and could be seen from the front, rear or side of the vehicle at night or low light situations.|$|E
