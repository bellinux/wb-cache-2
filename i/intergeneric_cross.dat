40|$|INTERSPECIFICmatings are {{normally}} discouraged by such natural isolating mechanisms as behavioral differences {{and differences in}} habitation. The develop-ment of practical procedures for avian artificial insemination allows the bypass-ing {{of the problems of}} natural mating, permitting numerous interspecific and even <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crosses</b> to be attempted. Such matings usually result in reduced fertility and embryonic viability; and when viable hybrids are produced, these are usually sterile.

Using the same maize pollens to be pollinated, different wheat lines all could produce haploid embryos with various efficiencies (Inagaki and Tahir 1990; Cai et al. 2004). For example, Chen et al.

All 26 progeny examined exhibited maternal inheritance of plastid petA and petD loci. However, 17 of the 26 progeny exhibited an apparent biparental inheritance of mitochondrial atpA, cob, coxII, and coxIII restriction frag-ment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and maternal inheritance of mitochondrial rrn 26 and coxI RFLPs. The remaining nine progeny inherited only maternal mito-chondrial DNA (mtDNA) configurations. Investigations of plant mitochondrial ge-nome inheritance are complicated by the multipartite structure of this genome, nuclear gene control over mitochondrial genome organization, and transfer of mi-tochondrial sequences to the nucleus. In this study, paternal mtDNA configurations were not detected in purified mtDNA of progeny plants, but were present in progeny DNA preparations enriched for nuclear genome sequences.

The aspects of the cross compatibility that are discussed testified in the hybridization investigation of the interspecific and <b>intergeneric</b> <b>cross</b> combinations that were made between species in the two tribes. The hybridization barrier between genera of the tribe Bambuseae was shown to be low. Species of Sasa group hybridized successfully with Phyllostachys bambusoides and with Sinobambusa tootsik, both distantly related species of Bambuseae. On the other hand, in the tribe Triticeae all of the distant hybridizations using Elymus tsukushiensis and E. ciliaris required embryo rescue because of abortive endosperm. The average of seed set was higher in the cross combination involving the latter species. The rate of germination is different for the two Elymus species.

István Molnár 1, Sándor Dulai 2, Márta Molnár-Láng 1 * ABSTRACT The physiological responses to water stress induced by PEG were investigated in Aegilops biuncialis (Vis.) genotypes which differ in the annual rainfall of their habitat (1050, 550 and 225 mm/year) and in Triticum aestivum (L.) wheat genotypes differing in drought toler-ance, {{in order to find}} Ae. biuncialis accessions suitable for improving wheat drought tolerance through <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crossing.</b> A decrease in the osmotic pressure of the nutrient solution from – 0. 027 MPa to – 1. 8 MPa resulted in intense water loss, a low extent of stomatal closure and a decrease in the intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci) in Aegilops genotypes originating from dry habitats, while in wheat genotypes high osmotic stress induced increased stomatal closure, resulting in a low level of water loss and high Ci. Nevertheless, under saturating light at normal atmospheric CO 2 level, the rate of CO 2 assimilation was higher for the Aegilops accessions under strong osmotic stress than for the wheats. Moreover, in the wheat genotypes, CO 2 assimilation exhibited less or no O 2 sensitivity. These physiological responses were manifested in changes in the growth rate and biomass production, since Aegilops (Ae 550, Ae 225) genotypes retain a higher growth rate (especially in the roots), biomass production and yield formation after drought stress than wheat. On the basis of the results it seems that Aegilops genotypes originat-ing from a dry habitat have better drought tolerance than wheat, making them good candidates for improving the drought tolerance of wheat through <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crossing.</b> Acta Biol Szeged 52 (1) : 175 - 178 (2008) KEY WORDS wheat-Aegilops biuncialis amphi-ploids drought tolerance CO 2 fixation stomatal conductanc...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} haploidy and haploid plants - with reduced number of {{chromosomes}} - {{is very important}} for genetic studies (genes interactions, genes amount etc.) but it is also important for conventional plant breeding. Dihaploid (DH) plants (homozygous linies) are obtained after chromosome doubling. Spontaneous frequency of haploids is very low in cereals (usually 0, 001 - 0, 01 %). Several mechanisms are known to result in haploid plants. These are mainly classified into three categories - androgenesis (anthers, microspores cultivation), gynogenesis (ovaries, ovules cultivation) and wide hybridization (intergeneric and interspecies hybridization). The principle of <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crosses</b> is based on the knowledge that the male (maize) chromosomes are eliminated from the developing embryo during the first few division cycles. Developed haploid embryos of wheat or oat are cultured on nutritive media and after necessary cytogenetic studies they are dihaploidized by colchicin to obtain fertile and genetically stable progeny. We study optimal culture conditions of particular explants (pretreatment, explant stage, modification of cultivation medium). Pollen embryos development has been studied in process of induction and regeneration. The number of regenerated green and albino androgenetic plants is evaluated. The ploidy level of regenerated plants was evaluated continually on the basis of flow-cytometric determination of nuclear DNA content. We evaluated individual genotypes of cereal species.

40|$|For the teleosts Xiphophorus montezuma, Platypoecilius maculatus, {{and their}} F 1 hybrids the {{temperature}} characteristics (µ in Arrhenius' equation) {{are the same}} for the shift of the low intensity and the high intensity segments of the respective and different flicker response contours (critical intensity I as a function of flash frequency F, with light time fraction constant, at 50 per cent). The value of µ is 12, 500 calories or a very little less, over the range 12. 5 to 36 °. This shows that 1 /I can be understood as a measure of excitability, with F fixed, and that the excitability is governed by the velocity of a chemical process common to both the classes of elements represented in the duplex performance curve (rods and cones). It is accordingly illegitimate to assume that the different shapes of the rod and cone branches of the curves are determined by differences in the chemical mechanisms of excitability. It is also forbidden to assume that the differing form constants for the homologous segments in the curves for two forms (X. and P.) are the reflections of a difference in the chemical factors of primary excitability. These differences are determined by statistical factors of the distribution of excitabilities among the elements implicated in the sensory effect vs. intensity function, and are independent of temperature and of the temperature characteristic. It must be concluded that the physicochemical nature of the excitatory process cannot be deduced from the shape of the performance contour. The form constants (σ'log I and Fmax.) for F vs. log I are specifically heritable in F 1, although µ is here the same as for X. and P. In an <b>intergeneric</b> <b>cross</b> one cannot in general expect Mendelian simplicity of segregation in subsequent generations, and in the present case we find that F 2 individuals are indistinguishable from F 1, both as regards F vs. log I and as regards the variation of I within a group of 17 individuals. The result in F 2 definitely shows, however, that certain specific statistical form constants for the F-log I contour are transmissible in inheritance. It is pointed out that there thus is provided an instance in which statistical (distribution) factors in performance characteristics involving the summating properties of assemblages of cellular units are heritable in a simple manner without the implication of detectable differences in chemical organization of the units involved. This has an important bearing upon the logic of the theory of the gene...|$|E
40|$|Anemone coronaria L. and Ranunculus asiaticus L. both {{belong to}} the Ranunculaceae, a large plant family with many ornamentals of horticultural importance. There are {{considerable}} differences between these species leaves, flower morphology and flower colour therefore <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crosses</b> between the species might result in new interesting hybrids. Crosses between Anemone coronaria L. and Ranunculus asiaticus L. were performed and the F 1 progeny was examined. In this study, the F 1 hybrid generation was investigated at morphological, molecular and cytogenetic levels. More than 85 % of the F 1 plants had very similar flowers to the maternal plants and although seeming to have a limited paternal contribution, AFLP analyses confirmed the partial hybrid character of the F 1 plants. GISH experiments revealed that the F 1 plants were mixoploids (plants composed of cells with different chromosome numbers) or showed many chromosome rearrangements...|$|R
40|$|The pollen–stigma {{interaction}} {{plays an}} important role in reproductive process and has been continuously studied in many interspecific and <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crossing</b> experiments. The aim of this study was to investigate stigma receptivity (SR) of willow in order to determine the most suitable period for its pollination with poplar pollen and improve the effectiveness of Salix × Populus crosses. Tissue samples were examined histologically using light, epifluorescent, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. Willow SR was determined by stigma morphological traits, test of pollen germination rate, Peroxtesmo test of peroxidase and esterase activity on stigma surface as well as papilla ultrastructure at anthesis. We have ascertained that the SR duration in willow is short, lasting from 1 to 2 DA. The poplar pollen germination rate on willow stigmas on 1 DA ranged from 26. 3 to 11. 2 %...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{numbers and}} meiotic {{behavior}} are {{reported for the}} climbing cacti species Hylocereus undatus, Hylocereus polyrhizus, and Selenicereus megalanthus. The Hylocereus spp. are diploid (2 n 5 22), while S. megalanthus is a tetraploid (2 n 5 44). Irregular chromosome disjunction at anaphase I in pollen mother cells of S. megalanthus is probably the major cause of its reduced pollen viability and may contribute to low seed set, low number of viable seeds and, consequently, low fruit mass. A pollination study confirmed self-incompatibility in H. polyrhizus and a weakened incompatibility reaction in H. undatus and S. megalanthus. Major crossability barriers do not exist between the Hylocereus spp. investigated. Reciprocal <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crosses</b> were successful between Hylocereus spp. and S. megalanthus, suggesting that an Hylocereus sp. Might {{be one of the}} diploid progenitors of the tetraploid S. megalanthus. The implications of the results on cacti nomenclature and systematics are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Andropogon is a pantropical grass genus {{comprising}} 100 – 120 {{species and}} found {{mainly in the}} grasslands of Africa and the Americas. In the new world the genus is represented by approximately sixty (diploids or hexaploids) species grouped in three sections. The hexaploid condition occurs only in the Americas and the full process of this origin is still uncertain, although cytogenetic analysis coupled with taxonomic evidence have provided strong support for new hypothesis. Stebbins proposed the first hypothesis suggesting that the origin of polyploidy in species of Andropogon in North America resulted from duplication of the genome of some diploid species, and then by <b>intergeneric</b> <b>crosses</b> with species of a related genus. Since then, numerous studies were performed to clarify the evolutionary history of the genus in America. In this paper, we present a review of cytogenetic studies in the American Andropogon species during the last four decades...|$|R
