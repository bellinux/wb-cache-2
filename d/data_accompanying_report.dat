40|$|AbstractEvaluating the {{kinetics}} of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in {{the blood}} of cancer patients could be a strong auxiliary component to the molecular characterization of cfDNA, but its potential clinical significance is obscured by the absence of an analytical consensus. To utilize quantitative cfDNA assessment with confidence, it is crucial that the preanalytical phase is standardized. In a previous publication, several preanalytical variables that may affect quantitative measurements of cfDNA were identified, and the most confounding variables were assessed further using the growth medium of cultured cancer cells as a source of cfDNA (“Cell-free DNA: Preanalytical variables” [1]). The <b>data</b> <b>accompanying</b> this <b>report</b> relates to these experiments, which includes numerous changes to the sample handling and isolation protocols, and can be used for the interpretation of these results and other similar experiments by different researchers...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{biochemical}} {{investigations of}} differentiating cardiac muscle first revealed {{the occurrence of}} a third class of filaments, differing in appearance and reactivities from the thick and thin filaments of the sarcomere. These inter-mediate filaments were more resistant to extraction with neutral salts, fl-mer-captoethanol, and urea than were the thick filaments, thin filaments, or Z material. Combined with the <b>data</b> from the <b>accompanying</b> <b>report,</b> sufficient evidence is presented to discount virtually all previous models of myofibril-logenesis. In 1965, Heuson-Stiennon (11) first reported the general occurrence of a hetero-geneous class of filaments in presarcomere myoblasts of developing striated muscle and indicated that the observed filaments were not identical to the sarcomeric thin filaments, as was (and still is) commonly assumed. In the <b>accompanying</b> <b>report,</b> visual identification {{of at least three}} classes of filaments is presented and is compared with the data from striated muscle presented by Heuson-Stiennon (11), Kelly (19), and Ishikawa et al.

40|$|Studies {{comparing}} {{the state of}} hydration and dehydration of rat liver mitochondria to their content of ATP, Ca, and fatty acid, along with the rate of ATP hydrolysis, as well as microscopic appearance of mitochondria, {{have led to the}} following generalizations: 1. The competition between cationic translocations and water translocation for the available chemical energy (ATP) determines under many circumstances the water content of mitochondria. 2. Swelling of mitochondria by electron transport substrates {{is an example of the}} activation of the cationic translocations at the expense of water translocation. 3. Electron micrographic studies are interpreted to indicate that EDTA alone can cause condensation and dehydration of the mitochondrial matrix. However, both EDTA and substrate are necessary to remove appreciable quantities of water from mitochondrial intramembranous spaces. 4. Since the <b>data</b> in the <b>accompanying</b> <b>report</b> indicated that EDTA, in the absence of energy, decreased the permeability of mitochondrial membranes, it appears likely that ballooning of intramembranous spaces, following addition of EDTA, represents trapping of water between two semipermeable membranes following dehydration of mitochondria...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{is associated}} with the document Fish Assemblages of Rocky Banks of the Pacific Northwest: Final Report by M. A. Hixon, B. N. Tissot, and W. G. Pearcy, and its <b>accompanying</b> <b>data</b> <b>reports.</b> Rockfishes, Sebastes spp [...] were the most numerous and speciose fishes seen during 16 submersible dives from 64 to 305 m depth in the vicinity of Heceta Bank off the coast of Oregon. Dense schools of juvenile rockfishes and large yellowtail rockfish, S. flavidus, were observed only over rocky, high relief areas {{near the top of the}} bank, and highest densities of small benthic rockfishes (up to 5 - 10 /m 2) on the flanks of the bank. These observations suggest that shallow, rocky portions of Heceta Bank are a nursery area for juvenile rockfishes. Two species groups of nonschooling fishes were identified based on transects over the diverse seafloor habitats around the bank: one comprised primarily of rockfishes in shallow water on rock and cobble, and the other comprised of flatfishes, agonids, sablefish, and some rockfishes in deep water over mud and cobble. Species composition of fishes observed from submersible dives differed from species composition of fishes taken from trawl catches in the same general areas...|$|R
