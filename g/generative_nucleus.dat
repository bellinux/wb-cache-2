However, it was not known if this deficiency also induces nondisjunction during the microspore divisions. Microsporogenesis in plants lacking or containing this deficiency was compared using two approaches. First, chromosome numbers were determined in <b>generative</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Many (8. 3 %) of the <b>generative</b> <b>nuclei</b> in r-X 1 -containing plants were aneuploid; however, those from control plants were all haploid. Thus, this {{deficiency in}}duces nondisjunction during the first microspore division. Second, nucleoli were analyzed in microspores. The only nucleolar organizing region in maize is on chromosome 6. If chromosome 6 underwent nondisjunction during the first microspore division, one nucleus in binucleate microspores would contain no nucleolus and the other would contain two nucleoli (or one nucleolus if the nucleoli fused). Only one (0. 03 %) microspore of this type was observed in control plants while 1. 12 % were found in r-X 1 -containing plants. Thus, the r-X 1 deficiency induces nondisjunction of chromosome 6 during the first microspore division. However, both of the sperm nuclei in trinucleate microspores contained one nucleolus in r-X 1 -containing and control plants; thus, this deficiency does not induce nondisjunction of chromosome 6 (and presumably other chromosomes) during the second microspore division...|$|R
40|$|Male {{germ line}} {{development}} in flowering plants is initiated with {{the formation of}} the generative cell that is the progenitor of the two sperm cells. While structural features of the generative cell are well documented, genetic programs required for generative cell cycle progression are unknown. We describe two novel Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants, duo pollen 1 (duo 1) and duo pollen 2 (duo 2), in which generative cell division is blocked, resulting in the formation of bicellular pollen grains at anthesis. duo 1 and duo 2 map to different chromosomes and act gametophytically in a male-specific manner. Both duo mutants progress normally through the first haploid division at pollen mitosis I (PMI) but fail at distinct stages of the generative cell cycle. Mutant generative cells in duo 1 pollen fail to enter mitosis at G 2 -M transition, whereas mutant generative cells in duo 2 enter PMII but arrest at prometaphase. In wild-type plants, <b>generative</b> and sperm <b>nuclei</b> enter S phase soon after inception, implying that male gametic cells follow a simple S to M cycle. Mutant <b>generative</b> <b>nuclei</b> in duo 1 complete DNA synthesis but bypass PMII and enter an endocycle during pollen maturation. However, mutant <b>generative</b> <b>nuclei</b> in duo 2 arrest in prometaphase of PMII with a 2 C DNA content. Our results identify two essential gametophytic loci required for progression through different phases of the generative cell cycle, providing the first evidence to our knowledge for genetic regulators of male germ line development in flowering plants. 7467...|$|R

On the other hand the consequences of these factors on {{the division of the}} <b>generative</b> <b>nucleus</b> and the formation of callose plugs are less known. In this study we report the effect of medium pH, 2 -[N- morpholino] ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, sucrose concentration, partial substitution of sucrose by polyethyleneglycol (PEG) 6000, arginine (Arg), and pollen density on the following parameters: pollen germination, pollen tube length, division of the <b>generative</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and the formation of callose plugs. We also studied the different developmental processes in relation to time. The optimal pH for all parameters tested was 6. 7. In particular, the division of the <b>generative</b> <b>nucleus</b> and callose plug deposition were inhibited at lower pH values. MES buffer had a toxic effect; both pollen germination and pollen tube length were lowered. MES buffer also influenced migration of the male germ unit (MGU), the second mitotic division, and the formation of callose plugs. A sucrose concentration of 10 % was optimal for pollen germination, pollen tube growth rate and final pollen tube length, as well as for division of the <b>generative</b> <b>nucleus</b> and the production of callose plugs. Partial substitution of sucrose by PEG 6000 had no influence on pollen germination and pollen tube length. However, in these pollen tubes the MGU often did not migrate and no callose plugs were observed. Pollen tube growth was independent of the migration of the MGU and the deposition of callose plugs. In previous experiments Arg proved to be positive for the division of the <b>generative</b> <b>nucleus</b> in pollen tubes cultured in vitro. Here, we found that more pollen tubes had callose plugs and more callose plugs per pollen tube were produced on medium with Arg. After the MGU migrated into the pollen tube (1 h after cultivation), callose plugs were deposited (3 h). After 8 h the first sperm cells were produced. The MGU moved away from the active pollen tube tip until the second pollen mitosis occurred, thereafter the distance from the MGU to the pollen tube tip diminished. Callose plug deposition never started prior to MGU migration into the pollen tube. Pollen tubes without a MGU also lack callose plugs (+/- 30 % {{of the total number of}} pollen tubes).

In cultured anther segments, moderate amounts of poly(A) +RNA were detected in the uninucleate, nonvacuolate, embryogenically determined pollen grains.

NN-medium {{was used as a}} basic medium for microspores development and MS-medium for rhizogenesis and organogenesis, together with adequate combinations of plant hormones (JAA, BAP, adenine, glutamine and kinetine) ...|$|E
40|$|Cultured anthers of Nicotiana sylvestris {{produced}} 70 % haploid, 14 % diploid, 8 % triploid, 2 % tetraploid and 6 % mixaploid plantlets. Immediately pre-mitotic anthers {{produced no}} plantlets; mitotic and immediately post-mitotic ones did so. Stage of anther development at initiation of culture {{was not related}} to production of non-haploids. Embryoids arose from divisions of the vegetative nucleus. In microspores containing globular embryoids 0, 1 or 2 nuclei derived from the <b>generative</b> <b>nucleus</b> could be recognised; these, however, contributed few if any viable cells to the developing plantlets. Metaphase plates with higher than the haploid number of chromosomes were seen and probably arose through nuclear fusion at an early stage...|$|E
40|$|The meiotic pollen mother cells (PMC) of Tradescantia (spiderwort) {{are highly}} {{synchronized}} in their prophase I and tetrad stages. Chromosomes of this stage {{are sensitive to}} physical or chemical mutagens. Thus high frequency of acentric fragments or sticky chromosomes can be induced with very low level of mutagens. These induced chromosome aberrations become micronuclei (MCN) in the synchronized tetrads {{and they can be}} easily identified and scored. Based upon these features, the Tradescantia micronucleus bioassay was established. This bioassay involves the exposure of PMC in the young inflorescences of the plant cuttings to gaseous agents through diffusion, to liquid agent through absorption and dialysis from the stem to flower buds, or to radiation. The exposed samples are fixed in aceto-alcohol (1 : 3) and prepared into microslides by using the aceto-carmine squash method. Frequencies of MCN in a large population of synchronized tetrads are the indications of genetic damage caused by the agents. Mature pollen grains of Tradescantia are free cells which can be cultured in lactose-agar medium. The generative cells in the cultured pollen tubes can carry out mitosis similar to the in vivo condition. The G 2 interphase chromosomes of pollen mitosis are highly sensitive to gaseous or liquid chemicals and radiation. Treatments can be applied to these mitotic generative cells of the mature pollen or the mitotic <b>generative</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the developing pollen tube. The mitotic chromosomes of the generative cells are allowed to proceed through mitosis in the culture medium and slides are prepared for metaphase figures. Frequencies of various types of chromatid aberrations can be scored and used as the indices of genetic damage...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is stated as ‚Äúto {{introduce}} the minute and mysterious world of pollen to as many readers as possible‚Äù and ‚Äúto re-establish the morphological study of pollen taking into account newly accumulated phylogenetic information‚Äù. It provides introductory accounts on ontogeny, pollen morphology, pollination, pollen physiology, genetics of pollen, airborne pollen and pollinosis, and pollen analysis. Technically speaking it is a well-produced book, being bound in hard covers and neatly printed on good paper. Moreover, it is overwhelmingly illustrated. However, when looking and reading carefully through the book one gets a bit disappointed. Let us first consider the illustrations, which take up at least {{three quarters of the}} book. In general, the line drawings are clear and instructive. I doubt however, whether in fig. 1. 7 (microsporogenesis) the vegetative and <b>generative</b> <b>nuclei</b> are correctly indicated. As to the photographs, one can not deny them being attractive at first sight. 92 full-page S(canning) E(lectron) M(icroscope) plates with micrographs of pollen grains, mainly from Japanese plants, form a kind of apocalyps {{at the end of the}} chapter on pollen morphology. Still, apart from revealing that ‚Äúminute and mysterious world of pollen‚Äù, they are not functional, as in the text reference is made to only one of the approximately 175 micrographs. In all other cases the reader must guess at ‚Äúthe beautiful art work of nature‚Äù. Many of the micrographs have too high contrasts or show excessively magnified details (often a view of the whole pollen grain is lacking). And what about the plate on p. 60 ? The two polyads shown are actually identical, which is obscured however, by presenting one of them in a smaller size, turning it upside down, and cutting off some of the grains...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{heterochromatic}} regions, containing moderately repetitive DNA as markers, {{has allowed}} {{to follow the}} course of development of the <b>generative</b> and vegetative <b>nuclei</b> in the pollen grains of some species of Tradescantia and Narcissus. It {{has been found that}} the chromocentres, relatives to the NOR-heterochromatin, are not randomly distributed. This implies the existence of a special mechanism governing the orientation of the centromeres in the spindle-shaped generative nuclei: a predisposition which may facilitate the mitotic process in the pollen tube...|$|R
