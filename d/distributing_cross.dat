The interaction between different {{layers of the}} OSI protocol stack requires a cross layer approach in order to optimally allocate {{the resources of the}} network. The Message Passing Direct Step Method presented here is an adaptive and distributed algorithm that achieves maximum network performance. Using the forward and backwards networks, this algorithm finds the left and right Perron Frobenius eigenvectors for the system and automatically adjusts the operating point of the system (data rates, link rates and transmitter powers) to their optimal values while satisfying QoS constraints. The approach is developed and simulated using TCP Reno...|$|R

This paper presents initial results exploring the effectiveness of distributed CLIR using query-based sampling techniques, which {{to the best of our}} knowledge has not been investigated before. In distributed retrieval with multiple databases, query-based sampling provides a simple and effective way for acquiring accurate resource descriptions which helps to select which databases to search. Observations from our initial experiments show that the negative impact of query-based sampling on cross language search may not be as great as it is on monolingual retrieval. ...|$|R

To better illustrate the disjoint portions in content passing between service proxies, two communication models were associated. Then, within Web Services, we explain the related protocols and socket connection between adaptation’s services.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{tolerance}} of cells toward different stresses {{is very important}} for industrial strains of microbes, but difficult to improve by the manipulation of single genes. Traditional methods for enhancing cellular tolerances are inefficient and time-consuming. Recently, approaches employing global transcriptional or translational engineering methods have been increasingly explored. We found that an exogenous global regulator, irrE from an extremely radiation-resistant bacterium, Deinococcus radiodurans, has the potential to act as a global regulator in Escherichia coli, and that laboratory-evolution might be applied to alter this regulator to elicit different phenotypes for E. coli. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To extend the methodology for strain improvement and to obtain higher tolerances toward different stresses, we here describe an approach of engineering irrE gene in E. coli. An irrE library was constructed by randomly mutating the gene, and this library was then selected for tolerance to ethanol, butanol and acetate stresses. Several mutants showing significant tolerances were obtained and characterized. The tolerances of E. coli cells containing these mutants were enhanced 2 to 50 -fold, based on cell growth tests using different concentrations of alcohols or acetate, and enhanced 10 to 100 -fold based on ethanol or butanol shock experiments. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays showed that intracellular ROS levels were sharply reduced for cells containing the irrE mutants. Sequence analysis of the mutants revealed that the mutations <b>distribute</b> <b>cross</b> all three domains of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that an exogenous global regulator has been artificially evolved to suit its new host. The successes suggest the possibility of improving tolerances of industrial strains by introducing and engineering exogenous global regulators, such as those from extremophiles. This new approach can be applied alone or in combination with other global methods, such as global transcriptional machinery engineering (gTME) for strain improvements...|$|R
