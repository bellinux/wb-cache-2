5|$|Due to {{seasonal}} high rainfall in the Shinano's watershed {{the fertile}} farmlands on the Niigata plain {{were subjected to}} flooding every {{three to four years}} which destroyed crops, particularly rice, and villages. Attempts from local residents to secure funding to build a <b>diversion</b> <b>channel</b> began in the mid-early eighteenth century, during the Kyōhō era. Government support was not secured until the early twentieth century following severe flooding and inundation in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Flooding in the Niigata area {{continued}} even {{following the}} construction Ohkouzu Channel and another channel, which was originally planned in the Edo period (1700s-1800s), {{was built on}} the western outskirts of Niigata City to further mitigate the risk of flooding and to help prevent saltwater intrusion into the Shinano estuary. The Sekiya <b>Diversion</b> <b>Channel</b> was originally to be funded by the Niigata Prefecture; however the 1964 Niigata earthquake resulted in the funds no longer being available so it was adopted as a national project.|$|E

40|$|The middle {{reach of}} the Yangtze River, customarily called the Jingjiang River, {{together}} with its <b>diversion</b> <b>channels</b> and Dongting Lake, form a large complicated drainage system. In the last five decades, significant geomorphological changes {{have occurred in the}} drainage system, including the shrinkage of <b>diversion</b> <b>channels,</b> contraction of Dongting Lake, changes in the rating curve at the Luoshan station, and cutoffs of the lower Jingjiang River. These changes are believed to be the cause of the occurrence of abnormal floods in the Jingjiang River. Qualitative analyses suggest that the first three factors aggravate the flood situation in the lower Jingjiang River, while the last factor seems beneficial for flood prevention. To quantitatively evaluate these conclusions, a finite-volume numerical model was constructed. A series of numerical simulations were carried out to test the individual and combined effects of the aforementioned four factors, and these simulations showed that high flood stages in the Jingjiang River clearly are related to the geomorphological changes...|$|R
5|$|Two large reservoirs, Shasta Lake and Trinity Lake, {{are formed}} {{by a pair}} of dams in the {{mountains}} north of the Sacramento Valley. Water from both of these lakes are released into the Sacramento River, which flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, at controlled rates. There, before it can flow on to San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, some of the water is intercepted by a <b>diversion</b> <b>channel</b> and transported to the Delta-Mendota Canal, which conveys water southwards through the San Joaquin Valley, supplying water to San Luis Reservoir (a SWP-shared facility) and the San Joaquin River at Mendota Pool in the process, eventually reaching canals that irrigates farms in the valley. Friant Dam crosses the San Joaquin River upstream of Mendota Pool, diverting its water southwards into canals that travel into the Tulare Lake area of the San Joaquin Valley, as far south as the Kern River. Finally, New Melones Lake, a separate facility, stores water flow of a San Joaquin River tributary for use during dry periods. Other smaller, independent facilities exist to provide water to local irrigation districts.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the flood <b>diversion</b> <b>channel</b> in 2001, to discharge excess water into the Ouse Flood Relief Channel, {{was part of a}} larger scheme, which included the raising of flood banks further upstream, and the provision of a flood storage area. To allow for the drainage of surface water from the Nar Ouse Regeneration Area, the channel below the bridge on Wisbech Road has been enlarged. Part of Blubberhouse Creek has been re-excavated, to create a flood relief basin. Although it will not normally contain any water, in storm conditions where high water levels in the Ouse prevent the discharge of water from the Nar, the basin may be filled to a depth of up to , and will drain back into the river once tide levels fall, normally after 5 to 6 hours. This work was completed in April 2011.|$|E

25|$|The final {{stretch of}} the river, called Friars Fleet, was used by steam tugs and barges {{delivering}} gas water from Cambridge Gas Works to the West Norfolk Farmers Manure Works until 1932. To {{the south of the}} factory, the tidal doors of the Old Nar Tidal Sluice prevented the tide passing further upstream. A wharf called Boal Quay was served by coasters, and fishing boats moored in the channel. With the removal of the Kings Lynn Harbour Branch railway line which crossed a large loop on this section, the river was diverted to a new sluice close to the Ouse, although two-thirds of the loop remains as a tidal inlet. To mitigate against flood risks, a flood <b>diversion</b> <b>channel</b> was constructed between the Nar and the Ouse Flood Relief Channel in 2001, at the point at which they are closest. A sluice was constructed in the flood bank, which is controlled by electric motors, and the new channel joins the Flood Relief Channel upstream from Saddlebow Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Henry Hotspur's speech {{complaining}} about the river {{has been linked to}} the meanders near West Burton, however, given the wider context of the scene, in which conspirators propose to divide England into three after a revolt, it is thought that Hotspur’s intentions were of a grander design, diverting the river east towards the Wash such that he would benefit from a much larger share of the divided Kingdom. Downstream of Burton upon Trent, the river increasingly trends northwards, cutting off a portion of Nottinghamshire and nearly all of Lincolnshire from his share, north of the Trent. The idea for this scene, may have been based on the disagreement regarding a mill weir near Shelford Manor, between local landowners Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and Sir Thomas Stanhope which culminated with a long <b>diversion</b> <b>channel</b> being dug to bypass the mill. This took place in 1593 so would have been a contemporary topic in the Shakespearian period.|$|E
25|$|There were {{plans to}} make the final part of the river navigable again, {{as part of a}} scheme to create a {{non-tidal}} route from King's Lynn to the Great Ouse, which included a marina at Boal Quay and a sea lock near the final sluice. It would have been part of a much larger regeneration project for the south of the town, and the river would have been linked to the Great Ouse Flood Relief Channel, which currently terminates at a sluice a little to the south of the A47 road. Various routes for the connecting link were considered, but the preferred route was to utilise the flood <b>diversion</b> <b>channel,</b> constructed in 2001. This would have been enlarged, and the two bridges, located on Thiefgate Lane and the bank of the Flood Relief Channel, would have been rebuilt to provide more headroom. However, the non-tidal link was eventually abandoned, as there were concerns over environmental issues, the channel was thought to be too narrow to accommodate boats travelling in opposite directions, and some of the bridges would not have provided sufficient headroom. The scheme was modified to include a lock {{from the end of the}} flood relief channel back into the Ouse, with the sea lock and marina being retained. These plans have since been deferred, due to the change in the financial situation and the collapse of land values.|$|E
