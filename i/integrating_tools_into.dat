40|$|Clinical {{decision}} support tools are important {{components of the}} electronic medical record. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} such tools can directly improve patient care outcomes and the performance of healthcare organizations. Decision support tools can be used within reference materials, order sets, electronic alerts, as well as clinical guidelines. The development and use of clinical {{decision support}} tools at the point-of-care offers clinicians the ability to analyze patient data in real-time while making critical decisions. One method of providing such a clinical decision support tool is <b>integrating</b> <b>tools</b> <b>into</b> the World Wide Web. We integrated a freely available online hyperbilirubinemia risk assessment tool, known as “BiliTool,” with our electronic medical record. Integration consisted of embedded a hyperlink to “BiliTool” in a neonatal-specific data summary screen. By clicking the hyperlink, the “BiliTool” website is launched and de-identified total bilirubin levels and hours of life are input by the computer through standard HTTP protocols. Assessment results for these variables are displayed in the web browser. The end-result of clicking the hyperlink is an automated bilirubin risk assessment and suggested course of treatment. We surveyed Child Health and Family and Community Medicine residents who have been on duty in the Well Baby Nursery since the launch of the “BiliTool” integration into the electronic medical record for their use and satisfaction with the automated web-based treatment guideline...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the last decade in the areas of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis technology, both in hardware and software. Science user requirements are so problem specific that currently no single system can satisfy all of the needs. The work presented here forms part of a conceptual framework for an all-encompassing science-user workstation system. While definition and development of the system as a whole will take several years, it is intended that small scale projects such as the current work will address some of the more short term needs. Such projects can provide a quick mechanism to <b>integrate</b> <b>tools</b> <b>into</b> the workstation environment forming a larger, more complete hydrologic analysis platform.

40|$|A Model Driven Engineering (MDE) tool chain {{serves to}} shape the work flow of an {{engineer}} working with the BRICS hardware, software and algorithms. It allows to integrate these ele-ments by using models that describe them and provides an interface for integration. By defi-nition, a <b>tool</b> chain <b>integrates</b> <b>tools</b> <b>into</b> a work flow {{and this is the}} main purpose of the BRICS IDE (BRIDE). In order to facilitate this integration a common language is required. Since BRIDE works with models, the consortium chose to define the BRICS Component Model (BCM) as the mediator between all tools. Each legacy tool that needs integration into BRIDE needs to understand {{in whole or in part}} the BCM and to provide a compliant interface, or the BRIDE developers team has to make a BCM wrapper around the provided interfaces of the legacy tool. The latter approach is more likely, since few or even no legacy tools will do the effort to make themselves “BCM compliant”. Finally, engineers will use BRIDE to model new components using the BCM and generate run-ning systems from these models. Because of its central role, it is of great importance that the BCM is accepted by the whole consortium and in the future by robotics engineers world wide...|$|R
