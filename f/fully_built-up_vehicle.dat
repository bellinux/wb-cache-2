5000|$|The Volkswagen {{assembly}} plant in Brazil was established after the Brazilian government prohibited {{the import of}} <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> <b>vehicles</b> in 1953. Its first manager was Friedrich Schultz-Wenk, who had emigrated to Brazil in 1950 after a brief stint as {{a prisoner of war}} followed by some time in Wolfsburg. Their first plant was in Ipiranga, São Paulo and was a strict Knock-down kit operation. In two years 2268 Fuscas and 552 Kombis were assembled there by hand. After Juscelino Kubitschek's import substitution programs began taking effect, Volkswagen was compelled to open a proper factory in São Bernardo do Campo. Work on the factory began in mid-1957. Originally only the Kombi was built locally from September 1957, but from January 1959 the 1200 cc [...] "Fusca" [...] also entered local production, with ever growing local parts content. In 1959, VW started production at the plant near Sao Paolo.|$|R

40|$|The {{influences}} of structural and aerodynamic modeling on multidisciplinary optimization in an aeroelastic environment {{are not well}} understood. Therefore, optimizations with flutter and frequency constraints were performed to investigate the effects these modeling factors have on various representative wings. To this end, the Automated Structural Optimization System (ASTROS) {{was used as a}} tool to minimize the weight of various <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> finite element wing models in subsonic and supersonic flow under given flutter and frequency constraints. First, the performance of the optimization module was tested against results from other codes on a straight and uniform wing widely used for optimization with flutter constraints. Then, <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> finite element models of various wings with different aspect ratios were investigated for the influence on the structural optimization for minimum weight of the following modeling factors: finite element selection, structural grid refinement; number of selected modes, retention of breathing modes; selection of reduced frequencies to be used in flutter analysis; aerodynamic panel size and placement; splining of the aerodynamic grid to the structural grid selection of extra points of the structural wing box for splining; and number of constraints to be retained. Knowledge of these influences {{as well as of the}} program behavior is important, since optimization can be made more efficient by the selection of reasonable initial models. Also, it was shown previously that modeling has an impact on the results of modal and aeroelastic analyses. Thus, if modeling errors can negatively affect the analyses, a minimum weight optimization can be jeopardized and result in an optimal design that is rather unreliable. In the following, selected results are presented and the {{influences of}} some modeling parameters on optimization are pointed out...|$|R
50|$|This {{sharing of}} models proved unpopular with buyers, {{and also with}} manufacturers, each of which kept the best models in the {{relevant}} ranges for itself. Consequently, the original models outsold their badge engineered counterparts, for example, the Toyota Corolla and Camry outsold the Holden Nova and Apollo seven to one. The last of such models, the Toyota Lexcen (Holden Commodore), was dropped in 1997. Rather than share locally assembled models with other manufacturers, Holden, Ford, and Toyota decided to import <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> models from subsidiaries elsewhere in the world, mainly Europe and Japan. Mitsubishi Motors did not share models with other manufacturers {{during the period of}} the plan and ended Australian manufacturing in 2008; Nissan ended car manufacturing in Australia completely in 1994.|$|R

25|$|In 1982, {{a license}} & Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) was signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd, and Suzuki of Japan. At first, Maruti Suzuki was mainly an {{importer}} of cars. In India's closed market, Maruti received {{the right to}} import 40,000 <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> Suzukis {{in the first two}} years, and even after that the early goal was to use only 33% indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were also some concerns that the Indian market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki, with the government even considering adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost sales. Finally, in 1983, the Maruti 800 was released. This 796 cc hatchback was based on the SS80 Suzuki Alto and was India’s first affordable car. Initial product plan was 40% saloons, and 60% Maruti Van. Local production commenced in December 1983. In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was released and the installed capacity of the plant in Gurgaon reached 40,000 units.|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{goal of the}} Motor Industry Development Program was to {{help the}} automotive industry in South Africa adjust to trade liberalization and become internationally competitive. In simple terms, it consists of an import/export complementation arrangement, whereby the local value-added of components or <b>built-up</b> <b>vehicles</b> exported earns credits {{that can be used}} to rebate import duties on components and vehicles. This study provides a first attempt at a quantitative analysis of the Motor Industry Development Program using the difference-in-difference methodology, in order to assess to what extent the program was effective in improving South Africa's automotive export performance during 1996 - 2006. The authors take a two-tier approach. First, they perform a comparative study using different manufacturing sectors within South Africa; second, they apply this methodology to analyze South Africa and a number of comparator countries that are automotive producers and exporters. The analysis finds that the impact of the program on automotive exports in South Africa is positive and significant. In particular, (i) the largest response to the program in terms of improved manufacturing exports occurs with a delay after the adoption of the law, suggesting that exports need time to fully react to the incentives; and (ii) in turn, the effectiveness of the tax incentives fades in time, reaffirming the common belief that tax incentives may affect some business decisions particularly in the short run, but they are not a primary consideration for investors in the long run.

50|$|Beginning in 1971, the {{government}} (along with private organizations representing the automotive industry) began {{an effort to}} increase the localization effort {{as a result of}} an ever increasing trade deficit. Many new parts manufacturers and assemblers had sprouted, but a proliferation of models and versions hindered economies of scale. As a reaction, the Thai government increased tariffs on completely <b>built-up</b> (CBU) <b>vehicles</b> and began a graduated increase in the local parts content regulations (up to 25 percent in 1975). A moratorium on new assemblers was also implemented, as were limits on the number of models offered. As manufacturers quickly began circumventing the model limits, these rules were abandoned before they could have any real effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{motor vehicle}} {{industry}} in the Philippines is regulated and protected by the provisions of development programs for cars, commercial vehicles, and motorcycles. Each program virtually prohibits the import of completely <b>built-up</b> <b>vehicles,</b> specifies minimum local content requirements for vehicles assembled in the country from imported completely knocked-down kits, and requires that firms assembling kits export to earn foreign exchange {{to cover the cost}} of the kits. Similar protective regimes have existed in a number of countries, especially in Latin America. The author develops a model to illustrate the economic impact and welfare cost of import prohibitions, local content requirements, and export requirements. She applies that model to Philippine data. Her results indicate that the protective regime in the Philippines imposes substantial costs on consumers and encourages the allocation of resources to relatively high-cost activities. Eliminating all of the restrictions overnight may lead to adjustment problems, but gradual liberalization could limit these problems. The proportion of domestic content required, the percentage of compensatory exports required for kits, and the tariff rates on kits could be lowered in stages, according to a preannounced schedule, to allow gradual adjustment. The prohibition on imports of assembled vehicles could be replaced by a tariff and phased out gradually. To avoid proportionately more protection of the assembly industry, the tariff on finished autos could be phased out more quickly than the other tariffs, to avoid sending false signals to the domestic industry about the direction of adjustment. To avoid increasing the effective rate of protection on assembly operations during liberalization, elimination of the domestic content and compensatory export requirements should be accompanied by decreases in the tariff rates on assembled vehicles.

40|$|Tripoli is {{the western}} capital of Libya and, {{is the largest}} urban centre in the whole country. The old city has evolved since Phoenician times, but grew {{gradually}} during the Roman and the Arab rules. It reached its ultimate stage of urban development {{at the end of}} the Ottoman rule, when the walled town of Tripoli was a <b>fully</b> <b>built-up</b> area. The urban development, of new Tripoli was initiated during the Italian rule when the central business district and part of the middle zone were developed for commercial and residential uses After the Independence of the country (1951) and recent oil development. The city began to experience a vast and rapid growth owing to various economic and social forces. Between 1954 and 1964 it nearly doubled in population partly through in-migration and partly through natural increase. Tripoli has important political and economic functions. The first is derived from the fact that the city is the western capital and the administrative centre of the Mugataa of Tripoli. The economic function is stronger than the political one, the growth of the shopping centre and central business district, together with the emergence of various industries within the city, are its most striking features. As a result of its growth, the city has begun to experience serious problems of transportation and traffic flow, shortage of housing, rise of rents, the emergence of the Shanty Town and other serious urban problems. Thus city planning and municipal programmes are of crucial importance to the city, in order to cope with the rapid growth of the population and expansion of housing development as well as to create better urban facilities and amenities "Mugataa" to indicate the province.
