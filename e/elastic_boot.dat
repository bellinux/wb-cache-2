5000|$|For {{everyday}} work wear, in environments or occasions {{where the}} CF greens {{would not be}} appropriate, personnel were issued the Work Dress uniform. This consisted of rifle-green work trousers; a zippered rifle-green work jacket; a [...] "lagoon green" [...] work shirt; and beret. The jacket collar was worn open; the shirt was either worn with a tie, or with the collar open and over the jacket collar. For a brief period in the 1980s, ascots or dickeys in regimental or branch colours were worn inside the open shirt collar. Army field units normally wore combat boots with work dress, [...] "blousing" [...] the trousers with <b>elastic</b> <b>boot</b> bands. Many Army regiments wore regimental shoulder flashes on the work dress jacket.|$|E
50|$|Charles Goodyear's {{development}} of vulcanised rubber enabled {{the invention of}} the <b>elastic</b> gusset <b>boot.</b> The advantage of elasticised boots meant they could be easily removed and put on again. By the late 1840s, the fashion began to catch on. This became a prominent style in the West until the onset of World War I.|$|R

60|$|Cornelius Doyle is {{an elder}} {{of the small}} wiry type, with a hardskinned, rather worried face, clean shaven except for sandy {{whiskers}} blanching into a lustreless pale yellow and quite white at the roots. His dress {{is that of a}} country-town titan of business: that is, an oldish shooting suit, and <b>elastic</b> sided <b>boots</b> quite unconnected with shooting. Feeling shy with Broadbent, he is hasty, which is his way of trying to appear genial.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design is}} {{credited}} to Queen Victoria's shoemaker Joseph Sparkes-Hall. The shoemaker certainly claimed {{it as his}} own, patenting the design in 1851 and citing his royal wearer, saying: [...] "She Victoria walks in them daily and thus gives the strongest proof of the value she attaches to the invention". In his advertising of the period, he refers to the boot as J. Sparkes-Hall's Patent <b>Elastic</b> Ankle <b>Boots.</b> The boot became popular for horse riding as well as walking.|$|R
50|$|On February 22, 1841, part of Chelsea was annexed by Saugus, Massachusetts. On March 19, 1846, North Chelsea, which {{consists}} of present-day Revere and Winthrop was established as a separate town. Reincorporated as a city in 1857, Chelsea developed as an industrial center and by mid-century had become a powerhouse in wooden sailing ship construction. As the century wore on, steam power began to overtake {{the age of the}} sail and industry in the town began to shift toward manufacturing. Factories making rubber and <b>elastic</b> goods, <b>boots</b> and shoes, stoves, and adhesives began to appear along the banks of Boston Harbor. It became home to the Chelsea Naval Hospital designed by Alexander Parris and home for soldiers.|$|R

5000|$|Non-elastic, ambulatory, below knee (BK) {{compression}} counters {{the impact}} of reflux on venous pump failure. Compression therapy is used for venous leg ulcers and can decrease blood vessel diameter and pressure, which increases their effectiveness, preventing blood from flowing backwards. [...] Compression is also used [...] to decrease release of inflammatory cytokines, lower the amount of fluid leaking from capillaries and therefore prevent swelling, and prevent clotting by decreasing activation of thrombin and increasing that of plasmin. [...] Compression is applied using <b>elastic</b> bandages or <b>boots</b> specifically designed for the purpose.|$|R
50|$|Paddock boots, {{also known}} as Jodhpur boots, are short boots that come just above the ankle, used most often for {{pleasure}} riding and everyday use. They are also required for Saddle seat style riding and are frequently worn by children when showing in hunt seat disciplines because they are less costly for rapidly growing children than are tall boots. They are sometimes combined with half chaps, a type of gaiter {{also known as}} chapettes, for added protection or to give the visual impression of a tall boot. The lace-up style is primarily seen in hunt seat riding, whereas the elastic-sided Chelsea boot design is seen in both hunt seat and saddle seat disciplines. The <b>elastic</b> side <b>boot</b> is also commonly used in Australia as a riding boot and dress boot. They {{are part of the}} required attire in Australian Stock Horse turnout competitions and for Pony Club riding. Heavier versions, such as Blundstone boots, are made for general work and gardening but are not suitable for riding owing to their heavy, deep-grooved soles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} attire of a stockman or grazier is a felt Akubra hat; {{a double}} flapped, two pocket (for stock notebooks) cotton shirt; a plaited kangaroo skin belt carrying a stockman's pocket knife in a pouch; light coloured, stockman cut, moleskin trousers with brown <b>elastic</b> side <b>boots.</b> The moleskin trousers have now largely {{been replaced by}} jeans. The plaited belt is often replaced by a working stockman or ringer with a belt known as a Queensland Utility Strap {{which can be used}} as a belt, neck strap, lunch-time hobble or a tie for a [...] "micky". This attire is still used in Australian Stock Horse competitions. Pocket knives may be used to castrate and/or earmark an animal, to bang cattle tails or in an emergency to cut free an animal entangled in a rope or horse tack. Specially designed and cut for riding, oilskin coats are used during wet weather. The horse typically wears a ringhead bridle, a saddle cloth, a leather Australian stock saddle, which may be equipped with a breastplate in steep country, and saddlebag and quart-pot.|$|R
50|$|The Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC) was a {{national}} program to eradicate bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis that commenced in 1970 after years of local jurisdictional activities. In the 1970s, interest rates soared and the American beef market collapsed causing the beef depression. A fat bullock was then worth less than a pair of locally made <b>elastic</b> side riding <b>boots.</b> The cattle herd was reduced to 21.8 million by 1978 {{in the wake of}} this crash. Roads and communications were further improved {{as a result of the}} Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign. In 1979, a disastrous drought struck and continued into 1983 becoming one of Australia's worst droughts.|$|R
40|$|Electro-Expulsive Separation System, a {{low power}} electro-thermal deicer, {{was invented by}} Leonard A. Haslim from the Ames Research Center, who was named 1988 NASA Inventor of the Year for his work. Sold under license by Dataproducts New England, Inc., it {{consists}} of an <b>elastic,</b> rubber-like deicer <b>boot</b> on the wing's leading edge with copper ribbons embedded in it. Conductors are separated by slits in between and parallel to the ribbons. When the system is switched on, a bank of capacitors in the power supply discharges into the conductors which induces the conductor pairs to repel each other. This results in a powerful force causing the slit voids to expand explosively, removing ice on the wing. EESS is more flexible, more effective, and easier to maintain than previous systems. Potential ship, bridge and industrial applications are under study...|$|R
5000|$|Fair Trade works best, {{when the}} product to which the concept is applied reaches the {{consumer}} as &#x27;directly&#x27; as possible: Hence Fairly Traded condoms are, not surprisingly, {{one of the first}} products applying the Fair Trade criteria of the Fair Rubber Association. Other products include: Mattresses, household gloves, flip flops, balloons, hot water bottle, rubber <b>boots,</b> <b>elastic</b> bands, rubber band balls, â€¦ In its founding year and the first full year of its existence, the members of the Fair Rubber Association purchased almost 150 metric tons of natural rubber under the Association&#x27;s criteria, which means Fair Trade premium payments of almost EUR 75,000. The workers who received this extra money used it, among other projects, to - secure safe drinking water (as a result of global warming previously safe water supplies are increasingly drying up); - arrange for electricity supply to a remote worker hamlet; - pay for a supplementary pension fund for retired plantation workers; - provide help for medical and other emergencies ...|$|R
