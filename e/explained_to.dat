While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War.

5|$|In 1947, Cariappa was {{the first}} of two Indians {{selected}} to undergo training at the Imperial Defence College, at Camberly, in the UK, to attend the higher command courses. With the experience he had gained at the Imperial Defence College, Cariappa felt that dividing the Indian Army during the partition would have a devastating effect on both sides. He <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the hierarchy that without the help of British officers, there was a risk of inexperienced Indian officers taking over higher commands. But his concern was not addressed. During the disquieting period of partition he handled the division of the Army and sharing of its assets between the two new nations as the officer in charge.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual.

Three lawyers <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an attempt to reduce such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E

Madonna <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song.

Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 2013, a Deep Impact mission {{status report}} {{explained}} that mission controllers believe the computers on the spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves {{and so are}} unable to issue any commands to the vehicle's thrusters.

Additionally, the solar panels on the vehicle may no longer be positioned correctly for generating power.|$|E

5|$|One of Metternich's first tasks was to {{push for}} the {{marriage}} of Napoleon to Archduchess Marie Louise {{rather than to the}} Tsar's youngest sister Anna Pavlovna. Metternich would later seek to distance himself from the marriage by claiming it was Napoleon's own idea, but this is improbable; in any case, he was happy to claim responsibility at the time. By 7 February Napoleon had agreed and the pair were married by proxy on 11 March. Marie Louise left for France soon after and Metternich followed by a different route and unofficially. The trip was designed, Metternich <b>explained,</b> <b>to</b> transport his family (stranded in France by the outbreak of war) home and to report to the Austrian Emperor about Marie Louise's activities.|$|E
5|$|Raël said he {{was given}} the mission of informing the world of humanity's origins in {{anticipation}} of the return of these extraterrestrials by building a residential embassy in neutral territory. He stated that certain mysteries were <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> him based on new interpretations of sacred texts such as the Bible. He said that, on 7 October 1975, he was contacted by one of the Elohim, who took him to another planet to meet Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. He stated that his second book, Les extra-terrestres m'ont emmené sur leur planète ("Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet"), relates the teaching he received from these people. In this book, Raël describes harmonious and peaceable beings, who were free of money, sickness, and war.|$|E

In 1785 he was chosen by the legislature to sit on a committee which revised the laws of the state, to modernize them and remove references to British authority. In 1789 {{he was a member of}} the state convention that met to ratify the United States Constitution, in which he <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the convention the meaning and importance of habeas corpus.

5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009). The plaintiff argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. The Court held that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the plaintiff the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the plaintiff had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the Court held that the URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.|$|E
5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} {{source for the}} acquisition of knowledge, especially of factual knowledge, is the construction, transmission and comprehension of explanations. Two distinctive settings in which explanations are constructed are self-explanation, in which a single individual <b>explains</b> <b>to</b> himself and interactive explanation in which several individuals mutually and interactively <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> each other. While providing explanations to oneself might lead {{to the construction of}} additional knowledge by the explaining individual, providing explanations to each other involves forms of collaborative learning. To better understand the differences between and potential benefits of <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> oneself and <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> others, we compare empirical research on both kinds of explanation. The comparison is guided by three main goals. The first goal is to describe the learning that takes place during the construction of self-explanations. The second goal is to reveal how the construction of explanations as well as the learning changes if one moves from a selfexplanation setting to a more interactive explanation setting. With respect to interactive explanation settings, we particularly focus on learning by teaching. The third goal is to uncover differences in the learning between those individuals who construct explanations and those who receive them. Essentially, since learning by teaching has repeatedly been found to promote learning, this gave rise to the assumption that the beneficial effects of such arrangements are due to the successive construction of explanations. In particular, it has been hypothesized that <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> others might be even more advantageous than <b>explaining</b> <b>to</b> oneself. However, so far empirical evidence does not strongly support this hypothesis...|$|R
