40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The size of {{the primary}} lesion and the lymph node metas-tasis are {{critical}} indicators for the patient prognosis. Here we attempted to assess the corre-lation between these 2 prognostic parameters in patients with oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, oral, or maxillary sinus cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 66 patients with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal (n 24), oral (n 35), or maxillary sinus (n 7) cancer. Of these patients, 25 (10 with oral or maxillary sinus and 15 with pharyngeal cancers) had lymph node metastases. We measured the volumes of the primary lesions as sums of gadolinium-enhanced areas on fat-suppressed, spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR) T 1 -weighted images. Histologically con-firmed metastatic nodes were mapped to the neck levels. RESULTS: The tumor volumes were well correlated with the clinical T-category for the primary lesions in oral, maxillary sinus, and oropharyngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers.</b> The volumes of the oropharyngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers</b> were significantly greater (P <. 05) in patients with metastatic nodes than in patients without metastasis, whereas {{there was no significant}} correlation between the tumor volume and nodal metastasis in patients with oral o...|$|R
40|$|Laryngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers,</b> which principally affect men, are {{considered}} rare in most European countries {{and in the}} US. The annual incidence rates for French men, however, are particularly high. 1 Alcohol and tobacco are the principal risk factors for these cancers. 2 Some dietary components and occupa-tional exposures are also risk factors but to a lesser extent. 3, 4 Social inequalities have been observed for these cancers. 5 Regardless of the social indicator considered, studies report significantly elevated risks among disadvantaged populations. 6 – 13 Although alcohol and tobacco consumption are often cited as a {{possible explanation for the}} higher risks among lower social classes, not all studies have adjusted for these variables. 12 Moreover, the studies that have adjusted for them used relatively crude coding and reached contradictory results: some observed significant associations 6, 8, 11 while others did not. 7, 9 Thus, whether alcohol and tobacco consumption totally explain social inequalities for these cancers remains a controversial question. Occupational exposures may also explain some of these social inequalities, but no study has examined this hypothesis.

40|$|Laryngohypopharyngectomies {{encompass}} the larynx with a dorsal covering of the mucosa of the hypopharynx subdivided in {{left and right}} piriform sinus and the median postcricoid area. Cranially, the specimen may include parts of {{the base of the}} tongue and caudally a varying number of tracheal rings. Endolaryngeally, one discerns between (1) supraglottic, (2) glottis, and (3) subglottic tumors. For examination of endolaryngeal tumor position and extension, the larynx has to be opened through a median vertical dorsal incision. For <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers,</b> the larynx should not be opened to avoid compromising assessment of tumor margins in this area. For gross sampling, specimens are cut in horizontal slices. Margin assessment depends on location: base of the tongue for supraglottis, trachea for endolarynx and postcricoid region for hypopharynx. Postcricoid cancers may extend into the adjacent cervical oesophagus. Piriform sinus cancers may extend cranially into the oropharynx or craniomedially into the supraglottic larynx, thereby crossing the aryepiglottic fold. Issues of special interest are perforation of laryngeal cartilages with extralaryngeal soft tissue spread, endolaryngeal extension of a hypopharyngeal tumor that may involve the tracheal margin and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers</b> growing submucosally into the caudal surgical margin through the postcricoid area.

40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (HNSCC) show diverse clinicopathological features and are mostly linked with poor outcome. In this study, we tested if {{the expression of}} tumor growth, cell cycle and basement membrane anchorage related biomarkers allow prognostic and clinicopathological stratification of HNSCC. Archived HNSCC samples from 226 patients included into tissue microarrays (TMA) were tested using immunohistochemistry. Histopathological evaluation and the analysis of immunostaining for EGFR, Ki 67, p 53, p 16 ink 4 and Collagen XVII proteins were carried out in digital whole slides. Statistical evaluation was carried out using Pearson's Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In the tested cohort, <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers</b> had the least favorable, and glottic cancers had the most favorable prognosis. High Ki 67 positive tumor cell fractions were associated with significantly worse prognosis and elevated rate of lymph node metastasis. Both Ki 67 and EGFR expression correlated significantly with the tumor localization. Ki 67 index was {{the highest in the}} hypopharyngeal region and it proved to be the lowest in the glottic region. EGFR expression was the highest in the oral cavity and the lowest in the glottic region. The survival rate of patients with p 16 ink 4 -negative cancer was significantly lower than of those with p 16 ink 4 -positive disease. A significant inverse correlation was found between histological grade and the prognosis of HNSCC.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Eighty {{percent of}} hypopharyngeal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma patients have advanced stages (III and IV) of the disease, and biological markers are required to predict high-risk head and neck {{squamous cell carcinoma}} patients in need of highly aggressive treatments after surgery to improve the survival rate. We analyzed the potential prognostic value of galectin 7 {{in a series of}} 81 stage IV hypopharyngeal SCCs because galectin 7 is an emerging marker involved in the epidermal development of pluristratified epithelia and in epidermal cell migration. METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of galectin 7 was determined on a series of 81 stage IV hypopharyngeal SCCs and was compared with that of galectins 1 and 3. RESULTS: High levels of galectin 7 expression were associated with rapid recurrence rates and dismal prognoses in these 81 stage IV hypopharyngeal SCCs, a feature not observed with galectin 3 and one observed weakly, if at all, with galectin 1. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the immunohistochemical determination of galectin 7 expression in the case of high-risk <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers</b> is a meaningful tool to identify patients who should benefit from aggressive postsurgical adjuvant therapy after surgery, including not only radiotherapy, but also chemotherapy.

40|$|Introduction: {{treatment}} of locoregional advanced <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers</b> of grades III and IV would be surgery and/or radiotherapy. An {{increasing number of}} authors has emphasized favorable effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy with potentiation. The aim: the authors presented therapeutical results of three-year survived patients with squamocellular cancers of the hypopharynx (SCC Hy), grades III and IV, in relation to specific modalities of therapeutical approach. Methods: a series of 207 patients with grades III and IV of SCC Hy, treated in the period 1982 to 2002, was analyzed. Group I consisted of 131 patients who had surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (SUR-RT). Group II included 16 patients who underwent induction chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (IC-SURRT). Group III consisted of 60 patients, who had primary radiotherapy (RT). Group IV involved 29 patients who were treated, in the period 2003 - 2006, by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with potentiation (CHT-RT). Results: three-year survival in Group I was 67. 94 %, Group II - 50 %, Group III - 30 %, and in Group IV was 51. 72 %. Five-year survival was analyzed only in group IIII. The longest survival was observed in Group I - 33. 59 %.

Methods: We retrospectively studied 45 patients with oropharyngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancer</b> and 44 with esopha-geal cancer who underwent NBI-ME from October 2006 through April 2009. The following variables were evaluated: 1) the frequency of SCS contiguous with advanced oropharyngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancer</b> and esophageal cancer, and 2) the influence of SCS contiguous with advanced oropharyngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancer</b> on clinical T category and clinical stage.

These patients underwent DSA {{of the head and}} neck region as a part of their superselective neoadjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy protocol for treatment of laryngeal and <b>hypopharyngeal</b> <b>cancers.</b> Depending upon the location of the tumor, unilateral or bilateral arteriograms of common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and STA were performed. Arteriograms were evaluated for the site of origin and branching pattern of STA. STA anatomy was ascribed to one of the three branching patterns. Results: A total of 25 angiograms were evaluated, including 14 right and 11 left. On the right side, STA was noted to arise from ECA in 10 (71. 5 %), bifurcation of CCA in 3 (21. 5 %), and CCA in 1 (7 %) patient. Left STA was seen to arise from ECA in 8 (72. 5 %), bifurcation of CCA in 2 (18. 5 %), and internal carotid artery (ICA) in 1 (9 %) patient. Type III branching pattern (non-bifurcation, non-trifurcation) was found to be the most frequent (52 %). Infrahyoid branch was found to be the most consistent in terms of its origin from STA. Conclusions: Origin of STA is predictable, arising from ECA in more than 70 % cases. Branching pattern of STA, following origin from ECA, is, however, highly variable.

Singer et al. 13 and Hamaker et al. 14 demonstrated that successful voice restoration with the tracheo-esophageal puncture technique could also be completed after neopharyngeal reconstruction with the PM myocutaneous flap. Others have confirmed the efficacy of this reconstructive method in small heterogeneous patient groups, 15, 16 but few studies have characterized the specific voice attainable after PM flap reconstruc-tion of the neopharynx. Using an extensive voice pro-tocol, we undertook this study to evaluate, in a quanti-tative and qualitative manner, tracheoesophageal voice after PM flap reconstruction and compared this with the voice of laryngectomy patients after standard pharyn-geal closure and voice restoration. METHODS AND MATERIAL Two patient groups were chosen for study. Group 1 (PM) consisted of patients who had undergone neopha-ryngeal reconstruction with a PM myocutaneous flap. Patients in group 1 were diagnosed with laryngeal/pha-ryngeal squamous cell cancer and underwent laryn-gopharyngectomy and subsequent reconstruction. Group 2 (standard) consisted of patients with similar cancer diagnoses who underwent total laryngectomy with standard pharyngeal closure. All group 2 patients had sufficient available tissue for primary closure and no significant tongue resection, oropharyngeal resec-tion, or cranial nerve deficits. All patients in both study groups received radiation therapy.
