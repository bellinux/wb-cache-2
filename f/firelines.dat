5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of <b>firelines,</b> helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
500|$|Almost 250 {{different}} fires {{started in}} Yellowstone {{and the surrounding}} National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed [...] "Black Saturday", more than [...] were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted {{as far away as}} Billings, Montana, [...] to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and <b>firelines,</b> and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over [...] high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of [...] a day, and there were even occasions when more than [...] in one hour were recorded.|$|E
500|$|... 1988 {{was a big}} {{year for}} {{wildfires}} in the western United States, with more than 72,000 fires reported during the year, including 300 rated as major. Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, over 6,000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide, with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone. At {{the height of the}} fires, over 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, {{and by the time the}} fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts. Crews would normally work for 2 to 3weeks, be sent home, and then return for one or two more tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14hours. Assignments included digging <b>firelines,</b> watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.|$|E
40|$|The {{entrainment}} of {{air into}} the bouyant flame and plume above any part of a <b>fireline</b> must affect the air flow at all {{other parts of the}} <b>fireline.</b> Thus the local wind actually felt at any one part of the fire is not necessarily the ambient wind; it is influenced, nonlocally, by all other parts of the <b>fireline.</b> By modelling this effect of bouyancy on the ambient air as a line of suction above the <b>fireline,</b> with a height and strength that varies with intensity of burning along the <b>fireline,</b> the changes in air flow can be calculated for any given shape and size of <b>fireline.</b> To illustrate the nature of the model, a fixed elliptical shape of <b>fireline</b> is examined within a steady ambient wind, as measured far from the fire. A reduction in head fire spread rate is predicted for finite widths of the <b>fireline</b> and, if the scale of the <b>fireline</b> increases, the spread rate approaches the limiting value of the potential spread rate. The model is therefore in qualitative agreement with the basic experimental findings of Cheney and Gould (1995) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFireline {{intensity}} {{is one of}} the most relevant quantity used in forest fire science. It helps to evaluate the effects of fuel treatment on fire behaviour, to establish limits for prescribed burning. It is also used as a quantitative basis to support fire suppression activities. Conversely, it has been poorly used as a key quantity to test the new generation of physical and detailed models of fire spread that have been developed these last ten years. The reason of the little use of <b>fireline</b> intensity by modellers may to be found in the difficulty encountered to measure this information accurately. Its measurement is particularly tricky for different reasons: difficulty in measuring the weight of the fuel consumed in the active fire front, difficulty to differentiate the heat yield from char and gas. An inverse method to obtain <b>fireline</b> {{intensity is}} through the observation of the flame length. Many researchers have established relationships between flame length and <b>fireline</b> intensity. In the the present work, we directly measure the <b>fireline</b> intensity at laboratory scale by oxygen consumption calorimetry. The results are then used to establish a new relationship between <b>fireline</b> intensity and flame length. Different formulations for <b>fireline</b> intensity versus flame length are also tested.

It helps to evaluate the effects of fuel treatment on fire behaviour, to establish limits for prescribed burning. It is also used as a quantitative basis to support fire suppression activities.

The three dimensions of the information permit to obtain the flame length with metric measures.

50|$|Wildfire {{suppression}} is a {{range of}} firefighting tactics used to suppress wildfires. Firefighting efforts in wild land areas require different techniques, equipment, and training from the more familiar structure fire fighting found in populated areas. Working in conjunction with specially designed aerial firefighting aircraft, these wildfire-trained crews suppress flames, construct <b>firelines,</b> and extinguish flames and areas of heat to protect resources and natural wilderness. Wildfire suppression also addresses {{the issues of the}} wildland-urban interface, where populated areas border with wild land areas.|$|E

30|$|We used FSim (Finney et al. 2011) to {{simulate}} the ignition and unsuppressed growth of wildfires starting in the designated RO fire start zone. FSim is a comprehensive, Monte Carlo-style fire occurrence, growth, and suppression simulation system that pairs a fire growth model (Finney 1998, 2002) and a model of ignition probability with simulated weather streams in order {{to simulate}} fire ignition and growth {{for tens of thousands}} of fire seasons. The results of these simulations are used to estimate annual burn probability (BP) and mean <b>fireline</b> intensity (MFI) in raster format. Burn probability is the annual probability of burning, and is estimated by dividing the number of simulated fires that burned each pixel by the total number of seasons. Mean <b>fireline</b> intensity is the arithmetic mean <b>fireline</b> intensity of the simulated wildfires that occurred at each pixel. FSim also produces a vector format geospatial layer consisting of the final perimeter of each simulated wildfire; start date, start location, duration, and final size are also saved to a file.|$|R
30|$|The low 95 th {{percentile}} burning index, flame length, and <b>fireline</b> intensity {{values for}} prescribed fires were {{well within the}} prescription limits set for Yosemite. Because the objective for these burns was to incrementally reduce heavy accumulations of fuels, the prescriptions were more conservative than conditions for naturally occurring fires. Wildfires and wildland fire use fires occurred primarily in the summer; consequently, the mean 95 th percentile burning indexes, flame lengths and <b>fireline</b> intensities were higher. The value of these attributes for wildland fire use fires were slightly higher than for wildfires because wildland fire use fires were allowed to burn over long durations, which often included periods of extreme weather.|$|R
