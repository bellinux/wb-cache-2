5|$|<b>Durian</b> {{fruit is}} used to flavour {{a wide variety of}} sweet edibles such as {{traditional}} Malay candy, ice kacang, dodol, lempuk, rose biscuits, ice cream, milkshakes, mooncakes, Yule logs, and cappuccino. Es <b>durian</b> (<b>durian</b> ice cream) is a popular dessert in Indonesia, sold at street side stall in Indonesian cities, especially in Java. Pulut <b>Durian</b> or ketan <b>durian</b> is glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened <b>durian.</b> In Sabah, red <b>durian</b> is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish. Red-fleshed <b>durian</b> is traditionally added to sayur, an Indonesian soup made from freshwater fish. Ikan brengkes tempoyak is fish cooked in a durian-based sauce, traditional in Sumatra. Dried <b>durian</b> flesh can be made into kripik <b>durian</b> (<b>durian</b> chips).|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>durian</b> is not {{native to}} Thailand, {{the country is}} {{currently}} {{one of the major}} exporters of durians, growing 781,000 tonnes of the world's total harvest of 1,400,000 tonnes in 1999, 111,000 tonnes of which it exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Canada. Malaysia and Indonesia follow, both producing about 265,000 tonnes each. Of this, Malaysia exported 35,000 tonnes in 1999. Chantaburi in Thailand each year holds the World <b>Durian</b> Festival in early May. This single province is responsible for half of the <b>durian</b> production of Thailand. In the Philippines, the centre of <b>durian</b> production is the Davao Region. The Kadayawan Festival is an annual celebration featuring the <b>durian</b> in Davao City. Other places where <b>durian</b> farms are located include Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India, the West Indies, Florida, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, the Polynesian Islands, Madagascar, southern China (Hainan Island), northern Australia, and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, <b>durian</b> {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of <b>durian</b> paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from <b>durian.</b> When <b>durian</b> is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The <b>durian</b> seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked <b>durian</b> seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
5000|$|Students use {{the term}} <b>DUrians</b> to refer SMK Damansara Utama students. This {{tradition}} was started in 2003, by the Class of 2004, as the Young Entrepreneurs (YE) company's name was <b>DUrians.</b> Coincidentally, <b>Durians</b> {{also referred to as}} the King of fruits for which Malaysia is famous for.|$|R
50|$|After {{the gold}} mines were depleted, the main {{economic}} activity of Raub is agriculture. Main commodity crops in Raub are natural rubber, oil palm, cocoa and local fruits, like <b>durians.</b> <b>Durians</b> grown in Raub are probably the best in Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|In 2000s, Sungai Ruan {{produced}} peanuts, dragonfruit and coconut. Best {{selling in}} Sungai Ruan is peanut, during the Chinese New Year, villagers return home {{and brought a}} lot of the peanut for gift to friends and neighbour. In 2009 Malaysia government planning export of frozen <b>durians</b> to China. The projected export of frozen <b>durians</b> from Malaysia to China is between 350 tonnes and 500 tonnes a year. Malaysia exported fresh <b>durians</b> worth an estimated RM18.5 million to Singapore, against RM15.4 million in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Tempoyak {{refers to}} {{fermented}} <b>durian,</b> usually made from lower quality <b>durian</b> unsuitable for direct consumption. Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, {{and can also}} be used for making curry. Sambal Tempoyak is a Sumatran dish made from the fermented <b>durian</b> fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as sambal. In Palembang, Pangasius catfish can be either cooked as tempoyak ikan patin (fish in tempoyak curry) or as brengkes (pepes) tempoyak, which is a steamed fermented <b>durian</b> paste in banana leaf container.|$|E
5|$|The <b>durian</b> {{has been}} known and {{consumed}} in Southeast Asia since prehistoric times, but has only been known to the western world for about 600 years. The earliest native reference to <b>durian</b> is the several bas relief panels of 9th-century Borobudur depicting <b>durian</b> as one of fruit offering for Javanese king, and also {{as one of the}} fruits sold in marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Young {{leaves and}} shoots of the <b>durian</b> are {{occasionally}} cooked as greens. Sometimes the ash of the burned rind {{is added to}} special cakes. The petals of <b>durian</b> flowers are eaten in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia, while in the Moluccas islands the husk of the <b>durian</b> fruit is used as fuel to smoke fish. The nectar and pollen of the <b>durian</b> flower that honeybees collect is an important honey source, but {{the characteristics of the}} honey are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Raw <b>durian</b> is {{composed}} of 65% water, 27% carbohydrates (including 4% dietary fiber), 5% fat and 1% protein. In 100 grams, raw or fresh frozen <b>durian</b> provides 33% of the Daily Value (DV) of thiamin and moderate content of other B vitamins, vitamin C and the dietary mineral, manganese (15–24% DV, table).|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the <b>durian</b> fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating. The traditional method to counteract this is to pour water into the empty shell of the fruit after the pulp has been consumed and drink it. An alternative method is to eat the <b>durian</b> in accompaniment with mangosteen, which is considered to have cooling properties. Pregnant women or people {{with high blood pressure}} are traditionally advised not to consume <b>durian.</b>|$|E
5|$|The name <b>durian</b> {{comes from}} the Malay word duri (thorn) {{together}} with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay). D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated {{on a large scale}} and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the <b>durian</b> that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the <b>durian</b> smelling like the civet.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The <b>Durian</b> Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red <b>durian</b> (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's <b>Durian</b> Theory.|$|E
5|$|In southeastern Asia, the <b>durian</b> {{has been}} {{cultivated}} for centuries {{at the village}} level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century. In My Tropic Isle, Australian author and naturalist Edmund James Banfield tells how, in the early 20th century, a friend in Singapore sent him a <b>durian</b> seed, which he planted and cared for on his tropical island off the north coast of Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{numerous}} <b>durian</b> cultivars, propagated by vegetative clones, {{have arisen}} in southeast Asia. They {{used to be}} grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected rootstocks. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as {{the shape of the}} spines. <b>Durian</b> consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, the {{domestic}} and international demand for <b>durian</b> in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region has increased significantly, {{partly due to the}} increasing affluence of Asia.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of <b>durian</b> to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the fruit is picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly <b>durian</b> fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of <b>durian</b> aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to <b>durian</b> are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) could possibly explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{agricultural}} town of Balik Pulau {{was established in}} 1794 by the British East India Company. To this day, the economy of Balik Pulau still relies heavily on agriculture; Penang's most famous products, including nutmegs, cloves and <b>durians,</b> are grown and harvested in the town. These have {{also contributed to the}} town's growing tourism sector; Balik Pulau's reputation for its wide variety of <b>durians,</b> for instance, attracts hordes of tourists between May and August each year.|$|R
5|$|The <b>durian</b> is a {{seasonal}} fruit unlike some other non-seasonal tropical fruits {{such as the}} papaya which are available throughout the year. In peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, the season for durians is typically from June to August, coinciding {{with that of the}} mangosteen.|$|E
5|$|In late November, Typhoon <b>Durian</b> brought {{even greater}} devastation to the Philippines and {{prompted}} greater need for international assistance. On December11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1billion PHP (US$25.6million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000people and left more than US$1.6billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency {{assistance to the}} nation, {{in the form of}} US$46million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided €2million (US$1.9million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon <b>Durian.</b> The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{destruction}} wrought by Typhoon <b>Durian</b> just weeks prior, preparations began in earnest in the Philippines. Over 91,000people were evacuated from areas at risk, primarily from Albay. Two major summits {{to be held in}} Cebu were postponed {{as a result of the}} forecast inclement weather. In addition, recovery efforts for victims of <b>Durian</b> had to be suspended and all domestic flights in the Philippines were cancelled. Utor's impacts in the central Philippines were extensive, with 30casualties reported and the damage toll reaching US$15.8million. Widespread power outages affected the entirety of Eastern Visayas. Numerous ships sunk as a result of rough seas generated by the typhoon, including a ferry carrying 104passengers and crew. Following the storm, relief agencies began to allocate resources to those affected by the typhoon, in turn also adding to relief efforts for the three Philippine typhoons which preceded Utor. Precautionary efforts also took place in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, while the Paracel Islands sustained marked damage but no fatalities. Although the storm mostly dissipated in the South China Sea, Utor's remnant moisture later contributed in part to Peninsular Malaysia's worst flood event in recorded history, as copious amounts of precipitation fell over a short, four-day period. Eight people were killed by the floods which were worst in Kota Tinggi and Segamat District.|$|E
