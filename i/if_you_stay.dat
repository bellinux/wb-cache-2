2500|$|In February 1998, Allen {{became a}} Richmond-based {{partner at the}} law firm McGuire Woods Battle & Boothe (now McGuireWoods LLP), as head of its {{business}} expansion and relocation team. At the time, Allen said [...] "I think it's healthy to get out of government. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> in too long, you lose track of reality and the real world." [...] According to a disclosure form Allen filed on May 12, 2000, he was paid $450,000 by the firm between January 1999 and April 2000.|$|E
2500|$|... "Right now, {{our minds}} are very fickle. Sometimes {{you like a}} certain place, and it inspires, and yet with that same place, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> too long, it bores you. [...] As you {{practice}} more and more, one day this kind of habit, this fickle mind will just go. Then you will search for the bindu interpretation of the right place, {{and according to the}} classic tantric texts, that is usually what they call the “eight great charnel grounds”. So then, {{you have to go to}} a cemetery, especially to one of the eight cemeteries. There, under a tree, in the charnel ground, wearing a tiger skin skirt, holding a kapāla and having this indifference between relatives and enemies, indifference between food and shit, you will practise. Then your bindu will flow. At that time, you will know how to have intercourse between emptiness and appearance." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I really {{believed}} in the horse. I was going so fast in the last 300 metres I knew no other horse would pass me. I had the best horse and I wanted to show how good he is. His record is unbelievable and he {{is probably the best}} horse I have ridden". Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about. When you're drawn wide, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> wide for a long time, you can run your own little race and not be bothered by anyone and then slot across. It was perfect as we sat behind the pacemaker and then kicked because as Frankie says, if you don't kick at a certain time here they come like arrows at your back". He also suggested that the horse might make a final appearance in the Breeders' Cup Turf, saying [...] "The owner is keen on the Breeders' Cup. It's a month away. If he's in good order, there's no reason we couldn't go there".|$|E

6000|$|... "So am I," [...] said Robert. [...] "It {{seems to}} me that we have a lot of ideas in common. Don’t you think it would simplify matters <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> at Salthaven and married me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Grant is right," [...] {{said the}} storekeeper. [...] "We know Torrance of Cedar, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> here, Larry, <b>you</b> {{and she might}} be sorry all your lives. Now, you could, by riding hard, make Canada to-morrow." ...|$|R
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Breaking Dawn was mixed. Lev Grossman wrote, [...] "First, since there's {{a lot of}} one-star reviews up on Amazon, let me say up front: I loved Breaking Dawn." [...] Cara von Wrangel Kinsey of School Library Journal responded with a positive review, describing the book as [...] "captivating" [...] and noting, [...] "While this novel is darker and more mature than the earlier titles, Meyer's twists and turns are not out of character." [...] The Charlotte Observer agreed and called the book [...] "pretty darned good", but criticized the book's length saying, [...] "I wish [...] hadn't felt compelled to pack so much into one volume. It should have been two books." [...] Mary Harris Russell of the Chicago Tribune also responded with a positive review and hailed the book as a [...] "fun read", noting that Stephenie Meyer [...] "continues to produce witty writing about families, teenagers and popular culture", while Time called the book [...] "a wild but satisfying finish to the ballad of Bella and Edward" [...] {{and gave it a}} rating of A-. An article in The Daily News Tribune said of Breaking Dawn, [...] "Some of the dialog is a bit stilted,... but, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> close to Meyer's rich and prodigious narrative, you too might fall in love with its suspense and moving sensitivity".|$|E
60|$|What is {{the secret}} of the portier's devotion? It is very simple: he gets FEES, AND NO SALARY. His fee is pretty closely regulated, too. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> a week, you give him five marks--a dollar and a quarter, or about {{eighteen}} cents a day. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> a month, you reduce this average somewhat. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> two or three months or longer, you cut it down half, or even more than half. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> only one day, you give the portier a mark.|$|E
60|$|THE ORACLE. My friend: <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> with us {{you will}} die of discouragement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; we will chance it," [...] I said, [...] "on his {{own terms}} of yearly payments, {{although}} heaven only knows how we're going to finance it if the crop dies off. Hudson, I'll give you a small check to-morrow <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are satisfied, but it's fair to tell <b>you</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> and completed the improvements you would get more for it when you held the patent." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There is {{no great}} courage in running away {{when you know}} that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> torture and death are before you," [...] Ned replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come away, Massas, come away!" [...] he cried, {{his eyes}} {{starting}} from his head. [...] "The debbil get you sure <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> up there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{fear for}} me, my boy--don't fear for me; you'll see how I manage her <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> with the circus long enough. Now I often--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>stay,</b> I can, Bathurst. If Miss Hannay {{has been}} made prisoner, I would willingly be killed to rescue her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a good thing <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>stay</b> overnight," [...] said Dr. Reed. [...] "Then you could have two days {{instructions}} instead of one. <b>You</b> could <b>stay</b> at my sister's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold hard, old fellow!" [...] cried Marston, in some alarm; [...] "you'll smash my thigh-bone <b>if</b> <b>you</b> try. <b>Stay,</b> I'll do {{the thing}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can, if need be," [...] {{answered}} that determined young woman. [...] "But I {{admit that it}} would be trying for you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank heaven--no. But {{there is}} no knowing what may happen <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> here. Ring the bell at once, and ask the waiter about the trains." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you: that {{contents}} me for to-night. Now you {{had better}} go; for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} you have come. It {{would have been}} a great mortification <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>stayed</b> away. I never quite {{believed}} you would.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>You</b> do <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>stay</b> in business.|$|R
6000|$|... "The only {{alteration}} {{would be}} that you must accompany me instead of staying here. Even putting aside {{the fact that you}} would be made a prisoner, <b>you</b> would, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> here, be a hindrance rather than a help to the business. Muller would carry it on as a purely German firm, while <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were here it would be evident that I had merely left temporarily, and that you were my representative. That would be fatal to Muller doing business with the French." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have to {{remember}} a little better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> here," [...] admonished Marilla. [...] "There, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get into bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, they won't. They'll respect you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> {{and tell}} 'em exactly how-it-all-is. You've disgraced {{me and my}} children, that's what you've done! If you don't stay-" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can be {{governor}} next year, {{when this}} reform nonsense has blown over," [...] he said. [...] "You can't be this year, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> in the race." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no doubt," [...] Mr. Blagrove said, [...] "that ere long a British army {{will be sent}} out, and the French {{compelled}} to leave Egypt. If I thought {{that the war was}} likely to go on for some time as at present, I should say that you had better leave the service. As it is, you would not be doing much good <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> here, and so may as well hold on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lady Tresham is all right," [...] he answered. [...] "I suppose I {{shall see}} <b>you</b> to-night <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are <b>staying</b> there. They {{have asked me}} to dinner!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing for me, sir, thank you,' anxiously undrawing {{the strings}} of the little bag; 'but <b>if,</b> while <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> here, <b>you</b> could be so kind as to teach my sister cheap--' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm dying, {{as you can}} plainly see," [...] she announced. [...] "My {{days are}} numbered, Louise. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> long enough you can gather wild flowers for my coffin." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lottie {{made her}} way to the door. [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do <b>stay,</b> mother, I'm not going to have you hanging round me all day. I can {{chaperon}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{she said}} at last, [...] "you're right. You only said--I would have said it for <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had not. You're so right, Stephen.... I suppose, poor silly little things, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>stayed</b> we should {{certainly}} begin making love to each other. It would be--necessary. We should fence about a little and then there it would be. No barrier--to stop us. And neither of us wants it to happen. It isn't what we want. You would become urgent, I suppose, and I should be--coquettish. In spite of ourselves that power would make us puppets. As if already we hadn't made love.... I could find it in my heart now.... Stephen I could make <b>you</b> <b>stay....</b>|$|R
