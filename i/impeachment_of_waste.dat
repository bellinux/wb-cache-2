5000|$|At {{the federal}} level, the {{impeachment}} {{process is a}} two-step procedure. The House of Representatives must first pass, by a simple majority of those present and voting, articles <b>of</b> <b>impeachment,</b> which constitute the formal allegation or allegations. Upon passage, the defendant has been [...] "impeached". Next, the Senate tries the accused. In the case <b>of</b> the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> a president, the Chief Justice of the United States presides over the proceedings. For the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> any other official, the Constitution is silent on who shall preside, suggesting that this role falls to the Senate's usual presiding officer. This may include the <b>impeachment</b> <b>of</b> the vice president, although legal theories suggest that allowing a defendant to be the judge in his own case would be a blatant conflict of interest. If the Vice President did not preside over an <b>impeachment</b> (<b>of</b> anyone besides the President), the duties would fall to the President pro tempore of the Senate.|$|R
