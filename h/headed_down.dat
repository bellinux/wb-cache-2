5|$|Arsenal {{took the}} lead in the 65th minute when Jimmy Logie's pass was {{collected}} by Holton. His shot at goal rebounded into the path of Doug Lishman, who was following up, and he scored. Ten minutes before the end, a cross by Don Roper into Blackpool’s penalty area was <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> by Lawton; the ball reached Lishman who scored again to make sure of Arsenal's win.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under way, but the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with cramp, Carragher in particular. In the 97th minute, Liverpool won a corner, which West Ham cleared to Liverpool defender John Arne Riise {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, but his shot went over the crossbar. Liverpool won another corner in the 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> for Cissé, but he was unable to control the ball. Before the end of the half, Hyypiä had a chance to score after running past Scaloni and Harewood, but his shot went wide of the West Ham goal.|$|E
5|$|Middlesbrough, {{also from}} the Premier League, were the {{opposition}} in the semi-final at the neutral venue of Villa Park in Birmingham. Before the game both players and supporters paused to remember the life of West Ham's recently deceased former manager, John Lyall. The first half saw Middlesbrough dominate, but {{they were unable to}} convert any of their chances into goals. They also lost goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to injury. A long pass by defender Anton Ferdinand was <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> by Ashton to Harewood, whose goal ensured a 1–0 victory for West Ham and a place in the final.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December, The Washington Post {{reported}} an incident involving Montanan. While <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods, Montanan {{was approached by}} a Japanese warship, which fired a warning shot for Montanan to stop. After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan. When the American identity of Montanan was established {{to the satisfaction of}} the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding Montanan. The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would have to remain and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|While New Guinea Force {{wished to}} pursue the Japanese, {{logistical}} difficulties precluded this. The Japanese prepared to make another attempt to capture Wau. This time, {{the plan was to}} approach from the north, building a road from Markham Point to the Snake River Valley. From there the advance would have <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the valley to Wau. The 51st Division was earmarked for the mission, but it suffered heavy losses en route to New Guinea in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. This impressed the Japanese command with the dangers from Allied air power. A new plan was therefore devised under which a land line of communication was to be established running down the Ramu and Markham Valleys. In June, Adachi was ordered to prepare to capture Wau. Road construction was carried out at great hardship to the troops involved, but the road was still incomplete when the Allied landings at Nadzab and Lae caused work to be suspended. For the Allies, Wau became an important jumping off point for the Salamaua-Lae campaign.|$|E

5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a driving motor coach, had <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most of Australia, where {{exploration}} typically went inland {{from the}} sea, the Gippsland region was first explored and settled by Europeans who came overland from the Monaro region of New South Wales and <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> to the coastal regions. This could perhaps {{be seen as}} a natural expansion of the first settlements of Australia radiating out from Sydney, but to do so the settlers had to cross the not insignificant barrier of the Australian Alps.|$|E

Colonel Tailyour arranged for more reinforcements to be brought in via helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Having {{landed in}} Darwin, North Australia, she <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> to Sydney, {{arriving}} in March 1932. Her plane was dismantled {{and shipped to}} New Zealand, then Panama where it was reassembled. There Elly resumed her flight, following the western coast of South America. She was presented with a medal in Peru. An ill-advised trip across the Andes followed. The plane was dismantled once more in Brazil and shipped to Germany. Elly arrived in Berlin in June 1932.|$|E
25|$|Two {{survivors}} were guided to William Bradford and the Plimouth Plantation by two Indians {{who spoke}} English.

However, yet another violent storm drove her onshore, and render her condition beyond repair. Mariners and passengers removed to the Plimouth Plantation. There, they were housed and fed for nine months before joining two vessels <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the coast to Virginia.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{made her}} last {{trip in the}} spring of 1865, in command of Capt. Thomas Stump, with Capt. William Gray as pilot, who {{attempted}} to take her above the Snake River rapids to Farewell Bend. She was eight days in making a distance of about 100 miles, then <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> stream and returned to Lewiston in less than five hours. Captain Stump reported his explorations as having been of no practical value; but he had taken a steamer farther {{into the heart of the}} regions lying to the east than any craft had ever gone before.|$|E
25|$|Indirect free-kicks {{can throw}} a defence into {{confusion}} when taken quickly, or in unexpected directions. The third goal of Brazil's 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method. Brazil's midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball {{in a high}} arc almost from the midfield line. It found Pele perfectly positioned near the Italian goal. The Brazilian <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> softly and accurately, straight {{into the path of}} the onrushing winger Jairzinho, who virtually walked the ball into the net. Italy's catenaccio defence was caught out of position here, not only failing to neutralise Pele, but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho. A rapid, daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences.|$|E
25|$|He {{took the}} {{elevator}} to the executive reception area on the third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the stairs to the pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E

25|$|On 16 March Southampton hosted Liverpool, {{and after}} a shaky start the home side went ahead through Morgan Schneiderlin's fifth goal of the season, {{converting}} a Gastón Ramírez cross <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> into the penalty area by Jay Rodriguez. The Saints dominated most of the first half, with chances for more goals falling to Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Rodriguez within the opening 20 minutes of play; Lambert eventually did put his side 2–0 up, with a free kick deflecting off the Liverpool wall to beat Brad Jones. Former Southampton target Philippe Coutinho was the main threat from the visiting side, and after being denied by Artur Boruc in the 40th minute he brought his side back into the game on the stroke of half time. The second half was much more scrappy, with Liverpool edging Saints out and forcing them into defensive errors, but late on in the game it was Rodriguez who scored the fourth and final goal of the game, running almost half the pitch and converting a deflection off Jones {{to win the game}} for Southampton in front of a season record attendance of 32,070.|$|E
25|$|After being commissioned, Wang {{immediately}} {{attacked the}} Later Tang-held city of Desheng (德勝, in modern Puyang)—which {{was divided into}} two parts by the Yellow River. He destroyed the bridge between the two parts so that the Later Tang forces to the north could not reinforce the southern city, and then captured the southern city and killed thousands of Later Tang soldiers, dealing a big blow to the Later Tang morale. He then prepared to attack Yangliu (楊劉, in modern Liaocheng), the ford on the Yellow River that was allowing the Later Tang forces {{to the north of}} the River to maintain communication and supply lines open to Yun Prefecture, in order to trap Li Siyuan at Yun. Both armies tore down the Desheng buildings to use as rafts, and as they <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the river, they battled intensely on the river. When he arrived at Yangliu, he laid siege to it, nearly capturing it several times, but the city's defenses eventually held under the defense by the Later Tang general Li Zhou (李周). When Later Tang soon built a second fort at Majiakou (馬家口, also in modern Liaocheng) to allow a second passageway to Yun, Wang attacked it but could not defeat the Later Tang emperor, who was defending the fort himself, Wang was forced to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|The pirates {{who participated}} in the battle were Illanuns of the Moro pirates from the {{southern}} Philippines. They had raided several coastal settlements in 1862 and the years preceding so many men and women were being held prisoner or worked as galley slaves on board the pirates' prahus. A prahu was a type of large primitive sailing ship, with about a ten-foot beam and usually over forty feet long, they could also be propelled by oars and the pirates armed theirs with three brass swivel guns each. The prahus had crews of over 100 men and were roofed by a bamboo cover to protect the ammunition and provisions from rain and to provide a platform to fight from. Sulu pirates sheltered in bays along the coast during the trading season to prey on merchant shipping passing from places like Singapore, Penang, or China back to the Americas or Europe. In response to the affair, Captain Brooke <b>headed</b> <b>down</b> the coast from the town of Sarawak, in November 1862 to build a fort at Bintulu and release the captives at Mukah. He had with him his eighty-foot screw-steamer named Rainbow, armed with two 9-pounder cannons, one 12-pounder and one 4-pounder, the latter two were meant to be offloaded for use at the fort. There was also a gunboat named Jolly Bachelor, under the command of a Captain Hewat, and armed with two brass 6-pounder guns and two small swivels.|$|E
