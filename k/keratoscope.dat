50|$|A <b>keratoscope,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Placido's disk, is an ophthalmic instrument {{used to assess}} the shape of the anterior surface of the cornea. A series of concentric rings is projected onto the cornea and their reflection viewed by the examiner through a small hole in the centre of the disk. A regular-shaped cornea should show equally spaced symmetric reflections. If the patient is suffering from astigmatism or from a corneal dystrophy, the rings will be distorted.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an adaptive and multi-scale algorithm for the parsimonious {{fit of the}} corneal surface data that allows to adapt the number of functions used in the reconstruction to the conditions of each cornea. The method implements also a dynamical selection of the parameters and the management of noise. It {{can be used for}} the real-time reconstruction of both altimetric data and corneal power maps from the data collected by <b>keratoscopes,</b> such as the Placido rings based topographers, decisive for an early detection of corneal diseases such as keratoconus. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm exhibits a steady exponential error decay, independently of the level of aberration of the cornea. The complexity of each anisotropic gaussian basis functions in the functional representation is the same, but their parameters vary to fit the current scale. This scale is determined only by the residual errors and not by the number of the iteration. Finally, the position and clustering of their centers, as well as the size of the shape parameters, provides an additional spatial information about the regions of higher irregularity. These results are compared with the standard approximation procedures based on the Zernike polynomials expansions. Comment: 19 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{introduce}} an iterative, multiscale {{procedure that}} allows for better reconstruction of {{the shape of the}} anterior surface of the cornea from altimetric data collected by a corneal topographer. Methods: The report describes, first, an adaptive, multiscale mathematical algorithm for the parsimonious fit of the corneal surface data that adapts the number of functions used in the reconstruction to the conditions of each cornea. The method also implements a dynamic selection of the parameters and the management of noise. Then, several numerical experiments are performed, comparing it with the results obtained by the standard Zernike-based procedure. Results: The numerical experiments showed that the algorithm exhibits steady exponential error decay, independent of the level of aberration of the cornea. The complexity of each anisotropic Gaussian-basis function in the functional representation is the same, but the parameters vary to fit the current scale. This scale is determined only by the residual errors and not by the number of the iteration. Finally, the position and clustering of the centers, as well as the size of the shape parameters, provides additional spatial information about the regions of higher irregularity. Conclusions: The methodology can be used for the real-time reconstruction of both altimetric data and corneal power maps from the data collected by <b>keratoscopes,</b> such as the Placido ring–based topographers, that will be decisive in early detection of corneal diseases such as keratoconus...|$|R
30|$|A <b>keratoscope</b> is an {{ophthalmological}} {{instrument that}} allows for non-invasive imaging of the topography of the human cornea, which is the outer surface of the eye [1]. The cornea is the largest contributor to the eye’s refractive power, and its topography is of critical importance when determining the quality of vision and corneal health. For example, astigmatism may occur if the cornea has an irregular or toric curvature. Videokeratoscopy allows for studying {{the dynamics of the}} corneal topography [2 – 5].|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{analyze the}} factors {{affecting}} data acquisition during corneal topography examination with the Medmont E- 300 videokera-toscope {{and to provide}} strategies to minimize their effects. Methods. Sixty eyes from thirty young adults were examined. A second ob-server registered incidences {{with the potential to}} affect data acquisi-tion. Those factors were correlated with the difficulty of measure-ments as judged subjectively by the practitioner who performed the examination. Measurements of axial curvature were analyzed to evaluate the variability expressed as intrasession and intersession coefficient of variation and the standard error of the mean (SEM). Results. The level of difficulty rated by the practitioner was in general low, with 70 % of the eyes being easy or very easy to measure. For the remaining 30 % of the eyes, corneal topography measurements were considered to be difficult (27 %) or very difficult (3 %). Of the external parameters investigated, only fixation instability (P 0. 001, 2) and the need for head repositioning (P 0. 024, 2) were associated sig-nificantly with a higher level of difficulty, as rated subjectively by the practitioner. Further analysis showed that some external factors, including those previously mentioned and others related to tear insta-bility, affect the variability of measurements at certain corneal loca-tions, particularly in the vertical meridian when related to tear insta-bility and in the horizontal meridian when related to the need for head repositioning on the chin rest owing to physiognomy interferences with the <b>keratoscope</b> cone. Intersession SEM improved when three readings from each session were considered. Conclusions. The level of subjective difficulty found during videokeratoscopy examination is correlated strongly with fixation instability and the need for head reorientation in the chin rest, whereas tear-related events seem to be less relevant in the practitioner perception of test ease or difficulty. Those factors have relevance in measurement variability...|$|E
