5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and {{decisions}} were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had <b>even</b> <b>got</b> to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E

25|$|An episode {{related to}} Brazil {{national}} football team almost made Zico {{give up on}} his career. He made his international debut in the South American Qualifier to the 1972 Summer Olympics playing 5 matches and scoring the qualifying goal against Argentina. Despite this fact, he wasn't called up to the Munich games. He felt extremely frustrated and told his father in dismay he wanted to stop playing football. He <b>even</b> <b>got</b> absent from training at Flamengo for 10 days, being later convinced otherwise by his brothers.|$|E
25|$|On Senior Day, Brad Banks was {{a perfect}} 10-for-10 for 197 yards and three touchdowns. He also scored on two of Iowa's four rushing touchdowns. Iowa's {{receivers}} were busy as Mo Brown, Dallas Clark and C.J. Jones all had touchdowns. Freshman wideout Ed Hinkel <b>even</b> <b>got</b> in on the action, scoring on a 58-yard punt return. Running back Fred Russell returned from a hand injury, and ran for 100 yards in becoming Iowa's 10th player to have a 1,000-yard rushing season. Iowa's victory tied a school record for wins in a season at 10.|$|E

25|$|Their officially {{recognized}} {{commercial activity}} was a fixed-amount {{entry into the}} Portuguese silk trade between Macau and Nagasaki. They financed to a certain amount the trade association in Macau, which purchased raw silk in Canton and sold it in Nagasaki. They did not confine their commercial activity to the official silk market but expanded into unauthorized markets. For the Macau-Nagasaki trade, they dealt in silk fabrics, gold, musk and other goods including military supplies and slavery. Sometimes, they <b>even</b> <b>got</b> involved in Spanish trade, prohibited by the kings of Spain and Portugal, and antagonized the Portuguese traders.|$|E
25|$|For the 1905–06 season, Taylor {{played a}} handful of games for Portage la Prairie in Manitoba. Several teams in the new International Professional Hockey League tried to get Taylor to join them, {{including}} Sault Ste.

But in February 1906 he ended up reuniting with Forrester on the Portage Lake team, based in Houghton, Michigan. The team won the league championship with Taylor playing point. He had started as a forward, but was too fast for his linemates {{to keep up with}} him. Player salaries outpaced revenue in the league and the IPHL went out of business in 1907.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} was desperate in January 1574 with Middelburg still besieged, the Duke of Alba was recalled by the Spanish king {{and was replaced}} by Don Luis de Requesens. De Requesens ordered the relief of Middelburg and he assembled a fleet of seventy ships under Julian Romero at Bergen op Zoom in addition from Antwerp, Sancho d'Avila with a hundred ships would join Romero. The operation however was a fiasco; they departed but before they <b>even</b> <b>got</b> to Middelburg they were set upon by the Sea Beggars who boarded all sides of the ships. Not one ship managed to make it to Middelburg and this was a huge blow to the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|For 2007, Marlin {{returned}} as did Waste Management for 12 races, while new sponsor Panasonic signed on for 12 races as well, and veteran crew chief Slugger Labbe handled the team. After a 2007 season filled with struggles and a best finish of 13th, in July Marlin {{was to be}} replaced by Regan Smith, who had previously been co-piloting the No. 01, {{for the remainder of the}} year. However, upon the merger of Ginn Racing and DEI at Indy, and before Smith <b>even</b> <b>got</b> the chance to drive the No. 14, the No. 14 team was merged with the No. 15 team, and its owner points were carried to the Paul Menard-piloted Menards car. Smith would pilot the No. 01 full-time in 2008 with DEI.|$|E
25|$|However, things {{quickly turned}} sour. Although {{he watched the}} first few races of the 1995 season with envy as Jos Verstappen and Schiattarella {{demonstrated}} {{the promise of the}} new car, the truth was that his funds had taken a battering after the devastating Kobe earthquake. It contributed to Simtek's mounting financial problems, resulting in the team's closure after Monaco. Noda never <b>even</b> <b>got</b> to drive the car; he was forced to forfeit his deposit {{and the rest of his}} 1995 went up in smoke. The Forti team attempted to enter him in the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in place of Roberto Moreno, but he was denied an FIA Super Licence despite his previous experience. He was also considered for a drive at the team in , but the seat went to Luca Badoer instead.|$|E

25|$|When about eighteen, in Treviso, he {{was invited}} to join the quartet of the Tommasini, and was noticed by Morosini, procurator of San Marco, who indulged him in auditioning for the {{admission}} in the Chapel of San Marco. He made a first attempt in 1784, which was lost to Antonio Spinelli. He finally joined the institution on 13 September 1787 as the last of the five double bass players of the Chapel with a yearly income of 25 ducats. He soon became the principal bassist. He later was offered a place by the Tsar of Russia, which was declined and got him a salary raise in the Chapel. He became very famous at the time, started playing solo pieces, which was exceptional at the time for the double bass, and <b>even</b> <b>got</b> elected as of the directors of a musical festival held for the coming of fourteen sovereign princes to the republic of Venice. One of his concertos was particularly remarked by the queen of Naples.|$|E
25|$|Big Machine and Super Machine {{wrestled}} {{the majority}} of the matches against Bobby Heenan's cronies, occasionally with Lou Albano joining them to face Bundy, Studd and Heenan in six man tag-team action. Soon, other masked wrestlers (whose identities were generally obvious) appeared and temporarily teamed with The Machines. On September 10, Big and Super Machine were joined by Animal Machine to defeat King Kong Bundy, Big John Studd and Bobby Heenan. On September 16 the Machines were joined by Hulk Machine as the trio defeated the Heenan Family. The Hulk Machine returned on September 22 and helped the Machines win in the main event at the Madison Square Garden. A few weeks later the Machines received help from the kilt-wearing Piper Machine. On a house show in St. Paul, Minnesota the Machines <b>even</b> <b>got</b> the help of Crusher Machine, pinning John Studd to gain the victory for his team. On October 28, The Machines wrestled their last match under that gimmick, a loss to Bundy and Studd. This also marked the last appearance as a manager in the WWF for Lou Albano.|$|E
25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You <b>Even</b> <b>Got</b> To Do A Thing.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even before}} the empire's {{external}} enemies were defeated, the two brothers fell to fighting each other with their armies. Upon {{the defeat of the}} Prince's forces by his brother the new emperor in 757, Li Bai escaped, but was later captured, imprisoned in Jiujiang, and sentenced to death. The famous and powerful army general Guo Ziyi and others intervened; Gou Ziyi was the very person whom Li Bai had saved from court martial a couple of decades before. His wife, the lady Zong, and others (such as Song Ruosi) wrote petitions for clemency. Upon General Guo Ziyi's offering to exchange his official rank for Li Bai's life, Li Bai's death sentence was commuted to exile: he was consigned to Yelang. Yelang (in what is now Guizhou) was in the remote extreme southwestern part of the empire, and was considered to be outside the main sphere of Chinese civilization and culture. Li Bai headed toward Yelang with little sign of hurry, stopping for prolonged social visits (sometimes for months), and writing poetry along the way, leaving detailed descriptions of his journey for posterity. Notice of an imperial pardon recalling Li Bai reached him before he <b>even</b> <b>got</b> near Yelang. He had only gotten as far as Wushan, when news of his pardon caught up with him in 759.|$|E

Even if he did land safely, agents contended that survival in the mountainous terrain would have been all but impossible without an accomplice at a predetermined landing point. This would have required a precisely timed jump—necessitating, in turn, cooperation from the flight crew. There is no evidence that Cooper requested or received any such help from the crew, nor that he had any clear idea where he was when he jumped into the stormy, overcast darkness.|$|E
