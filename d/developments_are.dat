5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is that, {{unlike most}} major {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions and adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises. As a result, in the 2000s (decade), {{there has been a}} renewed interest in building skyscrapers in Manchester and other cities in Britain. Several residential, hotel and office <b>developments</b> <b>are</b> under construction or have recently been built in the city centre, including the Beetham Tower.|$|E

Surrounded by undeveloped land, it meets the northern end of Dartnall Road at a trumpet interchange, with Mt. Albion Conservation Area to the southeast and the Red Hill Creek passing beneath the interchange to traverse the Niagara Escarpment at Albion Falls. The Linc gradually curves back northeast, now surrounded, passing under Pritchard Road. Immediately east of there, the Mud Street interchange branches off as the route curves northward and becomes the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which descends the escarpment towards the QEW.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic <b>developments</b> <b>are</b> usually {{linked to}} the periods he spent living in {{different}} places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E
5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. <b>Developments</b> <b>are</b> thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E

Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

5|$|Istanbul {{has voted}} for the winning party in general {{elections}} since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general and local election. The city's electorate has also {{voted for the}} AKP government's constitutional reforms proposed during the 2007 and 2010 constitutional referenda. Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected Mayor of İstanbul in the 1994 local elections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25.1% of the vote, winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties. Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as Bağcılar, Fatih, Sultanbeyli and Esenler. The opposition Kemalist center-left Republican People's Party (CHP), currently the second major political force in both İstanbul and the country, gets most of its support from more rural districts such as Silivri, Çatalca and Sarıyer. Urban districts such as Beşiktaş, Bakırköy, Şişli and Kadıköy have returned {{strong support for the}} CHP in past elections. The CHP are generally strongest in the west, where newer residential <b>developments</b> <b>are</b> taking place. İstanbul has 39 districts, more than any other province in Turkey. Since İstanbul is Turkey's largest city and has usually voted {{in the same way as}} the country as a whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party of an election is essentially decided by İstanbul's electorate. Political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the İstanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Due to its electoral importance, İstanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections, including the 2014 local elections.|$|E
