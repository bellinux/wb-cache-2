5|$|Florida {{returned}} to normal peacetime duties in 1919. She was heavily modernized in 1924–1926, including a complete overhaul of her propulsion system. She remained in service until 1930, when the London Naval Treaty was signed. Under {{the terms of the}} treaty, Florida and Utah were removed from active service. Therefore, <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned in 1931 and scrapped the next year in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The {{properties}} of the rock underneath the Everglades {{can be explained by}} the geologic history of the state. The crust underneath <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana. About 300 millionyears ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered the prevalent sedimentary rock with igneous rock. Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 millionyears ago. When <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler Jurassic Period, the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the Cretaceous Period, most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths. The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> first {{acquired}} by the United States, future president Andrew Jackson served as its military governor.

5|$|After Isaac {{crossed the}} Florida Keys on August26, the {{hurricane}} warning was downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} warning, and the tropical storm watch from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach was discontinued. Simultaneously, the hurricane watch on the Gulf Coast of the United States was upgraded to a hurricane warning along the portion from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Destin, Florida. Additionally, the tropical storm warning was discontinued {{from the mouth of}} the Suwannee River to Tarpon Springs. Early on August27, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> discontinued for areas lying north of the Jupiter Inlet. Six hours later, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> lifted from the Jupiter Inlet southward to Ocean Reef, including Lake Okeechobee. At 1500UTC, all of the remaining watches and warnings for South Florida were cancelled. On August28, the tropical storm warning in the Florida Panhandle was discontinued for areas east of Destin. By 1500UTC on August29, all tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings were no longer in effect for the state of Florida.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Before 1952, {{the entire}} State of <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> under the {{jurisdiction}} of one diocese, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Augustine.

Today, these once remote areas are thriving cities. Dozens of Catholic churches, schools and cemeteries built on the land purchased by Hurley dot these areas.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only <b>Florida</b> <b>was</b> not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E
