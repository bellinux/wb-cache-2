5|$|In 1950, Kennan {{left the}} Department of State—except for two brief ambassadorial stints in Moscow and Yugoslavia—and became a realist critic of U.S. foreign policy. He {{continued}} to analyze international affairs as {{a faculty member}} of the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> from 1956 until his death at age 101.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Ward's DSIR {{fellowship}} {{was coming}} to an end. Pryce had become a visiting professor at the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> in Princeton, New Jersey, and Ward's colleagues P. T. Matthews and Abdus Salam were visiting members there in the 1950–1951 academic year. Through them, he was able to secure a $3,000 membership for the 1951–1952 academic year. It was at Princeton that he was introduced to the Ising Model, and met Mark Kac from Cornell University, with whom he would collaborate on an exact solution of the Ising model using a combinatorial method. His joint work with Kac on the Ising Model gave rise to what is now being called the Kac-Ward operator. When his membership ended he worked for the Bell Laboratories in 1952 and 1953. He then accepted an offer of a lectureship at the University of Adelaide from Bert Green, where he worked for a year before taking up another membership at the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Széchenyi István College <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Studies</b> {{was founded}} by 30 {{students}} on 22 February 1987. The college was named after István Széchenyi, {{one of the greatest}} statesmen in Hungarian history as a tribute to the renowned politician, theorist, and writer. The college was soon officially acknowledged by the Karl Marx University as one of its colleges <b>for</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>studies</b> along with the Rajk László College <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Studies</b> and the College <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Studies</b> in Social Theory. The Organisational and Operational Rules of the college were adopted in September 1987, when the first officials were elected as well.|$|R

5|$|In October 1933 Einstein {{returned}} to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study,</b> noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, {{as a result of}} their Jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Lem {{cautiously}} supported the Polish dissident movement, and started publishing essays in Paris-based Kultura.

5|$|Part of the {{battlefield}} is now preserved in Princeton Battlefield State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another section of {{the battlefield}} adjacent to the state park is embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study,</b> which owns the property, is planning a housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land's significance. Several national and local preservation organizations are working to prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton Battlefield Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the Civil War Trust announced they will purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study.</b> Seven of the planned single family dwellings will be replaced with townhouses. In total, 16 housing units will be constructed. The compromise is subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.|$|E

5|$|After Fermi died in 1954, the Marshalls separated. John Marshall {{returned}} to the Los Alamos Laboratory, while Leona, now effectively a single mother, became {{a fellow at the}} Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> in Princeton, New Jersey in 1957. The following year she became a fellow at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, {{at a time when the}} focus of research in physics was shifting away from the nucleus and towards elementary particles. In 1960, she joined New York University as an associate professor of physics. She became a professor in 1962.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Foreign Service, he wrote {{an account of}} the end of the Soviet Union titled Autopsy on an Empire, {{followed}} by {{an account of the}} end of the Cold War titled Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended, establishing his reputation as a historian. He joined the faculty of the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> and he went on to teach diplomacy at several New England colleges. He and his wife Rebecca live in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their {{colleagues in the}} United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, Bryn Mawr College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study.</b> Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of the speed of the chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{affiliation}} with the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> would last {{until his death in}} 1955. He was one of the four first selected (two of the others being John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Said joined Columbia University, as {{a member}} of the English and Comparative Literature faculties, where he taught and worked until 2003.

5|$|In Islam: The Untold Story, Holland {{deals with}} {{the origins of the}} {{religion}} Islam. Travelling to Saudi Arabia, he visits Arabian Bedouins to hear their orthodox Islamic accounts of the religion's origins. Holland then talks to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a practising Muslim who teaches Islamic studies at the George Washington University, Washington D.C., and Patricia Crone, a non-Muslim historian of Islamic history at the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study,</b> Princeton. The former defends the orthodox Islamic account of the faith's history, citing its development within oral history, but Crone challenges the reliability of oral history, and therefore the traditional account.|$|E
5|$|Kennan lost {{influence}} with Acheson, who {{in any case}} relied much less on his staff than Marshall had. Kennan resigned as director of policy planning in December 1949 but stayed in the department as counselor until June 1950. In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much {{more comfortable with the}} calculus of military power. Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer's {{achievements}} in physics included the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, {{work on the}} theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and the first prediction of quantum tunneling. With his students he also made important contributions to the modern theory of neutron stars and black holes, {{as well as to}} quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays. As a teacher and promoter of science, he is remembered as a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s. After World War II, he became director of the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|The next {{computer}} that von Neumann designed was the IAS machine at the Institute <b>for</b> <b>Advanced</b> <b>Study</b> in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were {{designed and built}} at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed the defense computer include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and {{formed the basis for}} the commercially successful IBM 704.|$|E
