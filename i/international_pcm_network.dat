50|$|The AL-FIU {{contained}} 8 simplex {{groups of}} 96 lines each, {{referred to as}} Analog Line Units (ALUs), controlled by a redundant controller, the Analog Control Unit (ACU). The 96 lines within each ALU were housed on 12 circuit packs of eight line circuits. These 12 circuit packs were electrically grouped into four groups of three cards, where each group of three cards shared a serial 24 timeslot PCM group. The timeslot assignment capabilities of the codec were used to manage timeslots within the PCM group. The ACU contained a timeslot selection circuit that could select the same timeslot from up to eight <b>PCM</b> groups, (i.e. <b>network</b> timeslot 0-7 would select <b>PCM</b> timeslot 0, <b>network</b> timeslot 8-15 would select PCM timeslot 1, etc., giving eight opportunities for PCM timeslot 0 to connect to network). Since the same timeslot could be selected only eight times out of thirty-two possible candidates, the overall concentration was four to one. A later generation expanded the number of ALUs to twelve or sixteen, as appropriate, giving larger effective concentration.|$|R

For the <b>International</b> Space Station, <b>PCM</b> is melted by heaters {{just prior to the}} payload translation to the worksite when power is available. When power is cut off during the six-hour translation, the PCM releases its latent heat to make up the heat loss from the radiator(s) to space. For the interplanetary Probe, PCM is melted by heaters just prior to separation from the orbiter when power is available from the orbiter power system.

This is a result of both the growing acceptance within the community of the application of the technology, the availability of suitable hardware and the desire for increased parameters/higher data rates that PCM is unable to accommodate. However, migrating from an existing <b>PCM</b> based <b>networked</b> system to Ethernet is not typically just a case of exchanging the necessary hardware. There can be a range of other issues that require addressing such as ensuring determinism and realizing previous investment in hardware - this paper highlights and discusses several of these. This paper presents a case study of an FTI application on the Embraer Legacy 500 where a hybrid PCM and Ethernet configuration was implemented. One reason for this configuration was that it was necessary to prove to the Brazilian Aeronautical Agency that the data acquired using an Ethernet system was as reliable as that acquired using PCM. An additional reason was that such a system was seen as a safe stepping stone to a full Ethernet system for programs in the near future which are planning to fully migrate to an Ethernet architecture...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceA {{simplified}} <b>PCM</b> wallboard {{model is}} coupled to an existing design-oriented model of multi-zone buildings. Using a reference model and a basic simulation configuration, {{the accuracy of}} the resulting PCM wallboard-building thermal design tool is evaluated. A new performance indicator, called PCM utilization factor, is then proposed in order to estimate the thermal efficiency of using PCM wallboards in buildings. Using this PCM Utilization factor and a degrees-hours indicator, the ability of the PCM wallboard-building thermal design tool to evaluate the effect of PCM wallboards on heating loads and summer thermal comfort in the early design phase of a project is examined in two real case studies: a family house project and an existing office building. The user-friendliness of this design tool, and the short calculation times it leads to when performing a year-long simulation using a standard office computer, make it a well-adapted tool for sensibility studies or multi-criterion optimization for buildings that contain PCM wallboards...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceProteochemometric (<b>PCM)</b> is an {{approach}} for bioactivity predictive modeling which models {{the relationship between}} protein and chemical information. Gaussian Processes (GP), based on Bayesian inference, provide the most objective estimation of the uncertainty in predictions, thus permitting {{the evaluation of the}} applicability domain (AD) of the model. Furthermore, the experimental error on bioactivities measurements can be used as input for this probabilistic model. In this study, we apply GP implemented with a panel of kernels on three various (and multispecies) PCM datasets. The first dataset consisted of information from 8 human and rat adenosine receptors with a number of small molecule ligands and their binding affinity. The second consisted of the catalytic activity of four dengue virus NS 3 proteases on 56 small peptides. Finally, we have gathered bioactivity information of small molecule ligands on 91 aminergic GPCRs from 9 different species, leading to a dataset of 24, 593 datapoints with a matrix completeness of only 2. 43 %. GP models trained on these datasets are statistically sound, at the same level of statistical significance as Support Vector Machines (SVM), with R 2 0 values on the external dataset ranging from 0. 68 to 0. 92, and RMSEP values close to the experimental error. Furthermore, the best GP models obtained with the Normalized Polynomial and radial kernels provide intervals of confidence for the predictions in agreement with the cumulative Gaussian distribution. GP models were also interpreted on the basis of individual targets and of ligand descriptors. In the dengue dataset, the model interpretation in terms of the amino-acid positions in the tetra-peptide ligands gave biologically meaningful results...|$|R

To date there hasn’t been {{a means for}} creating a FC node connection between an airborne network and a ground based FC network or for creating a reliable high-speed Ethernet connection between air and ground. Ethernet connections have had some success by using the IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN for these types of connections; however, these connections suffer from many inherent problems using this standard. Problems include the lack of telemetry spectrum control, security validation, high-speed data transfer efficiency, and channel acquisition time. This paper will describe a methodology that utilizes the IRIG- 106 PCM standard for communicating between aircraft and ground-based <b>networks.</b> <b>PCM</b> can solve the aforementioned problems and it enables the user {{to take advantage of}} the many ARTM advances in PCM telemetry technology [1].

The CH- 53 K Heavy Lift Replacement (HLR) Program is an example in which the instrumentation data requirements have increased significantly over previous helicopter programs and necessitated {{the introduction of new}} technologies and capabilities. The CH- 53 K Program utilizes a hybrid system architecture that combines the benefits of legacy <b>PCM</b> and modern <b>networked</b> system architectures. The system provides for maintaining the required system-wide synchronized sampling capabilities, while providing real-time data access and system control over a vehicle network. Serial Streaming Telemetry (SST) -to-vNET Adapters are employed to enable many of these capabilities.

40|$|To support data {{intensive}} cluster computing, it {{is increasingly}} important that node virtual memory (VM) systems make effective use of available fast storage devices for swap or temporary file space. Nswap 2 L is a novel system that transparently manages a heterogeneous set of storage options commonly found in clusters, including node RAM, disk, flash SSD, <b>PCM,</b> or <b>network</b> storage devices. Nswap 2 L implements a two-level device driver interface. At the top level, it appears to node operating systems (OSs) as a single, fast, random access device that can be added as a swap partition on cluster nodes. It transparently manages the underlying heterogeneous storage devices, including its own implementation of Network RAM, to which swapped out data are stored. It implements data placement, migration, and prefetching policies that choose which underlying physical devices store swapped-out page data. Its policies incorporate information about device capacity, system load, and the strengths of different physical storage media. By moving device-specific knowledge into Nswap 2 L, VM policies in the OS can be based solely on typical application access patterns and not on characteristics of underlying physical storage media. Nswap 2 L 2 ̆ 7 s policy decisions are abstracted from the OS, freeing the OS from having to implement specialized policies for different combinations of cluster storage [...] -Nswap 2 L requires no changes to the OS 2 ̆ 7 s VM system. Results of our benchmark tests show that data-intensive applications perform up to 6 times faster on Nswap 2 L-enabled clusters, and show that our two-level device driver design adds minimal I/O latency to the underlying devices that Nswap 2 L manages. In addition, we found that even though Nswap 2 L 2 ̆ 7 s Network RAM is faster than any other backing store, its prefetching policy that distributes data over multiple devices results in increased I/O parallelism {{and can lead to}} better performance than swapping only to a single underlying device...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audiencePericentriolar {{material}} (<b>PCM)</b> recruitment to centrioles forms a key step in centrosome biogenesis. Deregulation of {{this process}} leads to centrosome aberrations causing disorders, {{one of which is}} autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder where brain size is reduced. During PCM recruitment, the conserved centrosomal protein Sas- 4 /CPAP/MCPH 6, known {{to play a role in}} centriole formation, acts as a scaffold for cytoplasmic PCM complexes to bind and then tethers them to centrioles to form functional centrosomes. To understand Sas- 4 's tethering role, we determined the crystal structure of its T complex protein 10 (TCP) domain displaying a solvent-exposed single-layer of β-sheets fold. This unique feature of the TCP domain suggests that it could provide an "extended surface-like" platform to tether the Sas- 4 -PCM scaffold to a centriole. Functional studies in Drosophila, human cells, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells were used to test this hypothesis, where point mutations within the 9 - 10 th β-strands (β 9 - 10 mutants including a MCPH-associated mutation) perturbed PCM tethering while allowing Sas- 4 /CPAP to scaffold cytoplasmic PCM complexes. Specifically, the Sas- 4 β 9 - 10 mutants displayed perturbed interactions with Ana 2, a centrosome duplication factor, and Bld- 10, a centriole microtubule-binding protein, suggesting a role for the β 9 - 10 surface in mediating protein-protein interactions for efficient Sas- 4 -PCM scaffold centriole tethering. Hence, we provide possible insights into how centrosomal protein defects result in human MCPH and how Sas- 4 proteins act as a vehicle to tether PCM complexes to centrioles independent of its well-known role in centriole duplication...|$|R
