40|$|In the {{following}} article we aspire {{to reflect on}} {{some aspects of the}} actual world of the <b>Holy</b> <b>Week's</b> Fraternities. In this sense, we will insist in the parallelisms showed with manifestations, equally with religious character, developed in the Antiquity, more exactly in the pagan roman field. For that are cited books of the some Christians and pagans writers. It is emphasized that some of the customs that in the present time characterize this corporations, were originally condemned by the Church because they were esteemed similar to paganism. Usually we forget this indubitable fact. En el presente artículo se pretende reflexionar sobre ciertos aspectos del actual mundo de las Cofradías y Hermandades de Semana Santa. Para ello se hará hincapié en los paralelismos mostrados con manifestaciones, igualmente de carácter religioso, desarrolladas en la Antigüedad, y más concretamente en el ámbito pagano romano. A tal fin se citan obras de autores cristianos y paganos de aquella época. Asimismo se resalta que algunos de los hábitos que hoy en día caracterizan a estas agrupaciones, fueron en origen condenados por la Iglesia al ser considerados signos de paganismo. En la actualidad suele olvidarse este innegable hecho...|$|R
