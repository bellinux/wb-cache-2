Thirteen years after the application of selenium, molybdenum and zinc, significant translocation and accumulation of these elements in the grain were established, indicating a long-term effect of these microelements on triticale plants. The highest degree of accumulation in grains and seedling shoots was found for selenium, then molybdenum, while the detected amounts of zinc were significantly lower. The degree of accumulation of all threemicroelements in the grain and seedling shoot increased as doses increased. Translocation index from shoot to grain at the grain-filling phase was the highest when zinc was used, then selenium, and the lowest when molybdenum was applied. The highest translocationindex from the grain during germination into seedling shoots was obtained with zinc, then molybdenum and selenium. Translocation indexes of the investigated elements significantly decreased as the doses of elements increased. Dry weight of seedling shoots decreasedas molybdenum and zinc in grain increased. High selenium concentration moderately stimulated seedling development, pointing out a high tolerance of triticale to higher concentration of this microelement at initial development stages. Infestatation with <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> was provoked by high concentrations of these microelements in the grain. High concentrations of zinc and selenium, in particular, significantly decreased the percentage of damaged grains, while molybdenum moderately increased their numbers.

A number of VOCs were specifically linked with confused flour beetle T. confusum and not observed with the other insect and mite species. For instance, 2 -methyl-p-benzoquinone and 2 -ethyl-p-benzoquinone were specifically linked to confused flour beetle. However, this study found that benzoquinones were not present in the headspace volatiles of the larvae of confused flour beetle, whereas, 1 -pentadecene was detected in adults and larvae of confused flour beetle. The results of the volatile extraction experiments with saw-toothed grain beetles O. surinamensis showed that several volatiles were detected in the adults and larvae of saw-toothed grain beetle {{but not in the}} other insect and mite species. Some of these VOCs were detected only in adults, and these were butanoic acid, 1 -methylethyl ester and 1, 3 -octadiene. The others were found in both larvae and adults. These were 2, 4 -hexadien- 1 -ol, octane, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 1 -octen- 3 -one and 1 -octen- 3 -ol. The analysis of the headspace from <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> S. granarius showed three VOCs which were specifically linked to weevils compared to the other species.

In the present study, a set of experimental maize hybrids generated using lineÂ ÃÂ tester mating design were evaluated against S. oryzae. Significant variation for grain weight loss (GWL) (6. 0 â 49. 1 %), number of insect progeny emerged (NIP) (17. 8 â 203. 3), grain hardness (GH) (263. 1 â 495. 4 Â N), and pericarp thickness (PT) (60. 3 â 161. 0 Â Î¼m) was observed. Strong positive association was observed between GWL and NIP. GH and PT did not show any correlation with GWL and NIP. Additive and non-additive gene actions were important for both GWL and NIP.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sets out}} to identify specific volatile compounds from both flour infested with the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum and wheat grain infested with the <b>grain</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitophilus granarius. These volatiles could help to aid the early detection of infestation by these pests. Volatiles by the infestation of these insect pests were entrained and analysed using Solid-Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). Several volatile compounds were identified specific to T. confusum and S. granarius, including the known semiochemicals of T. confusum. The T. confusum larvae specifically emitted the volatiles 1 -octen- 3 -one, benzeneacetaldehyde and decanal, whilst the adults specifically emitted the volatiles 2 -methyl and 2 - ethyl- 1, 3 -benzenediols, the known semiochemicals 1 -pentadecene, 2 -methyl and 2 -ethyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinones {{and a series of}} yet to be fully identified unsaturated hydrocarbons.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken following the survey into {{the incidence of}} infestation of stored cereals by insects (Munro, 1940), and forms {{part of a comprehensive}} research programme initiated by that author into the problems of the biology and control of grain weevils. Once infestation of a stock of grain has taken place the rate at which it develops depends on the number of insects present and {{on the extent to which}} the conditions favour their multiplication. Of the factors governing multiplication may be mentioned the rate of oviposition, the length of time a female lives before she lays eggs and the length of her ovipository life. These factors are dependent in turn on the environ-ment, and they have formed the subject of this investigation with reference to the <b>grain</b> <b>weevil,</b> Calandra granaria, in stored wheat. In no earlier work have strictly controlled environ-mental conditions been applied in this connexion. For instance, Kunicke (1936) reports that at 260 C. a female lays 200 eggs over an unstated period of time and that at 240 C. adult Calandra could live for a year. Lavrekhin (1937) states that at 25 - 270 C. the females lived for about 130 days, and that the average rate of oviposition was 0 - 9 egg per day from the 14 th to the 54 th day, the rate then falling off. Since these results were obtained without any precise control of the atmospheric humidity they are of little value. With these defects, in mind the features of oviposition rate, length of preoviposition period and of lengths of ovipository life in Calandra have been examined under a series of controlled humidities for each of several temperatures. In this way some comparison can fairly be made between the effects of temperature and atmospheric humidity separately and together...|$|E

This study had the objective to evaluate the action of vegetable extracts and essential oils on S. oryzae in the adult phase in stored wheat, through the assessment of toxic effect on exposed individuals to wheat grains treated. The biossay was done at the Laboratory of Entomology, DAG/UEM. The extracts of P. nigrum were obtained through the maceration of the grains with acetone and methanol and the essential oils of Ocimum basilicum and Eucalyptus globulus acquired of specialized companies. To study the toxic effects of the extracts on adults of S. oryzae, six concentrations were tested (50; 25; 12. 5; 6. 25; 3. 125 and 1. 5625 %) of each extract, in 40 g of wheat previously disinfectant, containing 20 adults of S. oryzae of 0 - 72 h of age.

40|$|More than 55 % of Africans {{earn their}} {{livelihood}} from agriculture, {{which is also}} the key to economic development of the continent. The agriculture is largely traditional and grains constitute the bulk of food production. Sorghum, maize, rice, wheat and millet for cereals and cowpeas, dry beans, groundnut, chickpea and bambara groundnut for pulses, are most common in Africa. Because agricultural production is seasonal while the demands for agricultural commodities are more evenly spread throughout the year, grain storage becomes a particularly important agricultural activity. Grain storage is done on-farm, peasant farmersâ residences (family granaries), community stores and large warehouses. Since most of the grains produced in Africa are destined for human consumption, storage in family granaries predominates. Unfortunately, the technology and management of family granaries and other storage structures are seriously wanting. These predispose the grains to serious attacks from biotic constraints such as insects, rodents, birds and micro-organisms. The rate of insect proliferation in these storage structures could be alarmingly high, especially with the warm climate in tropical Africa. Annual grain losses of up to 50 % in cereals and 100 % in pulses have been reported, although average losses stand at roughly 20 %. Major insects that attack cereals and pulses include <b>grain</b> <b>weevils,</b> <b>grain</b> borers, grain beetles and grain moths. Pest prevention, early detection and pest control would greatly reduce grain losses during storage. Control methods comprise physical, chemical and phytochemical measures with emphasis on the use of traditional botanical pesticides.

It also attempts to highlight peculiarities to the African storage environment and research trends over the years, and suggests recommendations for improving grain storage in the continent...|$|R

40|$|An {{assessment}} of post-harvest handling practices and food losses in a maize-based farming system in semi-arid areas of Central and Northern Tanzania {{was carried out}} in 2012. Seventeen crops were mostly cultivated by the farmers in the surveyed areas; maize (32 %), sunflower (16 %) and pigeon peas (12 %) were the most cultivated while maize was the most stored. There are at least 7 months between two harvest seasons of each crop; while farmers sold the crops soon after harvest to cater for household expenditure (54 %) and school fees (38 %), the market prices increased significantly (P 0. 05) within six months of storage. Most processing activities (winnowing, dehulling, drying, sorting and shelling) were carried out manually, almost entirely by women, but mechanized processing for maize, sunflower, millet, and sorghum were commonly practiced. Quantitative post-harvest losses of economic importance occur in the field (15 %); during processing (13 e 20 %), and during storage (15 e 25 %). The main storage pests responsible for the losses are larger grain borers (Prostephanus truncatus), <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> (Sitophilus granarius) and, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica). Most of the farmers considered changes in weather (40 %), field damage (33 %), and storage pests (16 %) as the three most important factors causing poor crop yields and aggravating food losses. However, survey results suggest that the farmersâ poor knowledge and skills on post-harvest management are largely responsible for the food losses. 77 % of the surveyed farmers reported inadequate household foods and 41 % received food aid during the previous year. Increasing farmersâ technical know-how on adaptation of the farming systems to climate variability, and training on post-harvest management could reduce food losses, and improve poverty and household food security.

40|$|Plant {{protection}} in arable and horticultural production {{was one of}} the central topics for research in the Federal Programme for Organic Agriculture. Since 2002, 53 projects have been carried out on this subject. After several status quo analyses (2002 - 2004), methods for control and prevention of pests and diseases were further developed and adapted to organic farming conditions. Focus areas included copper replacement, resistant varieties and improved cultivation methods. Plant health issues were also addressed in various speciality crops where pests and diseases often lead to the need to import produce from other European countries (e. g. Brussels sprouts), as domestic production cannot cover the ever-increasing demand; in this area, several projects were set up to improve growing conditions and establish new methods for plant protection. One important focus was the control of downy mildew, particularly in organic onion cultivation. In this case insights from conventional farming were adapted to organic farming conditions, e. g. in the control of downy mildew in summer onion cultivation. The growing risk of the occurrence of downy mildew in organic onion cultivation could be further reduced through the use of new, mildew-resistant varieties. New alternatives to the use of copper, such as plant extracts of sage and liquorice or microbial preparations with Aneurinibacillus migulanus demonstrated a significant reduction of infestation in onion and cucumber. In organic potatoes, primary stem infection by late blight (Phytophthora infestans) was significantly reduced by seed dressing using small amounts of copper (120 g/ha, compared to higher amounts that would be needed for a foliar treatments in the field); this led to yields increases by up to 55 %. Alternative pesticides were tested against the pea moth (Cydia nigricana); here, a pyrethroid formulation showed variable effects and Spruzit-NeuÂ® was unable to reduce pest infestation at high insect densities. The use of beneficial insects and other cultural methods was extensively studied. Covering Brussels sprouts with fine-meshed nets from the time of transplanting until the end of October achieved a 77 % reduction in the infestation with cabbage whitefly (Aleyrodes proletella) during the main infestation period in September. In field trials with point releases of the parasitic wasp Encarsia tricolor, parasitism was up to 50 % higher than in the reference without release; bringing the first release forward in time resulted in a significant pest reduction by about 60 %. Studies on the control of carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae) showed that a major risk factor for infestation is the distance to fields where carrot had been grown in the previous year, and thus field selection offers a major control option. In addition, the research showed that infestation can be limited by growing either early or late sets of carrots. Another project dealt with the natural control of the <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitophilus granarius) by a continuous release of the ectoparasitoid Lariophagus distinguendus in grain stores. This method is intended to be an affordable, easy-to-use and effective alternative to existing release methods.

40|$|The {{input costs}} of {{pesticides}} to control biotic constraints are often prohibitive to the subsistence farmers of Africa and seed based solutions to biotic stresses are more appropriate. Plant breeding has been highly successful {{in dealing with}} many pest problems in Africa, especially diseases, but {{is limited to the}} genes available within the crop genome. Years of breeding and studying cultural practices have not always been successful in alleviating many problems that biotechnology may be able to solve. We pinpoint the major intractable regional problems as: (1) weeds: parasitic weeds (Striga and Orobanche spp.) throughout Africa; grass weeds of wheat (Bromus and Lolium) intractable to herbicides in North Africa; (2) insect and diseases: stem borers and post-harvest <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> in sub-Saharan Africa; Bemesia tabaci (white fly) as the vector of the tomato leaf curl virus complex on vegetable crops in North Africa; and (3) the mycotoxins: fumonisins and aflatoxins in stored grains. Abiotic stresses may exacerbate many of these problems, and biotechnological alleviations of abiotic stress could partially allay some predicaments. Some of these constraints are already under study using biotechnological procedures, but others may require longer-term research and development to alleviate the problems. Despite the huge impacts of post-harvest weevils and of mycotoxins in grains, these issues had not been given high priority in national biotechnological programs, possibly {{due to a lack of}} knowledge of their immensity. The need for public sector involvement is accentuated for cases where immediate profits are not perceived (e. g. lowering mycotoxin levels in farmer utilized grain, which does not increase yield) but where the public weal will gain, and will be invaluable, especially where the private sector supplies genes already isolated...|$|R

Quality protein maize (QPM) {{has high}} {{nutritional}} value, but production {{is threatened by}} downy mildew (DM) and maize streak virus disease (MSVD) among other constraints. There are few studies of DM and MSVD resistance in QPM cultivars. The objective {{of this study was}} to improve resistance to DM and MSVD in three QPM populations. This was realized through ascertaining farmersâ key production constraints and special preferences for cultivars; determining the utility of recurrent selection method for improvement of three QPM populations (SussumaS 2, ZM 521 Q and Pop 62 SRQ); and determining grain yield potential. The study was conducted in Mozambique for DM and in Zimbabwe for MSV, during 2003 to 2006. Surveys were conducted in Manica and Angonia districts in Mozambique to ascertain farmersâ perceptions and preferences for maize varieties, especially QPM. Participatory rural appraisal tools that included semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions were used to collect data. Results showed that farmers predominantly grew open pollinated varieties and fewer normal maize hybrids (non-QPM), and grain yield was estimated to be very low (0. 2 to 0. 6 t ha- 1). Results showed that drought and insect pests were the dominant constraints to maize productivity in Mozambique, while diseases were ranked third. Downy mildew disease and MSVD were considered to be the most important diseases reducing maize productivity. Farmers also showed high preference for high yielding and early maturity cultivars in all areas. Predominantly, farmers were still using their local landraces because of sweet taste, particularly for home consumption and flint grain for storage. Farmersâ access to improved cultivars was limited due to high seed prices on the local market. Research priorities as perceived by the farmers included breeding for resistance to drought, <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> and diseases and sweetness. Generally, farmers showed little knowledge of QPM varieties and the importance of this trait, but they observed that the few QPM varieties they knew had some weaknesses such as poor storability and susceptibility to DM and MSVD which required improvement. These results should be considered in breeding new cultivars, both normal and QPM.
