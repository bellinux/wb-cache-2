The writer decided the lead character should be a female.

The names of the lead villain (Herod) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible.

According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it.

Design/methodology/approach: Corrosion resistance has been tested in the solution simulating tissueenvironments at temperature 37 ± 1 °C by recording of anodic polarization curves with the use of thepotentiodynamic method. The VoltaLab® PGP 201 system for electrochemical tests has been applied. Chemicalcomposition investigations of the adjacent tissue to the retrieved implants have been carried out with the use ofscanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS) Findings: The paper presents preoperative surface treatment and its influence on corrosion and topographicalproperties and it can be useful for implants producers to take <b>into</b> consideration. <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> surface coatingsensure high corrosion resistance of the implants in spite of damage while load bearing and during operation(prebending of implants). Coatings are flexible enough and wear resistant too. Research limitations/implications: The future research should be focused on the evaluation of new miniplatedesign and optimization of the surgical procedure. Practical implications: On the basis of the obtained results it can be stated that miniplates made of stainlesssteel with the passive-carbon layer can be applied in maxillo-facial surgery. Originality/value: The investigations indicate that the deformation of the surface layer does not depend on theresistance of implant to corrosion...|$|R

60|$|Much of {{his most}} {{striking}} quality was owing to the exceptional degree {{in which he was}} alive to the constant tendency of society to lose some excellence of aim, to relapse at some point from the standard of truth and right which had been reached by long previous effort, to fall back in height of moral ideal. He was keenly sensible that it is only by persistent striving after improvement in our conceptions of duty, and improvement in the external means for realising them, that even the acquisitions of past generations are retained. He knew the intense difficulty of making life better by ever so little. Hence at once the exaltation of his own ideas of truth and right, and his eagerness to conciliate anything like virtuous social feeling, in whatever intellectual or political association he found it. Hence also the vehemence of his passion for the unfettered and unchecked development of new ideas on all subjects, of originality in moral and social points of view; because repression, whether by public opinion or in any other way, may be the means of untold waste of gifts that might have conferred on mankind unspeakable benefits. The discipline and vigour of his understanding made him the least indulgent of judges to anything like charlatanry, and effectually prevented his unwillingness to let the smallest good element be lost, from degenerating <b>into</b> <b>that</b> weak <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> universalism which nullifies some otherwise good men.|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} to represent {{individual differences in}} situation-behavior profiles. The model consists of 3 components: (a) q'ypologies of person, situation, and behavior classes; (b) hierarchical relations between the classes of each typology; and (c) a characterization f the person types in terms of different sets of if (situation class) then (behavior class) rules by which the 3 typologies are linked to one another. A data analysis technique (INDCLAS) is available to induce a triple typology model from empirical data. To reveal the psychological mechanisms behind such a model, the classes of the model {{can be related to}} situation, behavior, and person features. As a result, person types can be interpreted in terms of systems of cognitive-affective variables that mediate between active situation features and behavioral manifestations. This is illustrated with a study on self-reported hostile behavior in frustrating situations. According to Bem (1983), the fundamental scientific task for personality research is to convert observations ofparticular persons behaving in particular ways in particular situations <b>into</b> assertions <b>that</b> certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> persons will behave in certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> ways in certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> situations, <b>that</b> is, to construct triple typologies or equivalence classes [...] of persons, of behaviors, and of situations [...] and to fash-ion theories of personality that relate these equivalence classes to one another.

Ancorada na perspectiva discursiva, perpassada pela psicanálise lacaniana, foram destacadas algumas regularidades nos depoimentos proferidos por agentes educacionais, durante palestras {{realizadas}} em um congresso sobre "inclusão e diversidade". Partindo da questão: como os conceitos de inclusão e diferença colocam os dizeres de agentes educacionais em funcionamento?, a análise do corpus discursivo evidenciou a aparente "necessidade" de aplicação do discurso da inclusão como eliminador das diferenças (físicas ou não), o que, imaginariamente, possibilitaria uma prática pedagógica mais justa e igualitária. Trata-se, portanto, de um equívoco de ordem ideológica, tendo em vista que a prática discursiva em questão não visa a incluir as diferenças ou tratá-las de modo singular, mas a criar identidades fixas, conservadoras e repetitivas.
