5|$|A {{secondary}} area {{of severe}} weather also developed that afternoon and evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28. Many tornadoes touched {{down in this}} area as well. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though an EF2 tornado touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> town of Halifax, Virginia, and caused severe damage to homes in the area, resulting in one death. Tornado alerts were issued for Southern Ontario {{as far north as}} Ottawa as well; one tornado was later confirmed in Fergus, Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} Indiana's post-touchdown kickoff to its 27-yard line, and Tech's offense {{returned to}} the field hoping to answer the Hoosiers' score. Two rushes by Thomas gave Tech a first <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> 40-yard line. Aided by a penalty against Indiana, Tech gained another first down in the Hoosiers' {{side of the field}} with a pass by DeShazo. A 15-yard late-hit penalty against Indiana gave Tech another first down and pushed the Hokies to the Indiana 31-yard line. Tech continued to drive with runs from DeShazo, Thomas, and fullback Joe Swarm. Inside the Indiana 10-yard line, Tech was stopped for losses on consecutive plays before DeShazo connected on a 14-yard touchdown pass to Thomas. The extra point was good, and with nineseconds remaining in the first quarter, Virginia Tech tied the game at 77.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech won the {{ceremonial}} pregame coin toss to determine first possession {{and decided to}} kick off to Florida State. Kickoff returner Lonnie Pryor mishandled the football, but quickly recovered the loose ball and carried it to the Florida State 33-yard line, where the Seminoles began their first offensive drive. On the first play of the game, quarterback E. J. Manuel completed a 29-yard pass to wide receiver Taiwan Easterling, driving the Seminoles into Virginia Tech's defensive half. A short rush and a subsequent 12-yard pass gave Florida State a first <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Short rushes pushed Florida State's offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone, but the Seminoles were unable to gain another first down. Placekicker Dustin Hopkins came {{on the field and}} kicked a 32-yard field goal, giving Florida State a 3–0 lead with 11:43 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Šišić {{pursued the}} helicopters, firing {{aircraft}} gun {{in front of}} the helicopters, but his aircraft was not armed with tracer ammunition and the helicopter pilots were not able to observe that they were fired upon. Flying at a speed of , he switched to missiles and registered that the missile seekers had acquired the targets. Šišić fired two infrared homing R-60 missiles. One of the missiles flew between the two helicopters, while the other struck the engine of the lead helicopter. The helicopter was shot <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> village of Podrute, located in an area administered by the city of Novi Marof, north of Zagreb. The second helicopter had to crash-land to evade the attack.|$|E
5|$|Farther to the {{northeast}} in Fayette County, Tennessee, another powerful tornado touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> rural community of Yum Yum and quickly reached EF3 intensity. This tornado was spawned by the same supercell that had affected Memphis about an hour earlier. Near {{the beginning of the}} path, a shed was obliterated and a pickup truck parked inside was thrown 40 feet and mangled, killing a man inside the vehicle. Several other vehicles were tossed, and significant damage to large trees was observed before the tornado crossed into Haywood County. Weakening to EF2 strength, the tornado struck the town of Dancyville, destroying a house, severely damaging another house and a church, and uprooting numerous large trees. The tornado then struck the rural community of Hillville, where two mobile homes were completely destroyed, a frame home was heavily damaged, and a convenience store sustained roof damage. Numerous large trees in this area were snapped, and an outbuilding was flattened. Several other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor damage. Regaining EF3 strength, the tornado crossed into Madison County, striking the Huntersville community. Numerous homes were damaged or destroyed in Huntersville, and two people were killed. A church in town sustained major damage, and a nearby church bus was tossed several hundred feet and flipped upside down. The tornado then exited Huntersville and headed towards the city of Jackson. Several cars and at least 13 tractor trailers were blown off of Interstate 40 by the tornado in this area. One car was tossed 75 yards into a farm field. A rest area along the interstate was severely damaged before the tornado began to weaken and lifted as it approached U.S. Route 412, dissipating just before it would have entered densely populated areas of western and northern Jackson.|$|E
25|$|During the day, a low {{pressure}} system developed across Texas and rain gradually turned into snow {{in parts of}} Oklahoma and northern Texas giving locally {{a few inches of}} snow particularly just east of Oklahoma City.

25|$|The Singapore {{government}} held {{a public}} {{inquiry into the}} accident under Mr. Justice Knight from 31 May to 16 August. The accident was attributed to poor execution of the approach due to crew tiredness, which exacerbated the pilot's decision to touch <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> end of the runway. The inquiry determined that, {{at the time of}} arrival in Singapore, Captain Hoyle had been on duty for 21½ hours since the flight departed Sydney.|$|E

The flotilla then proceeded up the Arkansas river.|$|E
25|$|The {{second wave}} of mission Elmira arrived at 22:55, and because no other {{pathfinder}} aids were operating, they headed for the Eureka beacon on LZ O. That wave too came under severe ground fire as it passed directly over German positions. One serial released early and came <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> German lines, but the second came down on Landing Zone O. Nearly all of both battalions joined the 82nd Airborne by morning, and 15 guns were in operation on June 8.|$|E
25|$|Phidippus clarus {{is found}} in old fields {{throughout}} eastern North America. It lives among flowers, often sharing habitats with the small to medium-sized crab spider Misumena vatia, which waits for prey. P. clarus often waits upside <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> top of a plant, a position which may be useful for detecting prey and then quickly jumping down before the prey can escape. In a 2002 survey of jumping spiders in Minnesota, P. clarus accounted for 52% of the total found.|$|E

25|$|The tornado first touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Kansas-Oklahoma {{border in}} Oklahoma {{southwest}} of Chetopa, Kansas and tracked eastward. It then slammed into Picher with devastating results. Twenty {{blocks of the}} town suffered extensive damage with houses and businesses destroyed or flattened, and some swept away. The damage in Picher was rated at EF4. At least 150 others were injured in Picher alone. The tornado continued eastward, passing just north of Quapaw and Peoria before crossing Interstate 44 into Missouri. This was the deadliest tornado in Oklahoma since the South Oklahoma City F5 tornado on May 3, 1999 which killed 36.|$|E
25|$|The USAir plane touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> runway threshold.

25|$|At 0100 on 1 April 2003, the Marines {{commenced}} their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city's {{power as}} the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around {{and on the}} hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched <b>down</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> hospital entrance {{with a team of}} PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Talil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The Hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch's unit that had been killed or died of their wounds. Task Force 20 carried out the first successful US POW rescue mission since World War II.|$|E
