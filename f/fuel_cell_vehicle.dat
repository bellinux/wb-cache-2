40|$|As the "low carbon, green growth" agenda, which {{emphasized}} {{sustainable development}} through equilibrium between {{economic growth and}} environmental preservation, is propagated rapidly in Korea. Despite this progress, {{it is not uncommon}} for new products made through advanced technologies, such as hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles,</b> to face public skepticism preventing market penetration. Therefore, the factors impacting customer acceptance of hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> have to be estimated. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine whether or not the policies related to these products can prevent public skepticism regarding them. This empirical study examining the relationship between personal experiences related to the policy and acceptance of the innovative products of hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> shows that government involvement in technology targeting and promotions administered by the "low carbon, green growth" agenda rarely stimulate potential customers' purchase intentions.

40|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powered <b>vehicle</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{attractive}} candidates for the future due to its high efficiency and capability to use hydrogen as the fuel. However, its relatively poor dynamic response, high cost, and limited life time have impeded its widespread adoption. With the emergence of large supercapacitors (also know as ultracapacitors, UCs) with high power density and the shift to hybridization in the vehicle technology, fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> are gaining more attention. <b>Fuel</b> <b>cells</b> in conjunction with supercapacitors can create high power with fast dynamic response, which makes it well suitable for automotive applications. Hybrid <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> with different powertrain configurations have been evaluated based on simulations performed at the Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California-Davis. The following powertrain configurations have been considered: (a) Direct hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> (FCVs) without energy storage (b) FCVs with supercapacitors directly connected in parallel with <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (c) FCVs with supercapacitors coupled in parallel with <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> through a DC/DC converter (d) FCVs with <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> connected to supercapacitors via a DC/DC converter Simulation results show that hybridization of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> with supercapacitors with load leveling control can significantly reduce the stress on <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> electrically and mechanically and benefit fuel economy of the <b>vehicles.</b> Compared to <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> without energy storages, fuel cell-supercapacitor hybridization achieved fuel economy increases of up to 28 % on the FUDS cycle and up to 24 % on the US 06 cycle for mid-size passenger vehicles. In general, the maximum fuel economy improvements are greater using supercapacitors than batteries. The simulation results show that the power assist control strategy is better than load-level control for batteries because of the lower losses in the DC/DC converter and batteries, but load level control is better for supercapacitors. The best approach for hybridization of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>vehicles</b> is to use supercapacitors with load leveled control as it greatly mitigates the stress on <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and results in a near maximum improvement in fuel economy and <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> durability.
