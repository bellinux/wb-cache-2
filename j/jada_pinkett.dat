[...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress <b>Jada</b> <b>Pinkett</b> Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks.

[...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E

Many of the actors involved including Campbell, Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jerry O'Connell were starring in their own television series at the time making scheduling their availability with the film difficult. Gellar in particular had also recently finished work on another Williamson-penned film, I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) which released two months prior to Scream 2. She would admit in interviews that she signed on to Scream 2 without having read the script, based on the success of the first film. Craven took their desire to participate in the film despite their workload as a compliment to the film's quality. To obtain the role of Derek, O'Connell and other candidates had to audition by performing a scene from the film where the character sings [...] "I Think I Love You". The cast was rounded out by Laurie Metcalf, who had just finished a nine-year run on the popular sitcom Roseanne, Lewis Arquette, father of David Arquette, <b>Jada</b> <b>Pinkett</b> and Timothy Olyphant in what was his first leading role in a feature film.
