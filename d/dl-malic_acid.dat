Here, the effect of coating of magnetite nanoparticles with organic stabilizers, such as O-phosphoryl ethanolamine, glycerol phosphate, phospho-l-ascorbic acid, phospho-d,l-serine, glycolic acid, lactic acid, <b>d,l-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> and d,l-mandelic acid was studied. Remarkably, this procedure led to an improvement of saturation magnetization in three cases rather than to an unfavorable decrease as usually observed. Detailed X-ray powder diffraction investigations revealed that changes in the average crystallite occurred in the coating process. Surprisingly, changes of the average crystallite sizes in either direction were further observed, when the exposure time to the stabilizer was increased. These results imply a new mechanism for the well-known coating of magnetite nanoparticles with stabilizers. Instead of the hitherto accepted simple anchoring of the stabilizers to the magnetite nanoparticle surfaces, a more complex recrystallization mechanism is likely, wherein partial re-dispersion of magnetite moieties from the nanoparticles and re-deposition are involved.

40|$|The role of {{water-soluble}} {{organic compounds}} on the hygroscopic properties of atmospheric aerosols {{has recently been}} the subject of many studies. In particular, low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids and some multifunctional organic acids have been found or are expected to exist in atmospheric aerosols in urban, semiurban, rural, and remote sites. Unlike for their inorganic counterparts, the hygroscopic properties of organic acids have not been well characterized. In this study, the hygroscopic properties of selected water-soluble dicarboxylic acids (oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, and glutaric acid) and multifunctional acids (citric acid, <b>DL-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> and L-(+) -tartaric acid) were studied using single droplets levitated in an electrodynamic balance at 25 degreesC. The water activities of bulk samples of dilute solutions were also measured. Solute evaporation was observed in the dicarboxylic acids but not in the multifunctional acids. Oxalic acid, succinic acid, and glutaric acid droplets crystallize upon evaporation of water, but, except for glutaric acid droplets, do not deliquesce even at 90 % relative humidity (RH). Mass transfer limitation of the deliquescence process was observed in glutaric acid. Neither crystallization nor deliquescence was observed in malonic acid, citric acid, <b>DL-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> or L-(+) -tartaric acid. Malonic acid and these three hydroxy-carboxylic acids absorb water even at RH much lower than their respective deliquescence RH. The growth factor (G(f)), defined as the ratio of the particle diameter at RH = 10 % to that at RH = 90 %, of oxalic acid and succinic acid was close to unity, indicating no hygroscopicity in this range. The remaining acids (malonic acid, glutaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid) showed roughly similar hygroscopicity of a G(f) of 1. 30 - 1. 53, which {{is similar to that of}} "more hygroscopic" aerosols in field measurements reported in the literature. A generalized equation for these four acids, Gf =(1 - a(w)) (- 0. 163), was developed to represent the hygroscopicity of these acids. Water activity predictions from calculations using the UNIFAC model were found to agree with the measured water activity data to within 40 % for most of the acids but the deviations were as large as about 100 % for malic acid and tartaric acid. We modified the functional group interaction parameters of the COOH-H 2 O-OH-H 2 O, and OH-COOH pairs by fitting the UNIFAC model with the measured data. The modified UNIFAC model improves the agreement of predictions and measurements to within 38 % for all the acids studied...|$|E

Evaluated treatments and initial rates consisted of sodium chloride (NACL, 10 %), urea (UREA, 2 %), sodium bicarbonate (LIME, 1. 68 %), <b>DL-malic</b> <b>acid</b> (MLAC, 3 %), calcium propionate (CAPR, 3 %), and sodium bicarbonate plus urea (LIUR, 1. 68 % + 2 %). Supplement intake was recorded daily and limiters were evaluated over three rates of inclusion, each for a duration of 14 d, {{on the basis of}} intake level, intake variation (cumulative stability), and rate of intake change over time (temporal stability). Data was analyzed as a 7 ? 2 factorial initial 7 days of each period were removed to avoid acclimation influence. A baseline period was observed to ensure no inherent differences were detected. Within the initial rate period, limiter affected OM intake (P = 0. 02) as consumption was reduced by NACL (P < 0. 01) and tended to be lower when limited by MLAC (P = 0. 14) and LIUR (P = 0. 11). Neither monensin (P = 0. 86) nor a limiter ? monensin interaction were present. Cumulative stability was indicated that heifers consuming NACL (P < 0. 01) and CAPR (P < 0. 01) consumed supplement with greater regularity than did CONT. Monensin (P = 0. 75) and monensin ? limiter (P = 0. 76) did not influence intake stability. Temporal stability was unaffected by limiter (P = 0. 43), monensin (P = 0. 69), or monensin ? limiter (P = 0. 93). When rate of inclusion was 2 ? initial rate, intake was affected by limiter (P < 0. 01) with observations similar to the initial period. No monensin (P = 0. 49) or interaction (P = 0. 27) effect was present. Cumulative stability was unaffected by limiter (P = 022), monensin (P = 0. 39), or interaction (P = 0. 86). Temporal stability was increased with monensin (P 0. 05) and an interaction resulted in an increased rate of supplement intake change in CONT when monensin was included. When supplement included limiters at 4 ? the initial rate, Effects on intake and cumulative stability by limiter were the only significant responses.

Physiological conditions affect the yields of biomass and fatty acid composition of cultivated cells {{along with the}} composition of the medium (Patil and Gogate 2015). Schizochytrium is known for its bulging growth rate and enhanced capability to produce DHA quantity when grown on glucose or fructose (Chatdumrong et al. 2007). Excess of C and limiting N in medium usually result in lipid accumulation, however, low amount of N causes reduction in cell growth which give rise to lower lipid and DHA yield. Glucose, <b>dl-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> d-fructose, d-xylose and glycerol have been used as carbon source with successive cell growth and DHA yield of 20 % in the biomass. In contrast, di- and polysaccharides caused limited cell growth (Shene et al. 2010). In a study, comparison of glucose, fructose and glycerol as carbon source give the result of 32.5, 30.9 and 43.1 % DHA in fatty acid composition (Yokochi et al. 1998). The initial pH of medium alter the DHA yield and total lipid accumulation by affecting cell membrane function and the uptake of nutrients. The maximum DHA yield and biomass of S. limacinum has been achieved at pH 7 (Wu et al. 2005). Other determinant is the salinity which regulates the cytoplasmic ion gradient and activity of enzymes (Kim et al. 2005). According to a study, in which different seawater concentrations were used, lowering the salinity from 28 to 18 % resulted in higher DHA accumulation (Zhu et al. 2008).|$|E

All isolates were analyzed by mitochondrial DNA {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (mtDNA RFLP) and a pattern profile was verified for each isolate, resulting in a total of 294 different profiles, all revealed to belong to the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A remarkable heterogeneity of phenotypical traits was found when this collection of indigenous S. cerevisiae strains was screened regarding ethanol tolerance, H 2 S production, capacity to utilize acetic and malic acid. Malic acid, together with tartaric acid, are the most abundant organic acids in wine contributing to its acidic taste. Excess malic acid removal is of enological interest in this wine region. From the screening of 294 strains, only 3 (318, 319 and 320) showed enhanced malic acid consumption in combination with other desirable phenotypic traits. Their fermentative profiles in a synthetic must medium containing glucose (20 %, w/v) and <b>D,L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> (0. 6 %, w/v) were very similar to the ones observed for the commercial strains QA 23 and 71 B, but considerable differences were found regarding the activity of key enzymes involved in the metabolism of malic acid (malic enzyme, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase). The best malic acid degrading strain was 71 B (40 % at the end of fermentation), but from an applied and enological point of view it is still desirable to improve this trait. In order to enhance malic acid consumption, cells were transformed with genetic constructs containing both Kluyveromyves lactis dicarboxylate permease KlJEN 2 and the MAE 2 malic enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe under constitutive expression.

Introduction. Recently, much {{attention has been paid}} on the development of a novel nonlinear optical (NLO) materials because of their optical applications, such as optical data storage, electro-optical modulation, optical switching, optical frequency doubling and optical communication. The organic compounds are having high nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ) than inorganic materials. The organic materials contain proton acceptor and donor groups positioned at either end of a suitable conjugation path. The efficient optical switching behaviour of third order nonlinear optical organic materials was investigated in recent years. The aim for designing the molecules with high third-order nonlinearity is to incorporate them into device applications. 4 -methylaniline contains a proton acceptor amino (NH 2) group, which can creates a strong hydrogen bond with organic acids and forms N-H-O, an anilinium group [1]. <b>DL-malic</b> <b>acid</b> one of the simplest chiral dicarboxylic acids, is a suitable building block in crystal engineering and it is used to create two-dimensional anionic networks held together by hydrogen bonds [2].

40|$|Titania-based photocatalysts {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied for the oxidative photodestruction of organic pollutants in wastewaters, releasing non-toxic substances such as CO 2, HCl, and water. However, commercial exploitation {{of this process}} is limited by the fact that titania is only active under UV irradiation (wavelength below about 388 nm), which is only less than 5 % of solar light energy. Sol-gel synthesised catalyst specimens were characterised to determine the correlation between preparation conditions on morphology (XRD, SEM), optical (bandgap energy level) and physicochemical properties (BET surface area, pore volume, acid site density, acid site strength and type) of the photocatalysts. These spesific properties would then be linked to their photoactivity using aqueous aliphatic and aromatic model pollutants. This study has demonstrated that sol-gel synthesised doped titania photocatalysts, especially Pt/TiO 2, may be used to effectively degrade non-volatile acids (<b>DL-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> dichloroacetic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid) under visible light and UV irradiation with significant photoactivity suitable for the solar light application of photocatalytic wastewater treatment. A significant drop in band-gap energy was found for all titania sol-gel catalysts doped with Pt, Co, and Ce with values between 1. 41 to 1. 78 eV. The BET areas of the photocatalysts were also higher (65 - 117 m 2 /g) than that of Degussa P 25 (50 m 2 /g). The visible-light photomineralisation of the three pollutants with Pt-TiO 2 specimen were further extended to evaluate the effects of major variables in a bubble-column photoreactor on the photodegradation activities. Those major variables were lamp intensity, oxygen concentration, initial pH, catalyst dosage, and inital pollutant concentration. All the three pollutants seemed to follow the Langmuir-Hinselwood model with dual adsorption sites which implicated a bimolecular surface rate-limiting step probably between the adsorbed organic substrate and a surface hydroxyl (or peroxy) radical. A study of the CeyCoxTi(1 -x) O 3 +d perovskite was conducted to investigate the influence of metal composition and pH on the intrinsic optophysical attributes as well as p-hydroxybenzoic acid degradation under UV irradiation. The perovskite UV photoactivities were lower than that of pure TiO 2 likely due to excessive loading (metal content) creating new oxide phases act as electron-hole recombination center, regardless better physicochemical attributes of some of the perovskite samples. The role of aging time and calcination temperature on the sol-gel synthesised TiO 2 was also explored. Higher calcination temperature (from 250 to 700 0 C) resulted in TiO 2 photocatalysts with better crystallinity, which is important for OH group formation as active sites for photodegradation. Despite of some advantages from higher temperature preparation, some detrimental effects such as decreased acidity attributes, surface area, and pore volume were also observed. The significant red-shift of sol-gel synthesized TiO 2 into visible light, especially for 250 0 C specimen since 600 or 700 0 C had extremely low activities, has promising implications that this specimen might be used for solar application to substitute Pt-doped TiO 2 in order to produce a more cost effective photocatalyst. Aging period (1 to 14 days) did not have any discernible effect on the band-gap value and acid-site density. Even so, the highest acid site strength was obtained with an aging time of 10 days. From the overall perspective, aging time longer than 3 days did not bring noticeable benefits to both catalyst attributes and photoactivities...|$|E
