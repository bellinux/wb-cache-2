2500|$|Prior to the World War II and Cold War era {{expansions}} {{of nearby}} military bases and defense industries that rapidly turned the area into a bedroom community, Poquoson was a sleepy rural area with many small family farms, commercial wharves, seafood packing houses, and boat yards that built and repaired log canoes, oyster buy-boats, and Chesapeake Bay <b>deadrise</b> work boats {{used by the}} local waterman. [...] The annual Poquoson Seafood Festival which celebrates Poquoson's heritage is the biggest event in Poquoson. Events at the Friday - Sunday festival include work boat races, singers/bands, vendors, food, crafts, children's entertainment, carnival rides, and sometimes even fireworks.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of these}} chine hulls {{has its own}} unique {{characteristics}} and use. The flat bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag [...] hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sail boat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth,fast ride in flat water but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat bottom boat. Multi chines are [...] more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc bottom chine boats have a Vshape between 6and 23degrees. This is called the <b>deadrise</b> angle. The flatter shape of a 6degrees hull will plane with less wind or a lower horse power engine but will pound more in waves. The deep Vform (between 18and 23degrees) is only suited to high power planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster smoother ride in waves.|$|E

50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century in the United States, various shallow draft {{sailboat}} designs were developed for oystering in Chesapeake Bay. These included the bugeye, log canoe, pungy, sharpie and skipjack. During the 1880s, a powerboat called the Chesapeake Bay <b>deadrise</b> was also developed.|$|E
