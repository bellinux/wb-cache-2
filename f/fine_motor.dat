5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{in young children}} {{has been linked to}} learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10μg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities. Increased blood lead level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, short-term memory, attention, reading and arithmetic ability, <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, emotional regulation, and social engagement.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in the wealthier nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E

5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|People of {{all ages}} with {{physical}} and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity {{for people with disabilities}} has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.|$|E

5000|$|The backhands are {{generally}} more accurate because having two hands on the racquet makes the contact more stable. This also makes it somewhat easier to impart topspin on the ball (though not as much) allowing for more control of the shot, while one-handed backhands generally require <b>finer</b> <b>motor</b> skills to generate topspin and are less consistent in longer rallies.|$|R
25|$|Gateway {{students}} {{typically have}} had difficulty in mainstream classrooms {{due to a}} language-based learning disability (dyslexia, expressive and receptive language delays, reading and writing disorders); attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; executive function disorder; visual-spatial or auditory processing difficulty; and/or gross and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> coordination issues.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine receptors are {{implicated in}} many {{neurological}} processes, including motivation, pleasure, cognition, memory, learning, and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> control, {{as well as}} modulation of neuroendocrine signaling. Abnormal dopamine receptor signaling and dopaminergic nerve function is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, dopamine receptors are common neurologic drug targets; antipsychotics are often dopamine receptor antagonists while psychostimulants are typically indirect agonists of dopamine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Alpha motor neurons (α-MNs) innervating {{the head}} and neck are found in the brainstem; the {{remaining}} α-MNs innervate {{the rest of the body}} and are found in the spinal cord. There are more α-MNs in the spinal cord than in the brainstem, as the number of α-MNs is directly proportional to the amount of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> control in that muscle. For example, the muscles of a single finger have more α-MNs per fiber, and more α-MNs in total, than the muscles of the quadriceps, which allows for finer control of the force a finger applies.|$|E

25|$|Mullan's wife, Rebecca, died in September 1898. John Mullan {{fell ill}} with an {{undetermined}} disease that same year. He became exceptionally weak, suffered from insomnia that could last for days, went long periods {{where he could}} not keep down solid food, and lost {{a significant amount of}} weight. He spent most of 1898 and 1899 under a nurse's care. No longer able to live alone, he moved in with his two daughters. He spent his time reading, and would occasionally travel to Baltimore or Annapolis to spend months living with his sisters. Mullan suffered a stroke in 1904 which left his left arm paralyzed and deprived his right arm of its <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> control.|$|E
25|$|Most reviews {{conclude}} that opioids produce minimal impairment of human performance on tests of sensory, motor, or attentional abilities. However, {{recent studies have}} been able to show some impairments caused by morphine, which is not surprising, given that morphine is a central nervous system depressant. Morphine has resulted in impaired functioning on critical flicker frequency (a measure of overall CNS arousal) and impaired performance on the Maddox wing test (a measure of deviation of the visual axes of the eyes). Few studies have investigated the effects of morphine on motor abilities; a high dose of morphine can impair finger tapping and the ability to maintain a low constant level of isometric force (i.e. <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> control is impaired), though no studies have shown a correlation between morphine and gross motor abilities.|$|E
25|$|Most {{children}} with A-T have difficulty in school {{because of a}} delay in response time to visual, verbal or other cues, slurred and quiet speech (dysarthria), abnormalities of eye control (oculomotor apraxia), and impaired <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> control. Despite these problems, {{children with}} A-T often enjoy school if proper accommodations to their disability can be made. The decision {{about the need for}} special education classes or extra help in regular classes is highly influenced by the local resources available. Decisions about proper educational placement should be revisited as often as circumstances warrant. Despite their many neurologic impairments, most individuals with A-T are very socially aware and socially skilled, and thus benefit from sustained peer relationships developed at school. Some individuals are able to function quite well despite their disabilities and a few have graduated from community colleges.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} sensations is the olfactory sensation. Evolutionary, gustation and olfaction developed together. This multisensory integration was necessary for early humans {{in order to ensure}} that they were receiving proper nutrition from their food, and also to make sure that they were not consuming poisonous materials. There are several other sensory integrations that developed early on in the human evolutionary time line. The integration between vision and audition was necessary for spatial mapping. Integration between vision and tactile sensations developed along with our <b>finer</b> <b>motor</b> skills including better hand-eye coordination. While humans developed into bipedal organisms, balance became exponentially more essential to survival. The multisensory integration between visual inputs, vestibular (balance) inputs, and proprioception inputs played an important role in our development into upright walkers.|$|R
25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals {{is that we}} are not born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{seeing his}} {{chiropractor}} in Charlotte, North Carolina, and consulting medical experts in Atlanta, Georgia, {{the damage was}} found to be much more severe and surgery was deemed the only option to keep his left arm functioning at all. Surgery occurred in Atlanta in late 1996 (resulting in a left posterior laminectomy of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical bones and a fusion of the 7th cervical and 1st thoracic bones) and was successful in repairing most of the damage, but there does remain some muscle weakness, loss of <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> control, and loss of muscle mass in his left arm. He spent many weeks in the hospital during that time, crediting his recovery to his wife, his physical therapist, and the fact he did not want his children to be fatherless. However, he would be readmitted in March 1997 with symptoms akin to cardiac arrest and pulmonary failure, but was released soon afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Cerebral palsy {{is a term}} {{referring}} to a non-progressive developmental neuromotor disorder with an upper motor neuron lesion origin. Depending on {{the location of the}} brain lesion, individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> challenges, including different forms and areas of the body affected. <b>Fine</b> <b>motor</b> planning, control and coordination are often affected. Dysarthria, a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual and hearing problems are also common. [...] Gross and <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device. Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement. Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use. [...] The trend towards custom-placed sensors and personalized signal processing may assist in facilitating communication for those who are incapable of using other AAC technologies.|$|E

500|$|Language {{problems}} are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and decreased word fluency, {{leading to a}} general impoverishment of oral and written language. In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately. [...] While performing <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> tasks such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties (apraxia) may be present, but they are commonly unnoticed. As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, sign {{languages}} have {{a linguistic}} base and permit {{the expression of}} an unlimited number of messages. Approaches to signing {{can be divided into}} two major categories, those that encode an existing language, and those that are languages in their own right. [...] Signing Exact English may be considered the most widely used example of the former and American Sign Language as a common example of the latter. Signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders. [...] The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate <b>fine</b> <b>motor</b> and motor planning skills. Sign languages require more fine-motor coordination and are less transparent in meaning than gestural codes such as Amer-Ind; the latter limits the number of people able to understand the person's communication without training.|$|E
