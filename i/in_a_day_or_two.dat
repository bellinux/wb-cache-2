5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Indian Navy orchestrated a {{disaster}} relief operation {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Alok Bhatnagar, the Flag Officer Commanding Tamil Nadu, Puducherry Naval Area (TNNA). The Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy rushed an amphibious warfare vessel, the INS Airavat, to Chennai on 2 December, with a complement of 20 divers, five Gemini boats, four landing craft and two boats. Three naval flood relief teams, comprising 86 trained swimmers and divers and three officers, were rushed to Tamil Nadu, along with several hundred food packets. The INS Rajali naval air station at Arakkonam functioned as a makeshift airport for transporting relief materials and evacuating stranded people. On 3 December, the Eastern Naval Command despatched the fleet tanker INS Shakti and the stealth guided missile frigate INS Sahyadri to Tamil Nadu; the ships brought 105 additional divers, 200 tents, 3000 towels, 1000 blankets, 10 field kitchens and food, milk powder, medicines, 5000 litres of bottled water and 700 tonnes of fresh water. General Dalbir Singh Suhag, the Chief of the Army Staff, flew to Chennai on 4 December to supervise the Army's rescue efforts; he and the General Officer Commanding, Dakshin Bharat Area, conducted an aerial reconnaissance. An additional 15 NDRF teams were planned to arrive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> With rainfall gradually becoming less intense, the pace of relief efforts intensified by 5 December. By then, more than 11 lakh (1,100,000) people had been evacuated to safer places and thousands more temporarily housed in relief camps across the city and adjoining districts. People in many localities began draining stagnant water, while government relief efforts were supplemented by thousands of NGO volunteers and individuals with food packets, drinking water, clothes, blankets and medicines. 92 mobile medical teams were deployed across Chennai on 4 December to tend to the needy, while 200 special medical camps became operational on 5 December, in addition to more than 210 camps already operating.|$|E

500|$|For instrumentation, Wilson {{employed}} {{the services of}} [...] "the Wrecking Crew", the nickname for a conglomerate of session musicians active in Los Angeles at that time. Production for [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] spanned {{more than a dozen}} recording sessions at four different Hollywood studios, {{at a time when most}} pop singles were typically recorded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> It was reported to have used over 90 hours of magnetic recording tape, with an eventual budget estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 (equivalent to $ and $ in [...] ), at that time the largest sum spent on a single. In comparison, the whole of Pet Sounds had cost $70,000 ($), itself an unusually high cost for an album. According to Wilson, the Electro-Theremin work alone cost $15,000 ($). It is said that Wilson was so puzzled by [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] that he would often arrive at a session, consider a few possibilities, and then leave without recording anything, which exacerbated costs.|$|E
500|$|Fruit bodies first {{appear as}} tiny white knobs {{less than a}} cubic {{millimeter}} in size. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by {{the formation of a}} minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, and then start to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile hymenium, which can be seen when the cap is about 2mm in diameter.The young cap is spherical and its growth is at first , its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special enclosed chamber. As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as [...] broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown—a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.|$|E
500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also said he had to adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common cause of damage to the facial nerve is Bell’s palsy (BP). [...] It has a {{reported}} incidence of about 0.00015% within the world population each year, and in up to approximately 10% of those cases, the disorder will recur. [...] The etiology of this disease is currently unknown, but hypotheses include infections, genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and neuropathy. [...] Among those who develop the disorder, unilateral paralysis of the facial muscles occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> but it is common for the patient to recover on their own over the span of a few weeks. [...] Even if the condition is resolved, the patient still stands a 20% chance of having lifelong weakness in their facial muscles, and 5% of these people will have permanent damage equivalent to a level of 4 or higher on the House-Brackmann scale.|$|E
2500|$|Yet, Mailer had {{a general}} dislike for short stories, {{and tended to}} write them when the more serious {{occupation}} of writing novels was not going well. In fact, he states, that his own short fiction is [...] "neither splendid, unforgettable, nor distinguished" [...] and implies that he is more a [...] "novelist, philosopher, essayist, journalist, personality, cathartic, spark, or demiurge." [...] J. Michael Lennon states that Mailer had an idea that if {{was not able to}} finish a story <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> it was never meant to be written. While it's true that Mailer's reputation as a novelist and a practitioner of new journalism are his chief claims to fame, Eric Heyne suggests that, contrary to Mailer's perhaps disingenuous claims, his short fiction is important, as it demonstrates a distinct arc in his development as a writer from his early work to his more mature style, and shows its literary and historical importance in the transition from modernism to postmodernism.|$|E
