40|$|Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea Linn.) is an {{important}} food legume and an oilseed crop in India and is cultivated {{in an area of}} 5. 53 million ha with a production of 9. 67 million tons and productivity of 1750 kgha- 1 (FAO, 2013 - 14). Groundnut production is usually hampered by several biotic and abiotic constraints during pre-harvest which to a greater extent are tackled by integrated management approaches while in the post-harvest, storage is a big challenge especially for farmers as <b>groundnut</b> <b>bruchid,</b> Caryedon serratus (Olivier) causes severe damage to groundnut pods when stored in improper storage conditions. In view of the importance of <b>groundnut</b> <b>bruchid</b> during storage, laboratory studies on “Evaluation of improved grain storage practices for the management of <b>Groundnut</b> <b>Bruchid,</b> Caryedon serratus Olivier. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) ” were conducted at International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Hyderabad. Studies were contemplated on estimation of oxygen requirement to bruchid, performance of triple layer bag as a tool of hermetic storage technology to manage bruchid, Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin contamination in groundnut pods stored at 10 and 14 per cent moisture regimes and effect of C. serratus and A. flavus on changes in important biochemical constituents viz., oil, protein and fatty acid composition of groundnut kernels under different storage conditions. The mode of action of hermetic storage on <b>groundnut</b> <b>bruchid</b> was investigated to determine the actual requirement of oxygen by the bruchid and to understand the dynamics of change in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and its effects on insects. The results revealed that a single bruchid from egg to pupal stage used approximately 39. 97 ml of oxygen and simultaneously produced 26. 21 ml of carbon dioxide. It is observed that any reduction in level of oxygen availability (hypoxia) than the requirement and increase in level of carbon dioxide concentration (hypercarbia) than optimum level, in storage conditions caused cessation of feeding and eventually death of insects. The performance of triple layer plastic bag as source of hermetic storage technology was evaluated for managing <b>groundnut</b> <b>bruchid,</b> C. serratus and storage fungi, A. flavus by storing groundnut pods with 10 and 14 per cent moisture contents and observing the development of bruchid and fungus at 2, 4 and 6 months of storage. The results revealed that groundnut pod with varying moisture contents stored in triple layer bag for a period of six months recorded 100 per cent mortality of bruchids and retained seed integrity significantly better than the pods stored in traditional bags such as jute, polythene and jute bag treated with insecticide. The percentage of damaged pods and test weight in triple layer plastic bag were unchanged at 10...|$|E
40|$|Dry {{formulations}} of three insecticides (chlorpyriphos, fenvalerate and carbaryl) were compared for their efficacy against rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton) and <b>groundnut</b> <b>bruchid</b> Caryedon serratus Oliver, {{in the context}} of identifying a suitable alternative to aldrin. Fenvalerate 4 g/kg seed showed quick action and killed all the Corcyra eggs, and Caryedon grubs and adults, within 48 h. Chlorpyriphos and carbaryl were less effective, although the former showed high persistency. Fenvalerate and carbaryl were significantly superior to a range of rates of chlorpyriphos up to 180 DAT, and were on par with aldrin. For seed exports that require storage of 60 days or more, chlorpyriphos could be used as an effective replacement for aldrin. The chemicals tested hid no deleterious effects on seed viability of pearl millet and groundnut up to 180 days at ambient temperature during storag...|$|E
40|$|Structuring {{effect of}} the host plant in the <b>{{groundnut}}</b> <b>bruchid,</b> Caryedon serratus (Olivier, 1790) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). Twenty-six samples of the groundnut seed-beetle which were reared from pods of five different host plants (Arachis hypogaea L., Bauhinia rufescens Lam., Cassia sieberiana DC., Piliostigma reticulatum (DC.) Hochst. and Tamarindus indica L.) in four localities of Senegal were compared using electrophoresis based on six loci of four enzymatic systems. The population structure of Caryedon serratus Olivier was analysed using Weir and Cockerham's estimator of Wright's F-statistics. θ value (0. 235) and the dendrogram of Rogers'genetic distances revealed {{a high degree of}} genetic differentiation between host plants. Genetic analysis without C. sieberiana samples indicated that populations form host races which are partially isolated according to their host plants (θ = 0. 035). Geographical distances between localities are not decisive for genetic structuration of C. serratus populations from a given host plant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Bamabara groundnut, Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc, is an {{important}} grain legume that {{plays a significant role}} in sustainable agriculture, food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa. In northern Ghana one major constraint to the save preservation of bambara groundnut seeds after harvest is infestation by bruchid insects. A survey was conducted to obtain information on the existing storage systems and their implications for bruchid pest management in the Talensi-Nabdam district of Upper East region of Ghana. Six farming communities and five marketing centers were surveyed between January and March, 2012 by administering structured and semi structured questionnaires to respondents drawn by purposive sampling method. The study revealed that the major storage pests infesting bambara groundnuts in the surveyed areas were insects of the bruchid group which were dominated by three species of Callosobruhus and one species of Zabrotes. Storage structures used by farmers and traders included earthenware pots, gourds, mud silos, jute sacks, metal drums and plastic containers but jute sacks and clay pots were rampant in terms of use. Though not all the structures are effective many were used owing to their hermetic conditions against the pests, coupled with their durability, economic and ease of integration with indigenous grain protectants such as admixture with vegetable oils, fine ash and extracts from a local plant scientifically known as Hyptis spicigera. The extract from Hyptis spicigera was more (50 %) in use to preserve Bambara groundnuts because its work better in warding off the bruchid pest. The rampant postharvest losses to bambara groundnut grains in the area could be minimized if these existing storage structures and grain preservation techniques were improved.

40|$|Groundnut {{seeds are}} prone to quality {{deterioration}} and damage due to improper storage. Hermetic storage of pods offers a novel, sustainable and ecologically safe alternative over traditional methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of triple-layer “Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) ” bags, (that comprises of two inner high density polyethylene bags and one outer woven polypropylene bag), for protecting pods from quality deterioration, damage by bruchids (Caryedon serratus) and aflatoxin contamination (Aspergillus flavus). Custom made triple-layer bags were used and pods (of cv ICGV 91114) were placed @ 2 kg/bag. Over four months of storage under ambient conditions, triple-layer bags supported retention of seed weight, germinability and oil content significantly better than cloth bags. Further, under both natural and artificial infestations with A. flavus, seed aflatoxins levels were lower in PICS bags compared to cloth bags. Toxin accumulation in PICS bags deliberately infested with bruchids and A. flavus was less compared to cloth bags under similar conditions. Bruchid damage to pods was less in PICS bags versus cloth bags in all cases. Our results suggest the superiority of triple-layer PICS bags over cloth bags in protecting seed viability, seed weight and oil content while safeguarding the <b>groundnuts</b> from <b>bruchids</b> and retarding toxin accumulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Caryedon serratus, the peanut (<b>groundnut)</b> <b>bruchid,</b> on 2 Australian native plants, Cassia brewsteri and C. tomentella, was documented over 2 years. Caryedon serratus was observed across {{the central and}} northern parts {{of the range of}} C. brewsteri (latitudes 19. 258 – 24. 140 °S) and {{at least part of the}} range of C. tomentella (as far as 24. 427 °S). Seed loss to C. serratus in these species assessed across all collection sites was 40 ± 8. 0 % (mean ± s. e.). Where the bruchid was detected at a given site, 72 ± 8. 6 % of pods on 71 ± 8. 5 % of trees were affected. Additional distribution points and other potential host species from previous C. serratus collections in the Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC) are reported. The combined data were used to predict a potential range for the bruchid across the dry tropics of Australia. No reports of migration to cultivated or stored peanut (Arachis hypogaea) in Australia were located. Further investigation of the potential impact of this bruchid on the Australian peanut industry is recommended. A potentially beneficial aspect of C. serratus establishment may be the biological control of Acacia nilotica (prickly acacia) in Australia...|$|E
