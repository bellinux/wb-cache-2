For instance, it took about three hours for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> halfway to Pluto. Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{influence}} on events, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Napoleon's personality that took effect. He reorganized France itself {{to supply the}} men and money needed for wars. He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout. The force of his personality neutralized material difficulties as his soldiers fought with the confidence that with Napoleon in charge they would surely win.|$|E

25|$|When the Greek {{inscription}} {{was published}} in the third volume of the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum in 1853, the cippi were described as discovered in the coastal village of Marsaxlokk. Before, their Marsaxlokk provenance had not been proposed by anyone, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a century later that the claim was discredited. The attribution to Tas-Silġ was apparently reached by inference, because the candelabra were thought, with some plausibility, to have been dedicated and set up inside the temple of Heracles.|$|E

While the affair was on record, there was no account in Viola's letter whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one-night and if it was more a business transaction than an amorous affair.|$|E

While noting that the damage did indeed exist, the NTSB countered that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> likely caused by the crash rather than existing beforehand, and furthermore it was not enough to cause the crash, as the 767 is designed to remain flyable even with two PCUs failed.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{researchers}} first {{attributed the}} mound to the Adena culture (1000 BC - 1 AD). William Webb, noted Adena exponent, found evidence through carbon dating for Kentucky Adena {{as early as}} 1200 BC. As there are Adena graves near the Serpent Mound, scholars thought the same people constructed the mound. The skeletal remains of the Adena type uncovered in the 1880s at Serpent Mound indicate {{that these people were}} unique among the ancient Ohio Valley peoples. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 45 years before scholars paid sufficient attention to the Adena studies.|$|E

She contacted Pokin to share Meier's story with him. Once the story broke, it quickly spread to national and international news outlets.|$|E
25|$|Carolina's defense {{shut down}} the Eagles offense, only {{allowing}} a field goal and holding Donovan McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions for 100 yards. Rookie cornerback Ricky Manning intercepted McNabb three times, while the Panthers defense recorded {{a total of five}} sacks. McNabb also sustained a lower-rib injury early in the game but stayed in until the second half. Although Carolina's offense only scored 14 points, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough for the team to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl with a 14–3 win. For the Eagles, it was their third straight NFC Championship Game loss.|$|E
25|$|Franklin saw the {{printing}} press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God. Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality. He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a business venture, for like many publishers since, {{he believed that the}} press had a public-service duty.|$|E
