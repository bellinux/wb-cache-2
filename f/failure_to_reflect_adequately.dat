40|$|Legal {{scholars}} have extensively debated {{the merits of}} the monopolistic nature of patent rights in contrast to the public interest objectives of competition law. Recently, the discussion has turned to standard essential patents and patent holders’ right to seek and enforce injunctions ex-post making a commitment to license essential patents under FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non- discriminatory) terms and conditions. Although lacking a common definition thereof, FRAND commitments significantly impact the remedies available to standard essential patent (SEP) holders, particularly their right to seek and enforce injunctions and the amount of damages potentially awarded. In fact, based on a risk of patent hold-up, which largely lacks empirical support, recourse to injunctive relief after making a FRAND commitment has alternatively been characterized as a breach of contract as well as abuse of dominance. Nonetheless, some scholars continue to posit that patent law norms are alone sufficient to police the anticompetitive impacts potentially associated with seeking and enforcing injunctions in the standard essential patent context. Seeking and enforcing injunctions after making a FRAND commitment has recently been characterized as abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU by the European Commission in two landmark cases regarding the exclusionary behavior of Samsung and Motorola. Extending arguments introduced in the so-called “refusal to license” case law and delineating the standard setting process and the existence of a FRAND commitment as exceptional circumstances, the Commission stated that SEP-holders may not seek injunctive relief if the prospective licensee is willing to enter into a licensing agreement on FRAND terms. The Commission’s test is, however, highly subjective and thus likely to generate more legal uncertainty than it is to resolve the FRAND debate. Seeking and enforcing injunctions in the SEP context has also been characterized as a breach of contract law, although the application of contract law norms is problematic {{due to a lack of}} common understanding of either the meaning or contractual nature of FRAND commitments. Specifically, FRAND commitments have alternatively been described as binding contracts on behalf of third-party beneficiaries, promises to license, and mere agreements to negotiate. Focusing on FRAND commitments made to ETSI, this research indicates strong support for considering FRAND commitments binding contracts with all prospective standards-implementers third-party beneficiaries thereof. Even though recent EU-level decisions regarding seeking and enforcing injunctions ex-post making a FRAND commitment have provided some clarity to the legal framework surrounding standard essential patents and FRAND licensing, the determination of a FRAND royalty rate in itself remains highly debated and uncertain. <b>Failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>adequately</b> <b>reflect</b> the value of a patent when courts set FRAND royalties may discourage either essential patent holders or prospective licensees from participating in standards- setting. Accordingly, distinguishing appropriate measures for determining FRAND royalties should represent a core focus area for both academia and courts alike. Although the excessive pricing test established in United Brands represents an upper boundary for FRAND royalties, the test alone is insufficient and overtly strict. Absent EU-level case law regarding FRAND royalty setting, this study reviews recent United States case law in order to determine the key issues that distinguish rate determinations for FRAND- encumbered standard essential patents from non-essential patents. Matters of particular concern relate to distinguishing patent value from value created by a standard, the risk of royalty stacking, and the identification of an appropriate royalty base. Although some, albeit limited, progress has recently been made with regard to addressing the availability of injunctive relief in the standard essential patent context, the FRAND debate remains far from resolved. Until the CJEU renders a decision in the matter, the use of the competition law defense against essential patent holders’ recourse to injunctive relief will remain somewhat uncertain in the European Union. Nevertheless, establishing guidelines for determining FRAND royalties should be a key priority, wherein practices already applied in the United States can be leveraged. In fact, in order to ensure a fair balance between the interests of standard essential patent holders and prospective standards-implementers and accordingly safeguard standards- setting in its current form, the main future questions pertain to the judicial determination of FRAND royalties and the empirical assessment of the risks of patent hold-up and reverse hold-up...|$|R

30|$|Perspective {{plays an}} {{important}} role in estimating the severity of impacts from disasters. The findings presented here illustrate how absolute loss and damage assessments often fail <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>adequately</b> the situation in which affected households find themselves and to take into account their prospect for post-disaster recovery (Merz et al. 2010). The true severity of impacts depends much less on their monetary value itself, but rather on how their monetary value relates to the resources at a household’s disposal. While it seems straightforward to conclude that any monetary loss is more severe the poorer the household that experiences it, relative loss and damage assessments are scarce. This is surprising, taking into account how crucial the role of impact assessment is for the payout of compensation money and the provision of relief goods.|$|R

Bronchodilators and steroid treatment had no effect. Radionuclide lung scans using an intravenous bolus of xenon- 133 both before and after treatment showed substantially reduced function on the hyperlucent side and modestly reduced function on the other side. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed no structural abnormalities. Partial forced expiratory flow volume (PEFV) curves, generated from end inspiration by rapid compression of the chest wall with an inflatable jacket, were obtained from the total respiratory system and from each lung separately by inflating a Fogarty catheter in the contralateral mainstem bronchus. Expiratory flow rates and volumes during both tidal breathing and PEFV manoeuvres were considerably decreased in the hyperlucent lung. PEFV curves from the "healthy" right lung and from the total respiratory system were similar in shape and showed a moderately obstructive pattern.

Exp. Ther. 199 : 53 - 60, 1976. Previous experiments had shown that carbon monoxide inhalation prolonged the in vivo response zoxazolamine. However, CO was clearly less potent than an equivalent level of hypoxia induced by inhalation of lowered 02 content (hypoxic hypoxia). The present study revealed that both CO and hypoxic hypoxia also prolonged the pharmacologic response to a drug of vastly different structure and site of action, i. e., hexobarbital. In this case, CO was approximately equipotent to hypoxic hypoxia in prolonging sleeping time.

40|$|Protein C is {{a natural}} vitamin K-dependent plasma anticoagulant, {{deficiencies}} {{of which have been}} found in patients with recurrent thrombosis and warfarin-induced skin necrosis. To appreciate more fully the role of protein C in disease states and during oral anticoagulation, a new functional assay for protein C involving adsorption of plasma protein C on a Ca+ 2 -dependent monoclonal antibody, elution, quantitative activation, and assessment of plasma anticoagulant activity, has been developed. When oral anticoagulation is initiated, the anticoagulant activity of protein C decreases {{to a greater extent than}} either the amidolytic or immunologic levels. During stabilized warfarin treatment, there is no correlation between either amidolytic or antigenic levels and the functional protein C activity, suggesting that measurement of protein C anticoagulant activity may be necessary <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>adequately</b> the anticoagulant protection afforded by this protein. In contrast, there was a strong correlation between anticoagulant and amidolytic and immunologic levels in liver failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Thus, this assay permits assessment of protein C in individuals who have received anticoagulant treatment and identification of a new class of protein C-deficient individuals...|$|R

Many temples have fallen victim to stone quar-rying, {{not only in the}} Delta where much of the building programme was concentrated, but also in Upper Egyptian urban centres such as Ashmunein, Abydos and Koptos. Elsewhere, Thirtieth Dynasty structures often consist of added elements within an older sanctuary, which fail to attract the attention engendered by an entirely new monument, despite {{the fact that some of}} these additions in themselves constituted an outlay of resources greater than that needed for the construction of many a complete temple. Where Thirtieth Dynasty temples were constructed, the demands of the building programme seem to have been such that their decoration sometimes remained to be completed by later rulers, as at Ashmunein, where the Thoth-temple founded by Nekhtnebef (Nectanebo I) was inscribed under Philip Arrhidaeus. 2 It is probable that some temples regarded as belonging to the Ptolemaic Period on the grounds of their decoration may have been initiated during the Thirtieth Dynasty.

40|$|The early {{identification}} of talented individuals is considered increasingly important across many performance domains. Traditional concepts of talent have primarily emphasized genetically driven variables, proclaiming that exceptional abilities {{are the result}} of favourable genes matched to the required performance domain. Consequently, an oversimplified concept of sporting talent exists where the focus has typically been on discrete, one-dimensional measures at unstable periods in the athlete’s development. Talent identification processes adopted by several countries around the world have evolved from this oversimplified concept of talent and are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>adequately</b> how talent emerges in sport. In fact, retrospective interviews with successful athletes emphasized that a range of factors impact success within sport and these are not solely governed by genetic determinants of performance. In particular, athletes highlighted the crucial role that psychology can have on the ability of an individual to translate potential to performance. It is concluded that TI models need to place a greater emphasis on the development of potentially talented performers rather than early identification. In this thesis, the concept of talent is revised as a complex, dynamical system in which future behaviours emerge from an interaction of key determinants such as psychobehavioural characteristics, motor abilities, and physical characteristics. A generic model of talent identification and development (TID) that addresses these issues, and resources that enable its practical application, is proposed.
