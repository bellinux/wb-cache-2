5|$|The inner chamber {{measures}} 4.5 metres (13 feet) in length, and 1.7 metres (5 feet, 6 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> width, {{although it}} was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber's internal height {{would have been at}} least 2 metres (6 feet, 6 <b>inches).</b> <b>In</b> its current state, the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs. One is 2.44 metres (8 feet) long, 2.29 metres (7 feet, 6 inches) deep, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) thick; the other is 1.52 centimetres (5 feet) long, 1.83 (6 feet) deep, and 61 centimetres (2 feet) thick. Conversely, the chamber's southern side consists of a single slab, measuring 3.45 metres (11 feet, 4 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> length, 2.21 metres (7 feet, 3 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> depth, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> thickness at its eastern end.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili's {{remnants}} brought heavy rainfall, peaking at four <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> Arkansas, to the Southeast, before dissipating {{near the}} Arkansas-Tennessee border. Lili's remnants also caused minimal rainfall in the Lower Tennessee Valley. No major damage was reported. In all, Lili caused $820 million in {{damage to the}} United States. Lili also caused a little girl to be born in Massachusetts 2 weeks before her due date. Her mother named her after the storm, Lilly. This girl has grown with the fury and intensity of this storm.|$|E
5|$|The earthen mound {{that once}} covered the tomb is now visible {{only as an}} {{undulation}} approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on {{the western end of}} the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. It is probable that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, the PAVN {{logistical}} system {{consisted of}} a two-lane paved (with crushed limestone and gravel) highway that ran from the mountain passes of North Vietnam to the Chu Pong Massif in South Vietnam. By 1974 {{it was possible to}} travel a completely paved four-lane route from the Central Highlands to Tây Ninh Province, northwest of Saigon. The single oil pipeline that had once terminated near the A Shau Valley now consisted of four lines (the largest eight <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> diameter) and extended south to Lộc Ninh. In July 1973 the 259th Group as redesignated the Truong Son Command, the regimental sectors were converted to divisions, and the binh trams were designated as regiments. By late 1974 forces under the new command included AAA Division 377, Transportation Division 571, Engineering Division 473, the 968th Infantry Division, and sectoral divisions 470, 471, and 472.|$|E

5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In {{southern}} Arizona, {{a surge of}} moisture from the storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in {{a short amount of}} time; one location reported hail of 1.75inches (44.5mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled several <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8inches (205mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64mph (103km/h) at the airport in Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona for about a week. In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.|$|E
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E

The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57½ <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> length.|$|E
5|$|Between March 23 and March 27, 1913, Indiana {{and more}} than a dozen other states {{experienced}} major flooding during the Great Flood of 1913; it was Indiana's worst flood disaster up to that time. The weather system that created the unprecedented flooding arrived in Indiana on Sunday, March 23, with a major tornado at Terre Haute. In four days, rainfall topped nine <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> southern Indiana, more than half of it falling within a twenty-four-hour period on March 25. Heavy rains, runoff, and rising rivers resulted in extensive flooding in northeast, central, and southern Indiana. Indiana's flood-related deaths were estimated at 100 to 200, with flood damage estimated at $25 million (in 1913 dollars). State and local communities handled their own disaster response and relief. The American Red Cross, still a small organization at that time, established a temporary headquarters in Indianapolis and served the six hardest-hit Indiana counties. Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston appealed to Indiana cities and other states for relief assistance and appointed a trustee to receive relief funds and arrange for distribution of supplies. Independent organizations, such as the Rotary Club of Indianapolis and others, helped with local relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|Chesbro's 1904 {{record for}} games {{won in a}} season (41 wins) has stood for over a century—one of the oldest major records in baseball, {{or in any other}} sport. Under current playing practices, his record is unbreakable. Chesbro started 51 games that season (plus 4 relief appearances) and pitched 48 {{complete}} games, for a record of 41–12. Today, it is uncommon for a pitcher to start even 35 games in a season and complete games are a rarity. The only other 40-win season since 1900 was 40 by Ed Walsh in 1908, and only three other pitchers in the modern era have won as many as 35--Christy Mathewson (37 in 1908), Walter Johnson (36 in 1913) and Joe McGinnity (35 in 1904). Since the pitcher's mound was lowered to its current height of 10 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> 1969, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were the}} {{youngest}} and usually the poorest (being 5th class citizens, with property worth 4002,500 denarii) soldiers in the legion, and could rarely afford much equipment. They were armed with veretum, light javelins, each with a 90 cm (3 ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c. 10 in (25 cm) narrow metal point, and tips designed to bend on impact to prevent them being thrown back, similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries. Livy says that they each carried seven javelins, however Roman satirist Lucilius says that they carried five, suggesting that the amount may have changed.They also carried darts, 30 in long, which also had a tip {{that was designed to}} bend on impact. The hastati and principes carried gladii, relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres (29 <b>inches)</b> <b>in</b> length, as their main weapons, and the velites carried them as backup weapons. They fought in a very loose, staggered formation like most irregular troops, and carried small round shields called parma, 90cm (3feet) in diameter.|$|E
