5|$|Rogers {{recruits}} Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier {{to attack}} other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers {{and his team}} sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using {{weapons of mass destruction}} on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off, and during the subsequent fight the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, causing him to dissolve <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> light. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out over the North Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later over the North Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original reflective material, invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E

5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed and Gray offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, and Gray finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle and Gray cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> clearing.|$|E

25|$|The duo {{dress up}} in 1980s fashion and drive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> yellow jeep to a car wash, where Spears and backup dancers break into dance. Meanwhile, Azalea's alien powers cause a {{television}} to explode, water to turn pink and an ATM to begin shooting cash, which Spears dances around. Soon, the pair hop into a convertible with Spear's friends, where Azalea turns Spear's 1980s handheld telephone into a Samsung Galaxy S6. Nightfall arrives and the duo head to a club where Azalea raps and Spears and dancers perform a synchronized dance break. Suddenly, the nightclub begins to shake and an unseen force proceeds to abduct Azalea and Spears, to the latter's delight. The screen fades black before the pair appear laughing and doing arm movements in the yellow jeep and the credits start.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by her {{assistant}} 's compassion, Twilight realizes {{that if she}} shows her friends their true destinies and reminds them of what they mean to each other, she {{may be able to}} reverse the spell. One by one, she shows each of her friends what their true calling is, encouraging them to help each other fix things. Each friend becomes aware of her original life and regains her original cutie mark with help of her respective Element, and Ponyville is quickly restored to normal. Twilight realizes that her friendship with the other ponies is a factor that Star Swirl had not accounted for, and is able to complete the spell. Upon doing so, the Elements worn by her friends activate on their own, engulfing Twilight <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> light and causing her to disappear.|$|E
25|$|Wetz's three symphonies are powerful, {{introverted}} {{works in}} the style of late romantic symphonic music being cultivated at the time, yet his works show their own distinct personalities separating them from the tradition. For Wetz, the subdued nature of the closing passages of his works confirm the integrity of these works. The first symphony's end, for instance, begins in the key of C minor (as Bruckner did also) and almost dissolves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> major key before, after a recall of earlier music, an austere and minor-mode conclusion not heard in any Bruckner finale (closer to the mood of the conclusions to some Bruckner opening movements) comes around. This was certainly influenced by the spirit of the times in which he lived, which were certainly not typical. His quartets follow the same techniques in form and gesture as his symphonies, but these were invested with substantially more intense feeling than the more public symphonies.|$|E

25|$|Returning home, Cook {{was again}} {{selected}} for the first XI during Sri Lanka's tour. For his debut match at Lord's, Cook was shuffled down to third {{to make way for}} the returning Trescothick. However, he still walked to the crease alongside his teammate as Strauss fell at the stroke of lunch. Cook and Trescothick put on 127 in their partnership as Trescothick made a century while Cook later stumbled just before at 89; there was no second innings as England enforced the follow-on but were one wicket away from victory, with Cook being targeted among others for two significant dropped catches. Cook's first taste of victory came in the second Test, guiding the team past the target of 78 in the second innings with an unbeaten 34 alongside Andrew Flintoff furthering the reputation of his calm, meticulous style of play against the dangerous spin of Muttiah Muralitharan who took 4–29. Although not initially {{selected for the}} one-day series, Cook made his limited overs debut in the fourth match scoring 39 from 38 balls <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> spot of an otherwise dour England performance hampered by injuries.|$|E
25|$|K 163: In {{regular service}} on the {{preserved}} Mornington Railway, hauling passenger services between Moorooduc and Mornington. The engine had been withdrawn from Government service in December 1968, at Ararat. It then sat idle for a few years, before being sold to the Frankston Apex Club in November 1973, {{and placed in the}} Frankston Jubilee Park. Within a few months it had been painted teal green above the frames. In 1984, the engine was sold to the Mornington Railway Preservation Society, and a boiler certificate was granted in July 1985. In November that year, the engine was moved to the Cresco sidings at Hastings for restoration, and moved under its own power for the first time ten months later. Fully restored in May 1987, and painted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> green scheme, with a similar layout similar to that of K190 at the time. By 1995 the engine had been repainted to a much darker green, with red lining and black smokebox and smoke deflectors, and as of 2004, the engine had gold boiler bands. The engine was under overhaul from 7 February to 21 November 2010, then it re-entered service, in the same livery but with the red changed to the same dark green, and regularly running without smoke deflectors. This overhaul utilised the boiler from K 191. The engine was used as the locomotive on train scene in part 3 of The Pacific.|$|E
25|$|On April 9, 2015, Spears and Azalea {{were spotted}} {{shooting}} scenes {{for the music}} video around the streets of Studio City, Los Angeles, after Spears shared lyrics of the track and a behind-the-scenes snapshot on her Twitter account. Spears shared a picture from the video shoot captioning it with lyrics of the song on her social media accounts. In the '80s-inspired visuals seen on the candid images, Spears wore a leopard print crop top, ripped jeans, and pumps with matching sunglasses, triangle-shaped earrings, and pink lipstick, while Azalea was wearing matching jean jacket and shorts with a crimped hairstyle, while posing together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> red convertible Fox-Body Mustang and with Spears also driving around in a yellow Jeep CJ. Azalea then shared a selfie from the set on her Instagram account along with a hashtag of the song title. Later that day, Azalea was also seen swapping into a second outfit, a green top, jet black studded leggings and electric blue heels. They were pictured again {{on the second day}} of production of the video shoot on April 10, 2015, with Spears wearing a repeat outfit from the day before but with a shorter hairdo sporting a voluminous curly bob, and Azalea changing into a sleeveless tie-dye number. Spears filmed a car wash scene with male backup dancers completing a dance routine. That same day, a snippet of the unreleased track went viral on Twitter after a fan, who was near the set, recorded and uploaded a clip online.|$|E

Sections of the interior floor appear relatively level, but Lunar Orbiter photographs reveal the surface is covered in many small hills, streaky gouges, and some minor fractures.

Accounts vary, but Orléans may have held his torch above a dancer's mask to reveal his identity when a spark fell, setting fire to the dancer's leg. In the 17th century, William Prynne wrote of the incident that [...] "the Duke of Orleance... put one of the Torches his servants held so neere the flax, that he set one of the Coates on fire, and so each of them set fire on to the other, {{and so they were}} all <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> flame", whereas a contemporary chronicle stated that he [...] "threw" [...] the torch at one of the dancers.|$|E
