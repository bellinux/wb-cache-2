[...] She played a productive role in the 1962 campaign, making speeches before groups of Republican women {{at a time when}} it was unusual for women to campaign separately from their husbands. She was given the task of campaigning in the rural, naturally Republican outstate areas while he focused on the naturally Democratic Detroit area.|$|E

Reiner pitched {{an idea for a}} film that Ephron rejected. The second meeting transformed into a long discussion about Reiner and Scheinman's lives as single men. Reiner remembers, [...] "I {{was in the middle of}} my single life. I'd been divorced for a while. I'd been out a number of times, all these disastrous, confusing relationships one after another". The next time they all met, Reiner said that he had always wanted to do a film about two people who become friends and do not have sex because they <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> ruin their relationship but have sex anyway. Ephron liked the idea, and Reiner acquired a deal at a studio.|$|E

[...] On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the Tribune, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the Tribune building on August 15.

500|$|Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{appears on}} Larry King Live. During his {{appearance}} on the program, a breaking story interrupts his interview with show host Larry King—it is being reported that the Asian stocks are falling. Larry King asks Tracy's opinion on this story, which results in Tracy giving chaos-inducting views, including, [...] "New York as we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> no longer exist tomorrow" [...] and he calls for panic, sending the people of New York into madness. At the NBC studios, the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), try looking for money that Tracy has hidden in the building after revealing this on Larry King Live. Pete calls the program asking Tracy where he stores the money. Tracy reveals that the safest place he has it hidden has [...] "a hard top and soft bottom, no matter where it moves, the cash stays in the same place." [...] This clue is of no help to Pete, Frank, Toofer, and Lutz.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that {{it would be difficult to}} put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be difficult to put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [...] and we must try to do it".|$|E

[...] "Unearthed" [...] {{was the last}} episode filmed during the first season schedule. Although it was filmed during the first season, [...] "Unearthed" [...] aired during the following season on Monday, January 11, 2010, a departure from its normal timeslot on Thursdays. Actor Joshua Jackson explained the move in April 2009, [...] " [...] for boring reasons. They only had 22 airdates for our show this year, but they ordered 23 episodes, so we shot one for next year, which is just silly TV network stuff. It's not for any cool reason like we had something we needed in New York that we couldn't shoot elsewhere. It's just an accounting issue." [...] That same month, executive producer/showrunner Jeff Pinkner further commented on the episode chronology for the new season, [...] "It won't be the first episode, and it probably won't be the second, but it'll be somewhere in the first batch of episodes.

500|$|Southerners, however, {{saw that}} Douglas' attempt was {{unlikely}} to result in legalization of slavery. While it allowed Nebraska to determine whether slavery would be legal there when it became a state, slavery was still forbidden under the Missouri Compromise {{as long as it}} remained a territory. If no slaveholders were allowed in the territory, it would be exceedingly unlikely that the state's voters would allow for slavery in their constitution. Following this line of thought, Dixon drafted an amendment to Douglas' bill that would repeal section eight of the Missouri Compromise, the section that prohibited slavery north of latitude 36°30'. After a promise of support from Tennessee senator James C. Jones, Dixon introduced the amendment on January 16, 1854. This forced Douglas to confront the Missouri Compromise issue outright, and two days later, he visited Dixon to discuss his position. Douglas was reluctant to repeal the Compromise, but was ultimately convinced by Dixon's logic. He concluded the interview by exclaiming [...] "By God, Sir, you are right. I will incorporate it in my bill, though I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> raise a hell of a storm." [...] Over the next several days, Douglas incorporated Dixon's suggestion and other pro-slavery measures into the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which President Franklin Pierce signed into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E

This was a lesson learned after she did not check the plan for Goblet of Fire and had to rewrite {{a third of the}} book. She started writing the book before her second child, David, was born, but she took a break to care for him. The first chapter, [...] "The Other Minister", which {{features}} the meeting between the Muggle Prime Minister, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and his successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, was a concept Rowling tried to start in Philosopher's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix, but she found [...] "it finally works" [...] in Half-Blood Prince. She stated that she was [...] "seriously upset" [...] writing the end of the book, although Goblet of Fire was the hardest to write. When asked if she liked the book, she responded, [...] "I like it better than I liked 'Goblet', 'Phoenix' or 'Chamber' when I finished them. Book six does what I wanted it to do and even if nobody else likes it (and some won't), I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> remain one of my favourites of the series.

2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>will</b> only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
