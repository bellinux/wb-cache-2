5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the <b>Intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides.

5|$|An <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> has a {{gelatinous}} core {{surrounded by}} a fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E

5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

Probable candidate genes like type I collagen (sp1 site), type IX collagen, vitamin D receptor, aggrecan, asporin, MMP3, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 polymorphisms have been implicated in disc degeneration.

25|$|The {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{accounts for}} 80–90% of scoliosis cases. Its pathogenesis is unknown. However, {{changes in the}} vestibular system, a lateral shift of the hand representation and abnormal variability of erector spinae motor map location in the motor cortex {{may be involved in}} this disease. Besides, idiopathic scoliosis being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of idiopathic scoliosis through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in idiopathic scoliosis, although these are perhaps results rather than causes.|$|E
25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the molecules involved in extracellular matrix remodeling {{and to identify}} and quantify heparanase isoforms present in herniated and degenerative discs. INTRODUCTION: Heparanase is an endo-beta-glucuronidase that specifically acts upon the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans. However, heparanase expression in degenerative <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> {{has not yet been}} evaluated. Notably, previous studies demonstrated a correlation between changes in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan pattern and the degenerative process associated with <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs.</b> METHODS: Twenty-nine samples of <b>intervertebral</b> degenerative <b>discs,</b> 23 samples of herniated discs and 12 samples of non-degenerative discs were analyzed. The expression of both heparanase isoforms (heparanase- 1 and heparanase- 2) was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and real-time RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Heparanase- 1 and heparanase- 2 expression levels were significantly higher in the herniated and degenerative discs in comparison to the control tissues, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in the intervertebral degenerative process. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of heparanase isoforms in the degenerative <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> and the herniated discs suggests a potential role of both proteins in the mediation of inflammatory processes and in extracellular matrix remodeling. The heparanase- 2 isoform may be involved in normal metabolic processes, as evidenced by its higher expression in the control <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> relative to the expression of heparanase- 1...|$|R
40|$|The <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> undergo {{profound}} changes in {{structure and composition}} during development and aging. They also degenerate much earlier than other cartilaginous tissues, and in severe cases may lose function completely.

25|$|Biofilms {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc.</b> More recently it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization at the bedside to permit timely initiation of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc),</b> or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The intervertebral discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and intervertebral disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: There is {{controversy}} regarding which {{imaging method}} {{is best for}} identifying early degenerative alterations in <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs.</b> No correlations between such methods and histological finds are presented in the literature. The {{aim of this study}} was to correlate the thickness of <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> measured on simple radiographs with the degree of degeneration seen on magnetic resonance images and the histological findings relating to nerve ends inside the discs. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional correlation study on the lumbar spines of human cadavers, at Universidade Federal de São Paulo (Unifesp), São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: Ten lumbar spinal columns were extracted from human cadavers and subjected to magnetic resonance imaging and simple radiography. They were classified according to the degree of disc degeneration seen on magnetic resonance, and the thickness of the discs was measured on radiographs. The <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> were then extracted, embedded in paraffin and analyzed immunohistochemically with protein S 100, and the nerve fibers were counted and classified. RESULTS: No correlation was observed between the thickness of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs</b> and the degree of degeneration seen on magnetic resonance images. Only the uppermost lumbar discs (L 1 /L 2 and L 2 /L 3) presented a correlation between their thickness and type I and IV nerve endings. CONCLUSION: Reduced disc thickness is unrelated to increased presence of nerve ends in <b>intervertebral</b> <b>discs,</b> or to the degree of disc degeneration...|$|R

2500|$|Most authors favour {{degeneration}} of the <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> as {{the major}} cause of spinal disc herniation and cite trauma as a low cause. [...] Disc degeneration occurs both with degenerative disc disease and aging. With degeneration, {{the contents of the}} disc, the nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus, are exposed to altered loads. [...] Specifically, the nucleus becomes fibrous and stiff and less able to bear load. [...] The load is transferred to the anulus, which, if it fails to bear the increased load, can lead to the development of fissures. [...] If the fissures reach the periphery of the anulus, the nuclear material can pass through as a disc herniation.|$|E
2500|$|The lumbosacral joint, {{between the}} sacrum {{and the last}} lumbar vertebra, has, like all vertebal joints, an <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc,</b> {{anterior}} and posterior ligaments, ligamenta flava, interspinous and supraspinous ligaments, and synovial joints between the articular processes of the two bones. [...] In addition to these ligaments the joint is strengthened by the iliolumbar and lateral lumbosacral ligaments. [...] The iliolumbar ligament passes between {{the tip of the}} transverse process of the fifth lumbar vertebra and the posterior part of the iliac crest. [...] The lateral lumbosacral ligament, partly continuous with the iliolumbar ligament, passes down from the lower border of the transverse process of the fifth vertebra to the ala of the sacrum. [...] The movements possible in the lumbosacral joint are flexion and extension, a small amount of lateral flexion (from 7 degrees in childhood to 1 degree in adults), but no axial rotation. [...] Between ages 2–13 the joint is responsible for as much as 75% (about 18 degrees) of flexion and extension in the lumbar spine. From age 35 the ligaments considerably limit the range of motions.|$|E
2500|$|Adding {{injury to}} the many insults hurled at Jerry Jones, Tony Romo and the Cowboys {{organization}} in general, Tony Romo did not play well during two preseason starts after receiving {{only a small percentage}} of snaps throughout training camp, due to continuing recovery from off-season surgery to repair a herniated <b>intervertebral</b> <b>disc</b> in his lower back.
