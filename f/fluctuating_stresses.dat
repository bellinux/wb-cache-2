When a flow is turbulent, one observes a randomly fluctuating velocity field superimposed on a mean flow (contrast with a laminar flow, in which the fluid motion is ordered and smooth). The fluctuating velocity field gives rise to <b>fluctuating</b> <b>stresses</b> (both tangential and normal) that act on the air-water interface. The normal stress, or fluctuating pressure acts as a forcing term (much like pushing a swing introduces a forcing term). If the frequency and wavenumber [...] of this forcing term match a mode of vibration of the capillary-gravity wave (as derived above), {{then there is a}} resonance, and the wave grows in amplitude.

40|$|The wind-excited {{vibrations}} {{of structures}} induce <b>fluctuating</b> <b>stresses</b> {{that lead to}} fatigue damage accumulation and may determine structural failure without exceeding ultimate strength. This paper proposes a mathematical model aimed at deriving the histogram of the stress cycles, the accumulated damage, and the fatigue life of slender vertical structures exposed to simultaneous alongwind and crosswind vibrations. Wind climate is modeled by the joint density function of the mean wind velocity and direction. Wind-induced actions consist of aerodynamic forces on the stationary structure and of aeroelastic forces due to the structural motion. Aerodynamic actions on the stationary structure are caused by the turbulence of the oncoming flow, dealt with through quasisteady theory, and by the vortex wake, considered as independent from turbulence. Aeroelastic forces are aimed at reproducing the lock-in phenomenon. The static and the quasistatic parts of the structural response are evaluated by the influence function technique, taking all modes of vibrations into consideration. The resonant part of the response {{is related to the}} fundamental alongwind and crosswind modes only. The probabilistic accumulation of damage due to aerodynamic actions on stationary structures is estimated by a counting cycle method inspired by narrow band processes. The damage in lock-in conditions is superimposed by counting stress cycles deterministically. The examples illustrate the application and the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, focusing attention on the role of upper modes and wind directionality...|$|E
40|$|A CONSIDERATION of the {{mechanical}} behavior of textile materials reveals that there is great need for a rational, impartial test {{of the behavior of}} textiles when subjected to shock loads. Mechanical tests are made on materials for two pur-poses. The tests may be standard commercial tests to determine whether a given material possesses certain specified properties as shown by these tests, or they may be special tests to evaluate new materials or new appli-cations of existing materials. In the first case it is merely necessary that there be some correlation between the behavior in the tests and service behavior. In the latter case the tests should represent, but not necessarily imitate, service conditions. A test should be so designed that it is impartial, that is, it should not be influenced by the peculiarities of the design of the machine or by irre- ’ levant characteristics of the material being tested. The most common type of mechanical test is the ten-sile test, in which the tensile load to break the specimen is measured, and sometimes the elongation at rupture also. In commercial testing machines the load is applied fairly slowly, the time to rupture usually being of the order of one minute.

Results are presented which {{show that the}} erosion rate of sprayed compared to sintered tungsten carbide-cobalt-chrome is similar for low energy impacts but the sintered material outperforms by 4 times the sprayed material for high energy impacts. This reflects the anisotropic microstructure of the thermally sprayed coating with a preferred crack propagation parallel to the coating surface followed by crack interlinking and spalling. This is the dominant erosion mechanism present. A minor erosion mechanism consists of micro-cutting and ploughing at low angles of particle impact. The coatings have a relatively high density of defects including thermal stress induced transverse cracks, voids, oxides, and grit blasting remnants. Such defects are shown to accelerate the erosion process considerably because they aid crack initiation and growth leading to partial, mono or multi-splat spalling of loose material. The influence of slurry jet angle {{was found to be}} more pronounced under low energy conditions where maximum erosion occurred at 90 ° and the minimum at 30 ° in contrast to the high energy erosion rates which were independent of jet angle.

Here, we focus on approximating the propagator tensor by determining an appropriate asymptotic solution to the adjoint vector Green’s function that it depends on by using an asymptotic approach at all frequencies of interest for jet noise prediction. The Green’s function is then rationally approximated by a composite formula in which the GSA (Goldstein-Sescu-Afsar, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 695, pp. 199 - 234, 2012) non-parallel flow Green’s function asymptotic solution is used at low frequencies and the O(1) frequency parallel flow Green’s function is used for all frequencies thereafter. The former solution uses the fact that non-parallelism will have a leading order effect on the Green’s function everywhere in the jet under a distinguished scaling in which the jet spread rate is of the same order as the Strouhal number for a slowly-diverging mean flow expansion. Since this solution, however, is expected to apply up to the peak frequency, the latter O(1) frequency Green’s function in a parallel flow must be used at frequencies thereafter. We investigate the predictive capability of the composite Green’s function for the prediction of supersonic axi-symmetric round jets at fixed jet Mach number of 1. 5 and two different temperature ratios (isothermal & heated) using Large-eddy simulation data. Our results show that, in the first instance, excellent jet noise predictions are obtained using the non-parallel flow asymptotic approach, remarkably, up to a Strouhal number of 0. 5. This is true for both heated and un-heated jets. Furthermore, we develop the analytical approach required to extend this solution by appropriate asymptotic approximation to O(1) frequencies...|$|R
