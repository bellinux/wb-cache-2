40|$|Speech {{given at}} Session 2 : World Communication: Where is Technology Leading Us? In {{many ways it}} does not make much sense if, say, you are setting up a {{business}} to go to one source <b>for</b> <b>your</b> legal <b>guidance,</b> another source <b>for</b> <b>your</b> accounting <b>guidance,</b> and another source <b>for</b> <b>your</b> financial advice. It will all come together, and lawyers may indeed be the people who bring that together into multidisciplinary services, bringing together the information that people require in their real-world circumstances. We will no longer package or present our guidance in the traditional legal categories, but we will aim them toward the market and we will work with other professions, combining their expertise as well. If you are a customer or a client of these kinds of information services, this is a great improvement.
