Such systems accumulate in time large amounts of information useful for process accounting and auditing. We study how software developers can get insight in this information {{in order to understand}} the project context and the product artifacts. To this end, we propose several new techniques for visual mining of project evolution. Central to our approach is a file-based evolution visualization, where each project is shown as a set of <b>horizontal</b> stripes depicting <b>files</b> along the time axis. We propose several mechanisms for interactively building layouts in this display, and for correlating the evolution with the results of various software metrics. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on real- life data sets...|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} with the TROP parameter, the spatial characteristics of the GRAD parameter are less well defined (Fig.  5; Additional file 3 : Figure S 3; Additional file 4 : Figure S 4). The frequency histograms, however, show clear characteristics in each day. For example, {{in the case of}} March 10, the frequency histograms of the optimum GRAD parameter for the horizontal components clearly show broader distributions compared to the TROP parameter for the vertical component (Fig.  6). In contrast, the frequency histogram for July 4 clearly shows the steep characteristic for the <b>horizontal</b> components (Additional <b>file</b> 5 : Figure S 5 (b, d)). Weather conditions on July 4 were strongly influenced by the passage of a cold front, such that the obtained results should reflect these weather conditions.|$|R

40|$|Much of {{software}} developers’ {{time is spent}} understanding unfamiliar code. To better understand how developers gain this understanding and how software development environments might be involved, a study was performed in which developers were given an unfamiliar program and asked to work on two debugging tasks and three enhancement tasks for 70 minutes. The study found that developers interleaved three activities. They began by searching for relevant code both manually and using search tools; however, they based their searches on limited and misrepresentative cues in the code, environment, and executing program, often leading to failed searches. When developers found relevant code, they followed its incoming and outgoing dependencies, often returning to it and navigating its other dependencies; while doing so, however, Eclipse’s navigational tools caused significant overhead. Developers collected code and other information that they believed {{would be necessary to}} edit, duplicate, or otherwise refer to later by encoding it in the interactive state of Eclipse’s package explorer, <b>file</b> tabs, and <b>scroll</b> bars. However, developers lost track of relevant code as these interfaces were used for other tasks, and developers were forced to find it again. These issues caused developers to spend, on average, 35 percent of their time performing the mechanics of navigation within and between source files. These observations suggest a new model of program understanding grounded in theories of information foraging and suggest ideas for tools that help developers seek, relate, and collect information in a more effective and explicit manner...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} a study the fabrication and characterization of photon radiation detectors. The {{focus has been}} to develop and improve the performance of optical measurement systems, but also to reduce their cost. The work {{is based on the}} study of two types of detectors, the position sensitive detector and the thermal detector. Infrared detectors are usually subcategorized into photonic detectors and thermal detectors. In the thermal detectors, heat generated from the incident infrared radiation is converted into an electrical output by some sensitive element. The basic structure of these detectors consists of a temperature sensitive element connected to a heat sink through a thermally isolating structure. Thin membranes of Silicon and Silicon nitride have been commonly used as thermally insulation between the heat sink and the sensitive elements. However, these materials suffer from relatively high thermal conductivity, which lowers the response of the detector. The fabrication of these membranes also requires rather advanced processing techniques and equipment. SU- 8 is an epoxy based photoresist, which has low thermal conductivity and requires only standard photolithography. A new application of SU- 8 as a self-supported membrane in a thermal detector is presented. This application is demonstrated by the fabrication and characterization of both an infrared sensitive thermopile and a bolometer detector. The bolometer consists of nickel resistances connected in a Wheatstone bridge configuration, whereas the thermopile uses serially interconnected Ti/Ni thermocouple junctions. The position sensitive detectors include the lateral effect photodiodes and the quadrant detectors. Typical applications for these detectors are distance measurements and as centering devices. In the quadrant detectors, the active region consists of four pn-junctions separated by a narrow gap. The size of the active region in these detectors depends {{on the size of the}} light spot. In outdoor application, this spot size dependence degrades the performance of the four-quadrant detectors. In this thesis, a modified four-quadrant detector having the pn-junctions separated by a larger distance has been fabricated and characterized. By separating the pn-junctions the <b>horizontal</b> electric <b>filed</b> in the active region is removed, making the detector spot size insensitive. Linearity of the lateral effect photodiodes depends on the uniformity of the resistive layer in the active region. The introduction of mechanical stress in an LPSD results in a resistance change mainly due to resistivity changes, and this affects the linearity of the detector. Measurements and simulations, where mechanical stress is applied to LPSDs are presented, and support this conclusion...|$|R
