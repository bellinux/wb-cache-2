25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody <b>ever</b> <b>let</b> me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
25|$|The first {{collaboration}} among the future Faces {{was in a}} formation called Quiet Melon, which also featured Wood's older brother Art Wood and Kim Gardner; they recorded four songs and played a few shows in May 1969, during a break in Ronnie Wood's and Rod Stewart's commitments with The Jeff Beck Group. Later that summer Wood and Stewart parted ways with Beck and joined Lane, McLagan and Jones full-time. Prior to any releases by the new Faces lineup, Wood and McLagan appeared on Stewart's first solo album in 1969, An Old Raincoat Won't <b>Ever</b> <b>Let</b> You Down (known as The Rod Stewart Album in the US). The rest of the backing band on the album included drummer Micky Waller, keyboardist Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).|$|E
25|$|In 1969, after Steve Marriott {{left the}} Small Faces, Wood {{began working with}} the {{remaining}} members of that group, returning to his instrument of choice, the guitar. This line-up, plus Rod Stewart and former Bird Kim Gardner, teamed up with Wood's brother Art Wood in a formation called Quiet Melon, making a handful of recordings in May 1969. After the Jeff Beck Group's fifth US tour in July, Wood and Stewart joined the former Small Faces full-time, and the band's name was changed to Faces. During the summer of 1969, Stewart and Wood also set the template for what would become The Faces on An Old Raincoat Won't <b>Ever</b> <b>Let</b> You Down, Stewart's first solo album (known as The Rod Stewart Album in the US). The backing band on the album also included Ian McLagan, Keith Emerson, Micky Waller and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer and later Armageddon and 7th Order), and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).|$|E

25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other {{producer}} available or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but to}} either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he <b>ever</b> <b>let</b> on.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{legislative}} proposals of the [...] "Stanley plan," [...] the Washington Post reported, were {{worked out}} at a secret meeting on July 2 in the United States House Committee on Rules hearing room in the United States Capitol. At the meeting were Abbitt, Byrd, Gray, Smith, Tuck, Stanley, and seven Southside state legislators. The group agreed to a five-point legislative program: 1) No public school integration would be tolerated in Virginia; 2) School districts which integrated would lose state funding; 3) The state law permitting school districts to be sued would be repealed; 4) The power to assign students to schools would {{be taken away from}} local school boards and transferred to the governor; and 5) The governor would have the power to close any school district which integrated. Despite the group's many public statements supporting local control of schools, Tuck later remarked {{that the purpose of the}} plan was to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia: [...] "If they [...] won't stand with us then I say make 'em. We cannot compromise. ... If you <b>ever</b> <b>let</b> them integrate anywhere the whole state will be integrated in a short time." [...] Byrd in particular was a vocal supporter of the school closing proposal, and helped draft the other proposals in the plan.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was {{particularly}} respected for his naturalism on screen. Hume Cronyn, {{who worked with}} Tracy on The Seventh Cross, admired his co-star's screen presence: [...] "His method appeared to {{be as simple as}} it is difficult to achieve. He appeared to do nothing. He listened, he felt, he said the words without forcing anything." [...] Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy's seemingly effortless performances. His four-time co-star Joan Bennett said, [...] "One never had the feeling he was 'acting' in a scene, {{but the truth of the}} situation was actually happening, spontaneously, at the moment he spoke his lines." [...] James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists, because [...] "You can't mimic reserve and control very well" [...] and [...] "there's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can't be mimicked." [...] Specifically, Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills. Barry Nelson said that Tracy [...] "brought the art of reacting to a new height"; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy [...] "thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures". Millard Kaufman noted that [...] " [...] listened with every fiber of his entire body". Burt Reynolds, in But Enough About Me, similarly noted Tracy's emphasis on naturalism when, as a rookie actor, he observed Tracy on the sets of Inherit the Wind. When Reynolds later introduced himself to Tracy as an actor, Tracy replied, [...] "An actor, huh? Just remember not to <b>ever</b> <b>let</b> anyone catch you at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|An Old Raincoat Won't <b>Ever</b> <b>Let</b> You Down became Stewart's {{first solo}} album in 1969 (it {{was known as}} The Rod Stewart Album in the US). It {{established}} the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of folk, rock, and country blues, inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material ("Cindy's Lament" [...] and the title song) and cover versions (Ewan MacColl's [...] "Dirty Old Town" [...] and Mike d'Abo's [...] "Handbags and Gladrags"). The backing band on the album included Wood, Waller and McLagan, plus Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer).|$|E
2500|$|With his {{distinctive}} raspy singing voice, Stewart came {{to prominence}} in the late 1960s and the early 1970s with The Jeff Beck Group, and then with Faces, though his music career had begun in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In October 1963, he joined the Dimensions as a harmonica player and part-time vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars, and in August, Stewart signed a solo contract, releasing his first single, [...] "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl", in October. He maintained a solo career alongside a group career, releasing his debut solo album, An Old Raincoat Won't <b>Ever</b> <b>Let</b> You Down in 1969. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R.|$|E
2500|$|His sheer energy {{helped to}} revolutionise the often stuffy world of Victorian journalism, while his blend of sensationalism and indignation, now so familiar, {{set the tone}} for British tabloids for more than a century. Like many journalists, he was a curious mixture of conviction, opportunism and sheer humbug. According to his biographer W. Sydney Robinson, [...] "He twisted facts, invented stories, lied, betrayed confidences, but always with a genuine desire to reform the world - and himself." [...] According to Dominic Sandbrook, [...] "Stead's papers forced his readers to confront the seedy underbelly of their own civilisation, but the editor {{probably}} knew more about that dark world than he <b>ever</b> <b>let</b> on. He held up a mirror to Victorian society, yet deep down, like so many tabloid crusaders, he was raging at his own reflection." ...|$|E

2500|$|One Day is a sparse, tersely written {{narrative}} {{of a single}} day of the ten-year labor camp imprisonment of a fictitious Soviet prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had first-hand experience in the Gulag system, having been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for writing derogatory comments in letters to friends about {{the conduct of the}} war by Joseph Stalin, whom he referred to by epithets [...] such as [...] "the master" [...] and [...] "the boss". Solzhenitsyn claimed the prisoners wept when news of Stalin's death reached them. He uses the epithet [...] "old man whiskers" [...] in his novel, where it is translated as [...] "Old Whiskers" [...] or [...] "Old Man Whiskers". This title was considered offensive and derogatory, but prisoners were free to call Stalin whatever they liked: [...] "Somebody in the room was bellowing: 'Old Man Whiskers won't <b>ever</b> <b>let</b> you go! He wouldn't trust his own brother, let alone a bunch of cretins like you!" [...] Drafts of stories found in Solzhenitsyn's map case were used to incriminate him (Frangsmyr, 1993).|$|E
