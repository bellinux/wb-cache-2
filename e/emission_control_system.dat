5000|$|For 1975, a {{catalytic}} converter {{was added to}} the exhaust system of all US-market GM passenger cars, including the Camaro.

50|$|An Onboard {{refueling}} {{vapor recovery}} system (ORVR) is a vehicle fuel vapor <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> that captures volatile organic compounds (VOC, potentially harmful vapors) during refueling. There {{are two types of}} vehicle emission control systems: the ORVR, and the Stage II vapor recovery system. Without either of these two systems, fuel vapors trapped inside gas tanks would be released into the atmosphere, each time refueling of the vehicle occurred. However, an ORVR system is able to retain those emissions, delivering them to the vehicle's carbon-filled canister and then to dispose of those vapors by adding them to the engine intake manifold and the stream of fuel supplying the engine, during normal operation. The goal behind implementing the ORVR system throughout the U.S. is to eventually make the Stage II systems obsolete.|$|E

50|$|A NOx {{adsorber}} {{is designed}} to reduce oxides of nitrogen emitted in the exhaust gas of a lean burn internal combustion engine. Lean burn engines, particularly diesels, present a special challenge to <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> designers because of the relatively high levels of O2 (atmospheric oxygen) in the exhaust gas. The 3-way catalytic converter that has been successfully used since the 1980s on stoichiometric engines (such as fueled by petrol, LPG, CNG, or ethanol) will not function at O2 levels in excess of 1.0%, and does not function well at levels above 0.5%. Because of the increasing need to limit NOx emissions from diesel engines, technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) have been used, however EGR is of limited effectiveness and SCR requires a continuous supply of reductant to the exhaust.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{handed over to}} the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust (SHFT) on 23 July 2005, and is {{currently}} closed to public. The SHFT has carried out extensive works on site, remediation of the ground contamination and buildings. The first stage of the remediation project included above ground works, demolition of a three storey building at the north of the site and part of the wharf, removal of hazardous materials, repairs to the seawall and remaining wharf. A large odour control enclosure, an <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and water treatment plant were constructed for the remediation works. Around 3,000 tonnes of tar-containing materials were excavated and removed by barge for off-site disposal. An additional 27,000 tonnes of material remained for on-site treatment and stabilisation. This remaining material was then used to backfill the excavated area and to create a mound capped with clean soil, forming the base for a future public park at the northern end of the site.|$|E
5000|$|Changes for 1968 were {{relatively}} subtle. The park and turn {{lights in the}} grille were moved slightly inboard and made round.

Shoulder harnesses (separate, this year and until 1973, from the lap belts) and non-glare matte finish on the windshield wiper arms were also part of the 1968 federally mandated safety package. Chrysler's [...] "Clean Air Package" [...] <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> became standard equipment on cars sold in all 50 states. The steering linkage was revised again, as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim-lock strips, leaving the 1967 pieces as one-year-only items. The standard rear axle ratio was dropped from 2.93 to 2.76 with all standard-performance engines and automatic transmission. Part-throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the TorqueFlite automatic transmission in 6-cylinder cars, to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio.|$|E

5000|$|Catalytic {{converters}} {{restrict the}} free flow of exhaust, which negatively affects vehicle performance and fuel economy, especially in older cars. Because early cars' carburetors were incapable of precise fuel-air mixture control, the cars' catalytic converters could overheat and ignite flammable materials under the car. A 2006 test on a 1999 Honda Civic showed that removing the stock catalytic converter netted a 3% increase in horsepower; a new metallic core converter only cost the car 1% horsepower, compared to no converter. To some performance enthusiasts, this modest increase in power for very little cost encourages the removal or [...] "gutting" [...] of the catalytic converter. In such cases, the converter may be replaced by a welded-in section of ordinary pipe or a flanged [...] "test pipe", ostensibly meant to check if the converter is clogged, by comparing how the engine runs with and without the converter. This facilitates temporary reinstallation of the converter in order to pass an emission test. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to remove or disable a catalytic converter for any reason other than its direct and immediate replacement. In the United States, for example, it is a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(A) of the 1990 Clean Air Act for a vehicle repair shop to remove a converter from a vehicle, or cause a converter to be removed from a vehicle, except in order to replace it with another converter, and Section 203(a)(3)(B) makes it illegal for any person to sell or to install any part that would bypass, defeat or render inoperative any <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> device or design element. Vehicles without functioning catalytic converters generally fail emission inspections. The automotive aftermarket supplies high-flow converters for vehicles with upgraded engines, or whose owners prefer an exhaust system with larger-than-stock capacity.|$|E
