40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the efficiency of}} the Japanese banking system utilising the slacks-based measure. In addition, we also extend the comparative bank modelling methodology literature by utilising both the intermediation and production approaches, together with the profit/revenue-based approach, proposed in [Berger, A. N., Mester, L. J., 2003. Explaining the dramatic changes in performance of US banks: technological change, deregulation, and dynamic changes in competition. J. <b>Financial</b> <b>Intermed.</b> 12, 57 - 95]. We find that, across the three methodologies, there are marked differences in: mean efficiency scores; the dispersion of efficiency scores; and the ranking of banks and bank sectors. Hence, the results demonstrate a very high degree of modelling dependence, which has importance in the context of policy responses. Efficiency Japanese banking...|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written in recent years about the changes in {{corporate}} strategies and industry structures associated with electronic coordination of market activities. This paper considers the ad- vent of electronic market coordination in the home mortgage industry, focusing on Computerized Loan Originat/on (CLO) systems. Case studies of five CLOs (First Boston's Shelternet, PFtC's LoanExpress, American Financial Net- work's Ftennie Mae, Prudential's CLOS, and Citicorp's Mortgage Power Plus) reveal a range of system functional/ties. Predictions from the Electronic Markets Hypothesis (EMH) are tested against the empirical results of the five case studies. As suggested by the EMH, <b>financial</b> <b>intermed</b> /aries have been threatened by the in- troduction of CLOS, {{and in some cases}} opposition has been mounted against the systems. On the other hand, despite the availability of the technology and mortgages' seemingly favorable characteristics as an elec- tronically mediated market product, the industry has not been fundamentally changed by the introduction of these systems, despite {{more than a decade of}} experience with them. Of the two case studies that could be characterized as elec- tronic markets, neither continues to exist in that form today. And the system with the largest dollar volume of mortgages of the five is best characterized as an electronic hierarchy. These results suggest that either the full results predicted by the EMH require a longer gestation period or that the underlying hypothesis will require augmentation in order to fully explain the results in the home mortgage market...|$|E

The accurate and efficient economic resources management contributes decisively toimproving performance. The paper presents an econometric model that shows the link betweeneconomic performance and patrimony management reflected {{through a series of}} indicators, such as thereturn on current assets, fixed assets ratio and the funding structure of capitals (<b>financial</b> leverage). <b>Interms</b> of research tools, we used techniques of regression analysis based on specialized software. Theobtained results allow drawing conclusions about the elements upon which decision makers shouldintervene in order to increase economic performance. economic performance, regression analysis, modelling, patrimony management...|$|R
