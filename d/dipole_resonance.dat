Over a long period, detailed theoretical {{models for the}} giant <b>dipole</b> <b>resonances</b> were proposed and low energy electron accelerators were constructed to perform experiments to test their veracity. More recently, through laser and "smart" material devices, electrons have been accelerated in condensed matter systems up to several tens of MeV. We discuss here the possibility of inducing electro-disintegration of nuclei through such devices. It involves a synthesis of electromagnetic and strong forces in condensed matter via giant <b>dipole</b> <b>resonances</b> to give an effective "electro-strong interaction" - a large coupling of electromagnetic and strong interactions {{in the tens of}} MeV range.

50|$|Neutrons are {{produced}} when photons above the nuclear binding {{energy of a}} substance are incident on that substance, causing it to undergo giant <b>dipole</b> <b>resonance</b> after which it either emits a neutron (photoneutron) or undergoes fission (photofission). The number of neutrons released by each fission event {{is dependent on the}} substance. Typically photons begin to produce neutrons on interaction with normal matter at energies of about 7 to 40 MeV, which means that radiotherapy facilities using megavoltage X-rays also produce neutrons, and some require neutron shielding. In addition, electrons of energy over about 50 MeV may induce giant <b>dipole</b> <b>resonance</b> in nuclides by a mechanism which is the inverse of internal conversion, and thus produce neutrons by a mechanism similar to that of photoneutrons.|$|E

Since the end of the 1970s, Brown worked on bag models of nucleons (Chiral bag model). Toward the end of Bethe's life, Bethe told Brown to explain his work {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E

5000|$|Clarification:There are {{a number}} of {{experimental}} works published previously to the 1975 Göttingen experiment (or even to the Desy 1973 one). Most notable Jackson and Wetzel in 1969 and Moreh and Kahane in 1973. In both these works use was made of higher energy gamma rays compared with the Göttingen one, conferring a higher contribution of the Delbrück scattering to the overall measured cross section. In general, in the low energy nuclear physics region i.e. < 10-20 MeV, a Delbrück experiment measures a number of competing coherent processes including also Rayleigh scattering from electrons, Thomson scattering from the point nucleus and nuclear excitation via the Giant <b>Dipole</b> <b>Resonance.</b> Apart from the Thomson scattering which is well known, the other two (namely Rayleigh and GDR) have considerable uncertainties. The interference of these effects with Delbrück is by no means [...] "minor" [...] (again [...] "at classical nuclear physics energies"). Even at very forward scattering angles, where Delbrück is very strong, there is a substantial interference with the Rayleigh scattering, the amplitudes of both effects being of the same order of magnitude (see [...] ).|$|E

The nanocylinders not only increase the absorption of infrared light with a wavelength of 980 nm but also enhance the emission of visible light with a wavelength of 660 nm through surface plasmons and electric <b>dipole</b> <b>resonances.</b> The absorbance of the UC material can be enhanced by coupling with the surface plasmons and coupling with the MDs of each nanocylinder.

40|$|High-refractive index {{dielectric}} nanoparticles may exhibit strong directional forward {{light scattering}} at visible and near-infrared wavelengths due to interference of simultaneously excited electric and magnetic <b>dipole</b> <b>resonances.</b> For a spherical high-index dielectric, the so-called first Kerker's condition can be realized, {{at which the}} backward scattering practically vanishes for some combination of refractive index and particle size. However, Kerker's condition for spherical particles is only possible at {{the tail of the}} scattering resonances, when the particle scatters light weakly. Here we demonstrate that significantly higher forward scattering can be realized if spheroidal particles are considered instead. For each value of refractive index exists an optimum shape of the particle, which produces minimum backscattering efficiency together with maximum forward scattering. This effect is achieved due to the overlapping of magnetic and electric <b>dipole</b> <b>resonances</b> of the spheroidal particle at the resonance frequency. It permits the design of very efficient, low-loss optical nanoantennas. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
