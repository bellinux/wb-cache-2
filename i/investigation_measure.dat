40|$|Abstract—The {{survey of}} {{expressway}} service level in China awaits upgrading nowadays. This article proposes that respondents herein cover drivers of travelers and goods transport, transport managerial, passengers, sedan drivers etc, {{in the view}} of consumers of road commodity networking. And the respondent weight is determined by questionnaire numbers and difficulty level for sample taking. The preliminary survey, proceeded with on-the-spot questionnaire and discussions with transport enterprises, suggests a focus of investigation upon consummation and satisfaction of services in transit, toll station, traffic information, along with placement of service area and its parking lot, and customer convenience. Finally, a survey cost forecasting model is put forward, according to the optimal allocation out of stratified sampling, and the stratified sample size is affirmed. Namely, the response rate renders the bulk sample coordination. The proposed <b>investigation</b> <b>measure</b> provingly reveals the factual expressway service status, based on its low cost, high availability and easy usage. 4 tabs, 1 fig, 5 refs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the position of the defence in a criminal case under the Initiative for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters of 29 April 2010. This proposal is under ongoing discussion at the European Union level and aims to increase efficiency in cross- border cooperation on obtaining evidence in criminal matters. Mutual recognition is the key word on which this cooperation is based. Any new evidence-gathering instrument must safeguard human rights, including the rights of the defence. This work concentrates particularly on the <b>investigation</b> <b>measure</b> of hearing a witness. In this regard, the relevant specific defence rights and their interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice are revealed. Subsequently, the potential execution of the new instrument of a European Investigation Order is scrutinised in light of these observations. The results suggest concerns regarding the form and content of the current provisions of the Initiative from a defence perspective. Moreover, general counterbalancing measures are absent, rendering the new Proposal non-proportional to the aim it is willing to achieve. The principal conclusion is that alternative scenarios should be established in order to balance all the interests involved. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
40|$|The Great Wall is {{an ancient}} Chinese {{fortification}} against the raids of nomadic tribes and is the longest human building in the world, built over 2000 years and 10 dynasties in the Chinese history, and stretching over more than 10, 000 km. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. There are no precise and full recordings about the Great Wall, resulting in the difficulty of preservation, research, exploration {{and management of the}} Great Wall. It has important practical significance on how to measure scientifically the length of the longest human building in the world and issue the important geographic information related to the Great Wall such as the length, distribution, etc. The paper presents the method of measuring the Ming Great Wall based on image with the technology support of the field investigation and photogrammetry. The key technology of the method is to interpret and identify the Great Wall based on ortho-image dababase, testify the attribute and distribution by the field <b>investigation,</b> <b>measure</b> the surface length by the photogrammetry. The test result shows that the measuring accuracy of the surface length of the Ming Great Wall (5000 km) will be 0. 866 km based on the method. The method has been used by the 10 provincial bureau of surveying and mapping along the Ming Great Wall. 1...|$|E

But such an impression, it will be contended, is obscuring the recalibration of ECHR rights that has occurred, easing the path to the introduction of the enhanced version of TPIMs, under the Enhanced Terrorism Prevention and <b>Investigation</b> <b>Measures</b> Bill.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} UK government’s use of anti-terrorism control orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) 2005 between March 2005 and December 2011. Control orders, {{a form of}} {{preventive}} civil order, were used to impose a range of often stringent ‘obligations’ on individuals who were suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity but who, for either legal or practical reasons, could not be prosecuted or deported. The study examines the central features of the PTA’s statutory scheme and provides {{a detailed analysis of}} the control order regime’s conformity, in principle and in practice, with the rights enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and incorporated into UK law through the Human Rights Act 1998. In addition to critiquing the operation of the regime from a human rights perspective, a consequentialist analysis is employed in order to evaluate the practical efficacy of control orders as a mechanism for ‘protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism’. Following the change of government in 2010, control orders were replaced by the new, although in many ways similar, Terrorism Prevention and <b>Investigation</b> <b>Measures</b> (TPIMs) under the Terrorism Prevention and <b>Investigation</b> <b>Measures</b> Act 2011. Whether the transition from control orders to TPIMs can, from a human rights and/or security point of view, be deemed a positive development is considered. In addition, the current and prospective future utility of TPIMs as a component of the United Kingdom’s legal response to the threat of terrorism is assessed...|$|R

In 2004, the Law Lords ruled that this violated European law, but it {{was replaced by the}} system of control orders in the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which provided the Government with powers to place various restrictions on suspected terrorists. The 2005 Act was subsequently replaced by the Terrorism Prevention and <b>Investigation</b> <b>Measures</b> Act 2011. Many Islamists may have left the UK to avoid internment,.
