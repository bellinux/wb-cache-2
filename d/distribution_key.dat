But while in today's leagues the hosting teams keep the cash from the ticket sales, this was handled differently in the Gauligen. In the regular season, in cup matches or other competitive matches, the money was shared between the German Football Association, who received 5% of the income, the hosting club and the hosted club. In particular, the hosting club received 10% for using their ground and 5% for administrative costs. The remaining 75% of the matchday income were shared between the two clubs. These relations changed for the play-offs for the German championship. Here the matches were usually played on neutral ground, therefore 15% of the income were allotted for renting the ground, administrative cost and travel cost for the teams. The remaining income was divided equally between the clubs and the DFB. For the semi-final and final matches, yet another <b>distribution</b> <b>key</b> was applied. In the semi-final, teams received 20% of the net income (that is, after rent, administrative and travel costs had been deducted) and in the final their share was reduced to 15%.|$|E

5000|$|The Carnot {{method is}} an {{allocation}} procedure for dividing up fuel input (primary energy, end energy) in joint production processes that generate {{two or more}} energy products in one process (e.g. cogeneration or trigeneration). It is also suited to allocate other streams such as CO2-emissions or variable costs. The potential to generate mechanical or electrical work (exergy) is used as the <b>distribution</b> <b>key.</b> For heat this potential can be assessed the Carnot efficiency. Thus, the Carnot method {{is a form of}} an exergetic allocation method. It uses mean heat grid temperatures at the output of the process as a calculation basis. The main application area of this method is cogeneration, {{but it can also be}} applied to other processes generating a joint products, such as a chiller generating cold and producing waste heat which could be used for low temperature heat demand. The Carnot method's advantage is that no external reference values are required to allocate the input to the different output streams; only endogenous process parameters are needed. Thus, the allocation results remain unbiased of assumptions or external reference values that are open for discussion.|$|E

40|$|How to {{establish}} secure session keys {{is one of}} the central tasks for wireless sensor network communications. General <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes for traditional computer networks could not be directly shifted to wireless sensor network environments as broadcast messages may be lost due to sensor network internal factors or external attacks. Self-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> schemes, therefore, have been proposed to address packet loss issues since 2002. The essential issue that self-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> mechanism addressed is the fixed-number of broadcast messages (excluding the last broadcast message) loss. In other words, a node could not recover its new session keys if a node has missed more than a fixed number broadcast messages or the last broadcast message in a self-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme for wireless sensor networks. This paper aims to address this emerged issue and provide a new <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme: mutual-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme for wireless sensor networks. This mutual-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> can enable a node in a wireless sensor network to recover its new session key although its last broadcast message was lost. A formal definition for mutual-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> will also be proposed in this paper. The proposed mutual-healing <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> scheme is based on bilinear pairings. The scheme is collusion-free for any coalition of non-authorized nodes.
