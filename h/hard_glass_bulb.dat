40|$|DE 1004011976 A UPAB: 20051109 NOVELTY - The {{illuminant}} has an illuminating {{body that}} {{is surrounded by a}} bulb (11) e. g. quartz bulb and a <b>hard</b> <b>glass</b> <b>bulb.</b> A layer system is partially surrounding the illuminant and is transparent to visible light. The system that is arranged on an inner side of the bulb includes three layers (20, 30, 40). The layers (20, 40) are made up an insulator or a dielectric, and the layer (30) is made up of a transparent metal. USE - Used for reflecting an infrared radiation (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The illuminant is partially surrounded by the layer system that is transparent to visible light, thus increasing efficiency of the illuminant by more than 20 percent when compared to conventional illuminants. The illuminant remains consistent even for a temperature more than 600 degree centigrade, and hence increasing life span of a lamp e. g. bulb...|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of <b>glass,</b> with a <b>bulb</b> containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the <b>glass</b> <b>bulb,</b> creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Taiwan, {{qualified}} <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> sprinklers must be {{validated by}} the Approval Criteria for Close Sprinkler Head. However, the actuation temperature {{marked on the}} sprinkler head is the temperature as tested in water, not the ordinary air temperature In the actual scene of the fire. The difference in the thermal conductivity between water and air is 23 times. This study uses heat transfer principles for derivation and FDS software for a thermal responsiveness analysis of <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> sprinklers. Fire loads of 0. 5, 1. 5 and 2. 5 MW are simulated with both ultra-fast and slow burning rates; the cracking temperature of the <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> and the hot air velocity are recorded. The results show that there are significant differences in actuation and detecting environment when the sprinklers head contact the hot air at the fire scene. The marked detection result can only serve as a qualification because {{of the differences in}} fluid properties. In addition, the actuation time of the sprinkler head is closely related to the burning rate...|$|R

50|$|Each closed-head {{sprinkler}} is held {{closed by}} either a heat-sensitive <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> (see below) or a two-part metal link {{held together with}} fusible alloy such as Wood's metal and other alloys with similar compositions. The <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> or link applies pressure to a pipe cap which acts as a plug which prevents water from flowing until the ambient temperature around the sprinkler reaches the design activation temperature of the individual sprinkler. Because each sprinkler activates independently when the predetermined heat level is reached, the number of sprinklers that operate is limited to only those near the fire, thereby maximizing the available water pressure over the point of fire origin.|$|R

Thus, only sprinklers near the fire will operate, normally just one or two. This maximizes water pressure over the point of fire origin, and minimizes water damage to the building.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} type {{of mercury}} vapor electric rectifier {{consists of an}} evacuated <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> with a pool of liquid mercury sitting in the bottom as the cathode. Over it curves the <b>glass</b> <b>bulb,</b> which condenses the mercury that is evaporated as the device operates. The glass envelope has one or more arms with graphite rods as anodes. Their number depends on the application, with one anode usually provided per phase. The shape of the anode arms ensures that any mercury that condenses on the glass walls drains back into the main pool quickly to avoid providing a conductive path between the cathode and respective anode.|$|R

2500|$|In {{manufacturing}} the <b>glass</b> <b>bulb,</b> {{a type of}} [...] "ribbon machine" [...] is used. A continuous {{ribbon of}} glass is passed along a conveyor belt, heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the <b>glass</b> <b>bulbs</b> are created. After the bulbs are blown, and cooled, they are cut off the ribbon machine; a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour. The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the stem press is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the lamp base, and the whole assembly tested.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined a}} heat transfer model {{to predict the}} activation time of a concealed sprinkler. Concealed sprinklers consist of two stages of activation. They include the release of cover plates from a recess housing and the breakage of the <b>glass</b> <b>bulbs</b> or melting of the solder links. The research analysis {{is divided into two}} sections. The first section includes the prediction of cover plate activation time (stage one) and the second section includes the prediction of <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> activation time (stage two). Each prediction result is compared with the experimental data conducted by Annable (2006) and Yu (2007). A lumped heat capacity method is introduced to predict the activation time of the cover plate. This method has been used for predicting the activation time of a standard pendent exposed sprinkler. It is reasonable to apply this method by assuming they are flush with the ceiling. The analysis results are compared based on the percentage of predicted and measured uncertainties. A recommendation is provided for which method is appropriate to apply to predicting the cover plate activation time. The proposed of using FDS 5 simulations is to simulate the heat transfer to the sensing element (<b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> only) within the recessed housing. The constructed simulation models comprises of ceiling within a compartment. The simulations of various sprinkler heads are performed to investigate any parameters that can potentially affect the activation time of the sprinklers. To simulate the <b>glass</b> <b>bulb,</b> combined thermal properties including glass and glycerine are modified to account for the differences in mass. Prior to stage two analysis, the FDS 5 simulation was tested to predict the activation time of a standard pendent exposed sprinkler. The results showed positive progress to carry onto the next analysis. In stage two analysis, the simulations are constructed with and without the presence of vent holes within the recess housing. The combined activation time for concealed sprinklers show lack of solid predictions compared to the experimental data especially Yu experimental data...|$|R

50|$|In the Galileo thermometer, {{the small}} <b>glass</b> <b>bulbs</b> are partly filled with different-coloured liquids. The {{composition}} of these liquids {{is not important}} for {{the functioning of the}} thermometer; they merely function as fixed weights and their colours are only for decoration. Once the hand-blown bulbs have been sealed, their effective densities are adjusted by means of the metal tags hanging from beneath them. Any expansion due to the temperature change of the coloured liquid and air gap inside the bulbs does not affect the operation of the thermometer, as these materials are sealed inside a <b>glass</b> <b>bulb</b> of fixed size. The clear liquid in which the bulbs are submerged is not water, but some organic compound (such as ethanol) the density of which varies with temperature more than water does. Temperature changes affect the density of the outer clear liquid and this causes the bulbs to rise or sink.|$|R
