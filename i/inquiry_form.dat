50|$|Landing {{pages are}} often linked to social media, e-mail campaigns or search engine {{marketing}} campaigns {{in order to enhance}} the effectiveness of the advertisements. The general goal of a landing page is to convert site visitors into sales or leads. If the goal is to obtain a lead, the landing page will include some method for the visitor to get into contact with the company, usually a phone number, or an <b>inquiry</b> <b>form.</b> If a sale is required, the landing page will usually have a link for the visitor to click, which will then send them to a shopping cart or a checkout area. By analyzing activity generated by the linked URL, marketers can use click-through rates and conversion rate to determine the success of an advertisement.|$|E

5000|$|According to Matthew Lipman, C.S. Peirce {{originally}} {{restricted the}} concept {{to the community}} of scientists. John Dewey broadened {{the scope of the}} concept, applying it to the educational setting (Lipman, 2003, pp. 20-21). Borrowing from Dewey, Lipman systematically applies the concept to the educational setting. He argues that a classroom is a type of community of inquiry, which leads to “questioning, reasoning, connecting, deliberating, challenging, and developing problem-solving techniques.” Students and teachers involved in <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> a community of inquiry under certain circumstances. Therefore, a holistic understanding of a community of students and teachers engaged in authentic inquiry is the working definition of the key term ‘community of inquiry’. There is a [...] dimension to the concept that is underlined by Lipman. He points to “….the profound educational implications of fusing together, as Peirce had, the two independently powerful notions of inquiry and community into the single transformative concept of community of inquiry” (2003, p. 84).|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands, all animal {{experiments}} involving vertebrate animals must {{be approved}} by an accredited Animal Ethics Committee (AEC, or, in Dutch: DEC). Researchers who are planning to carry out an animal experiment, need to submit an <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> to the DEC. The information in the <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> will be used by the DEC to decide if an animal experiment may be carried out. Since the end of 2011, the DEC Utrecht has added a new section to its <b>inquiry</b> <b>form.</b> In this section, the researcher is being asked to make his own ethical assessment of the experiment. This new section has been added to the <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> in order to promote the researcher’s awareness {{of the importance of the}} wellbeing of the involved animals and to let him critically think about the ethical aspects of the planned experiment. The goal of this study was to determine, based on literature, what should be included in the researcher’s ethical assessment and to compare this to what researchers themselves had filled in. A scoring sheet was created to quantify to what extent the researcher’s own ethical assessments complied with what should minimally be in it. Only a very small amount of the ethical assessments (5 %) complied with the criteria of what minimally should be in it. This could be due to the fact that all aspects that should be in the ethical assessment already need to be mentioned elsewhere in the inquiry form: the researcher might not feel the need to explicitly mention these aspects again. Also, clear directions for what should be in the own ethical assessment are missing in the form. The addition of the ‘own ethical assessment’ is an improvement of the <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> in the way that it makes an appeal to the responsibility of the researcher. Ultimately, it is the DEC that decides if an experiment can be judged as ethically acceptable, but with the ‘own ethical assessment’ we place part of the responsibility with the researcher. The <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> of the DEC Utrecht could be further improved by implementing clear directions of what should be in the own ethical assessment of researchers. This would probably significantly decrease the current discrepancy between what should be in the ethical assessment and what researchers fill in themselves...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how different meeting-places can influence individuals in different ages. A quantitative and a qualitative method was used and an <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> was sent to approximately 5000 users in a social forum at the Internet. The sample remained 32 persons in ages from 19 to 79 years who also gave informed approbation and answered the <b>inquiry</b> <b>form.</b> There were 22 women and 10 men. The attendance had their residence in big parts of Sweden. The analyse resulted in 5 different categories “The meeting-place – where meetings are”, “community around a common denominator”, “Good atmosphere and permissiveness” and “peace and recovery”. Participants highlighted the importance of community, a relaxed atmosphere and the opportunity to relax. Recovery, fellowship and meaningfulness in the exercise of an interest in community is among others three elements that promote health.

40|$|Graduation date: 1951 The California adult {{education}} program has considerable {{freedom in the}} type of classes which may be offered, as long as certain requirements of the State Education Code are met. The study was conducted in five counties in the north San Francisco Bay area. <b>Inquiry</b> <b>forms</b> were used to obtain information from teachers and students. In each school, administrators were interviewed and all industrial arts teachers contacted personally. Each teacher distributed <b>inquiry</b> <b>forms</b> to the students in his class. Under the existing program industrial arts objectives for avocational interests, health, and extension of formal education, appear to be served. While some social objectives are functioning, not all the socio-economic and consumer education contacts are realized. The avocational objective receives the main emphasis. The adult students fall into either one of two groups as follows: Group I - those who are interested only in using school facilities; Group II - those interested in the educational aspects. A majority {{of the students in the}} study were in Group I. It was determined that there is a high percentage of drop-outs in the classes. The following recommendations were made: If industrial arts classes were presented in a well organized program, a desire would be instilled in the adult student to gain more background information and to develop a greater degree of skill. Adequate facilities should be made available in the adult school and class sizes should be limited to the number which can make convenient and effective use of tools and equipment available. It should be required that all teachers who have had no preparation for {{adult education}}, complete in-service training within a reasonable period. The name and objectives of industrial arts should be given wider publicity in order to stimulate the interest of the public. There is a need for further study of the over-all program since industrial arts is a relatively new addition to the adult education program...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{the years}} of formal {{academic}} preparation possessed by individuals in most professions, {{the large majority of}} current collegiate athletic directors have not had formal academic training which was designed to professionally prepare them for their varying administrative tasks. A few years back then were only a few institutions of higher education that had established graduate programs in athletic administration. The number was small compared to approximantly one thousand institutions that employed athletic directors and associate directors. Also, nearly all high schools in this country have an athletic director. The lack of specific academic preparation of the athletic directors, the trend in the job market to employ those individuals who had sound administrative abilities, and the number of institutions that were providing programs in the athletic administration created the need for additional professional preparation programs designed to train present and future administrators. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess selected educational, professional and personal characteristics of the athletic directors at the selected institutions today. Also, to compare those characteristics by the type of the institution (public or private and divisional membership in the National Collegiate Athletic Association), and to determine from the above, recommendations for those seeking employment as athletic directors and to make suggestions for improving educational programs for those individuals aspiring to become an athletic director. This study will provide useful information for those seeking employment as athletic directors. The methodology to be used in this study will involve the development and validation of an <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> for the athletic directors, the procurement of the information from the athletic directors in the study population, and finally the analysis of the data obtained by the <b>inquiry</b> <b>form.</b> The <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> has been used by Karch, Robert Charles.

The theoretical background of this study was the model of demand-control by Theorell, and various aspects of stress by Frankenhauser and Ödman. The survey was constituted of an <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> which was handed out to six different classes at the school. A total of 86 students filled in the form, and their answers were treated with standard statistical procedures to reveal the results. The <b>inquiry</b> <b>form</b> was made up by five parts; one that concerned the background of the respondent, one that reflected the psychosocial health and stress level and three parts that concerned discrimination, victimization and school democracy. Among the results was that female students was highly affected by stress related psychosocial disorder, and that they probably in some sense were able to cope with it because of good relations to friends. Another result of the study was that students with different cultural backgrounds had the same psychosocial health conditions as those with Swedish cultural background, and they were not seemingly affected by discrimination. These results, as well as the others in this study, are of course part of a very complex context and no certain conclusions can be drawn...|$|E
