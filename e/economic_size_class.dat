40|$|Romania {{is one of}} the EU {{countries}} with significant agricultural potential. The economic and social changes occurring after 1990 has profoundly affected the agriculture in Romania. The excessive land fragmentation due to land restitution to the former owners and their heirs, as well as the subsequent developments have led to a large number of small-sized agricultural holdings and a small number of large agricultural holdings, in terms of size and economy. The sustainability performance must be assessed from the economic, social and environmental points of view. The paper aims to assess the sustainable performance of the agricultural holdings in Romania on <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> to highlight the directions for enhancing the performance by reorganizing the agricultural structures.

Recent results show that they also contribute significantly to soil organic matter (SOM) formation. We hypothesized that different molecular <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of compounds in soil microbial biomass (SMB) have variable turnover time and in consequence influence SOM formation differentially. Here we used natural differences in carbon stable isotope signatures (d 13 C values) after C 3 eC 4 vegetation change to track newly fixed C 4 plant carbon into SMB molecular <b>size</b> <b>classes.</b> SMB was obtained by chloroform fumigation extraction (SFE) and d 13 C values of its <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> were measured using size exclusion chromatography coupled online to liquid chromatography‒isotope ratio mass spectrometry (SECeLC eIRMS). Resolved SMB was assigned to 5 <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of 1800 e 9800, 800 e 1800, 380 e 800, 180 e 380 and 50 e 180 Da respectively. The contribution of recent C 4 plant carbon to <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> of SMB decreased with increasing molecular weight (MW). It ranged from 77 19 % in the lowest MW <b>size</b> <b>class</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> to 41 14 % in the highest MW <b>size</b> <b>class</b> in a sandy soil and from 59 18 % in the lowest MW <b>size</b> <b>class</b> to 8 15 % in the highest MW <b>size</b> <b>class</b> in a clayey soil. A decreasing carbon turnover of compounds in SMB extracts along a continuum of molecular size from small to large implies that low molecular weight microbial compounds are rapidly metabolized products that link to fast respiratory carbon fluxes, whereas high molecular weight ones could be products of microbial synthesis like structural compounds that have slower turnover rates and link to slower SOM formation. Our methods help avoid contamination of CFE extracts and the results help explain why SMB turnover is faster in CFE extracts when compared to calculations using membrane lipids (e. g.

30|$|Because the {{historical}} timber surveys sampled forest structure during two separate years (1923 and 1936), {{the absence of}} fire in this 16 -year period likely allowed for additional tree recruitment into the smallest <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> in the 1936 dataset (Lydersen et al. 2013).

40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} {{studies suggest that}} the total energy available in natural communities influences body size as well as patterns of abundance and diversity. But the precise mechanisms underlying relationships or how these three ecological properties relate remain elusive. We identify five hypotheses relating energy availability, body size distributions, abundance, and species richness within communities, and we use experimental deep sea wood fall communities to test their predicted effects both on descriptors describing the species richness-body size distribution, and on trends in species richness within <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> over an energy gradient (size class-richness relationships). Invertebrate communities were taxonomically identified, weighed, and counted from 32 Acacia sp. logs ranging in size from 0. 6 to 20. 6 kg (corresponding to different levels of energy available) which were deployed at 3203 m in the Northeast Pacific Ocean for between 5 and 7 years. Trends in both the species richness-body size distribution and the size class-richness distribution with increasing wood fall size provide support for the Increased Packing hypothesis: species richness increases with increasing wood fall size but only in the modal <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> Furthermore, species richness of body <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> reflected the abundance of individuals in that <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> Thus, increases in richness in the modal <b>size</b> <b>class</b> with increasing energy were concordant with increases in abundance within that <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> The results suggest that increases in species richness occurring as energy availability increases may be isolated to specific niches, e. g. the body <b>size</b> <b>classes,</b> especially in communities developing on discrete and energetically isolated resources such as deep sea wood falls...|$|R

The <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution fluctuated greatly throughout the year and the smallest <b>size</b> <b>class</b> (Class I; < 5. 0 cm) was conspicuous from October to December both in 2008 and 2009, while the largest <b>size</b> <b>class</b> (Class IX; 40. 0 – 44. 9 cm) was only found on May 2009, reaching 41. 2 cm in length. The proportions of the three types of plants fluctuated throughout the year with the tetrasporangial plants constantly present and mostly dominant. From these results, it was known that new thalli started to grow from October, and that they could mature rapidly even in short size, suggesting that the renewal of the population is made yearly on sporic basis (tetraspores and carpospores) ...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of the agricultural sector in the variation of the productive base, this study has targeted the recognition of the definite factors of the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> to the sector and its expectation till 2010. To accomplish its goals, the study use stepwise regression analysis for independent variables which determined the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> for the agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia for the period 1980 - 2001. The results of this study show that: Instead of the reduction in the investment values directed to the agricultural sector, and its share of labor, the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of agricultural sector increased from 1 % in 1980 to 5. 11 % in 2001. So, this sector participate in diversifying the Saudi economy. Water used in agricultural, investments, and level of technology are considered the most important factors in determining the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of agricultural sector, where it is explaining 91 % of changes that happened in the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> of agricultural sector during the period 1980 - 2001. According to high level of technology, fixed investment at 1. 75 % and increasing the water used in agriculture, we expect increase in the <b>economic</b> <b>size</b> from 6. 7 % in 2004, to 7. 74 % in 2010, with an average about 7. 22 % for the period 2004 - 2010. This study recommend re-evaluation the assets and increasing its economic and technical efficiency and encouraging local and foreign investment which can help in re-employ the agriculture economic resource, in order to increase and sustained the share of this sector in Saudi econom...|$|R
30|$|Re-burned {{areas were}} {{classified}} by size thresholds based on standard fire <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> used by fire management {{and policy makers}} (NWCG 2006). Using standard fire <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> for reporting units facilitates easy comprehension of results by fire managers already accustomed to these units. Three <b>size</b> <b>classes</b> were used: 40 ha to 121 ha (NWCG Class D), 121 ha to 405 ha (NWCG Class E), and > 405 ha (NWCG classes F and G, combined). Time-since-previous-fire (TSPF) was calculated by subtracting {{the year of the}} first fire from the year of the subsequent fire in order to assess relationships between TSPF and re-burn sizes.|$|R

Not all sources agree on the exact sizes or names for these size ranges, but the concept of the ranges is well-established and useful to both the cultivation and the aesthetic understanding of the trees. A photograph of a bonsai may not give the viewer an accurate impression of the tree's real size, so printed documents may complement a photograph by naming the bonsai's <b>size</b> <b>class.</b> The <b>size</b> <b>class</b> implies the height and weight of the tree in its container.|$|R
