In order {{to solve the}} problem: firstly, identify the key performance indicators of the sustainability related to <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> (environmental, social, economic and technological factors);optimize the selected indicators with both experts knowledge and measurable data; secondly, develop a new model for measuring the level of sustainability for <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings.</b> The data acquisition of objective indicators for <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> {{is based upon the}} wireless wearable sensors networks, and the subjective indicators connected with expert experience derived through questionnaire surveys. Using a consensus-based model, which is analyzed by the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multi-criteria decision-making. Using the multi-attribute model based on structure entropy weight methodology and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for priority and weight setting in the sustainability assessment is studied. It is concluded that the whole system not only acquires multiple data but also gets available and reliable assessment for the sustainability of <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two {{articles}} presenting a detailed review of the historical evolution of mathematical models applied in the development of building technology, including conventional <b>buildings</b> and <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings.</b> After presenting the technical differences between conventional and <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings,</b> this article reviews the existing mathematical models, the abstract levels of these models, and their links to the literature for <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings.</b> The advantages and limitations of the applied mathematical models are identified and the models are classified in terms of their application range and goal. We then describe how the early mathematical models, mainly physical models applied to conventional buildings, have faced new challenges for the design and management of <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> and led to the use of models which offer more flexibility to better cope with various uncertainties. In contrast with the early modelling techniques, model approaches adopted in neural networks, expert systems, fuzzy logic and genetic models provide a promising method to accommodate these complications as <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> now need integrated technologies which involve solving complex, multi-objective and integrated decision problems...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} goals of the <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> especially in commercial applications {{is not only to}} minimize the energy consumption but also to enhance the occupant’s comfort. However, most of current development in the <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> focuses on an implementation of the automatic building control systems that can support energy efficiency approach. The consideration of occupants’ preferences is not adequate. To improve occupant’s wellbeing and energy efficiency in intelligent environments, we develop four types of agent combined together to form a multi-agent system to control the <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings.</b> Users’ preferential conflicts are discussed. Furthermore, a negotiation mechanism for conflict resolution, has been proposed in order to reach an agreement, and has been represented in syntax directed translation schemes for future implementation and testing.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to: firstly, identify key issues related to sustainable <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> (environmental, social, economic and technological factors); develop a conceptual model for {{the selection of the}} appropriate KPIs; secondly, test critically stakeholder's perceptions and values of selected KPIs intelligent buildings; and thirdly develop a new model for measuring the level of sustainability for sustainable <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings.</b> This paper uses a consensus-based model (Sustainable Built Environment Tool- SuBETool), which is analysed using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) for multi-criteria decision-making. The use of the multi-attribute model for priority setting in the sustainability assessment of <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> is introduced. The paper commences by reviewing the literature on sustainable <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> research and presents a pilot-study investigating the problems of complexity and subjectivity. This study is based upon a survey perceptions held by selected stakeholders and the value they attribute to selected KPIs. It is argued that the benefit of the new proposed model (SuBETool) is a ‘tool’ for ‘comparative’ rather than an absolute measurement. It has the potential to provide useful lessons from current sustainability assessment methods for strategic future of sustainable <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> in order to improve a building's performance and to deliver objective outcomes. Findings of this survey enrich the field of <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings</b> in two ways. Firstly, it gives a detailed insight into the selection of sustainable building indicators, as well as their degree of importance. Secondly, it tesst critically stakeholder's perceptions and values of selected KPIs <b>intelligent</b> <b>buildings.</b> It is concluded that the priority levels for selected criteria is largely dependent on the integrated design team, which includes the client, architects, engineers and facilities managers. ...|$|R
