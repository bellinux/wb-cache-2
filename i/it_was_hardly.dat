25|$|Beiser divides up {{the mature}} form of Schelling's Naturphilosophie into {{the attitudes of}} {{transcendental}} realism (nature's independence of consciousness) and transcendental naturalism (nature's inclusion of the rational subject). He notes how Naturphilosophie was first a counterbalance to Wissenschaftslehre, and then in Schelling's approach became the senior partner. After that, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> to be avoided that Schelling would become an opponent of Fichte, having been a close follower in the early 1790s.|$|E
25|$|A {{geomagnetic}} storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, {{and bring the}} aurora to lower latitudes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000km away from the magnetic pole. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the magnetic pole in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.|$|E

Along with the Steiner Brothers, The Road Warriors, and the Samoan Swat Team they were entered in a one night, tag team round robin tournament.

Then on February 6, 1990, Doom were defeated by the Steiner Brothers {{and as a result}} of the stipulation were forced to unmask.

25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the French Quarter, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> the only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of timeshare condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E
25|$|Still in {{the summer}} of 209 BC, while Marcellus was {{fighting}} Hannibal in Apulia, the army under the consul Quintus Fulvius Flaccus effected the submission of northern Lucania. The other consul, Quintus Fabius Maximus, assaulted the city of Manduria, in the Sallentine. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> 35km away from Tarentum. Having disentangled himself from Marcellus, although the army of Fabius was very close to Tarentum, Hannibal hurried to rescue the city of Caulonia (in the farthest corner of southwestern Italy for Bruttium was also under Roman attack). Unopposed by the main Roman forces the Carthaginian commander managed to intercept and destroy near Caulonia an 8,000 strong detachment that had attacked the Bruttians from Regium, and thus retained control over the region. But this fight delayed him and he would not arrive in time to save Tarentum from Fabius' assault. He was five miles away when Fabius sacked Tarentum.|$|E

25|$|East Germans were {{subjected}} to far more stringent restrictions. The East German constitution of 1949 granted citizens a theoretical right to leave the country, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> respected in practice. Even this limited right was removed in the constitution of 1968 which confined citizens' freedom of movement to the area within the state borders. It was not until November 1964 that {{they were allowed to}} visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. East German pensioners were able to visit the West for up to four weeks in a year, but were not permitted to take more than a token 10East German marks with them, requiring them to depend on the support of relatives, churches and the West German government. As they were retired, they were seen by the East German government as economically unimportant and no great loss if they defected. The vast majority, though, chose to return {{home at the end of}} their stay.|$|E
500|$|While this {{correspondence}} {{was taking}} place, another issue arose when, in early 1644, a publication entitled A Short Story of the Rise, reign and ruin of the Antinomians, Familists & Libertines that infected the Churches of New England... {{was published in}} London. The author of the work was never stated, though the Reverend Thomas Weld provided the introduction and preface. Scholars through the years have almost unanimously attributed the authorship of this work to John Winthrop, and John Cotton said as much in a book he published in 1648. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> a balanced account of events, and Wheelwright biographer Charles Bell wrote that [...] "it may be characterized as a very bitter and partisan production, even for that day".|$|E

500|$|By 1989, the Peace Candle {{had become}} so {{dilapidated}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> able to sustain the winter weather. Strong winds in November had shaken the structure {{so much that the}} wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off. On November 16, 1989, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST's Voice of the People show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs. The committee was now receiving an average of $3,000 a year in donations, which was used to maintain the existing candle. Panto said, [...] "The sad reality is, this is the last year." [...] However, new fundraising efforts were started to raise $20,000 to build a new Peace Candle. Local businesses and unions volunteered their time and materials to work on it, with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season.|$|E
500|$|In 1765, the British {{decided that}} the {{occupation}} of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means. As Gage commented {{to one of his}} officers, he was determined to have [...] "none our enemy" [...] among the Indian peoples, and that included Pontiac, to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks. [...] Pontiac had by now become less militant after hearing of Bouquet's truce with the Ohio country Native Americans. Johnson's deputy, George Croghan, accordingly travelled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765, and although he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens, he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac. While Charlot Kaské wanted to burn Croghan at the stake, Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25, 1766. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> a surrender: no lands were ceded, no prisoners returned, and no hostages were taken. Rather than accept British sovereignty, Kaské left British territory by crossing the Mississippi River with other French and Native refugees.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time as {{exhibition}} venues for B films vanished, the independent film movement was burgeoning; among the results were various crossovers between the low-budget genre movie and the [...] "sophisticated" [...] arthouse picture. Director Abel Ferrara, who built a reputation with violent B movies such as The Driller Killer (1979) and Ms. 45 (1981), made two works in the early nineties that marry exploitation-worthy depictions of sex, drugs, and general sleaze to complex examinations of honor and redemption: King of New York (1990) was backed by a group of mostly small production companies and the cost of Bad Lieutenant (1992), , was financed totally independently. Larry Fessenden's micro-budget monster movies, such as No Telling (1991) and Habit (1997), reframe classic genre subjects—Frankenstein and vampirism, respectively—to explore issues of contemporary relevance. The budget of David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), , was not comfortably A-grade, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hardly</b> B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: [...] "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick", wrote critic Janet Maslin. Financed, like King of New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features. This result mirrored the film's scrambling of definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division. Pulp Fiction (1994), directed by Quentin Tarantino on a [...] budget, became a hugely influential hit by crossing multiple lines, as James Mottram describes: [...] "With its art house narrative structure, B-movie subject matter and Hollywood cast, the film is the axis for three distinct cinematic traditions to intersect." ...|$|E
