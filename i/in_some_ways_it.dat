5|$|Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire is a {{pinball game}} {{developed}} by Jupiter, published by The Pokémon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, {{and was released}} {{in the same year}} – on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is based on Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, and is a sequel to Pokémon Pinball for the Game Boy Color. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping the ball in play as long as possible and hitting bumpers. In keeping with the theme of Pokémon, it features Pokémon collection, where while the players play pinball, they must also capture the eponymous creatures.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} law tracts that {{originated}} {{from the church}} were written in Old Irish. The most famous of these is Cáin Adomnáin, which was apparently created in 697 {{under the influence of}} Adomnán and ratified by a number of ecclesiasts and kings whose names appear in the text. The idea of the law was apparently to supplement the punishments of Brehon law for crimes against women, children, and clerics. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> follows the ideas embodied in Brehon law although there are differences; for instance, it uses capital punishment, which Brehon law avoids.|$|E
25|$|York's hostile {{attitude}} toward the Council's surrender of the French province of Maine, in return for {{an extension of the}} truce with France and a French bride for Henry, must have contributed to his appointment on 30 July 1447 as Lieutenant of Ireland. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was a logical appointment, as Richard was also Earl of Ulster and had considerable estates in Ireland, {{but it was also a}} convenient way (for his enemies at court) of removing him from both England and France. His term of office was for ten years, ruling him out of consideration for any other high office during that period.|$|E

25|$|Number {{theory is}} {{the theory of}} the {{positive}} integers. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and congruence. Its fundamental theorem states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding automorphic forms, which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.|$|E
500|$|The {{book can}} be seen as an attempt to {{understand}} the growth in unity and interconnection of mathematics as a whole, as well as an examination of the mutual influence of mathematics and philosophy, language, and physics. [...] Although the book is little-read, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> prefigures certain points of Whitehead's later work in philosophy and metaphysics.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the launch of Scientific Atlanta and the subsequent disputes, Georgia Tech's culture encouraged hard work, but did not encourage start-ups. This changed during Pettit's administration; Pettit was at Stanford during the development of the Silicon Valley and worked to change the culture to inspire something similar in Atlanta. [...] "That was when Tech began actively encouraging faculty, staff and students to be entrepreneurial... <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was a shift back to our roots, with Tech beginning to reconnect with the state through the Advanced Technology Development Center, the Economic Development Institute and the Georgia Research Alliance", according to Bob McMath.|$|E

500|$|In early 1787 John Jay {{wrote that}} the rural {{disturbances}} and {{the inability of the}} central government to fund troops in response made [...] "the inefficiency of the Federal government [...] more and more manifest." [...] Henry Knox observed that the uprising in Massachusetts clearly influenced local leaders who had previously opposed a strong federal government. [...] Historian David Szatmary writes that the timing of the rebellion [...] "convinced the elites of sovereign states that the proposed gathering at Philadelphia must take place." [...] Some states, Massachusetts among them, delayed choosing delegates to the proposed convention, in part because <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> resembled the [...] "extra-legal" [...] conventions organized by the protestors before the rebellion became violent.|$|E
500|$|Meet the Superhumans won a Golden Lion {{award at}} the Cannes Lions Festival in June 2013, losing the overall award to Dumb Ways to Die. Sir John Hegarty, the jury {{president}} said of it: [...] "When you've got some really outstanding work it is tragic <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> can't get a bigger award, but there {{can only be}} one grand prix", while jury member Carlo Cavallone added [...] " [...] is an amazing campaign, one of the golds that went through [...] immediately ... Everyone felt it had {{the highest level of}} craft. It puts an issue that was really important before London 2012 to raise awareness of the Paralympics [...] they were hyper successful … Dumb Ways to Die was a tough contender." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Carr, an {{academic}} and practising lawyer, called {{the implementation of}} Section 1 [...] "slightly awkward", suggesting that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was more limited than the provisions contained in the Sale of Goods Act 1893 from the seller's point of view. Unlike with the 1893 Act, a seller cannot exclude the provisions, and while the right to sell can be excluded {{it is not clear}} how this might be done. Turpin complimented the section on hire-purchase agreements, although noting some flaws in draftsmanship; he also questioned whether or not the protection given to consumers would be sufficient. Prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 was one of the few limitations on clauses in consumer contracts. Most of it was eventually superseded by the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which included many of the Act's provisions.|$|E

500|$|Talking to Nashville Scene, Lewis {{said that}} the songs [...] "weren't written off-the-cuff, but they were {{definitely}} recorded, not carelessly, but with a real effort to capture a live feeling, particularly with the vocals". Lewis continued, [...] "To me, it's a big step in a different direction...and {{to be able to}} sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me." [...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, so we knew that we could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways.</b> <b>It</b> was about getting the band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could." [...] As [...] "a child of digital generation", Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools, but wanted to capture the [...] "not-perfect sound" [...] of some of her favorite records.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a perfect four-star rating, calling it [...] "the most cheerfully exciting, bizarre, goofy, romantic {{adventure}} movie since Raiders, {{and it is}} high praise to say that it's {{not so much a}} sequel as an equal. It's quite an experience." [...] Vincent Canby felt the film was [...] "too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is, but shape may be beside the point. Old-time, 15-part movie serials didn't have shape. They just went on and on and on, which is what Temple of Doom does with humor and technical invention." [...] Neal Gabler commented that [...] "I think in some ways, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> was less. In sum total, I'd have to say I enjoyed it more. That doesn't mean it's better necessarily, but I got more enjoyment out of it." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "sillier, darkly violent and a bit dumbed down, but still great fun." [...] Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, claimed it was [...] "one of the most sheerly pleasurable physical comedies ever made." [...] Halliwell's Film Guide described the film as a [...] "slow-starting adventure romp with much ingenuity and too much brutality and horror." ...|$|E
500|$|The Stone Circle witches' looks were {{designed}} by Twilight Creations (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows). [...] According to McKay, [...] "the witches are awesome in it. Nasty, mean witches, and we'll get some great actresses for them as well." [...] Wirkola {{said he wanted to}} reinvent witches as villains: [...] "I do love Witches of Eastwick. We wanted to try to avoid the classical witch with the long nose stirring the pot. I really wanted them to be...dangerous, fast – they’re stronger than Hansel and Gretel...It’s a good basis for a villain." [...] He recalled that [...] "the most fun was finding their look and sound. For the main witches, we found one animal to represent all of them, like Muriel is a wolf. It just helped us find the witches. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> feels like they're the spawn of the dark places of nature. It should feel animalistic." [...] Asked if he was worried about [...] "this perception that it might be interpreted as sexist", Wirkola said, [...] "For me, that’s a classical villain from hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Yeah, I never worried about that, to be honest." [...] He added, [...] "People forget how truly dark and twisted those stories are. [...] talks about a witch burning alive in an oven, screaming and scratching." [...] Ulrich Zeidler's concept art for some of the witches was released on the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|Regine Olsen {{occupies}} {{a central role}} in Kierkegaard's thought and writings, and indeed a unique position in the history of all of Western philosophy. It can be argued that no other single woman has been so instrumental in a major philosopher's development as Regine was to Kierkegaard. [...] <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>it</b> is difficult to understand Kierkegaard fully without at least a cursory knowledge of his failed relationship to Regine.|$|E
2500|$|The x-axis {{of a mass}} {{spectrum}} represents {{a relationship between the}} mass of a given ion and the number of elementary charges that it carries. This is written as the IUPAC standard m/z to denote the quantity formed by dividing the mass of an ion by the unified atomic mass unit and by its charge number (positive absolute value). This has been referred to as a mass-to-charge ratio, although <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> does not fit this description. The IUPAC Gold Book gives an example: [...] "for the ion C7H72+, m/z equals 45.5".|$|E
