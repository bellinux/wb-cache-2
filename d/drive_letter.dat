25|$|Each {{disk drive}} was {{identified}} by a <b>drive</b> <b>letter,</b> for example drive A and drive B. To {{refer to a}} file on a specific drive, the <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> was prefixed to the file name, separated by a colon, e.g. A:FILE.TXT. With no <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.|$|E
25|$|AutoRun {{will work}} with network drives (the DRIVE_REMOTE drive type) that are mapped to a <b>drive</b> <b>letter.</b> AutoRun will also work with floppy drives that are {{provided}} with autorun-compatible drivers.|$|E
25|$|MSCDEX.EXE - {{support for}} CDROM drive access and <b>drive</b> <b>letter,</b> used in {{combination}} with a separate manufacturer-specific driver. Needed in addition to above SCSI drivers for access to a SCSI CDROM device.|$|E
5000|$|In most DOS systems, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to have more than 26 mounted drives. Atari GEMDOS supports <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> A: to P: only. The PalmDOS PCMCIA driver stack supports <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> 0:, 1:, 2:, ... to address PCMCIA drive slots.Some Novell network drivers for DOS support up to 32 <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> under compatible DOS versions. In addition to this, Novell DOS 7, OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 genuinely support a CONFIG.SYS LASTDRIVE=32 directive in order to allocate up to 32 <b>drive</b> <b>letters,</b> named A: to Z:, \:, :, ^:, _: and `:. (DR-DOS 7.02-7.07 also supports HILASTDRIVE and LASTDRIVEHIGH directives in order to relocate drive structures into upper memory.) Some DOS application programs do not expect <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> beyond Z: and will not work with them, therefore it is recommended to use them for special purposes or search drives.JP Software's 4DOS command line processor supports <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> beyond Z: in general, but since some of the letters clash with syntactical extensions of this command line processor, they need to be escaped in order to use them as drive letters.Windows 9x (MS-DOS 7.0/MS-DOS 7.1) added support for LASTDRIVE=32 and LASTDRIVEHIGH=32 as well.If access to more filesystems than Z: is required under Windows NT, Volume Mount Points must be used. However, it is possible to mount non-letter drives, such as 1:, 2:, or !: using the command line SUBST utility in Windows XP or Vista (i.e. [...] ), but this is not officially supported and may break programs that assume that all <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> are A: to Z:.|$|R
5000|$|When all {{files were}} transferred, the <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> would be swapped.|$|R
5000|$|By default, Windows will assign <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> to all <b>drives,</b> as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Because ReadyBoost stores its cache as a file on {{the root}} {{directory}} {{of the drive}} rather than using the flash memory without a file system, the file system must be mounted and assigned a <b>drive</b> <b>letter.</b> The ReadyBoost cache is created on the root directory of the drive.|$|E
25|$|A CCP {{internal}} command, of {{the form}} <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> followed by a colon, {{could be used to}} select the default drive. For example, typing B: and pressing enter at the command prompt would change the default drive to B, and the command prompt would then become B> to indicate this change.|$|E
25|$|Ladd {{had a brief}} timeout for {{military}} service in the United States Army Air Forces First Motion Picture Unit. Ladd was initially classified 4-F unfit {{for military}} service because of stomach problems, but began his military service in January 1943. He was posted to the Walla Walla Army Air Base at Walla Walla, Washington, attaining the rank of Corporal. He attended the Oscars in March 1943 and in September appeared in a trailer promoting a war loan <b>drive,</b> <b>Letter</b> from a Friend.|$|E
50|$|The program Ext2Mgr can {{optionally}} {{be installed}} additionally to manage <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> and such.|$|R
5000|$|Each logon session {{receives}} {{its own set}} of <b>drive</b> <b>letters.</b> They {{cannot be}} shared.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} support Java applications, the FlexOS-based IBM 4690 OS version 2 {{introduced}} its own virtual file system (VFS) architecture to store long filenames in the FAT file system in a backwards compatible fashion. If enabled, the virtual filenames (VFN) are available under separate logical <b>drive</b> <b>letters,</b> whereas the real filenames (RFN) remain available under the original <b>drive</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R
25|$|The FAT {{file system}} {{itself does not}} impose any limits on the depth of a {{subdirectory}} tree {{for as long as}} there are free clusters available to allocate the subdirectories, however, the internal Current Directory Structure (CDS) under MS-DOS/PCDOS limits the absolute path of a directory to 66 characters (including the <b>drive</b> <b>letter,</b> but excluding the NUL byte delimiter), thereby limiting the maximum supported depth of subdirectories to 32, whatever occurs earlier. Concurrent DOS, MultiuserDOS and DRDOS3.31 to 6.0 (up to including the 1992-11 updates) do not store absolute paths to working directories internally and therefore do not show this limitation. The same applies to Atari GEMDOS, but the Atari Desktop does not support more than 8 sub-directory levels. Most applications aware of this extension support paths up to at least 127bytes. FlexOS, 4680OS and 4690OS support a length of up to 127bytes as well, allowing depths down to 60 levels. PalmDOS, DRDOS6.0 (since BDOS7.1) and higher, NovellDOS, and OpenDOS sport a MS-DOS-compatible CDS and therefore have the same length limits as MS-DOS/PCDOS.|$|E
500|$|In {{order for}} BitLocker to encrypt the volume holding the {{operating}} system, {{at least two}} NTFS-formatted volumes are required: one for the operating system (usually C:) and another with a minimum size of 100MB from which the operating system boots. BitLocker requires the latter to remain unencrypted—on Windows Vista this volume must be assigned a <b>drive</b> <b>letter,</b> while on Windows 7 that is not required. Unlike previous versions of Windows, Vista's [...] "diskpart" [...] command-line tool includes the ability to shrink {{the size of an}} NTFS volume so that this volume may be created from already allocated space. A tool called the BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool is also available from Microsoft that allows an existing volume on Windows Vista to be shrunk to make room for a new boot volume and for the necessary bootstrapping files to be transferred to it.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "8.3" [...] {{filename}} {{format and}} the <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> + colon combination survived into MS-DOS. The <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> + colon convention has survived in Microsoft Windows {{and is still}} used today. In addition, file extensions (for example, [...]txt, [...]com (a compiled file), or [...]exe (an executable file)) are still used to identify file types on many operating systems.|$|E
5000|$|Expandable storage: Provides {{a unified}} single and easily {{expandable}} storage space, removing {{the need for}} <b>drive</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Assign {{subsequent}} <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> to any {{block device}} drivers loaded in CONFIG.SYS via DEVICE statements, e.g. RAM disks.|$|R
5000|$|DOS 5.0 and higher: Assign <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> to all {{physical}} floppy drives {{beyond the}} second physical floppy drive.|$|R

2500|$|USB {{support and}} {{redirection}} – connect peripherals such as flash drives and digital cameras, and print from the guest to host OS printers. However, USB isochronous transfer mode is not supported [...] Other methods involve simply just treating an active <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> from a USB flash drive as a virtual hard drive.|$|E
2500|$|As {{these type}} of devices {{do not have a}} <b>drive</b> <b>letter,</b> AutoPlay {{properties}} cannot be accessed and changed through [...] "My Computer". However, when a device is attached, the discovery causes Windows to place an icon in the taskbar notification area (commonly referred to as the tray). AutoPlay preferences for this device can now be changed by clicking this icon. The image to the left shows the icon that appeared when a video camera was attached.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{configuration}} {{and if this}} hasn't happened already, <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> may get swapped, so {{that the}} compressed drive becomes C:.|$|R
5000|$|In the GPT scheme, BDPs are {{the only}} {{partition}} types which Windows XP 64-bit can mount and normally assign <b>drive</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Through their {{designated}} {{position as}} DOS successor, {{the concept of}} <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> was also inherited by OS/2 and the Microsoft Windows family.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{behaviors}} exhibited by Microsoft Windows {{are a result}} of backward compatibility to MS-DOS, which in turn attempted some backward compatibility with CP/M. The <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> and 8.3 filename conventions in MS-DOS (and early Windows versions) were originally adopted from CP/M. [...] The wildcard matching characters used by Windows (? and *) are based on those of CP/M, as are the reserved filenames used to redirect output to a printer ("PRN:"), and the console ("CON:"). The drive names A and B were used to designate the 2 floppy disk drives that CP/M systems typically used; when hard drives appeared they were designated C, which survived into MS-DOS as the C:\> command prompt. [...] Also, the control character marking the end of some text files can also be attributed to CP/M.|$|E
5000|$|Assign a <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> to {{the first}} active primary {{partition}} recognized upon the first physical hard disk. DOS 5.0 and higher will ensure that this will become <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> C:, so that the boot drive will either have <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> A: or C:.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{disk drive}} was {{identified}} by a <b>drive</b> <b>letter,</b> for example drive [...] and drive [...] To {{refer to a}} file on a specific drive, the <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> was prefixed to the file name, separated by a colon, e.g[...] With no <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.|$|E
5000|$|Except for CP/M and {{versions}} of MS-DOS/PC DOS prior to version 5.0, {{each of these}} operating systems assigns <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> according to the following algorithm: ...|$|R
5000|$|DOS 5.0 and higher: Assign <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> to all {{remaining}} primary partitions, {{beginning with}} the first hard drive and proceeding through successive physical hard disk drives.|$|R
5000|$|Assign {{subsequent}} <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> {{to every}} recognized logical partition {{present in the}} first extended partition, beginning with the first hard drive and proceeding through successive physical hard disk drives.|$|R
5000|$|Contig can't {{defragment}} files accessed through directory mount points (as {{opposed to}} <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> mounts). Using an additional (temporary) <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> will circumvent this problem. See subst command.|$|E
5000|$|In computing, <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> {{assignment}} {{is the process}} of assigning alphabetical identifiers to volumes. Unlike the concept of UNIX mount points, where volumes are named and located arbitrarily in a single hierarchical namespace, <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> assignment allows multiple highest-level namespaces. <b>Drive</b> <b>letter</b> {{assignment is}} thus a process of using letters to name the roots of the [...] "forest" [...] representing the file system; each volume holds an independent [...] "tree" [...] (or, for non-hierarchical file systems, an independent list of files).|$|E
5000|$|Since (at least) Microsoft Windows XP SP2 AUTORUN.INF files {{present in}} the new <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> are ignored; thus, AutoRun/AutoPlay does not work on drive letters created in this way. In addition, {{assigning}} a custom icon or label to the <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> created this way via AUTORUN.INF does not work. A custom label assigned to the <b>drive</b> <b>letter</b> created with [...] only appears if the source drive/volume {{does not have a}} volume label set (check and set with the [...] command).|$|E
50|$|Creates DOS device {{mappings}} (e.g. CON:, NUL:, AUX:, COM1:, COM2:, COM3:, COM4:, PRN:, LPT1:, LPT2:, LPT3:, and <b>drive</b> <b>letters)</b> {{listed at}} the HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\DOS Devices registry key. This {{can be used}} to create permanent subst drives.|$|R
5000|$|Assign {{subsequent}} <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> to any dynamically loaded drives via CONFIG.SYS INSTALL statements, in AUTOEXEC.BAT or later, i.e. additional {{optical disc}} drives (MSCDEX etc.), PCMCIA / PC Card drives, USB or Firewire drives, or network drives.|$|R
5000|$|Assign {{subsequent}} <b>drive</b> <b>letters</b> to {{the first}} primary partition upon each successive physical hard disk drive. DOS versions prior to 5.0 will probe for only two physical harddisks, whereas DOS 5.0 and higher support eight physical harddisks.|$|R
