An {{extended}} segment in the novel version of Triplanetary, set during World War II, suggests intimate familiarity with <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> <b>munitions</b> manufacturing. Some biographers cite as fact that, just as Smith's protagonist in this segment lost his job over failure to approve substandard munitions, Smith did, as well. Smith began work for the J. W.

50|$|During World War II the Germans moved in. The keep was transformed; {{it served}} as an arms dépôt and a 115m {{anti-aircraft}} observation post. Operation Dragoon triggered a retreat of the occupation forces.

Only the cellar and {{the south side of the}} keep remained intact. The west façade, while already in ruins, resisted the explosion and its windows show the layout of the château and its three floors.

The Norwegian steamer Gurre, reported as 1,733 tons, was crossing the North Sea while steaming from Narvik and Fredrikshald for Hull with a cargo of iron ore. U-66 torpedoed her at position , sending the doomed Norwegian ship into the murky depths with 20 of her crew. The same day, U-66 encountered another Norwegian cargo ship, the 1,005-ton Livingstone, headed from Skien to Charente with a cargo of ammonium nitrate. Livingstones cargo, used {{in the making of}} <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> <b>munitions,</b> was too valuable to destroy. U-66s captain seized the ship as a prize east of Shetland. Further details of the encounter do not appear in sources, but it is known that the 11-year-old Livingstone not only survived the war, but remained in service under a variety of names until she was scrapped in 1962.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the groups}} {{targeted}} by U.S. airstrikes was the Khorasan Group, an extremist group of suspected al-Qaeda [...] "core" [...] members who were alleged to have been plotting an attack against the U.S. and other Western nations. The strikes targeted Khorasan training camps, <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> <b>munitions</b> production facilities, communications facilities, as well as command and control facilities. The group has been claimed to possess advanced bomb making skills and their plot is claimed to involve a bomb made of a nonmetallic device such as a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material. The group is reportedly led by Muhsin al-Fadhli, a leader of al-Qaeda and a close confidant of Osama bin Laden.

40|$|FOREWORD This {{document}} {{might be}} seen as a natural progression of many years of research and study. The authors have been involved in various programs dealing with the hazards associated with propellants <b>and</b> <b>explosives</b> <b>and</b> <b>munitions</b> incorporating these energetic materials. In 2005 and 2006, the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) assembled a team to review a test plan to update propellant safety siting methodology for application to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The team included members from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB), and industry. One of the recommendations was that NASA fund an effort to develop alternate methods to determine safe separation distance based on fire hazards. The NESC was funded to assemble a team of experts to develop these alternate methods. The team developed the methodology and applied it to determining the safe separation distances from the VAB. The results of that effort were published in Reference 69 of this document. One of the primary conclusions was that th...|$|R
