The stations were run by Ukrainian personnel and data was sent to the headquarters of the Russian <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> in Solnechnogorsk. In 2008 Russia announced that it was pulling out of the agreement with Ukraine and that the last data given to Russia from the stations would be in 2009. The Ukrainian government announced that the stations were to be used part-time for space surveillance.|$|E
40|$|Community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> involve {{community}} driven {{collection and}} analysis of information that enable warning messages to help a community to react to a hazard and reduce the resulting loss or harm. Most <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are designed at the national or global level. Local communitiesâ€™ capacity to predict weather conditions using indigenous knowledge has been demonstrated in studies focusing on climate change and agriculture in some African countries. This review was motivated by successes made in non-disease specific community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{with a view to}} identify opportunities for developing similar systems for malaria. This article reviewed the existing community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> documented in literature. The types of disasters that are addressed by these systems and the methodologies utilised {{in the development of the}} systems were identified. The review showed that most of the documented community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> focus on natural disasters such as floods, drought, and landslides. Community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for human diseases are very few, even though such systems exist at national and regional and global levels. There is a clear gap in terms of community-based malaria <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> The methodologies for the development of the community-based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> reviewed mainly derive from the four elements of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> systems; namely risk knowledge, monitoring, warning communication and response capability. The review indicated the need for the development of community based <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for human diseases. Keywords: community; early warning; disaster; hazards</p...|$|R
50|$|Since the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, {{there has}} been a surge of {{interest}} in developing <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> However, <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> can be used to detect a wide range of events, such as vehicular collisions, missile launches, disease outbreaks, and so forth.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-exhausting overview of <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for emerging foodborne hazards that are {{operating in the}} various places in the world. Special attention is given to endpoint-focussed <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. ECDC, ISIS and GPHIN) and hazard-focussed <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. FVO, RASFF and OIE) and their merit to successfully identify a food safety problem in an early stage is discussed. Besides these <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{which are based on}} monitoring of either disease symptoms or hazards, also <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and/or activities that intend to predict the occurrence of a food safety hazard in its very beginning of development or before that are described. Examples are trend analysis, horizon scanning, <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for mycotoxins in maize and/or wheat and information exchange networks (e. g. OIE and GIEWS). Furthermore, recent initiatives that aim to develop predictive <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> based on the holistic principle are discussed. The assumption of the researchers applying this principle is that developments outside the food production chain that are either directly or indirectly related {{to the development of a}} particular food safety hazard may also provide valuable information to predict the development of this hazard...|$|R
5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century astronomers {{increasingly}} {{turned to}} computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. Recently the Supernova <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|In Tokelau, many of {{the local}} {{officials}} feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of mosquitoes and other insects, increasing {{the threat of a}} dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged {{many of the}} hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave <b>Early</b> <b>Warning</b> <b>system</b> (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|This {{programme}} is one {{of three}} programmes that NATO is pursuing in the area of missile defence. The contract puts the Alliance on track for having, by 2010, a system to protect troops on missions against ballistic missiles. The contract is worth approximately 75 million EUR for work that would be conducted over a period of six years. The theatre missile defence would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are deeply divided about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|E
5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.|$|E

5|$|After his {{transfer}} to JG 27, Galland met MÃ¶lders again. Due to his injuries, Galland could never match MÃ¶lders' sharp eyesight; the {{shards of glass}} in his eyes denied him that capacity. However, MÃ¶lders, by that time a recognised ace (a pilot with five or more aerial victories), shared what experiences he could with Galland; leadership in the air, tactics and organisation. MÃ¶lders was Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{at the time of}} their meeting. In order for Galland to gain experience on the Bf 109E, which Galland lacked, he offered Galland the chance to join his unit which was flying patrols along the French border. During these sorties, Galland learned MÃ¶lders' tactics, such as using spotter aircraft to indicate the position of enemy formation, as an <b>early</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> Galland learned to allow the Staffel to operate freely in order to seize the initiative and surprise. Taking his findings back to JG 27, its commander Max Ibel, agreed to their implementation. Galland gained further experience as a combat leader acting as the Gruppenkommandeur, when the Gruppenkommandeur went on leave.|$|E
