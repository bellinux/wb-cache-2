5|$|Official {{production}} for FutureSex/LoveSounds started in December 2005. When production began, Jive Records Chairman and CEO, Barry Weiss, asked when the album would be completed, to which Timberlake replied that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> take a year. The title was not finalized until Jive Records gave Timberlake a deadline on finishing {{what would become}} FutureSex/LoveSounds. The collective thought the album is comparable with Michael Jackson's landmark record, Thriller, dubbing their own as Thriller 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> swing at an arc of 180 degrees, {{covering}} the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds {{at the tail end}} may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E

5|$|HD 154672 b is {{a closely}} {{orbiting}} planet that {{is larger than}} Jupiter. Its mass was estimated as 5.02 that of Jupiter. HD 154672 b also orbits its host star {{at a distance of}} 0.6 AU every 163.91 days. Earth, in comparison, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1 AU every 365.25 days. However, HD 154672 b has an orbital eccentricity of 0.61, which indicates a very elliptical orbit. Because HD 154672 b has such an eccentric orbit, the equilibrium temperature of the planet varies between 300 K and 600 K, which is significantly higher than that of Jupiter (124 K). If liquid water is present in the atmosphere of HD 154672 b, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> convert between gaseous and liquid phases as the planet moves along its orbit.|$|E
25|$|Skyguard {{would use}} laser beams to {{intercept}} rockets, with each beam discharge costing an estimated $1,000–$2,000. With {{an investment of}} $180million, Northrop Grumman claimed <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> deploy the system within 18months. Israeli defense officials rejected the proposal, citing the extended timeline and additional costs.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of all the}} parishes (with the {{exception}} of Kingston Parish and Saint Andrew Parish) Saint Catherine shows the most potential for urban development. With its good water resources, virtually flat landscape, and nearness to the capital, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> {{be one of the}} Caribbean's major urban areas in the next few years.|$|E

25|$|In early 2013, NASA {{announced}} {{the planning stages}} of a mission to capture a near-Earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the Moon. On 19 June 2014, NASA reported that asteroid 2011 MD was a prime candidate for capture by a robotic mission, perhaps in the early 2020s.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that the handkerchief was his. He was administered a polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He had no idea how <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have ended up in Chicago and the presence of the handkerchief was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2004, The Aquabats were signed to {{independent}} label Nitro Records and began work on a new studio album in the fall. Despite this fortuitous turn of events, the group were still uncertain of their future following their semi-hiatus and radical shift in line-up; Jacobs later admitted that the band spent the recording sessions under the belief that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be their last album. After several months of production and much online hype, The Aquabats released their fourth album Charge!! on July 7, 2005. Continuing with the direction set by Yo! Check Out This Ride!, Charge!! was a bold introduction to The Aquabats' new musical style of guitar-driven, new wave-influenced rock.|$|E
60|$|My {{surprise}} was great, but short-lived. Clearly, amongst extreme anarchists {{there could be}} no hierarchy; nothing in the nature of a law of precedence. The idea of anarchy ruling among anarchists was comforting, too. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> not <b>possibly</b> make for efficiency.|$|R

Clinical signs can show up anywhere from days to years after exposure.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a {{difficult}} decision; he could move his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria {{to come to his}} aid and launch a war from there. He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> {{fall into the hands of}} a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master—forbidden in the Islamic principles in which he believed—could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders. Saladin saw that in order to acquire Syria, he either needed an invitation from as-Salih, or to warn him that potential anarchy could give rise to danger from the Crusaders.|$|E
25|$|The Donne Triptych, {{held in the}} National Gallery in London, {{also has}} a similar setting and the same saints, but the donors are {{positioned}} with the female saints on the central panel; the two Johns are each depicted on separate wing panels. Art historians are unsure whether the Donne Triptych was painted in the early 1480s, {{at about the same}} time as Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara, or in the late 1470s when the altarpiece was completed, or whether it was perhaps an earlier piece painted as a precursor to the altarpiece. Sir John Donne, a Welsh-born diplomat for the House of York, came to Bruges in 1468 to attend Charles the Bold's and Margaret of York wedding; how Donne became acquainted with Memling is as uncertain as when he commissioned the triptych, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> have occurred during the 1468 visit to Bruges.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

60|$|And {{suddenly}} the aeropile slipped {{over the edge}} of the Council House and fell.

25|$|Ahab's {{contribution}} {{was estimated at}} 2,000 chariots and 10,000 men. In reality, however, the number of chariots in Ahab's forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds (based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found). If, however, the numbers are referring to allies <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> include forces from Tyre, Judah, Edom, and Moab. The Assyrian king claimed a victory, but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 849 BC and 846 BC against a similar but unspecified coalition seem {{to show that he}} met with no lasting success. According to the Tanakh, however, Ahab with 7,000 troops had previously overthrown Ben-hadad and his thirty-two kings, who had come to lay siege to Samaria, and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at Aphek, probably in the plain of Sharon at Antipatris (1 Kings 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father, and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.|$|E
500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that it is such a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of it for the first time in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also {{we wanted to make}} sure that it was the best <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E

500|$|The size of Hatzegopteryx was {{initially}} estimated {{by comparing the}} [...] humerus fragment with that of Quetzalcoatlus northropi, which has a -long humerus.

The latter is generally estimated at [...] in length.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011, it was {{announced}} that Aguilera and Green were collaborating on a song. A demo track, entitled [...] "Nasty", leaked online and was later confirmed to be an unused song from Aguilera's soundtrack album Burlesque.

The same month, Green was asked about the song in an interview with Billboard; he explained: [...] "It's a song for her album.

Tim Sheehy at Destructoid called the game promising, based on a demo available at Tokyo Game Show, saying that the demo left him wanting more.
