5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar <b>flattening.</b>|$|E

Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 {{and was replaced by}} Sean Foley.|$|E
5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later <b>flattening</b> out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off.

5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then <b>flattening</b> and polishing the thin section with an abrasive.

25|$|In melody, blues is {{distinguished}} {{by the use}} of the <b>flattened</b> third, fifth and seventh of the associated major scale. These specialized notes are called the blue or bent notes. These scale tones may replace the natural scale tones, or they may be added to the scale, {{as in the case of}} the minor blues scale, in which the <b>flattened</b> third replaces the natural third, the <b>flattened</b> seventh replaces the natural seventh and the <b>flattened</b> fifth is added between the natural fourth and natural fifth. While the 12-bar harmonic progression had been intermittently used for centuries, the revolutionary aspect of blues was the frequent use of the <b>flattened</b> third, <b>flattened</b> seventh, and even <b>flattened</b> fifth in the melody, together with crushing—playing directly adjacent notes at the same time (i.e., minor second)—and sliding, similar to using grace notes. The blue notes allow for key moments of expression during the cadences, melodies, and embellishments of the blues.|$|R
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or <b>flattening</b> of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E

Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of <b>flattening</b> the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E
40|$|A <b>flattened</b> Lorentzian {{irradiance}} profile, {{which was}} introduced by Brenner in 2003, offers prospects for analytic design of beam shaping optics when transforming a Gaussian beam into a soft-flat-top profile.

5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before <b>flattening</b> out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave <b>flattening).</b> Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a <b>flattening</b> of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E
40|$|Increasing integrated-circuit pin {{bandwidth}} has motivated {{a corresponding}} {{increase in the}} degree or radix of interconnection networks and their routers. This paper describes the <b>flattened</b> butterfly, a cost-efficient topology for high-radix networks. On benign (load-balanced) traffic, the <b>flattened</b> butterfly approaches the cost/performance of a butterfly network and has roughly {{half the cost of}} a comparable performance Clos network. The advantage over the Clos is achieved by eliminating redundant hops when they are not needed for load balance. On adversarial traffic, the <b>flattened</b> butterfly matches the cost/performance of a folded-Clos network and provides an order of magnitude better performance than a conventional butterfly. In this case, global adaptive routing is used to switch the <b>flattened</b> butterfly from minimal to non-minimal routing — using redundant hops only when they are needed. Different routing algorithms are evaluated on the <b>flattened</b> butterfly and compared against alternative topologies. We also provide a detailed cost model for an interconnection network and compare the cost of the <b>flattened</b> butterfly to alternative topologies to show the cost advantages of the <b>flattened</b> butterfly. ...|$|R

5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by <b>flattening</b> its pharynx which {{acts as a}} valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity at a constant volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{function}} of various patterns of animal coloration {{that have been}} called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), with the suggestion {{that there may be}} multiple functions including <b>flattening</b> and background matching when viewed from the side; background matching when viewed from above or below, implying separate colour schemes for the top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of largely untested non-camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Eaton {{became the}} first {{scientist}} to publish a more {{detailed description of the}} entire Pteranodon skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on {{a better understanding of the}} differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and <b>flattening</b> on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no Pteranodon skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: P. occidentalis, P. ingens, and P. longiceps.|$|E

5|$|Offshore impacts were significant; on 30January, {{the yacht}} Darkie washed ashore at South Brook Island, its crew of four surviving. Throughout Queensland, the cyclone {{isolated}} small towns, cut off telephone service, inflicted severe damage to crops, and generated widespread flooding. Between Cairns and Ingham, Winifred obliterated structures, toppled power lines, uprooted trees, wrecked 1000homes, and damaged hundreds of others. Service of the Sunlander between Gordonvale and Babinda was interrupted after tracks were inundated, and travelers {{were forced to}} travel by bus instead. At the latter city, approximately 500homes suffered significant damage, and at Innisfail, 200residences were destroyed. Several individuals were recovered safely from wreckage of a building collapse in each city. At Babinda, sixteen other structures were wrecked, with the cyclone unroofing an additional 50houses and <b>flattening</b> 40sheds. Five individuals were badly injured, two of them impaled by flying glass and other debris. Officials noted that the cyclone tore off the police station door and unroofed a Uniting Church.

5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap is initially hemispherical before <b>flattening</b> with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The cap margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to the stalk), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may {{the top of the}} stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from the stalk {{to the edge of the}} cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).|$|E
