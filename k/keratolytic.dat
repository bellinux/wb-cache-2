5|$|Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid {{that stops}} {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has <b>keratolytic</b> properties.

5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, <b>keratolytic</b> soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E

25|$|Treatment is by reassurance, as the {{condition}} is benign, and then by correction of any predisposing factors. This may be cessation of smoking or cessation/substitution of implicated medications or mouthwashes. Generally direct measures to return the tongue to its normal appearance involve improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue before sleep. This promotes desquamation of the hyperparakeratotic papillae. <b>Keratolytic</b> agents (chemicals to remove keratin) such as podophyllin are successful, but carry safety concerns. Other reported successful measures include sodium bicarbonate mouthrinses, eating pineapple, sucking on a peach stone and chewing gum.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Lichen spinulosus is a rare, benign {{dermatosis}} representing follicular keratotic disorders. It {{is characterized}} by follicular keratotic papules grouped into large patches. Symmetrical and often asymptomatic lesions affect the limbs, trunk, neck and very rarely the face. The etiopathogenesis of lichen spinulosus is unclear. The disease has been reported predominantly in children in the second decade of life, more frequently in boys. For the treatment <b>keratolytics</b> and emollients are mainly used. Topical corticosteroids, retinoids, tar preparations and vitamin D analogs are also useful. The disease has not been reported in Polish medical literature. Objective. Presentation of child with lichen spinulosus and review of the literature. Case report. An 8 -year-old, generally healthy boy presented {{for a couple of}} years symmetrical, small spinous papules grouped into patches. Lesions affected the knee and shins. Hyperkeratotic lesions on the eyelids and nose were also observed. Histopathology showed dilated hair follicles with keratotic plugs and mild lymphocytic infiltration. According to clinical and histopathological features, the diagnosis of lichen spinulosus was established. The patient was treated with <b>keratolytics</b> and emollients with partial remission. Conclusions. Lichen spinulosus is a rare dermatosis which should be differentiated from other follicular keratotic disorders as well as nummular eczema, lichen planopilaris, frictional childhood eruptions, miliary pustular syphilis and psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|Olmsted {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} congenital, sharply circumscribed transgredient palmoplantar keratoderma. It was first described by Olmsted in 1927.

It starts in the neonatal period or in childhood. The disease has a slow but progressive and extremely disabling course.
