500|$|The {{poems in}} <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved focus on themes of hard work, {{universal}} experiences of humans, {{the struggle of}} African Americans, and love and relationships. [...] Like most of her poetry, the collection has received little serious critical attention, although most reviews have been positive.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{her writing}} career she began {{alternating}} {{the publication of}} an autobiography and a volume of poetry. By the time <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved was published in 1990, she had published five autobiographies, eventually going on to publish seven. [...] Her publisher, [...] Random House, placed the poems in <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved in her first collection of poetry, The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou (1994), perhaps to capitalize on her popularity following her reading of her poem [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] at President Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993. [...] Also in the 1994 collection were her four previous collections, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975), And Still I Rise (1978), and Shaker, Why Don't You Sing? (1983). [...] Angelou's publisher placed four poems in a smaller volume entitled [...] Phenomenal Woman in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Critic Lyman B. Hagen {{states that}} much of Angelou's poetry and most of her writings, {{especially}} [...] "Worker's Song", the first poem in <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved, praises the laborer. [...] He says, [...] "In Angelou's writings, rarely is there anyone who does not work. [...] Everyone of her characters—singers, dancers, railway workers, etc.—works hard". [...] Critic Hazel Rochman, who calls the poem an [...] "exquisitely simple worksong", states that Angelou connects physical action with wit and longing. [...] She compares it to the performances of singer Paul Robeson and to Langston Hughes' poem [...] "Florida Road Workers". [...] Michele Howe calls <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved [...] "a collection that testifies to the undaunted spirit of oppressed people everywhere", and states that it [...] "relates a history of hard work, pain, joy, and the affection and heartbreak often associated with love". [...] She also mentions [...] "Worker's Song" [...] in her article in the New Jersey newspaper The Star-Ledger, stating that it describes the struggles of the workers that [...] "keep the whole world running".|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved is Maya Angelou's fifth {{volume of}} poetry. [...] She studied and began writing poetry {{at a young}} age. [...] After her rape {{at the age of}} seven, as recounted in her first {{autobiography}} I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), she dealt with her trauma by memorizing and reciting great works of literature, including poetry, which helped bring her out of her self-imposed muteness.|$|E
500|$|Anne became queen {{upon the}} death of William III on 8 March 1702, and was {{immediately}} popular. In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, [...] "As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>not</b> be ready {{to do for the}} happiness and prosperity of England." ...|$|E
500|$|Rochman, {{when she}} compares [...] "Worker's Song" [...] to Hughes' [...] "Florida Road Workers", states that like Hughes, Angelou's poem {{combines}} rhythm and sense. [...] She considers the poem {{the best in}} the volume, calling many of the other poems in <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved [...] "too polemical". [...] Rochman says that the sensuous details in Angelou's best poems enlivens her abstractions, and finds no false sentiments in them. [...] She also states, [...] "The dying fall of many lines combined with the strong beat reinforces the feeling of struggle and uncertainty".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, the King suffered several heart attacks, {{but refused}} to go to bed, saying, [...] "No, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>not</b> give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end." [...] Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King George V) {{told him that his}} horse, Witch of the Air, had won at Kempton Park that afternoon. The King replied, [...] "Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad": his final words. At 11:30p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved {{is author}} and poet Maya Angelou's fifth {{collection}} of poetry, published by Random House in 1990. [...] Angelou had written four autobiographies and published four other volumes of poetry {{up to that}} point. [...] Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright and her poetry has also been successful, but she {{is best known for}} her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. She began, early in her writing career, of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. [...] Most critics agree that Angelou's poems are more interesting when she recites them.|$|E
500|$|The upper façade {{contained}} paired pilasters {{on either}} side, {{and a thick}} entablature and triangular pediment. The architect Sir John Soane criticised Dance's combination of slender pilasters and a heavy entablature as a [...] "strange and extravagant absurdity". The capitals topping the pilasters sported volutes {{in the shape of}} ammonite fossils. Dance invented this neo-classical feature, which became known as the Ammonite Order, specifically for the gallery. In a recess between the pilasters, Dance placed Thomas Banks's sculpture Shakespeare attended by Painting and Poetry, for which the artist was paid 500 guineas. The sculpture depicted Shakespeare, reclining against a rock, between the Dramatic Muse and the Genius of Painting. Beneath it was a panelled pedestal inscribed with a quotation from Hamlet: [...] "He was a Man, take him for all in all, <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>not</b> look upon his like again".|$|E

500|$|Etty {{landed in}} Dieppe, {{and made his}} way to Paris via Rouen. Although he {{admitted}} to finding France a beautiful country, he was unhappy throughout his stay there, suffering from severe homesickness; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that [...] "I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris, or I think <b>I</b> <b>shall</b> <b>not</b> feel resolution to stop a year. If I don't, I shall content myself with seeing what I think worth while; and then return." [...] He travelled onwards via Geneva, but found Switzerland frustrating; although he had brought his own tea-making equipment with him, in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea. Travelling through the Simplon Pass to Piedmont revived his spirits somewhat; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating, and in late September arrived in Florence.|$|E
500|$|Angelou uses rhyme and {{repetition}} {{throughout all}} her works, yet rhyme is only found {{in seven of}} the poems in Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie; critic Lyman B. Hagen calls her use of rhythm [...] "rather ordinary and unimaginative". [...] Death is an important theme throughout many of Angelou's works, especially in Caged Bird, which opens with it and, according to scholar Liliane K. Arensberg, is resolved at the book's end, when her son is born. [...] Death is directly mentioned in 19 of the 38 poems in Diiie. [...] According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, many of the poems in Diiie, along with those in Angelou's second volume Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well, [...] "lack the overt empowerment themes of her later, better known works", especially And Still I Rise (1978) and <b>I</b> <b>Shall</b> <b>Not</b> Be Moved (1990).|$|E
