40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international coercive policies on <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> parties operating within ‘rogue’ states.

In order to explore this issue, the time period from 1992 to 2000 is broken down into five subperiods in each of which Serbia’s experience of international coercion differed in terms of its nature and/or extent. Within each of these sub-periods the issues of whether Serbia’s opposition parties held positions that differed from those of the Milosevic regime on issues that were of key international concern; the extent and nature of links between the Serbian <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> and the international community; and the impact of international policy on the effectiveness of the <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> <b>in</b> opposing the Milosevic regime is investigated.
