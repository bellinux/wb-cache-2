40|$|Traditional {{real-time}} scheduling algorithms typically {{assume that}} <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> tasks {{do not change}} with time. Task deadlines in many real-time command, control and communication applications change over time. <b>Deadlines</b> <b>of</b> some tasks in these applications depend on {{the states of the}} objects monitored and controlled by the applications. Because the states of the objects change with time, the deadlines may also change with time.

5|$|As the <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> noon approached, set the {{previous}} day {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> 14:00. The police allowed the deadline to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} delivering real-time messages, both periodic and aperiodic, over Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop or FC-AL. Periodic messages typically have hard real-time constraints whereas aperiodic tasks are delivered based on the best-effort approach.

The aperiodic messages are delivered using a global server scheme based on the full duplex communication and transfer state facilitated in FC-AL.

40|$|Many {{distributed}} and multiprocessor real-time applications {{consist of}} pipelines of tasks that must complete before their end-to-end deadlines. Different schedulability analyses {{have been proposed}} for both Fixed Priority and Earliest Deadline First scheduling. All the schedulability analyses proposed so far assume that a global clock synchronization protocol is used to synchronize the <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> jobs allocated on different processors. This assumption may limit the applicability of EDF to such systems. In this paper, we propose the Distributed Deadline Synchronization Protocol (DDSP) for computing the absolute <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> jobs. The protocol is a non-trivial extension of the Release Guard Protocol proposed for fixed priority systems. DDSP {{does not require a}} global clock synchronization, yet existing schedulability analyses are valid for schedules generated by DDSP...|$|R
5|$|On 26 November, {{the same}} day the {{incident}} occurred, Pakistan ordered the US to shut down and vacate the Shamsi Airfield in the southwestern Balochistan province within a <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> 15 days. US forces and the Central Intelligence Agency had reportedly leased this airbase in 2001 for joint surveillance and launching drone attacks against militants in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan. The Shamsi airbase was the only military base in Pakistan being used by the United States, and orders of its evacuation by US personnel symbolised an increasing rift and deterioration in relations between Pakistan and the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In IEEE 802. 12 network, a {{repeater}} arbitrates {{the network}} access contentions among the nodes on round robin basis. The node having received {{a grant from}} the repeater, can transmit a frame. The burst mode, a newly approved feature in IEEE 802. 12 network, allows a node to transmit multiple frames per grant. This paper proposes a bandwidth allocation scheme based on the burst mode to guarantee the <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> periodic real-time messages. Once the bandwidth of each node is derived from the lengths and <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> periodic messages, a node can transmit the frames up to the allocated bandwidth per grant. Simulation study shows that the proposed scheme provides much higher guarantee ratio and graceful degradation for high network load, compared with the existing approaches...|$|R

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{continued}} efforts of U.S. Chess Federation officials, a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands, {{in which it was}} accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32. FIDE set a <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm their participation in the match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion. In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.|$|E

3000|$|The {{policies}} {{to schedule a}} mixture of elastic and real-time flows (with delay <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> {{the order of a}} second) have been considered in [30] for narrowband systems, and in [31] for wideband OFDMA systems where the latter assumes that the statistics of the packet arrival process of the real-time flows along with the channel statistics are known. The scheduling policy in [31] is persistent and only provides an average rate guarantee to the real-time flows, which, as pointed out earlier, is generally not sufficient to guarantee the packet delay targets. By contrast with the above two, in this paper we investigate whether, given the faster MAC turn-around times and larger bandwidths of LTE systems, the queue- and channel-aware scheduler can and should be used for real-time flows with delay <b>deadlines</b> <b>of</b> few tens of milliseconds.

5|$|The Glazers' {{shareholding}} increased {{gradually to}} 76.2% by 23 May, {{when they made}} their final offer of 300 pence per share, with a <b>deadline</b> <b>of</b> 3p.m. on 13 June.

Despite the board's encouragement, the Glazers' share in the club had only reached 97.3% by 14 June, short of the 97.6% threshold required for a compulsory buyout of all remaining shareholders, prompting them to extend the deadline on their offer to purchase the remaining shares until 27 June. A statement released on 28 June said that Red Football's shareholding had reached 98% (259,950,194 shares), prompting a squeeze out of the remaining shareholders. The final valuation of the club was almost £790million (approximately $1.5billion at the exchange rate at the time).|$|E
