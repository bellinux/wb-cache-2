40|$|Graduation date: 1994 In the Pacific Northwest, a {{transition}} has begun that is shifting many practices in forest management. Traditionally, harvesting and regeneration {{has been done}} through clearcutting which removes all trees in the area being cut and plants an entirely new stand. Clearcutting is often the most efficient method for harvesting forests since implementation and other costs are kept to a minimum, while yields and revenues are maximized by removing all of the timber. Now, however, ecosystem and aesthetic concerns are directing forest management away from clearcutting, which usually impairs both, and toward other methods that are less damaging to the environment. Many of these alternative systems can be classified under the heading New Forestry. " Typically, their applications involve leaving live trees on the site after a cutting, thereby creating a more diversified stand than would a clearcut. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the timber volumes and <b>financial</b> <b>yields</b> between New Forestry techniques and clearcutting. Two alternative systems of management were designed to represent variations on the New Forestry theme. The first was a two-story technique where the stand would consist of two distinct size classes, and all harvests would leave a few trees scattered throughout the site. The second alternative method was a group-selection system that would consist of multiple entries removing small patches of a stand at a time. It was determined that managing two-story stands would reduce volume yields by 3 % to 29 % and <b>financial</b> <b>yields</b> by 6 % to 15 % depending on the number of live trees left after harvest. Group-selection stands reduced average annual volume yields by 6 % or 10 % and <b>financial</b> <b>yields</b> by 33 % or 45 % depending on the number of entries in a rotation.

40|$|Yield {{has become}} a central issue in tourism development. The New Zealand Tourism Strategy 2010 {{has called for a}} {{sustainable}} yield in two of its four key principles for the sector's long-term prosperity. Despite the rhetoric about tourism yield, little is known of its meaning or measurement, especially among tourism proprietors. A broad measure is required to address the questions of financial, economic and community-based sustainability at each level of the sector. That is, one that not only captures an accurate financial and economic measure of a high yield but also measures the sustainability of community and public assets. This is a pilot study of tourism proprietors' perceptions of business performance tools and yield management strategies among tourism businesses in Akaroa Township, a small coastal resort town on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. A mixed method approach (qualitative and quantitative) is employed in the study. Economic Value Added (EVA) is used as a quasi-experimental tool to measure the tourism business proprietors' perceptions and behaviour of measuring performance in New Zealand and their learning readiness for a new performance metric. The findings of the study indicate that many tourism proprietors have a poor understanding even of <b>financial</b> <b>yield</b> and of how to measure their business success. Many tourism proprietors are involved in the sector for a 'mixed bag' of motivations, which suggests that a measure of a purely <b>financial</b> <b>yield</b> will miss much of the true nature of their tourism investing and operating decisions.

40|$|Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) {{disposal}} {{has been}} a controversial issue in many countries over the past years, due to disagreement among the various stakeholders on the waste management policies and technologies to be adopted. One of the ways of treating/disposing MSW is energy recovery, as waste is considered to contain {{a considerable amount of}} bio-waste and therefore can lead to renewable energy production. The overall efficiency can be very high in the cases of co-generation or tri-generation. In this paper a model is presented, aiming to support decision makers in issues relating to Municipal Solid Waste energy recovery. The idea of using more fuel sources, including MSW and agricultural residue biomass that may exist in a rural area, is explored. The model aims at optimizing the system specifications, such as the capacity of the base-load Waste-to-Energy facility, the capacity of the peak-load biomass boiler and the location of the facility. Furthermore, it defines the quantity of each potential fuel source that should be used annually, in order to maximize the <b>financial</b> <b>yield</b> of the investment.

In addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the effect of the most important parameters of the model on the optimum solution, pinpointing the parameters of interest rate, investment cost and heating oil price, as those requiring the attention of the decision makers.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify yield based visitor and itinerary prototypes. An examination of tourist itineraries (i. e. tourist behaviour across space and time) as reported in the International Visitor Survey revealed that – when itineraries are sufficiently simplified – patterns of similarity emerge. However, the diversity was still too large to be able to derive a manageable set of ‘itinerary prototypes’. For this reason a simplified approach was taken, in which spatial implications of tourist travel where measured through visitation to Regional Tourism Organisations. It could be seen that the spatial distribution is shaped by a wide range of factors, including country of origin, port of arrival, travel style, repeat visitation, purpose of travel, and presence of children under 15. The weakest amongst the analysed factors was whether tourists travelled with children or not. Importantly, it has to be noted that most of the factors analysed are interrelated. In turn, it could also be shown that the spatial distribution of tourists is related to yield, for example average expenditure per day by tourists who visit major centres is higher than that of tourists who include more remote areas in their itinerary. Knowing that country of origin has an important influence on distributional patterns and its relationship to other key drivers of itineraries (see also the Ministry of Tourism’s Flows Model), made origin a useful variable for an a priori segmentation of yield analyses in relation to itineraries. The country of origin analysis provided useful insights into travel behaviour (e. g. length of stay, expenditure, transport choices), tourist decision making (where information was available), and <b>financial</b> <b>yield.</b> It could be seen, for example, that the behaviour of Australian tourists is largely driven by its strong visiting friends/relatives component (e. g. high repeat visitation), whereas behaviour by British and German visitors seems strongly influenced by the long distance from home (e. g. length of stay, expenditure). While the Chinese and Japanese markets share some similarities (e. g. shorter stays, propensity to tour group travel) the main difference lies in the greater travel experience by Japanese tourists. American visitors were found to fall between European and Asian visitors in their travel behaviour. The yield associated with the six main countries of origin was analysed for the financial dimension. <b>Financial</b> <b>yield</b> was chosen as it can be measured as a national-level or ‘systemic’ indicator rather than local or ‘site-specific’ indicators for yield, such as environmental or social impacts. Further analyses of yield at a local level will be undertaken later on in the research programme. The analysis of expenditure, Value Added and Economic Value Added shows that the ‘preferability’ of a certain market depends on the indicator selected and also whether yield per trip or per day is calculated. In all cases, the German market appears favourable, mainly {{as a result of their}} high spending on rented vehicles, which is associated with high <b>financial</b> <b>yield.</b> In the light of the findings above, this component of the research developed a framework for the further analysis of decision making in the Spatial Yield research programme.

A sequential quadratic programming routine is applied for the entire investigation period whilst the time-dependent objective function is subject to various social and production constraints, usually confronted in power sectors. The analysis indicated the optimal capacity additions that should be annually ordered from each competitive technology in order to substantially improve both the economy and the sustainability of the system. It is confirmed that higher electricity prices lead to higher <b>financial</b> <b>yields</b> of power production, irrespective of the CO 2 allowance price level. Moreover, by following the proposed licensing planning, a medium-term reduction of CO 2 emissions per MW h by 30 % might be possible. Interestingly, the combination of electricity prices subsidisation with high CO 2 allowance prices may provide favourable conditions for investors willing to engage on renewable energy markets.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to: (1) describe the colonisation process; (2) assess the role of the artificial reefs in terms of juvenile recruitment and growth and as mating/spawning areas and (3) evaluate the potential of artificial reefs as near shore artisanal fishing grounds for three economically important fish species, Diplodus bellottii (Steindachner), Diplodus sargus (L.) and Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire). The fish assemblages were monitored after the deployment of a large artificial reef (Faro/Ancao) in 2002. Colonisation rates for the three species were fast. Artificial reefs play a multiple role for Diplodus spp., acting as recruitment, growth and nursery areas for juveniles, and spawning/mating areas for adults, and can thus be considered essential fish habitat. Three months after deployment of the artificial reefs, exploitable biomass was 16, 29 and 8 kg per reef group, respectively, for D. bellotti, D. sargus and D. vulgaris. These results indicate that artificial reefs quickly become good fishing grounds, where suitable <b>financial</b> <b>yields</b> may be obtained by fisher. Moreover, the artificial reefs became new and alternative fishing grounds, allowing reduction of fishing effort over traditional rocky areas that are scarce along the Algarve coast. Management measures for artificial reefs, in terms of fishing strategies, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} model in which financially {{constrained}} arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies across segmented markets. We show that the dynamics of arbitrage capital are self-correcting: following a shock that depletes capital, returns increase, and this allows capital to be gradually replenished. Spreads increase more for trades with volatile fundamentals or more time to convergence. Arbitrageurs cut their positions more in those trades, except when volatility concerns the hedgeable component. <b>Financial</b> constraints <b>yield</b> a positive cross-sectional relationship between spreads/returns and betas with respect to arbitrage capital. Diversification of arbitrageurs across markets induces contagion, but generally lowers arbitrageurs’ risk and price volatility...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{has shown that}} it is hard to find unambiguous evidence that <b>financial</b> openness <b>yields</b> an improvement in economic performance, particularly at the macro level. One of the major problems in empirical work is the bundling of financial openness with a potential host of other growth-friendly reforms, and the endogeneity of the liberalization decision itself. Nonetheless, policymakers (in emerging and developing economies) have displayed a remarkable revealed preference for financial openness, and the trend is likely to continue (Obstfeld, 2007). Accordingly, the underlying question this book has aimed to answer, is why this revealed preference...|$|R
