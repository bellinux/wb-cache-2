50|$|PDT (short for Professional <b>Digital</b> <b>Trunking</b> or Police <b>Digital</b> <b>Trunking)</b> {{is an open}} {{industry}} standard for trunked radio system in China servicing police wireless communications and professional mobile radio. The standard is being maintained by the Professional <b>Digital</b> <b>Trunking</b> System Industry Association, an association of major vendors of wireless communications equipment in China. The association was formed with the help from Information and Communications Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security. The standard was used to facilitate the digital transformation of the Ministry's existing MPT analogue trunking system. Government policy supporting this domestic standard had lead to the abolishment of previous GA/T {{industry standard}}s based on the European TETRA standard.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the interrelatedness between the hierarchical structure of China׳s urban system and high-speed railway (HSR) network planning {{at the national}} level. As a multi-layered system, the Chinese HSR can be categorized into three sub-networks, namely, the national HSR <b>trunk</b> <b>network,</b> the national HSR extensional network, and the intercity HSR network. By examining the direct HSR network connection, HSR nodal connection, and HSR operational frequency of 287 prefecture-level cities, this study demonstrates that the hierarchies of China׳s administrative, demographic, and economic urban systems strongly influence HSR network planning. The national HSR <b>trunk</b> <b>network</b> prioritizes the connection of top-level central cities, whereas the extensional network prioritizes cities at the lower level of the urban system. Moreover, the national HSR system forms {{the backbone of the}} HSR network structure based on a national scale, whereas the intercity HSR system satisfies the travel needs within urban agglomerations based on the regional level...|$|R
