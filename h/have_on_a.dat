5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dumped body.|$|E
5|$|The initial premise {{placed the}} story on a space station to avoid the {{ecological}} damage that the creatures would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> planet. However, Gerrold's agent was concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.|$|E

25|$|Concern {{over the}} {{depletion}} of the earth's finite reserves of oil, and the effect this would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> society dependent on it, is a concept known as peak oil.

The burning of fossil fuels {{plays a major role in}} the current episode of global warming.|$|E
25|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} rule have persistent, long term effects {{on the success of}} former colonies. Lakshmi Iyer, of Harvard Business School, conducted research to determine the impact type of rule can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> region, looking at postcolonial India, where both systems were present under British rule. Iyer’s findings suggests that regions which had previously been ruled indirectly were generally better-governed and more capable of establishing effective institutions than areas under direct British rule. In the modern postcolonial period, areas formerly ruled directly by the British perform worse economically and have significantly less access to various public goods, such as health care, public infrastructure, and education.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} law {{enforcement}} and military agencies have adopted the 5.7×28mm cartridge. These agencies include the Navy SEALs and the Federal Protective Service branch of the ICE. In contrast, some defense contractors, law enforcement analysts, and military analysts say that hydrostatic shock is an unimportant factor when selecting cartridges for a particular use because any incapacitating effect it may <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> target is difficult to measure and inconsistent from one individual to the next. This {{is in contrast to}} factors such as proper shot placement and massive blood loss which are almost always eventually incapacitating for nearly every individual.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{pieces of}} {{legislation}} passed in 1996 {{had a significant effect}} on illegal immigration and deportations in the United States; the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). These were introduced following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, both of which were terrorist attacks that claimed American lives. These two acts changed the way criminal cases of lawful permanent residents were handled, resulting in increased deportations from the United States. Before the 1996 deportation laws, there were two steps that lawful permanent noncitizen residents who were convicted of crimes went through. The first step determined whether or not the person was deportable. The second step determined if that person should or shouldn't be deported. Before the 1996 deportation laws, the second step prevented many permanent residents from being deported by allowing for their cases to be reviewed in full before issuing deportations. External factors were taken into consideration such as the effect deportation would <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> person's family members and a person's connections with their country of origin. Under this system permanent residents were able to be relieved of deportation if their situation deemed it unnecessary. The 1996 laws however issued many deportations under the first step, without going through the second step, resulting in a great increase in deportations.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Observers Sue Arnold, Finch {{believed}} The Archers {{had done}} [...] "a great service for women's health" [...] by tackling {{the subject of}} breast cancer. Finch later revealed that she had received letters from listeners about the storyline and one woman wrote to thank her because she had found a lump in her breast after listening to the show. Finch also named the storyline {{as one of her}} Archers highlights. Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough said The Archers treated the subject of breast cancer [...] "as sensibly as one can reasonably expect." [...] Morgan continues saying that Breakthrough liked how the show had highlighted the effect that a cancer diagnosis can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> partner. In contrast, the radio series Feedback reported that the storyline had initially attracted a negative response from listeners, who felt the subject should have been handled with more optimism.|$|E
30|$|After {{confirming}} that increasing {{weight in the}} communication layer is very likely an intermediate stage preceding the formation of ties in the nomination, we can observe how some edges in the nomination layer emerge gradually over time, from mere collocation to communication finally leading to nomination as cognitively salient contact. In the first semester, we find that students who start communicating in the second semester, but who do not achieve enough cognitive salience to nominate {{one another in the}} network survey, <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> average 74.6 collocations, while those who would not communicate <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> average 25.9 collocations. Now out of these communicators in the second semester, the ones who move on to become nominees in the third semester, <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> average 166.2 collocations, while those that do not become nominees <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> average 55.1 collocations in the second semester. So we observe how some of the emergence of nomination links progress from collocation to communication, gradually increasing the number of occasions in which they find themselves in the same place.|$|R

500|$|The Lion King {{was first}} {{released}} on VHS and laserdisc in the United States on March 3, 1995, under Disney's [...] "Masterpiece Collection" [...] video series. The VHS tape contained a special preview for Walt Disney Pictures' then-upcoming animated film Pocahontas, {{in which the}} title character (voiced by Judy Kuhn) sings the musical number [...] "Colors of the Wind". In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative [...] "Circle of Life" [...] epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show The Making of The Lion King, and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and The Making of The Lion King, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not <b>have,</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold {{on the first day}} and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million before these home video versions went into moratorium in 1997.|$|E
500|$|Even though How the García Girls Lost Their Accents {{was written}} in the United States, there are {{significant}} historical ties between the novel and the author’s country of origin. Alvarez wrote an essay entitled [...] "An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic", in which she reveals some information about her own life. This is evidence that it may have served {{as the basis for the}} novel. For example, she mentions that it was Mr. Victor, of the US embassy and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who persuaded Carlos García to join the resistance against Trujillo, and later helped him in leaving the country, and obtaining a job with an international cardiovascular team. This is a parallel to the novel in which Carlos Garcia obtains work as a doctor in New York. Julia Alvarez emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with her parents and three sisters as political refugees from the Dominican Republic. The novel is a variation of her real-life experiences, which have perhaps been slightly altered. The majority of her literature is constructed from multiple viewpoints and a strongly concealed political undercurrent is present in her literature. In this case, that undercurrent is her family fleeing the Trujillo revolution, something she did as a child. The novel encompasses the impact living under a regime can <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> family, and the way it shaped the four girls' upbringing. It is also an attempt to understand memory, the past, and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents.|$|E

2500|$|Some Spanish {{nationalist}} organisations of neo-fascist character (specifically the AUN), <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{few occasions}} used the arrano beltza as well, presenting it {{as a symbol}} of Spanish unity. For this idea, they allege that Sancho III ruled most of Christian Spain, from León to Barcelona, and that he appeared in many documents named as Rex Hispanorum Regum, that is, [...] "King of the Kings of the Hispanians" [...] (Spaniards), which, from their point of view, demonstrates that the Kingdom of Navarre perceived Spain as a territorial and historical unit, despite its political division (although it is debatable whether Hispania was then a merely geographical term, like its modern-day substitute Iberia).|$|E
