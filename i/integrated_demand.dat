40|$|Excerpt] More {{than ever}} before, {{you and your}} {{operation}} need expertise in demand management, which involves strategies and tactics to encourage your guests to book your hotel or restaurant by dynamically managing demand to optimize revenue while securing customer relationships for the long term. What {{that means is that}} you and your managers must constantly oversee and adjust your operation 2 ̆ 7 s use of distribution channels to reach target customer segments; build on and enhance existing customer relationships; and take effective revenue management actions to achieve an objective balance of near-term profitability and long-term viability. This chapter explains the rapid evolution of demand management in the hospitality industry. I review the many changes in distribution—most of them driven by the rise of the Internet—that have placed the burden of demand management squarely on your shoulders as a chain staff member, regional chain manager, or manager of a local property. At the moment, demand management in most hotels and restaurants is being handled by different positions in different organizations. If you are handling demand management, your title may be marketing manager, revenue manager, or sales manager (or you may have all of those responsibilities with a different title). If more than one person in your operation has demand management responsibility, they may not report to the same boss or even coordinate activities with the same staff group. With the background and strategies presented in this chapter, your firm should move toward a program of <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> management, using all distribution and media channels. With an <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> management program, you and your managers will make integrated decisions about pricing, promotion, distribution channel management, and customer relationship management (CRM) ...|$|E

Inclusion of retail demand factors in explaining markup decisions by wholesalers is crucial to accurate evaluation {{of the effects of}} price and market changes on profitability. We apply an <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> and markup model to markets for organic broccoli and carrots where wholesalers set markups facing retail demand. The estimated integrated system includes crossequation restrictions on organic and conventional prices received from retail, publicity about food safety scares and availability of a competing certification programme. The results show that organic wholesalers behave strategically in response to observable demand factors as they expand into fresh produce markets. Wholesalers arbitrage markups across items to increase market share, combining crop-specific and overall market information to decide on appropriate responses. Wholesalers also attempt to moderate markups in response to demand fluctuations in order to smooth market development. ...|$|E

As a result, the integrated planning and optimal operation of a multi-carrier energy (MCE) system have aroused widespread concern for reasonable utilization of multiple energy resources and efficient accommodation of renewable energy sources. In this context, an <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> response (IDR) scheme is designed to coordinate the operation of power to gas (P 2 G) devices, heat pumps, diversified storage devices and flexible loads within an extended modeling framework of energy hubs. Subsequently, the optimal dispatch of interconnected electricity, natural gas and heat systems is implemented considering the interactions among multiple energy carriers by utilizing the bi-level optimization method. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated with a 4 -bus multi-energy system and a larger test case comprised of a revised IEEE 118 -bus power system and a 20 -bus Belgian natural gas system.|$|E

40|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>Demand</b> Management (IDM) is a near- to mid-term NASA {{concept that}} proposes to address {{mismatches}} in air traffic system demand and capacity by using strategic flow management capabilities to pre-condition demand {{into the more}} tactical Time-Based Flow Management System (TBFM).

Such a capability allows for parametric studies that will inform the HITL simulations, identifying breaking points and parameter values at which significant changes in system behavior occur. This paper also describes the initial validation of individual components of the automated simulation capability, and an example application comparing {{the performance of the}} IDM concept under two TBFM scheduling paradigms.

40|$|Current debate {{focuses on}} the need for the {{transport}} sector to contribute to more ambitious carbon emission reduction targets. In the UK, various macro-economic and energy system wide, top-down models are used to explore the potential for energy demand and carbon emissions reduction in the transport sector. These models can lack the bottom-up, sectoral detail needed to simulate the effects of <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> and supply-side policy strategies to reduce emissions. Bridging the gap between short-term forecasting and long-term scenario "models", this paper introduces a newly developed strategic transport, energy, emissions and environmental impacts model, the UK Transport Carbon Model (UKTCM). The UKTCM covers the range of transport-energy-environment issues from socio-economic and policy influences on energy demand reduction through to life cycle carbon emissions and external costs. The model is demonstrated in this paper by presenting the results of three single policies and one policy package scenario. Limitations of the model are also discussed.

40|$|Compressed {{air supply}} and demand {{strategies}} have received significant attention since <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> management was initiated by Eskom. Due to the expensive nature of this vastly utilised energy carrier, every increase in the efficiency of a system is needed. Usually controlling the compressed air demand resulted in a reduced need for supply, ultimately leading to energy savings. The majority of compressed air optimisation projects on deep level mines in South Africa utilise demand side management initiatives to control or reduce compressed air usage. However, reduction in usage through control, leak repairs and reduced demand often results in system pressure build up. Compressed air supply must also then be reduced accordingly using capacity controllers. The existing capacity control is typically upgraded to reduce compressor output capacity automatically. The problem encountered is that not all compressor controls are created equal, and they produce different results in terms of efficient supply reduction. Inefficient compressor control is frequently encountered in industry today. On average, compressors operate at 16 % below their maximum efficient point due to inefficient surge and capacity controllers. In contrast to this, intelligent compressor control resulted in compressors operating within 9 % of their maximum efficiency point. In this case study, financial savings of R 3 -million per annum could be realised[URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports some {{preliminary}} results from an ongoing study that uses regression methods {{to break down}} total household load into its constituent parts, each associated with a particular electricity-using end use or appliance. The data base {{used for this purpose}} consists of 15 -minute <b>integrated</b> <b>demand</b> readings on a random sample of statistical control group customers from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power TOD (time of day) -pricing experiment for the months of August 1978 (132 customers), 1979 (108 customers), and 1980 (80 customers). Twenty-four regression equations are fitted, each one aimed at explaining variation in the time-averaged load (averaged over days of the month) over customers as a function of temperature, house size, and binary indicator variables that indicate {{the presence or absence of}} each of the end uses of interest. This sort of method for extracting the individual contributions of end uses to total household load has become known as conditional demand analysis (Parti and Parti, 1981). The success of this method for isolating end-use loads statistically, without direct metering of the appliance, depends crucially on whether the ownership patterns of appliances are well mixed. For example, if (as in our sample) everyone owns at least one refrigerator, it will be impossible to isolate refrigerator load. ...|$|E
