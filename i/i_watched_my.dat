6000|$|CAMPBELL: [...] "Me? I didn't {{come in the}} {{elevator}}. I had {{my usual}} luck. The elevator was up somewhere, and after I'd pressed the annunciator button till my thumb ached, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> chance and walked up." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “…because it is {{something}} <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> at <b>my</b> leisure time, {{there is a tendency}} to be lazy. If I was going for a lecture, I know I have to be there but with the video because <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> at <b>my</b> own pace I can actually get lazy doing that.” (Female student, 21  years) [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That {{is indeed}} sooth,' replied the other lady. 'My lord hath ever been most good to me, and I have had joy of my sons. Yet {{there is much}} that my mind forbodes and shrinks back from in dread, as <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> son Richard's overmastering spirit.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that was}} the end of King Wallace," [...] he went on in his sad, low voice. [...] "After the {{excitement}} cooled down <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> chance and bent over and smelled Wallace's head. Then I sneezed." ...|$|E
60|$|I waited, intensely, {{but really}} without hope. And <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> bait until it sank out of sight. Then {{followed}} {{what seemed a}} long wait. Probably it was really only a few moments. I {{had a sort of}} hopeless feeling. But I respected the fish all the more.|$|E
6000|$|Oh! I {{love the}} great blue ocean, [...] I love the {{whistling}} breeze, [...] When the gallant ship sweeps lightly [...] Across the surging seas. [...] <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> first ship building; [...] I saw her timbers rise, [...] Until her masts were towering [...] Up {{in the bright}} blue skies.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as th' animals do. <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> brats—I let 'em grow. They're beauties, they are—sound {{as a young}} ash pole, every one. They shan't {{learn to}} dirty {{themselves}} wi' smirking deviltry—not if I can help it. They can be like birds, or weasels, or vipers, or squirrels, {{so long as they}} ain't human rot, that's what I say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Am I a wild beast {{that you}} should try to kill me {{suddenly}} and in the dark, Tuan Almayer?" [...] said Dain, breaking the strained silence. [...] "Throw some brushwood on the fire," [...] he went on, speaking to Nina, [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> white friend, lest harm should come to you or to me, O delight of my heart!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mason almost {{exclusively}} has written his own material. A sampling of his humor is his commentary on doctors: [...] "That's a great profession, a doctor. Where {{else can you}} ask a woman to get undressed and then send the bill to her husband?" [...] And his commentary on what is important in life: [...] "Money is not important. Love is important. Fortunately, I love money." [...] As well as his ruminations on pleasing people: [...] "You can't please everyone. I have a girlfriend. I think she's the most wonderful person in the world. That's to me. But to my wife ..." [...] And on trust: [...] "My grandfather always said that <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> money. That <b>I</b> should <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> health. So while <b>I</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather." [...] And on fidelity: [...] "Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe." ...|$|R
60|$|We made a wide circle round him, to {{draw the}} flying-fish bait near him. But before we could get it near he went down. The same old story, I thought, with despair--these {{floating}} fish will not bite. We circled over {{the place where he}} had gone down, and <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> bait rising and falling in the low swells.|$|E
60|$|Forbearing {{as he was}} to-night, I {{could not}} stay in this proximity; this {{dangerous}} place and seat must be given up: <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> opportunity, rose, and stole away. He might think, he might even believe that Lucy was contained within that shawl, and sheltered under that hat; he never could be certain, for {{he did not see}} my face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, as I was sayin', I gave 'm the glad hand, an' trailed {{along with}} 'em to the brickyard, an' from the talk I could see things was doin'. Then <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> chance an' sprung my proposition. I was scared stiff {{all the time}} for maybe the teamin' was already arranged. But I knew it wasn't when they asked for my figures. I had 'm by heart, an' I rattled 'm off, and the top-guy took 'm down in his note-book.|$|E
6000|$|... "I ha' vowed my vow {{in another}} place, [...] And bitter oath {{it was on}} me, [...] <b>I</b> ha' <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> arms the lee-long night, [...] Where five-score fighting-men would flee.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have got}} the best of me again!" [...] he muttered, {{clenching}} his fists. [...] "And after I felt sure I had escaped them. It must have been Fate that made Captain Blossom pick them up. Now I've either got to work as a common sailor or submit to being locked up in some dark, foul-smelling hole on the ship. And when we get to Australia, unless <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> chance to skip out, they'll turn me over to the police." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not agree, Major, {{only chance}} for us {{put him in}} blue funk. If I not shoot, {{presently}} he shoot," [...] {{and he made a}} sound that resembled the whistling of an arrow, then added, [...] "Now you go sleep. I not tired, <b>I</b> <b>watch,</b> <b>my</b> eyes see in dark better than yours. Only two more days of this damn forest, then open land with tree here and there, where dwarf no come because he afraid of lion and cannibal man, who like eat him." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, {{and in my}} dreams, often, I got off {{the little}} narrow-gauge train where the straggly village stood beside the big dry creek, {{and got into the}} buckboard behind my {{mountain}} horses, and drove hour by hour past all the old familiar landmarks of my alfalfa meadows, and on to my upland pastures where my rotated crops of corn and barley and clover were ripe for harvesting and where <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> men engaged in the harvest, while beyond, ever climbing, my goats browsed the higher slopes of brush into cleared, tilled fields.|$|E
6000|$|I moved {{accordingly}} to {{the other}} side of that big room. The garniture was very fine. But while pretending to examine it <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> man going forward to meet a tall visitor, who said, [...] "I thought you would be disengaged so early. It's only a word or two"--and after a whispered confabulation of no more than a minute, reconduct him to the door and shake hands ceremoniously. [...] "Not at all, not at all. Very pleased to be of use. You can depend absolutely on my information"--"Oh thank you, thank you. I just looked in." ...|$|E
6000|$|A fresh {{excitement}} made me {{strong for}} each new duty. The present at last held all that I craved. When <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> child among her pillows, {{so much better}} that she prattled of great plans {{to be carried out}} on the far away Coast, I loved even then the land. To see the little one sleep, and watch for her awakening among the great quiet mountains, was to my heart an ecstasy. [...] "Dear Mamma," [...] she cried, clasping her thin hands as the train clambered close to the silent monarchs of the West, [...] "I want to touch they!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip, Dark, {{overgrown}} with willows, cool, with the brook [...] ebbing through so slow, Naked on the steep, soft lip Of the bank <b>I</b> stand <b>watching</b> <b>my</b> own white shadow [...] quivering to and fro.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder where}} it happened," [...] Spencer said reflectively. [...] "I {{have been on}} my guard all the time. <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> wine and coffee at the cafés, and I have eaten only in the {{restaurants}} that I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought it," [...] {{she said}} with a musical laugh, [...] "although at this place I rust and grow dull like an unused sword. Now you would rest. Go--all of you. To-morrow you and I will talk alone. Fear nothing for your safety; you are <b>watched</b> by <b>my</b> slaves and <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> slaves. Until to-morrow, then, farewell. Go now, eat and sleep, as alas we all must do who linger on this ball of earth and cling to a life we should do well to lose. Billali, lead them hence," [...] and she waved her hand to signify that the {{audience}} was ended.|$|R
60|$|I {{was not of}} {{a nature}} to meditate long, without putting my {{thoughts}} into action. My spirit had been suddenly aroused, and was now all awake within me. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> opportunity, fled from the convent, and made my way on foot to Naples. As I entered its gay and crowded streets, and beheld the variety and stir of life around me, the luxury of palaces, the splendor of equipages, and the pantomimic animation of the motley populace, I seemed as if awakened to a world of enchantment, and solemnly vowed that nothing should force {{me back to the}} monotony of the cloister.|$|E

[...] Thou Paynim fool! could Leila's prayer [...] Be passed, and thine accorded there? [...] <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> time, I leagued with these, [...] The traitor in {{his turn to}} seize; [...] My wrath is wreaked, the deed is done, [...] And now I go--but go alone." ...|$|E
60|$|From the {{junction}} of the rivers the road led up the Tambur to Mywa Guola; about sixteen miles by the river, but fully thirty-five, as we wound, ascended, and descended, during three days' marches. We were ferried across the stream in a canoe much ruder {{than that of the}} New Zealander. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> party crossing by boat-loads of fifteen each; the Bhotan men hung little scraps of rags on the bushes before embarking, the votive offerings of a Booddhist throughout central Asia;--the Lepcha, less civilised, scooped up a little water {{in the palm of his}} hand, and scattered it about, invoking the river god of his simple creed.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{was in a}} great panic. I thought, do I {{really want}} this? [...] [...] [...] [...] I {{secretly}} hoped I wouldn't get any further. <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> performance on video and it shows how inexperienced I was." [...] (Nyman, p. 175) ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>my</b> child, {{who is not}} yet {{three years}} old, I can see so many signs of {{knowledge}} from beyond her own mind; why else should she be so excited when a little boy passes outside the window, and take so little interest in a girl; why should she put a cloak about her, and look over her shoulder to see it trailing upon the stairs, as she will some day trail a dress; and why, above all, as she lay against her mother's side, and felt the unborn child moving within, did she murmur, [...] "Baby, baby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} have thought so, if <b>I</b> had not <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> uncle cast off {{troubles}} about his eye-sight and the keeping his living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When did I first {{dream of}} killing him, as I killed the other? I {{could not tell}} you that. But it was some time ago, and <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> {{opportunity}} with patience and perseverance. Then at last the opportunity came, following on terrible provocation. That dark, foggy November night that you all remember so well! I was to meet my tyrant at the Veterans' Club at nine o'clock. I drove up there and as I {{stepped out of the}} cab I {{came face to face with}} Luke. Something in the boy's manner told me what had happened. He didn't tell me, but I guessed. The two men had quarrelled and Luke had had to endure the other's arrogance.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{flattering}} {{his love}} of vengeance, Bucklaw," [...] answered Craigengelt. [...] "He has always distrusted me; but <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> time, and struck while his temper was red-hot {{with the sense of}} insult and of wrong. He goes now to expostulate, as he says, and perhaps thinks, with Sir William Ashton. I say, that if they meet, and the lawyer puts him to his defence, the Master will kill him; for he had that sparkle in his eye which never deceives you when you would read a man's purpose. At any rate, he will give him such a bullying as will be construed into an assault on a privy councillor; so there will be a total breach betwixt him and government. Scotland will be too hot for him; France will gain him; and we will all set sail together in the French brig 'L'Espoir,' which is hovering for us off Eyemouth." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>my</b> fifty-two boys narrowly; {{watched their}} faces, their walk, their {{unconscious}} attitudes: {{for all these}} are a language --a language given us purposely that it may betray us in times of emergency, when we have secrets which we want to keep. I knew that that thought would keep saying itself {{over and over again}} in their minds and hearts, All England is marching against us! and ever more strenuously imploring attention with each repetition, ever more sharply realizing itself to their imaginations, until even in their sleep they would find no rest from it, but hear the vague and flitting creatures of the dreams say, All England --ALL ENGLAND!--is marching against you! I knew all this would happen; I knew that ultimately the pressure would become so great that it would compel utterance; therefore, I must be ready with an answer at that time--an answer well chosen and tranquilizing.|$|E
25|$|I had a {{baby sister}} who had begun to learn to creep. I would {{have to learn to}} stand up and walk. And you can imagine the {{intensity}} with which <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> as <b>my</b> baby sister grew from creeping to learning how to stand up.|$|R
500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with TV Guide, Barack Obama named SpongeBob his favorite T.V. character, and admitted that SpongeBob SquarePants was [...] "the show <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> with <b>my</b> daughters".

60|$|Then, {{peering through}} the branches, I could see the {{sentinel}} on the wall near the sally-port, and {{it goes without saying}} that <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> with <b>my</b> heart in my mouth for some gesture which might tell that he understood what was of so much importance to us.|$|R
