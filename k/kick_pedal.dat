50|$|Freese {{started his}} {{drumming}} career in a Top-40 cover band at the Tomorrowland Terrace Stage at Disneyland from 1985 to 1988. Freese {{has since been}} a member of punk rock band The Vandals since 1989, and has played on all the band's albums since then, with the exception of 2000's Look What I Almost Stepped In..., on which current Avenged Sevenfold drummer Brooks Wackerman was deputised due to Freese's commitments with A Perfect Circle. In 2004, The Vandals released a live DVD as part of Kung Fu Records' The Show Must Go Off! series.

50|$|Christian metalcore outfit MyChildren MyBride's sophomore effort {{rises above}} its 2008 {{predecessor}} {{with a more}} adventurous approach to the genre. The basic tenets of the style (toneless screaming and staccato riffs layered over a foundation of tight, dry, double <b>kick</b> drum <b>pedal</b> bursts) are well represented on Lost Boy, but the machine screw production and tone-deaf melodic structures that often accompany those parameters are not. Guitarists Robert Bloomfield and Daniel Alvarado know how to grind out basic jackhammer riffs, but they also {{know how to take}} those riffs and bend them into something real, melodic, and surprisingly progressive. Standout cuts like “Hooligans” and “Redeemer” benefit from the old-school punk gang vocals, and producer Matt Goldman (Underoath, the Chariot) allots vocalist Matthew Hasting's voice (which is surprisingly effective and utterly devoid of Cookie Monster posturing) the room it needs to be heard, resulting in another strong outing for both the band and the increasingly “solid” Solid State Records.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of click-tracks and the {{benefits}} they enable for drum production within the extreme metal genre. The paper {{will focus on the}} drum production of ‘Sink’, the second album by French act Kaizen that was produced, engineered and mixed by the first author of this paper and released through Sony in 2005. This paper will reflect the first author’s eight years experience producing within the metal genre including releases through Sony and Universal. He has worked with the likes of Colin Richardson, Andy Sneap and Jens Bogren. Contributions with various producers, as well as professional musicians from the genre will be included in this paper. For extreme metal acts, accuracy is more important than vibe, feel or groove in the drum performance. The kick drum work and the beats, patterns, subdivisions and syncopation involved demand the very highest standard of precision and accuracy to facilitate the tightest possible production. The use of a click track provides an essential central reference point in forcing a drummer to tighten up his beats and parts and allows the producer to accurately assess this, which enables a precise standard of drum performance. However, to take advantage of these benefits, {{the use of}} a click needs to be a central aspect of pre-production. Here, a producer will often need to be involved, for example in the mapping out of the song’s tempi, and the recording of guide tracks for the drummer to rehearse to. The drummer’s rehearsal time to the clicks and guides are a vital element of pre-production and their importance cannot be overstated. Additionally, due to the particularly fast kick drum patterns involved (double <b>kick</b> drums/double <b>kick</b> <b>pedals</b> are a prerequisite) and the often rhythmically intricate and complex nature of the drum parts, it is normal for the drum tracks heard on a finished production to not entirely be as performed. Often a variety of kick-pattern building, drum editing and quantisation methods will have been employed to produce very tight drum performances. This is one of the particular production challenges of the genre, and ultimately the use of clicks when recording the drums facilitates these methods and the tools involved. This paper looks at these issues {{in the context of the}} drum production of the album ‘Sink’. On commencing recording of the drum tracks it became obvious that the drummer was unable to perform the vast majority of the double bass drum work for the often-complex parts. Measures were therefore taken to minimise any bleed of the kick drums onto the other microphones, so that the entire performance of the footwork involved could be built with samples. In essence, the tightness, accuracy and consistency of the final drum performance could not have been achieved without the use of a click-track during tracking. Clearly, the impact of these measures resulted in a complete lack of authenticity of the perceived kick drum performance of this album. In a genre where authenticity and musical virtuosity are often viewed as paramount, the artists were keen that this ‘fake’ element of the production was not made public knowledge in the fear that it would affect album sales, and the band sacked the drummer involved following the completion of the album. However, under the circumstances, this kick building was the most appropriate solution to getting the album completed on time, within budget and with a strong standard of production...|$|R
50|$|The first Tempo moped ever {{manufactured}} was the bicycle-like 1951 Tempo Handy. It {{looked like}} a bicycle, but where the pedals normally would be it carried a Sachs 49 cc, 1 hp engine with pedals and two gears, shifted with the left side twist grip. It had a three-litre gasoline tank and weighed around 28 kilograms. To start the moped, one put the engine in neutral (the start gear) and used the <b>pedals</b> as a <b>kick</b> starter. To <b>pedal</b> the bike, e.g. {{in the event of}} running out of petrol, the clutch lever was kept depressed by means of a small locking device and the transmission put in first or second gear. The engine was stopped by pressing a small switch that grounded the magneto. This moped sold well and was very cheap, but eventually more luxuries were needed and from 1957 Tempo made the rear suspensioned Comfort and Swing (same construction, the latter utilizing a swingarm front fork hence the name.) mopeds using the same engine before introducing the Corvette in 1960. Upgraded versions of the Sachs hand-shifted pedal engine had 1,6 hp and 3 gears.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large and/or fast engine speed shifts may appear reluctant or even counteractive. Reminiscent of comparable behaviour seen in aircraft jet-propulsion, this phenomenon is {{also referred to as}} ‘jet-start’. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT powertrain is augmented with a powersplitting planetary gear stage and compact steel flywheel. The new transmission—coded ‘Zero Inertia (ZI) powertrain’— seamlessly combines two contradictive features: the driveability in terms of the pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. This is achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds as of the large ratio-coverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a ‘peak shaver’ during engine speed shifts: it delivers power during (semi-) <b>pedal</b> <b>kick</b> down and absorbs kinetic energy of the engine at pedal back-out. This paper presents results from simulations of, and field experiments with a test vehicle incorporating the ZI powertrain. The evaluation concentrates especially on longitudinal driveability and is compared with that of basic CVT and 4 -gear automatic powertrains. Results on the substantially improved fuel economy are summarized {{at the end of the}} paper. The driveability has an accurately controllable character, i. e., the accuracy with which desired drive shaft torque excursions can be realized by the powertrain. The subjective driveability depends highly on how drive pedal deflections are translated into desired drive shaft torque excursions. Evaluation by experts and non-experts in general determines the quality of this translation. A non-rigorous attempt to formalize the translation and use it in a powertrain control strategy is made. Preliminary conclusions on possible acceptance by public are drawn. From this, directions for ongoing research are given...|$|R

5000|$|The game also {{ships with}} a unique drum controller, the AirStrike, that allows the player to {{interact}} with the game without contact, similar to air guitaring, making for a quieter playing experience. The crescent-shaped unit, with four sensors and a bass-drum <b>kick</b> <b>pedal</b> along with additional console control buttons, is used by placing it {{on the floor in front}} of the player. The unit senses the movements in the general areas where the sensors are located, simulating the position of drums, and is able to distinguish movement between the individual drum sticks. The unit also includes support legs to bring the sensors closer to the player to help improve movement detection. Bernard Chiu, CEO of Seven45 Studios, noted that they expected people to be skeptical of the controller, but believes the unit provides a [...] "much more real and authentic" [...] experience compared to other drum kits available.|$|E
