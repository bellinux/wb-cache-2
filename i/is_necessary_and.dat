5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Designing {{reversible}} {{rules for}} block cellular automata, and {{determining whether a}} given rule is reversible, is easy: for a block cellular automaton to be reversible it <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient that the transformation applied to the individual blocks at {{each step of the}} automaton is itself reversible. When a block cellular automaton is reversible, the time-reversed version of its dynamics can also be described as a block cellular automaton with the same block structure, using a time-reversed sequence of partitions of cells into blocks, and with the transition function for each block being the inverse function of the original rule.|$|E

5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, or will exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed with a wire brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> <b>and</b> welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study contact {{representations}} for planar graphs, with vertices {{represented by}} simple polygons and adjacencies {{represented by a}} point-contact or a side-contact between the corresponding polygons. Specifically, we consider proportional contact representations, where given vertex weights are represented by {{the areas of the}} corresponding polygons. Several natural optimization goals for such representations include minimizing the complexity of the polygons, the cartographic error, and the unused area. We describe optimal (with respect to complexity) constructive algorithms for proportional contact representations for general planar graphs and planar 2 -segment graphs, which include maximal outerplanar graphs and partial 2 -trees. Specifically, we show that: (a) 4 -sided polygons <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient for a point-contact proportional representation for any planar graph; (b) triangles <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient for point-contact proportional representation of partial 2 -trees; (c) trapezoids <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient for side-contact proportional representation of partial 2 -trees; (d) convex quadrilaterals <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>and</b> sufficient for hole-free side-contact proportional representation for maximal outer-planar graphs. ...|$|R
