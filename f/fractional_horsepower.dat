2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed.

40|$|The {{single-phase}} {{induction motor}} (SPIM) {{is one of}} the electrical machines more used in the World, and can be found in several <b>fractional</b> and sub-fractional <b>horsepower</b> applications in houses, offices, shoppings, farms, and industries. The introduction of more sophisticated applications has required the use of variable speed drives for SPIM, where the adoption of sensorless techniques is the more reasonable option for speed control due to the low cost of this electrical machine. A proposal for sensorless variable speed SPIM drive based on direct rotor field orientation techniques is presented in this paper. None transformation is used in order to eliminate the asymmetry of the stator windings of the SPIM. The rotor speed is estimated from an flux observer, which is based on two independent linear feedback control systems. The speed and flux estimatives are used in two control loop based on PID regulators, which determine the voltages to be applied to the SPIM windings by a three-legs VSI inverter. Using computer simulations, two situations are considered in order to demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed sensorless speed control for SPIM drives: variations on rotor speed reference and the application of mechanical load...|$|R

50|$|Several {{types of}} recirculators are {{currently}} on the market. Effective and reasonably priced, the smaller units are composed of <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> attachments to a pot sink, which loops water through a pump {{at one end of}} the sink.

This new unit can be installed easily and does not require any holes to be punched in the sink itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} commercially successful {{electric motors}} {{date back to}} {{the latter part of the}} 19th century when Nikola Tesla patented his induction motor in 1888. The development of <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> motors however would not have taken place without the push toward urban, and later rural, electrification, using alternating current. Electrification began in cities around 1915 and with electrification so too came the potential market for washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and a host of other commercial appliances. This was recognised by major manufacturers, like Westinghouse and General Electric, who were already in the business of manufacturing large motors for industrial installations. By 1920, over 500,000 fractional horse-power motors were powering washers and other appliances in America.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} many models of Vico pumps, including; Ultraflo, Ultrajet, Ultima, Ultima 2, Ultima Plus, Ultimax, Wow, and Power Wow series.

Vico pumps can be one, two, or three-speed models to achieve different levels of water flow. The Vico pumps have been sold to many manufacturers of hot tubs, bath tubs, and pedicure spas since the 1980s and sometimes under proprietary brand names such as American Standard, Cal Spas, or others. Vico, Ultrajet, Ultra Jet, Vico Products, are all registered tradenames, and are now manufactured by Pentair Spa & Bath.

50|$|The 1900s {{began the}} decline of the Knickerbocker Ice Company and other ice {{companies}} across the Hudson River Valley. Inventors had devised ways to use electricity to refrigerate food. Although expensive, it was a product that would eventually be found in everyone’s home by the 1920s. Along with <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> motors for electric powered refrigerators, artificial ice was also created so that households no longer needed to call their local “iceman” to deliver their block of ice to their homes. The last block of ice was harvested from Rockland Lake in 1924 and the Knickerbocker Ice Company closed its doors to the public. Two years later during the demolition of the remaining icehouses, one that was still filled with sawdust to insulate the ice caught fire and destroyed almost all of Rockland Lake Village.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of motors {{that can be used}} in a linear {{actuator}} system. These include dc brush, dc brushless, stepper, or in some cases, even induction motors. It all depends on the application requirements and the loads the actuator is designed to move. For example, a linear actuator using an integral horsepower AC induction motor driving a lead screw can be used to operate a large valve in a refinery. In this case, accuracy and high movement resolution aren't needed, but high force and speed are. For electromechanical linear actuators used in laboratory instrumentation robotics, optical and laser equipment, or X-Y tables, fine resolution in the micron range and high accuracy may require the use of a <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> stepper motor linear actuator with a fine pitch lead screw. There are many variations in the electromechanical linear actuator system. It is critical to understand the design requirements and application constraints to know which one would be best.|$|E

50|$|Cooling of the {{majority}} of hit-and-miss engines is by hopper cooling, with water in an open reservoir. There were a small portion of small and <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> engines that were air-cooled with the aid of an incorporated fan. The water-cooled engine has a built in reservoir (larger engines usually don't have a reservoir and require connection to a large external tank for cooling water via pipe connections on the cylinder). The water reservoir includes the area around the cylinder as well as the cylinder head (most cases) and a tank mounted or cast above the cylinder. When the engine runs it heats the water. Cooling is accomplished by the water steaming off and removing heat from the engine. When an engine runs under load for a period of time, it is common for the water in the reservoir to boil. Replacement of lost water is needed from time to time. A danger of the water-cooled design is freezing in cold weather. Many engines were ruined by the forgetful operator neglecting to drain the water when the engine was not in use and the water freezing and breaking the cast iron engine pieces. However, New Holland patented a v-shaped reservoir, so that expanding ice pushed itself up and into a larger space, so that the ice wouldn't break the reservoir. Water jacket repairs are common on many of the engines that exist today.|$|E
