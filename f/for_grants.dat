A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.|$|E
40|$|I {{think that}} the {{phenomenon}} of taking things <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> is an interesting and important one. But it has received relatively little attention from either epistemologists or theorists of rationality. 1 In putting this topic {{on the table in}} such a direct and forceful way, Harman and Sherman’s paper opens up new avenues for exploration. 1. On any plausible view, {{there are some things that}} you are justified in taking <b>for</b> <b>granted,</b> and other things that you are not justified in taking <b>for</b> <b>granted.</b> 2 One way in which someone might be subject to legitimate criticism for taking something <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> is this: what he or she takes <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> isn’t true. (If you point out that something that I’m taking <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> is false, then I should stop taking it <b>for</b> <b>granted.)</b> It also seems that someone is subject to legitimate criticism <b>for</b> taking <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> something that it is unreasonable to think is true. (If you point out that something that I’m taking <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> is unlikely to be true given our evidence, then it seems like I should stop taking it <b>for</b> <b>granted.)</b> Putting these points together, one might think that a relevant norm here involves knowledge: One should only take <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> what one knows. In fact, I’m inclined to think that this is a genuine norm. “Don’t take <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> things that you don’t know to be true ” has the ring of truth, at least to my ear. It’s the 1 A notable exception among the latter is Bratman (1999) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{site for}} the school was {{directly}} north of the U.S. Agricultural Experimental Station (Tanana Valley), an experimental farm created by Charles Christian Georgeson in 1907. The farm was a project by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explore the agricultural potential of Interior Alaska. By 1916, {{one year after the}} founding of the University of Alaska, the experimental farm employed 20 people. As mining declined in the Fairbanks area, some miners turned to homesteading. Under the Homestead Act, many miners applied <b>for</b> <b>grants</b> of land from the federal government and established farms around the city. A 1919 survey by the U.S. Geological Survey identified 94 homesteads within six miles of Fairbanks. Also listed were two tungsten mills and 16 gold mills.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ISMB conference lie in a {{workshop}} for artificial intelligence researchers {{with an interest in}} molecular biology held in November 1991. The workshop was organised by American researcher Lawrence Hunter, then director of the Machine Learning Project at the United States National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NLM) in Bethesda, Maryland. A subsequent workshop on the same topic held in 1992, hosted by the NLM and the National Science Foundation, made it clear that a regular international conference for the field was required. Such a conference would be dedicated to molecular biology as a rapidly emerging application of artificial intelligence. Having successfully applied <b>for</b> <b>grants</b> from AAAI, NIH and the Department of Energy Office of Health and Environmental Research, the first ISMB conference was held in July 1993, at the NLM. The conference was chaired by Hunter, David Searls (research associate professor at University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and Jude Shavlik (assistant professor of computer science at University of Wisconsin–Madison) and attracted over 200 attendees from 13 countries, submitting 69 scientific papers.|$|E

5|$|Whereas Henry VII had not {{involved}} Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII {{had to turn}} to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular <b>for</b> <b>grants</b> of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, {{and as a result}} the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth £120,000 (£36million) a year. The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped to bring about a period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, {{just days}} after the storm moved through, President George W. Bush {{declared}} New Castle County, Delaware as a disaster area following the effects of Henri and later Hurricane Isabel. The declaration designated the affected citizens eligible <b>for</b> <b>grants</b> to pay for temporary housing, house repairs, and serious disaster-related expenses. The declaration also allowed for federal funding for 75% of the repair cost for replacing public facilities. By two months after the storm, 659residents had applied for disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), totaling to just over $1million (2003USD, $1.1million 2006USD). 141small businesses applied for loans, totaling to around $2.5million (2003USD, $2.75million 2006USD). In addition, FEMA received 183applications for public assistance, which would be used for rebuilding public roads and buildings. Over twentyvolunteer organizations met to establish a long-term committee to find resources for disaster recovery needs. One goal sought by the committee was to find a permanent housing solution for every one who was displaced from their houses from the storms. Volunteers also helped remove ruined appliances and furniture to local landfills, totaling to more than 300tons. State and county governments in Delaware purchased 171homes following the damage in the Glenville area, the highest number of houses purchased in the state due to storm damage. The house purchasing was done to mitigate the flood damage by restoring the area as a wetland.|$|E
