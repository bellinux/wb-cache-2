40|$|Coatings are a {{cheap and}} {{efficient}} solution to protect underlying metallic substrates against electrochemical corrosion. High performance coatings do not only provide this {{protection of the}} substrate in the undamaged state but also when they are scratched. This enhanced protection can be achieved {{in many different ways}} (ranging from primers based on expansive phases which seal the crack upon scratch [1] to encapsulated healing agents which polymerize when disrupted by the crack [2]). This work focuses on the behaviour of self healing organic coatings carrying corrosion inhibitors that are stored in one of the coating layers, usually the primer [3]. These inhibitor particles will not restore the coating surface topology, but will prevent oxidation at the exposed substrate. Figure 1 : Left: schematic of a fractured organic coating that contains several encapsulated pigments dispersed through the primer. Right: response in a fractured coating-water uptake (top), capsule disruption (center), and leaching of corrosion inhibitors (bottom) - modelled in this study. In this type of coatings, regardless of the inhibitor type, the corrosion protection mechanism is activated by the ingress of moisture via the crack towards the <b>dispersed</b> <b>corrosion</b> inhibitor particle...|$|E
50|$|Many higher {{current switch}} designs {{rely on the}} {{separation}} arc to assist in <b>dispersing</b> contact <b>corrosion.</b> A switch designed for high current/high voltage use may become unreliable if operated at very low currents and low voltages, because the contact corrosion builds up excessively without an arc to disperse it.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{variations}} in iron ore origin and iron manufacture, wrought iron can be inferior or superior in corrosion resistance compared to other iron alloys. There are many mechanisms behind that corrosion resistance. Chilton and Evans found that nickel enrichment bands reduce corrosion. They also found that in puddled, forged and piled iron, the working-over of the metal spread out copper, nickel and tin impurities, which produces electrochemical conditions that slow down corrosion. The slag inclusions {{have been shown to}} <b>disperse</b> <b>corrosion</b> to an even film, enabling the iron to resist pitting. Another study has shown that slag inclusions are pathways to corrosion. Other studies show that sulfur impurities in the wrought iron decrease corrosion resistance, but phosphorus increase corrosion resistance. Environments with a high concentration of chlorine ions also decreases wrought iron's corrosion resistance.|$|R
