Since {{each of the}} levels in a hi-erarchical system could have various characteristics, different fault-tolerance schemes could he appropriate at different levels. In this paper, we use stochastic Petri nets (SPN's) to investigate various fault-tolerant schemes in this context. The basic SPN is augmented by pa-rameterized subnet primitives to model the fault-tolerant schemes. Both centralized and distributed fault-tolerant schemes are considered in this paper. These two schemes are investigated by considering the in-dividual levels in a hierarchical system independently. In the case of distributed fault-tolerance, we consider two different checkpointing strategies. This first scheme is called the arbitrary checkpointing strat-eg).
