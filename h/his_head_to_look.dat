25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as precisely as he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
60|$|Then Shefford raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> with bated {{breath and}} strange curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dorothy who?" [...] {{asked the}} Scarecrow, tipping <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upward until he nearly {{lost his balance}} and tumbled over backward.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's wrong?" [...] {{asked the}} animal, {{slightly}} turning <b>his</b> wooden <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the party}} with one eye, which was a knot of wood.|$|R
60|$|With this {{he raised}} <b>his</b> lean <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{up at the}} Tin Owl and the Canary and the Monkey, and he lashed his tail upon the ground and growled as {{fiercely}} as any jaguar could.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do you suppose}}," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the ground, {{and then}} {{throwing}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the ceiling,--"what do you suppose you are living at the rate of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “One of the Vice-Presidents,” Mr Verloc breathed out heavily; and the First Secretary of the Embassy raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|E
6000|$|The Mule turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> reproachfully {{at his old}} friend, {{the young}} girl. [...] "Who can fight against magic?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, lifting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, 'I guess I'll {{answer for}} my own faults, if {{everybody}} else'll answer for theirs.' ...|$|E
60|$|The umpire shook <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Mid-on tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{as if he}} had not spoken.|$|R
5000|$|Doodle (voiced by Rob Morrison) - Sunny's talking pet dog. A tuft of fur on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> is styled <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like {{hair with}} highlights.|$|R
6000|$|He said, very hoarse and abrupt: [...] "It can't end like this. [...] . Sit down;" [...] {{and while}} she crossed the room again to the low-backed chair before the dressing-table, {{he opened the door}} and put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> and listen. The house was quiet. He came back pacified, and asked-- ...|$|R
60|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her. She was {{so close}} to him that their hats collided. He was profuse in his apologies.|$|E
6000|$|Tip {{was bound}} so tightly by the cord {{that he could}} not turn <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at his companions; so he said to the Saw-Horse: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you're a wise man,' growled Hugh, raising <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{him with}} a frown, 'you'll hold your tongue. I tell you I'm going to sleep.' ...|$|E
60|$|Thus he pleaded, {{praying for}} mercy, {{even as a}} captive prays to his conqueror for life, and never once daring <b>to</b> lift <b>his</b> bowed <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her face; while she sat {{motionless}} and silent, not a word, not a sigh, escaping her; and {{she was like a}} woman carved in stone, with knees of stone on which <b>his</b> <b>head</b> rested.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear, dear Mortimer,' {{returned}} his friend, lazily lifting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> a little <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him, 'how often have I {{pointed out to}} you that its moral influence is the important thing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Newman {{was struck}} with {{the gravity of}} her tone; he threw back <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> round the room again. [...] "Had you never noticed that number up there?" [...] he {{presently}} asked.|$|R
60|$|All the caress in {{his eyes}} for the books {{vanished}} as he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me, and ere he spoke I knew that I, too, was hated.|$|E
60|$|CONFUCIUS [raising <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him] You {{have decided}} not to believe it now that you realize its inconveniences. That is the English method. It may not work in this case.|$|E
60|$|Bilbil {{was deeply}} vexed {{and would not}} even turn <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at his master. To escape from Rinkitink he wandered among {{the ruins of the}} palace, where he came upon Prince Inga.|$|E
6000|$|... “Waldo shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> and {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> westward along the Mall. He’s rather good at acting in an amateur sort of fashion. Lena followed his gaze, {{and then turned}} to him with a puzzled look of inquiry.|$|R
60|$|At this moment, Francois {{was raising}} <b>his</b> father's <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> closely at him. A faint spasm had indeed {{passed over the}} deathly face; the lips quivered, the jaw dropped. Francois shuddered as he looked, and moved away hastily from the bed. At the same instant Gabriel started from the wall; his {{expression}} altered, his pale cheeks flushed suddenly, as he snatched up the wicker-cased bottle, and poured all the little brandy that was left in it down his grandfather's throat.|$|R
60|$|While Erling {{was thus}} engaged, his friend Glumm, having {{finished}} the recital of his adventures for the twentieth time, {{and at the}} same time eaten a good supper, was advised by his companions to have the wound in <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>looked</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
60|$|Still {{there was}} no reply, and Reddy began {{to be a little}} bit suspicious. He turned over and raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look.</b> Instead of old Granny Fox, there was Unc' Billy Possum {{grinning}} at him.|$|E
6000|$|Bartley did {{not even}} turn <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> round at him. [...] "Keep your money!" [...] he said, as he plunged forward through the snow. [...] "I wouldn't touch a cent of it to save your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He was terrible--relating this to me--this {{tortured}} {{skeleton of}} a man drawn up together with his face over his knees, upon a miserable bed in that wretched hovel, and lifting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me with malignant triumph.|$|E
50|$|A redeco of the Cybertron Deluxe Red Alert {{available}} only at BotCon 2009. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> is molded <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like a younger {{version of his}} Generation 1 incarnation. The figure is molded in teal with orange stripes and Autobot Elite Guard emblems.|$|R
50|$|The depicts Absalon as a {{military}} commander, mounted on a rearing horse, wearing a mail and helmet, holding an axe in his right hand. The statue faces Christiansborg Palace on Slotsholmen, where Absalon's bishop's castle once stood, but he turns <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the right, <b>looking</b> {{in the direction of}} Copenhagen City Hall.|$|R
60|$|She {{washed his}} long beard {{until it was}} as white as snow, and she shaved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> make him <b>look</b> bald and venerable. Then she brought him a flowing black robe with a girdle at the middle; {{and when he was}} dressed, he looked fully as wise as either Socrates or Sophocles.|$|R
60|$|Through {{no matter}} what indignation and rage that possessed him, his lord's voice {{penetrated}} his consciousness, so that, cooling almost instantly, Michael's ears flattened, his bristling hair lay down, and his lips covered his fangs as he turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> acknowledgment.|$|E
60|$|For Columbine, {{the most}} {{interesting}} moment of this incident was when the mustang raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at his legs, {{in order to see}} what had been done to them. There was something almost human in that look. It expressed intelligence and fear and fury.|$|E
60|$|And for {{the first}} time he lifted <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me with wonder and incredulity. He lifted his head so sharply that there could be no mistake. I had touched a spring. I saw the whole extent of my opportunity, and could hardly believe in it.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{execution}} chamber, Michael raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> several times <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at the window}} into the witness chamber as his death warrant was being read. The last words he mouthed to two of his sons and a daughter-in-law who witnessed {{the execution}} were simply [...] "I love you,".|$|R
60|$|Now {{just take}} the case of Bowser the Hound. Bowser was so {{interested}} in the chase of Old Man Coyote that he paid no attention whatever to anything but the warm scent of Old Man Coyote which the latter was taking pains to leave. Bowser ran with his nose in Old Man Coyote's tracks and never <b>looked</b> either <b>to</b> left or right. He would lift <b>his</b> <b>head</b> only <b>to</b> <b>look</b> straight ahead in the hope of seeing Old Man Coyote. Then down would go his nose again to follow that scent.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Snap kept careful watch of the bear. The animal {{took his time}} drinking, raising <b>his</b> <b>head</b> several times <b>to</b> <b>look</b> around him. But he did not turn his gaze upward, and consequently did not discover the young hunter, who stood with weapon aimed, ready to fire at a moment's warning.|$|R
