30|$|The {{increment}} of the <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} uniform traffic. The reasons are as follows. Under uniform traffic, the transmission durations of links in a pairing are diverse in MPMH [1]. The diversities bring about the waste of time slots in a pairing. The differences among the transmission durations of links in a pairing under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> are worse, which result in further degradations in the throughput performance. However, the transmission durations of links in a pairing are the same under both traffic patterns in MPMH-SRSC. Thus, it outperforms the MPMH under uniform traffic and has greater performance increment under <b>random</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|R

Taking the Second Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge as an example, the characteristics of traffic load are obtained by traffic investigation and the data from existing research results. In the paper the method and process for vehicle load spectrum simulation which includes data acquisition of <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> load, statistical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation is proposed. The simulation program of <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> flow is verified using the measured data. The proposed method can provide a reference for <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> load simulation. ...|$|R

Even though an exact and universal traffic model is hard to define, there are several heavily used models such as permutation <b>traffic,</b> uniform <b>random</b> <b>traffic,</b> ON-OFF bursty traffic and so on. In this paper, we present a way of generating various basic traffic types using the inverse transformation technique for testing and analysis of a packet switch.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section 6.2, MPMH-MRMC can better utilize MPMH than the MPMH-SRSC, {{which results in}} the decrease of delay. Compared with MPMH-SRSC, the average transmission delay of MPMH-MRMC decreases by about 74.20 % under uniform traffic and 70.91 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> with the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20. With the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20, MPMH-MRMC outperforms MPMH 2 by about 29.21 % under uniform traffic and 49.04 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> on average, respectively. The reason is identical with the one in network throughput. When the traffic load ratio is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which leads to lower average delay in TDMA.|$|R
40|$|A new {{asynchronous}} interconnection {{network is}} introduced for globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) chip multiprocessors. The network {{eliminates the need}} for global clock distribution, and can interface multiple synchronous timing domains operating at unrelated clock rates. In particular, two new highly-concurrent asynchronous components are introduced which provide simple routing and arbitration/merge functions. Post-layout simulations in identical commercial 90 nm technology indicate that comparable recent synchronous router nodes have 5. 6 - 10. 7 x more energy per packet and 2. 8 - 6. 4 x greater area than the new asynchronous nodes. Under <b>random</b> <b>traffic,</b> the network provides significantly lower latency and competitive throughput over the entire operating range of the 800 MHz network and through mid-range traffic rates for the 1. 36 GHz network, but with degradation at higher traffic rates. Preliminary evaluations are also presented for a mixedtiming (GALS) network in a shared-memory parallel architecture, running both <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> and parallel benchmark kernels, as well as directions for further improvement. ...|$|R
40|$|A general {{expression}} {{for the average}} distance for meshes of any dimension and radix, including unequal radices in different dimensions, valid for any traffic pattern under zero-load condition is formulated rigorously to allow its calculation without network-level simulations.

Hot spot traffic patterns are also considered and the formula is empirically validated by cycle true simulations for uniform random, local, and hot spot traffic. Moreover, a methodology to attain closed-form solutions for other traffic patterns is detailed. Furthermore, the model is applied to guide design decisions. Specifically, we show that the model can predict the optimal 3 -D topology for uniform and local traffic patterns. It can also predict the optimal placement of hot spots in the network. The fidelity of the approach in suggesting the correct design choices even for loaded and congested networks is surprising. For those cases we studied empirically it i...|$|R

30|$|With the {{introduction}} of MRMC, MPMH-MRMC can better utilize MPMH than the MPMH-SRSC, and the throughput of MPMH-MRMC increases linearly even under heavy traffic load. With the traffic load ratio from 10 to 20, MPMH-MRMC surpasses MPMH-SRSC by about 82.34 % under uniform traffic and 108.29 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic,</b> respectively. Compared with MPMH 2, MPMH-MRMC increases the network throughput by about 14.09 % under uniform traffic and 25.8 % under <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> on average with the traffic load ratio from 12 to 20. The reason is {{the same with the}} one in SRSC situation. When the traffic load ratio is over 3, the number of discarded packets in TDMA exceeds MPMH and MPMH-SRSC, which results in smaller network throughput in TDMA. Since the delay threshold is larger than the frame length, the packets that cannot be scheduled in current frame will be transmitted in the next frame. With the increase of the traffic load ratio, the number of packets successful transmitted in the system becomes stable and the network throughput curves become flat.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{need to support}} high performance and distributed cloud-based computing applications, data centers are employing commodity switches to build multi-rooted trees. An effective distributed, adaptive flow scheduling algorithm is needed to realize the full potential of the multiple parallel paths provided by such networks. The overall aim of this work is to design a load balancer that can maximize the aggregate network utilization. In this paper, the Distributed Flow-by-Flow Fair Routing (DFFR) algorithm is proposed for flow balancing in data center networks. It is a scalable, distributed, and adaptive algorithm designed for maximizing network resources. Our analysis shows that the algorithm has proven theoretical performance bounds, which gives a low variance for the aggregate bandwidth utilization. A simulation {{study was conducted to}} compare the performance of the DFFR algorithm with other load balancing algorithms. Simulation results reveal that the DFFR algorithm outperforms a static routing assignment protocol. It is also compared to Distributed Dynamic Flow Scheduling (DDFS), which is chosen because it is a distributed algorithm like DFFR. DFFR is shown to perform better for <b>random</b> <b>traffic</b> patterns than DDFS, but worse for patterns where hosts always send to the same receiver.
