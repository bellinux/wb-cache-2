5|$|Some iPad 2 users {{reported}} performance issues {{when running}} iOS 8. Apple improved {{performance on the}} iPad 2 and the iPhone 4S on the iOS 8.1.1 update. However, those 2 devices still don't run as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> later models.|$|E
5|$|Its Linpack {{performance}} {{stands at}} 80 TeraFLOPs, {{which is about}} half as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> cut-off line for the Top 500 Supercomputers list. According to Rennie, all content was stored in Watson's RAM for the Jeopardy game because data stored on hard drives would be too slow to be competitive with human Jeopardy champions.|$|E

5|$|The USB2.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} in April 2000 and was ratified by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) {{at the end of}} 2001. Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Lucent Technologies (now Nokia), NEC, and Philips jointly led the initiative to develop a higher data transfer rate, with the resulting specification achieving 480Mbit/s, 40 times as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original USB 1.1 specification.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda Softworks, the {{developer}} of Morrowind, offers the ability change the game via plugins (often {{referred to as}} modifications, or mods for short) using The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which comes with the PC version of the game. The Construction Set, {{and a variety of}} third-party mod-making tools, allows the modder to create and edit different objects, places, characters, dialogues, races, birthsigns, abilities, and skills. Characters can be made as strong or as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> user wants, and allows the player to experience the game {{in a way that would}} not normally be possible within the game's mechanics.|$|E
5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics {{who were still}} a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
50|$|As {{each level}} is completed, {{the speed of}} the game {{quickens}} along with more randomly appearing Kryllons. The colour of <b>the</b> levels change <b>as</b> <b>the</b> game goes on, and <b>the</b> music grows <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pace of the game accelerates.|$|R

5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with the deployment as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s the South Florida {{metropolitan}} area grew {{four times as}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rest of the nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to south Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, {{for the first time}} in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
50|$|The green {{artifact}} is {{the essence}} of Xel'lotath. Her monsters tend to sap more sanity from the player than the monsters from other alignments. Therefore, if Pious picks Xel'lotath the game tends to get creepier <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> player loses more sanity than they gain.|$|R

Then the {{automobile}} began to move backwards, slowly at first and then <b>faster</b> and <b>faster,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> youngest Rover put on the power.|$|R
50|$|The server {{architecture}} {{required to}} operate a Powered By Nine solution is a R.A.I.N. (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Nodes) organization. This data storage approach allows the system to expand should demand for space exceed space available. Adding load balancers to the system also makes backup and restore processes <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> vault expands.|$|R
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|Resident Office {{moved from}} Marudi to Miri in 1912. Miri grew as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rate of oil {{production}} by the Shell company. In 1920, roads {{were built in}} Miri. Bicycles and motorcycles were also bought into the town. By 1921, there were 40 shop houses in Miri, with one English school and one Chinese school. Motor cars were later introduced to the town. In 1924, Pujut Road was built to link Miri with Lutong. By 1925, rotary drilling was introduced. Oil production continued to increase until it reached a peak of 15,211 barrels per day in 1929. Water supply were improved, jungles were cleared, and more roads were built. Miri became the administrative centre of the entire Baram region in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The B-70, {{designed}} for even higher speeds, altitudes and range than the B-58, suffered {{even more in}} relative terms. At high altitudes, the B-70 was as much as four times as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> B-52, but at low altitudes it was limited to only Mach0.95, only modestly faster than the B-52 at the same altitudes. It also had a smaller bombload and shorter range. Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover, especially on the long journey from the USA to USSR. The value was limited; the USAF's doctrine stressed that {{the primary reason for}} maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack. In this case, the higher speed would be used for only {{a short period of time}} between the staging areas and the Soviet coastline.|$|E

50|$|Construction crews {{assembled}} the arches {{from both sides}} of the river. A rivalry formed between the two crews, likely making <b>the</b> assembly go <b>faster,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> trusses were connected on January 10, 1905, after twenty-eight working days. The total construction time was four months, using a total of forty-five men. The bridge was formally opened on March 20, 1905.|$|R
5|$|The first British {{furnaces}} {{outside the}} Weald {{appeared during the}} 1550s, and many {{were built in the}} remainder of that century and the following ones. The output of the industry probably peaked about 1620, and was followed by a slow decline until the early 18th century. This was apparently because it was more economic to import iron from Sweden and elsewhere than to make it in some more remote British locations. Charcoal that was economically available to the industry was probably being consumed as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> wood to make it grew. The Backbarrow blast furnace built in Cumbria in 1711 has been described as the first efficient example.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays almost twice as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E
5|$|Thunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, {{and a high}} {{definition}} FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models. The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbit/s, which is up to twice as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> USB 3.0 specification, 20 {{times faster than the}} USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800. Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.|$|E
50|$|Negative-splitting is {{a racing}} {{strategy}} that involves completing {{the second half}} of a race faster than the first half. The racer runs slow in the beginning, and gradually runs <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> race progresses. This is typically seen as a conservative racing strategy, but in distance events, many world records have been run with a slight negative split.|$|R
50|$|Quicksand is {{a natural}} case of a shear thinning, non-Newtonian fluid. This is the {{opposite}} of a dilatant. As its strain rate increases, its resistance to shear will decrease causing the system to act more like a liquid than a solid. Hence, as one thrashes about in quicksand one sinks <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mixture's resistance decreases.|$|R
50|$|Raccoon Hunt has {{the player}} {{shooting}} {{at up to}} four raccoons as they climb up the screen. Instead of a timer, the counter in the corner shows how many raccoons will appear. The raccoons climb up <b>the</b> screen <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> player's score also increases through four levels, and once the counter reaches 00, the game will end.|$|R
5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E
5|$|Monaco is a stealth action {{game played}} in a {{top-down}} perspective. The game features both single-player and multiplayer modes and allows up to four players to each control one of eight characters while they partake in heists and robberies in locations including nightclubs, mansions and yachts. Each character has different traits and advantages. The eight characters consist of: the Locksmith, the Cleaner, the Lookout, the Pickpocket, the Mole, the Gentleman, the Redhead, and the Hacker. The Locksmith can open doors twice as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> other characters; the Cleaner can put guards to sleep; the Lookout is able to see enemies {{who are not in}} the player's direct line of sight; the Pickpocket owns a monkey which runs around collecting coins; the Mole can dig holes through walls and takes less time to open vents; the Gentleman has the ability to temporarily change his appearance, making the player less detectable to enemies; the Redhead can charm enemies into not attacking them and make characters follow them; and the Hacker has the ability to upload computer viruses to security systems, resulting in them shutting off temporarily. The first four of the eight characters are available immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} the {{pre-production}} I-250s had been placed with Factory No. 381 in Moscow for two aircraft to be delivered in September, three more in October and the remainder {{by the end of}} the year. This proved to be very optimistic and it was revised to a single aircraft {{by the end of the}} year. The airframe was completed on this revised schedule, but its engine was not ready in time. The factory management was much criticized for these problems which were not entirely under their control as changes to the design and drawings were constant. The criticism was not limited to just the I-250 program as the other jet programs could not be developed as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> leadership wanted as well and Alexei Shakhurin, the head of MAP (Ministry of Aviation Industry) and its NKAP predecessor since 1940, was arrested in March 1946 as a sign of their displeasure. The new Minister severely reprimanded the designer of the VRDK and three factory directors on 13 April 1946 and set up a commission to determine why Factory No. 381 and TsIAM had failed to meet their deadlines. He refused to accept its findings as it apportioned blame fairly evenly among those responsible for the production program and he had the director of Factory No. 381 and his quality control manager arrested for industrial sabotage.|$|E
