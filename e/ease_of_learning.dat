5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning,</b> low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E

2500|$|The Solesmes monks also determined, {{based on}} their research, {{performance}} practice for Gregorian chant. Because of the ambiguity of medieval musical notation, the question of rhythm in Gregorian chant is contested by scholars. Some neumes, such as the pressus, do indicate the lengthening of notes. Common modern practice, following the Solesmes interpretation, is to perform Gregorian chant with no beat or regular metric accent, in which time is free, allowing the text to determine the accent and the melodic contour to determine phrasing. By the 13th century, with {{the widespread use of}} square notation, it is believed that most chant was sung with each note getting approximately an equal value, although Jerome of Moravia cites exceptions in which certain notes, such as the final notes of a chant, are lengthened. [...] The Solesmes school, represented by Dom Pothier and Dom Mocquereau, supports a rhythm of equal values per note, allowing for lengthening and shortening of note values for musical purposes. A second school of thought, including Wagner, Jammers, and Lipphardt, supports different rhythmic realizations of chant by imposing musical meter on the chant in various ways. [...] Musicologist Gustave Reese said that the second group, called mensuralists, [...] "have an impressive amount of historical evidence on their side" [...] (Music in the Middle Ages, p.146), but the equal-note Solesmes interpretation has permeated the musical world, apparently due to its <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> and resonance with modern musical taste.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{promising}} directions in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) [4] is induction of decision rules. During the last two decades many methods e. g.

The advantages of the rule-based approach to KDD include natural representation and <b>ease</b> <b>of</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>learned</b> rules with background knowledge. In the paper we propose a new method <b>of</b> <b>learning</b> decision rules, which uses an evolutionary algorithm (EA). EAs are stochastic search techniques, which have been inspired by the process of biological evolution. They have been applied to many search and optimization problems including learning decision rules [2, 6, 8]. There are two key issues in our approach. The first one is the use of two non-standard recombination operators, which we call changing condition operator and insertion operator. The second issue is the application of entropy-based discretization [5, 3], which allows us to effectively deal with c...|$|R

This paper investigates an analogous problem: {{how to use}} information from one neural network to help a second network learn a related task. Rather than translate such information into symbolic form (in which {{it may not be}} readily expressible), we investigate the direct transfer of information encoded as weights. Here, we focus on how transfer can be used to address the important problem of improving neural network learning speed. First we present an exploratory study of the somewhat surprising effects of pre-setting network weights on subsequent learning. Guided by hypotheses from this study, we sped up back-propagation learning for two speech recognition tasks. By transferring weights from smaller networks trained on subtasks, we achieved speedups of up to an order of magnitude compared with training starting with random weights, [...] ...|$|R

Subjects in 4 experiments first learned novel categories. At test, they categorized a new set of novel stimuli that were either consistent or inconsistent with background knowledge given about the categories.

Three other experiments using a part-detection task showed that subjects were more likely to notice missing parts that were critical than noncritical according to background knowledge. The mechanisms by which background knowledge affects categorization and part detection are discussed.

40|$|In {{controlled}} contexts, {{young children}} {{find it more}} difficult to learn novel words for actions than words for objects: Imai et al. (2008) found that English-speaking three-year-olds mistakenly choose a novel object as a referent for a novel verb about 42 % of the time despite hearing the verb in a transitive sentence. The current two studies investigated whether English three- and five-year-old children would find resultative actions easier (since they are prototypically causative) than the non-resultative, durative event types used in Imai et al. ’s studies. The reverse was true. Furthermore, if the novel verbs were taught on completion of the action, this did not improve performance, which contrasts with previous findings (e. g. Tomasello & Kruger, 1992). Our resultative actions were punctual, change-of-location events which may be less visually salient than the non-resulative, durative actions.
