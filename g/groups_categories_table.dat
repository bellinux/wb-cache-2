40|$|Historically, {{women have}} always played an {{important}} role in fishing in France, either helping on board (there were 1. 34 women per boat in 1894 (Geistorfer, 1996)) or fishing on their own account, for shellfish for example. It was productivity gains related to mechanisation which gradually reduced their role at sea. As a result, their role is now concentrated in the tertiary sector, mainly in management and marketing activities. At the same time, it has become common for them to undertake external salaried work as well as managing a fishing enterprise. Women have remained much more involved in shellfish culture, where the amount of work onshore is much greater. It is a less risky activity because production is more predictable. Most of the time, as in sea-fishing, it is in the case of family businesses that the contribution of women is essential. The last decade has seen the development of GAEC (Groupement Agricole d'Exploitation en Commun) as a legal company form, which allows, amongst other things, women to be involved officially as co-managers. The contribution of women in these sectors is what may be called “invisible ” work in the sense that is provided on a voluntary basis and is often not even recognised since wives undertake it in a family framework and are not salaried. The position of women can be <b>grouped</b> into four <b>categories</b> (<b>table</b> 1 below), depending on their status and the relative importance of their contribution in terms of work and finance (particularly the supply of capital) ...|$|R

Two years after the implementation of PPS, the mix of patients across the <b>categories</b> of payment <b>groups</b> has shifted, {{as determined by the}} patients' initial minimum data set assessments. Although the overall share of patients classified into rehabilitation payment <b>group</b> <b>categories</b> based on their initial assessments remained about the same, more patients were classified into the high and medium rehabilitation payment <b>group</b> <b>categories,</b> and fewer were initially classified into the most intensive (highest paying) and least intensive (lowest paying) rehabilitation payment <b>group</b> <b>categories.</b> Two years after PPS was implemented the majority of patients in rehabilitation payment groups received less therapy than was provided in 1999.
