25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned. When an army unit goes {{against the grain of}} the pattern, he reasoned, it becomes conspicuous; to hide, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with the pattern. He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E

He also claimed that the committee was putting all necessary effort to finalize the bill in the current parliamentary session amidst other important bills such as the budget bill, the taxation bill and the national planning bill. Moreover, since the education bill is not under the category of bills that will go directly to the Union of Parliament, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the Lower House and the Upper House before it could be passed.|$|E

25|$|Throughout this process, {{every time}} the soul {{associates}} itself with a particular form, it collects through this medium impressions of the gross world. When the impressions through association with a particular form have been exhausted, the soul dissociates from that form. Yet the collected impressions must be further experienced and for this the soul associates with the next most developed form. So when the human form is reached, although consciousness is fully developed, it has a store of impressions that {{still need to be}} experienced. While the soul is no longer in search of a better medium, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through numerous human forms, until these impressions gathered through evolution are weakened and finally exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Bureaucratic {{structures}} {{have many}} levels of management ranging from senior executives to regional managers, {{all the way}} to department store managers. Since there are many levels, decision-making authority has to pass through more layers than flatter organizations. A bureaucratic organization has rigid and tight procedures, policies and constraints. This kind of structure is reluctant to adapt or change what they have been doing since the company started. Organizational charts exist for every department, and everyone understands who is in charge and what their responsibilities are for every situation. Decisions are made through an organized process, and a strict command and control structure is present at all times.In bureaucratic structures, the authority is at the top and information is then flowed from top to bottom. This causes for more rules and standards for the company which operational process is watched with close supervision. Some advantages for bureaucratic structures for top-level managers are they have a tremendous control over organizational structure decisions. This works best for managers who have a command and control style of managing. Strategic decision-making is also faster because there are fewer people <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through to approve. Some disadvantages in bureaucratic structures are it can discourage creativity and innovation in the organization. This can make it hard for a company to adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace.|$|E
500|$|The station's {{upper and}} lower levels are about [...] and [...] deep respectively, making the station among the system's deepest. This depth is because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> under the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and other {{existing}} infrastructure, {{in addition to the}} IND tunnels having to go under the East River a short distance to the east. At the original (1989) mezzanine at Lexington Avenue, there are a total of eight escalators, four staircases and two elevators from the fare mezzanine to platform level. There is an in-building entrance with two escalators and a staircase, and another, stand-alone entrance with a staircase, from the street to the Lexington Avenue fare mezzanine. Two additional staircases between the platform levels are at the eastern end of platforms, past the elevator. A third staircase between the platform levels has been constructed.|$|E

Studio Litho {{is owned by}} Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. The band members produced the album themselves. On the choice of not working with a producer, frontman Chris Cornell said that [...] "a fifth guy is too many cooks and convolutes everything. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down too many mental roads, which dilutes it." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron added that while working with Michael Beinhorn in Superunknown had good results, it was [...] "a little more of a struggle than it needed to be", and self-production would make the process go faster. Adam Kasper, who previously had worked with Soundgarden as an assistant engineer on Superunknown, worked with the band as a production collaborator and mixed the album.|$|E
2500|$|... "This Little Light" [...] {{is based}} around [...] "This Little Light of Mine", a gospel song written by American {{composer}} Harry Loes {{in the early}} 20th century. It first appeared on LZ7's EP Gasoline, which was released in the UK in August 2008. It was then remixed in 2010 for inclusion as track one on the band's second studio album, Light, and {{was used as a}} theme song for both The Message Trust's charitable initiative Shine Your Light and the UK government's Shine Week 2010. LZ7 launched the 2010 remix at a gig at the Manchester Apollo, before promoting the track at summer festivals and an eight-date schools tour around Manchester. The band encouraged people to make a note of the release date and to download the single, with Lindz West, LZ7's frontman, remarking: [...] "What we don't want is anyone phoning up stations and saying 'Why aren't you playing this song?', because that just creates a bad name for us in the first place. What we do want is people buying it and getting it to the position where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the radio airplay lists and the stations have to play it." ...|$|E
