It seemed difficult to realize both conditions working solely on the temperature of the cooling water in a way so as to produce hot spots on the cylinder wall capable of provoking autoignition. Moreover, in the majority of practical cases, autoignition is produced by the spark plug, one of the least cooled parts in the engine. The first procedure therefore did not resemble that which most generally occurs <b>in</b> <b>actual</b> <b>engine</b> operation.

40|$|The {{crosshead}} bearing in large two-stroke diesel engines operates under severe lubrication conditions because hydrodynamic action {{is limited by}} low-amplitude, low-velocity oscillation under high specific load. The recent trend toward more compact engines with increased output raises the bearing specific load, thereby significantly increasing the lubrication severity. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} find a means to prevent tribological failure such as seizure. In this study, a technique for monitoring abnormal vibration was evaluated using a dynamically loaded bearing seizure test rig that is capable of simulating load patterns and relative oscillations of the {{crosshead bearing}} <b>in</b> <b>actual</b> <b>engines.</b> Vibration spikes occur around crank angles of ± 90 deg where the oscillating speed is zero during one cycle. When lubrication is impaired, an abnormal vibration spike caused by severe metal-to-metal contact is generated at a crank angle of approximately + 90 deg, where the oil film thickness is a minimum. The frequency of this spike generation increases with the degree of impairment. If running-in is carried out immediately after detecting abnormal vibration, the bearing surface is conformed, thereby avoiding severe metal-to-metal contact damage.

40|$|Enhanced NO 2 {{production}} (without raising total NOx) in {{a diesel}} engine combustion chamber {{can improve the}} performance of several catalytic aftertreatment systems. Thus this can facilitate a further reduction in key regulated emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. The oxidation of NO to NO 2 is an important intermediate step involved in all current aftertreatment systems that are designed for NOx and PM catalytic removal. The performance of both NOx control systems and catalysed particulate filters depend highly on the NO 2 concentration. In this work we have examined the influence of using hydrogen (H 2) and simulated reformate (H 2, CO and EGR gases) {{as a supplement to}} diesel fuel on NO 2 production. <b>In</b> <b>actual</b> <b>engine</b> applications a reformer will be integrated within the engine EGR system.

The influence of the simulated reformate combustion on the NO 2 production is dependent on the engine load and in-cylinder conditions. It was observed that both reformate composition and concentration significantly influence the NO 2 /NOx ratio of the exhaust gas.

The present work {{is based on the}} need for understanding the in-cylinder flow and its subsequent effects on combustion in a valved-two-stroke spark ignition engine with fuel injection using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimental techniques. In this context, the CFD code KIVA-II has been modified to model the two-stroke engine gas exchange and combustion processes. A 3 -D Cartesian grid generation program for complex engine geometry has been added to the KIVA code which has been modified to include intake and exhaust flow processes with valves. New and improved sub models for wall jet interaction, mixing controlled combustion and one dimensional wave action have also been incorporated. The modified version of the program has been used to simulate a fuel injected two-stroke spark ignition engine and parametric studies have been undertaken.

40|$|From {{considerations}} {{of safety and}} reliability in performance of gas-turbine aircraft, {{it is clear that}} engine starting and acceleration are of utmost importance. For this reason extensive efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the factors involved in the starting and acceleration of engines. In chapter III it is shown that certain basic combustion requirements must be met before ignition can occur; consequently, the design and operation of an engine must be tailored to provide these basic requirements in the combustion zone of the engine, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} ignition source. It is pointed out in chapter III that ignition by electrical discharges is aided by high pressure, high temperature, low gas velocity and turbulence, gaseous fuel-air mixture, proper mixture strength, and-an optimum spark. duration. The simultaneous achievement of all these requirements <b>in</b> an <b>actual</b> turbojet-engine combustor is obviously impossible, yet any attempt to satisfy as many requirements as possible will result in lower ignition energies, lower-weight ignition systems, and greater reliability. These factors together with size and cost considerations determine the acceptability of the final ignition system. It is further shown in chapter III that the problem of wall quenching affects engine starting. For example, the dimensions of the volume to be burned must be larger than the quenching distance at the lowest pressure and the most adverse fuel-air ratio encountered. This fact affects the design of cross-fire tubes between adjacent combustion chambers in a tubular-combustor turbojet engine. Only two chambers in these engines contain spark plugs; therefore, the flame must propagate through small connecting tubes between the chambers. The quenching studies indicate that if the cross-fire tubes are too narrow the flame will not propagate from one chamber to another. In order to better understand the role of the basic factors <b>in</b> <b>actual</b> <b>engine</b> operation, many investigations have been conducted in single combustors from gas-turbine engines and in full-scale engines in altitude tanks and in flight. The purpose of the present chapter is to discuss the results of such studies and, where possible, to interpret these results qualitatively in terms of the basic requirements reported in chapter III. The discussion parallels the three phases of turbojet engine starting: (1) Ignition of the fuel-air mixture (2) Propagation of flame throughout the combustion zone (3) Acceleration of the engine to operating speed...|$|R

Mean particle sizes were found to be between. 77 microns and. 80 microns at the exit of the augmentor tube. Recommendations to improve future experiments are discussed. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (LIF) {{has been}} developed for visualization of fuel distribution fields in an operating spark-ignition (SI) engine. Since the standard research fuel iso-octane, does not yield a useful LIF signal a fluorescent additive was used. None of the commonly used seeds were found adequate. A seed not commonly used in this context, 3 -pentanone, C 2 H 5 COC 2 H 5, was chosen due to favorable vaporization characteristics and fluorescent properties. Results from preparatory investigations <b>in</b> the <b>actual</b> <b>engine</b> environment are presented and related laboratory data are discussed. The two-dimensional LIF technique was applied to a spark-ignition engine and the fuel distribution at the ignition time was recorded. The resulting images were processed and converted into fuel/air equivalence ratio using an in situ calibration technique. The processed fuel distribution maps presented a noise level of 10 % and a systematic error not exceeding 0. 03 fuel/air equivalence units. An increased combustion variability was observed when changing from a homogeneous to an inhomogeneous fuel/air mixture. Correlations of image data to the combustion development indicated that the increased cyclic variability could be largely explained by variations in the mean fuel concentration around the spark gap. The initial flame development therefore seems {{to be controlled by}} the average amount of fuel near the spark gap, whereas the actual distribution of the fuel within this volume is of less importance...|$|R
