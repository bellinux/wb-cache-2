5|$|Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante {{piece is}} his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None {{of these works}} has rivalled the {{popularity}} of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to deal with}} Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari in addition to investigating the mystical themes and philosophical works of him. It can be claim that Sheikh Shabestari made the best and finest Gnostic and theological implications into poetic form. He was impressed by three philosophical-theological schools including the philosophy of Ibn Arabi, the theological school of Ash'ari and the romance of Sanaee. The {{first part of the}} study focuses on the Gnostic concepts and terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Shabestari. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following sections, we discuss the Gnostic concepts and the theory <b>of</b> pantheism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh. Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari, {{is one of the most}} important issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of Gnostic mainstreaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speech of philosophers and famous mystics of Islam. To understand Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari, it is necessary to philosophically investigate and analyze schools and Gnostic and philosophical movements before him which have influenced him. Therefore, in this study we have tried to talk about schools influencing him in addition to describing Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari. Apart from this, we investigate how the Gnosticism of Sheikh Shabestari revolves around a main idea that is pantheism...|$|R
5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E

25|$|In {{complying}} with the Senate's wishes, Marius tried to show the senate, who had always been suspicious of his motives, {{that he was one}} of them instead of the outsider that Quintus Metellus said he was in 108 BC. Marius' overall concern, for his part, was always how to maintain the Senate's esteem: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scholar A.N.

25|$|Of all {{his more}} general works the boldest and most {{far-reaching}} was Grimm's Geschichte der deutschen Sprache (History of the German Language), in which linguistic elements are emphasized. The {{subject of the}} work is the history hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German language (the oldest natural history of the Teutonic tribes determined by means of language). To this end he laboriously collected scattered words and allusions found in classical literature, and endeavoured to determine the relationship between the German language and those of the Getae, Thracians, Scythians, and many other nations whose languages were at the time known only through doubtfully identified, often extremely corrupted remains preserved by Greek and Latin authors. Grimm's results have been greatly modified by the wider range of comparison and improved methods of investigation that now characterize linguistics, and many questions he raised will probably remain obscure (due to the enduring lack of attestation in the form of surviving records of these languages), but his book's influence has been profound.|$|E
