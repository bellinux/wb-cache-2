40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{genetics}} of <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> produced differing conclusions on {{the timing of}} their colonization of the Hawaiian Islands {{and whether or not}} North American (Aeorestes cinereus) and Hawaiian (A. semotus) <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> are distinct species. One study, using mtDNA COI and nuclear Rag 2 and CMA 1, concluded that <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> colonized the Hawaiian Islands no more than 10, 000 years ago based on indications of population expansion at that time using Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots. The other study, using 3 mtDNA and 1 Y-chromosome locus, concluded that the Hawaiian Islands were colonized about 1 million years ago. To address the marked inconsistencies between those studies, we examined DNA sequences from 4 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear loci in lasiurine bats to investigate the timing of colonization of the Hawaiian Islands by <b>hoary</b> <b>bats,</b> test the hypothesis that Hawaiian and North American <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> belong to different species, and further investigate the generic level taxonomy within the tribe. Phylogenetic analysis and dating of the nodes of mtDNA haplotypes and of nuclear CMA 1 alleles show that A. semotus invaded the Hawaiian Islands approximately 1. 35 Ma and that multiple arrivals of A. cinereus occurred much more recently. Extended Bayesian Skyline plots show population expansion at about 20, 000 years ago in the Hawaiian Islands, which we conclude does not represent the timing of colonization of the Hawaiian Islands given the high degree of genetic differentiation among A. cinereus and A. semotus (4. 2 % divergence at mtDNA Cytb) and the high degree of genetic diversity within A. semotus. Rather, population expansion 20, 000 years ago could have resulted from colonization of additional islands, expansion after a bottleneck, or other factors. New genetic data also support the recognition of A. semotus and A. cinereus as distinct species, a finding consistent with previous morphological and behavioral studies. The phylogenetic analysis of CMA 1 alleles shows the presence of 2 clades that are primarily associated with A. semotus mtDNA haplotypes, and are unique to the Hawaiian Islands. There is evidence for low levels of hybridization between A. semotus and A. cinereus on the Hawaiian Islands, but it is not extensive (< 15 % of individuals are of hybrid origin), and clearly each species is able to maintain its own genetic distinctiveness. Both mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences show deep divergence between the 3 groups (genera) of lasiurine bats that correspond to the previously recognized morphological differences between them. We show that the Tribe Lasiurini contains the genera Aeorestes (<b>hoary</b> <b>bats),</b> Lasiurus (red bats), and Dasypterus (yellow bats) ...|$|R

Oral ingestion during grooming of contaminated fur {{appears to be the}} principal route by which these bats might be exposed to citric acid. We made assessments of oral toxicity, citric acid consumption, retention of material on fur, and grooming using big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) as a surrogate species. We evaluated both ground application and aerial application of 16 % solutions of citric acid during frog control operations. Absorbent bat effigies exposed to ground and aerial operational spray applications retained means of 1. 54 and 0. 02 g, respectively, of dry citric acid, although retention by the effigies was much higher than bat carcasses drenched in citric acid solutions. A high dose delivered orally (2, 811 mg/kg) was toxic to the big brown bats and emesis occurred in 1 bat dosed as low as the 759 mg/kg level. No effect was observed with the lower doses examined (B 542 mg/kg). Bats sprayed with 5 ml of 16 % (w/w) citric acid solution showed no evidence of intoxication. In field situations, it is unlikely that bats would be sprayed directly or ingest much citric acid retained by fur.

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} bats {{are killed by}} wind {{turbines}} worldwide and minimizing fatalities is critically important to bat conservation and acceptance of wind energy development. We implemented a 2 -year study testing the effectiveness of an ultrasonic acoustic deterrent for reducing bat fatalities at a wind energy facility in Pennsylvania. We randomly selected control and treatment turbines that were searched daily in summer and fall 2009 and 2010. Estimates of fatality, corrected for field biases, were compared between treatment and control turbines. In 2009, we estimated 21 – 51 % fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine than per control turbine. In 2010, we determined an approximate 9 % inherent difference between treatment and control turbines and when factored into our analysis, variation increased and between 2 % more and 64 % fewer bats were killed per treatment turbine relative to control turbines. We estimated twice as many <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> were killed per control turbine than treatment turbine, and nearly twice as many silver-haired bats in 2009. In 2010, although we estimated nearly twice as many <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> and nearly 4 times as many silver-haired bats killed per control turbine than at treatment turbines during the treatment period, these only represented an approximate 20 % increase in fatality relative to the pre-treatment period for these species when accounting for inherent differences between turbine sets.

We recorded deep, prolonged torpor bouts, which meet the definition for hibernation, by pregnant females. Prolonged torpor occurred during spring storms.

Our observations imply a fitness advantage of torpor in addition to energy conservation because reduced foetal growth rate could delay parturition until conditions are more favourable for lactation and neonatal survival...|$|R
40|$|Bats exploit forest {{resources}} based on species-specific adaptations, resulting in differences in activity across forested landscapes. Forest management practices alter forests, impacting species differently and presumably affecting bat activity. Application of forest management that promotes bat conservation requires further understanding of bat response to silvicultural practices. We surveyed timber harvest treatments on two Indiana State Forests to compare bat activity across forest management treatments, in forests adjacent to harvests, and at locations across the harvest-forest gradient from May to July 2013 and 2014. We used Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter SM 2 BAT+ detectors to survey bats {{in relation to}} four treatment types: clear cut, patch cut, shelterwood cut, and intact forest. Detectors were deployed at two points within each treatment and three points on the forested periphery of treatments and recorded for three consecutive nights. We examined bat activity using N-mixture models that estimate abundance and probability of detection for an open population and used Akaike’s Information Criterion to select the best models. Eastern red <b>bats</b> and <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> were more active in harvest treatments than control treatments. Big brown, eastern red, and tri-colored bats were most active at harvest edges. Northern long-eared and Indiana/little brown bats were most active at harvest edges and in adjacent forest and <b>hoary</b> <b>bats</b> were most active at harvest centers. All species were active in forests adjacent to harvests. Variables affecting detection probability differed among species and included air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, dew point, cloud cover, wind speed, and forest clutter. Differences in bat activity across these managed forests suggest bat assemblages benefit from management that employs an array of silvicultural methods, provides edge habitat, and maintains adjacent forest stands.
