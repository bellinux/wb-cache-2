40|$|Free Electron Laser (FEL) in Osaka University can be {{continuously}} {{varied in}} the range of 5. 0 - 20. 0 μm when using 30 MeV electron beam. The FEL has a double pulse structure. The structure consists of a train of macropulses of pulse width 15 μs, and each macropulse contains a train of 330 micropulses of the pulse width 5 ps. The tunability and short pulse afford new medical applications such as investigation of protein dynamics and the ablation of soft tissues. Precise control of micropulse train is <b>essential</b> for <b>medical</b> applications <b>using</b> FEL because macropulse with long pulse duration leads to undesirable thermal effects. FEL pulse control system using an Acousto Optic Modulators (AOM) was developed in order to investigate non-thermal effect between the FEL and living tissues. This system provides efficiency (~ 70 %) and a fast switching speed (> 200 ns). Thus, this is expected as a novel tool...|$|R
