40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the implementation of facial recognition using filtering techniques that will increase the accuracy of the process as well as distinguish faces more decisively. The process has proved to be invariant to image scale, rotation and illumination. This paper was motivated by the EOH-SIFT approach. The process described in this paper is aimed at improving upon the effectiveness of EOH-SIFT by feeding it a filtered image. After much exhaustive research into various filters, this paper shows that, with two filters which when used in a specific order, significantly boost the potency of the EOH-SIFT approach to identify faces. This approach has given very promising results when tested on the ORL database. Although it is a standard dataset, it does not have much variation as seen in the real world. Hence, our approach has been tested on other datasets and it has produced extremely encouraging results. The recognition of faces proceeds by first obtaining the region of interest and applying the filters on that area followed by the identification of important features in the faces and then matching them using an efficient nearest-neighbor algorithm. This leads to a robust and <b>definitive</b> face <b>recognition</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{incidence}} of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections in primary varicella {{appears to be}} increasing. GAS infections complicating varicella range from cellulitis, abscess, and septic arthritis to life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis and pyomyositis in association with GAS toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Four patients admitted in 1 year to the Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, whose care included evaluation and treatment by the Orthopaedic service, are presented to illustrate this spectrum. Three had a delay in diagnosis, including discharge from previous emergency department visits. One patient with polyarticular septic arthritis was treated with diagnostic aspiration and intravenous antibiotics. The remainder required urgent surgical debridement for treatment of deep infection. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis or pyomyositis had life-threatening complications of TSS, including hypotension, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. These patients required aggressive fluid resuscitation and prolonged intensive care unit support. Diagnostic imaging studies were obtained in one patient with necrotizing pyomyositis but may have served only to delay <b>definitive</b> treatment. <b>Recognition</b> {{of the potential for}} secondary GAS infections and a high index of suspicion for the presence of necrotizin...|$|R

40|$|Since 1984, 12. 294 {{different}} medical specialists {{have been}} certified in Chile by the Autonomous Corporation for Certification of Medical Specialties (whose Spanish acronym is CONACEM). Infernal Medicine certification started in 1985, approving 1364 candidates thus far. Certification {{can be obtained}} in three ways. Sixty one percent of applicants were approved by a reputable university specialization program. Thirty five percent of applicants fulfilled the requirements of a five years practical training program and less than 5 % were approved in a training program from another country which was validated in Chile. There are 13 university training programs for medical specialties, lasting three years each. These programs can receive a total of 110 students per year. Half of these programs are not carried out in Santiago. Applicants, who have not completed a certified university training program, must go through a five days practical examination. Since 2002 a written test was added, whose approval is a requisite {{to gain access to}} the practical examination. Sixty one percent of applicants have approved the theoretical test. Certifications last 10 years initially and seven years, there after. When certifications expire, a recertification mechanism is required, whose requirements are informed. According to the current legislation, certifications must be done by recognized accrediting agencies. CONACEM has been accepted by the authority and its <b>definitive</b> legal <b>recognition</b> should be a reality soon...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} conditions where, after initially negative plain x rays following trauma, there subsequently {{proves to}} be fracture, and to explore {{ways in which the}} management might be improved. DESIGN: A 16 month prospective study. Patient details were collected from accident and emergency (A&E) review clinics and returns, A&E ward admissions, correspondence from other services, and discussions at a weekly clinicoradiological conference. The inclusion criteria comprised A&E trauma patients with normal initial plain x rays and proven fractures on subsequent imaging for the same patient event. SETTING: A large A&E department seeing 65, 000 new attendances per annum with full back up services. RESULTS: 55 cases were identified: 41 fractures were identified on subsequent plain x ray, six on bone scan, six on CAT scan, and two on MRI scan. The commonest regions involved were the wrist, pelvis/hip, ankle/foot, and leg. Follow up had not been arranged at the initial attendance in 17 instances and between two and 135 days were required for <b>definitive</b> fracture <b>recognition.</b> All but nine patients required alteration in treatment because of fracture detection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical suspicion of fracture at initial A&E attendance should prompt organised follow up {{even in the face of}} normal plain x rays. Consideration should be given to alternative imaging techniques which may have a higher resolution than plain x rays. Close corroboration between A&E and radiology departments has benefits in patient care in this group of patients and may lead to a reduction in functional disability and litigation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) [...] Boston UniversityThe basic {{response}} of the visual mechanism is the discrimination of changes in luminous intensity in the visual world. This discrimination consists of (1) detecting {{the presence of a}} signal, and (2) assigning this signal to a category which has <b>definitive</b> class properties (<b>recognition).</b> Detection: In the attempt to establish the characteristics of the stimulus for the detection response, amount of area and amount of edge of the object, have been advanced as determining factors. One group of investigators propose that as area is increased, the detection threshold will decrease systematically end that this response is independent of the shape of the object. These investigators have favored a view that as stimulus size increases a larger number of retinal receptors are fired and accordingly the detection threshold is reduced. 	On the other hand, other investigators hold that the detection response is dependent upon the amount of edge or perimeter of the object. These investigators, however, are divided into two theoretical groups. One group proposes that the contrast disparity at tile edge active-tea the postretinal neural mechanism and that differential stimulation of a row of receptors will account for brightness discrimination. The other group has advanced the theory that brightness discrimination results from the retinal scanning associated with eye-movements [TRUNCATED]...|$|R

50|$|Francesco Sartorelli {{came from}} a well-to-do family - {{his father was a}} {{solicitor}} at Asolo - and after secondary school he enrolled at the Faculty of Medicine in Padua, though he abandoned his studies around 1875 to attend the Milan Conservatory. Serious health problems forced him to give up his career as a flautist and on his return to Cornuda he began to teach himself painting. In 1889 he moved to Venice and made friends with Alessandro Milesi; that same year he exhibited {{for the first time at}} the Turin Promotrice. He took part in the Esposizioni Internazionali d’Arte di Venezia from the first edition in 1895 onwards. In 1900 his landscape painting received <b>definitive</b> <b>recognition</b> by being awarded the Principe Umberto Prize at the Brera exhibition, followed by the gold medal at the 8th Munich International Art Exhibition the following year. In 1903 the art dealer Ferruccio Stefani, who was active in South America, organised a solo exhibition for him, which travelled to Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Valparaiso. His works were also shown at the International Centenary Exhibition in Buenos Aires in 1910 and that same year the Venice Biennale devoted a whole room to forty-six works by Sartorelli. In 1924 he moved to Milan, where the Galleria Pesaro mounted a solo exhibition for him the following year. In 1940, a few months after his death, the 23rd Venice Biennale devoted a major retrospective to him organized by his son Carlo, who was also a painter.|$|E

40|$|Recently, an {{analysis}} of the enzymological patterning of L-tyrosine biosynthesis was shown to distinguish five taxonomic groupings among species currently named Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, or Alcaligenes (Byng et al., J. Bacteriol. 144 : 247 [...] 257, 1980). These groupings paralleled with striking consistency those previously defined by ribosomal ribonucleic acid-deoxyribonucleic acid homology relationships. The comparative allostery of 3 -deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7 -phosphate (DAHP) synthetase has previously been shown to be a useful indicator of taxonomic relationship at about the level of genus. The comparative allostery of DAHP synthetase was evaluated in relationship to data available from the same pseudomonad species previously studied. Species of Xanthomonas and some named species of Pseudomonas, e. g., P. maltophilia, were unmistakably recognized as belonging to group V, having a DAHP synthetase sensitive to sequential feedback inhibition by chorismate. This control pattern is thus far unique to group V pseudomonads among microorganisms. Group V organisms were also unique in their possession of DAHP synthetase enzymes that were unstimulated by divalent cations. Group IV pseudomonads (P. diminuta) were readily distinguished by the retro-tryptophan pattern of control for DAHP synthetase. Activity for DAHP synthetase was not always recovered in group IV species, e. g., P. vesicularis. The remaining three groups exhibited overlapping patterns of DAHP synthetase sensitivity to both L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. Individual species cannot be reliably keyed to group I. II, or III without other data. However, each group overall exhibited a different trend of relative sensitivity to L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine. Thus, although enzymological patterning of L-tyrosine biosynthesis alone can be used to separate the five pseudomonad groups, the independent assay of DAHP synthetase control pattern can be used to confirm assignments. The latter approach is, in fact, the easiest and most <b>definitive</b> method for <b>recognition</b> of group V (and often of group IV) species...|$|R
5000|$|Zapata {{finally did}} gain the support {{necessary}} by his peers {{and was considered}} a [...] "singularly qualified candidate". This decision to make Zapata the true leader of the revolution did not occur all at once, nor did it ever reach a true <b>definitive</b> level of <b>recognition.</b> In order to succeed, Zapata needed a strong financial backing for the battles to come. This {{came in the form}} of 10,000 pesos delivered by Rodolfo from the Tacubayans. Due to this amazing sum of money Zapata's group of rebels became one of the strongest in the state financially.After some time Zapata became the leader of his [...] "strategic zone." [...] This gave him tremendous power and control over the actions of many more individual rebel groups and thus increased his margin of success greatly. [...] "Among revolutionaries in other districts of the state, however, Zapata's authority was more tenuous." [...] After a meeting with Zapata and Ambrosio Figueroa in Jolalpan, it was decided that Zapata would have joint power with Figueroa with regard to operations in Morelos. This was a turning point in the level of authority and influence that Zapata had gained and proved useful in the direct overthrow of Morelos.Zapata immediately began to use his newly found power and began to overthrow city after city with gaining momentum. Madero, alarmed, asked Zapata to disarm and demobilize. Zapata responded that, if the people could not win their rights now, when they were armed, they would have no chance once they were unarmed and helpless. Madero sent several generals in an attempt to deal with Zapata, but these efforts had little success. It seemed as though Zapata would shortly be able to overthrow Madero. Before he could overthrow Madero, [...] General Victoriano Huerta beat him to it in February 1913, ordering Madero arrested and executed. This officially and formally ended the civil war.Although this may have caused individuals to believe that the revolution was over, it was not. The battle continued for years to come over the fact that Mexican individuals did not have agrarian rights that were fair, nor did they have the protection necessary to fight against those who pushed such exploitation upon them.If there was anyone that Zapata hated more than Díaz and Madero, it was Victoriano Huerta, the bitter, violent alcoholic who had been responsible for many atrocities in southern Mexico while trying to end the rebellion. Zapata was not alone: in the north, Pancho Villa, who had supported Madero, immediately took to the field against Huerta. [...] Zapata revised the Plan of Ayala and named himself the leader of his revolution. He was joined by two newcomers to the Revolution, Venustiano Carranza and Alvaro Obregón, who raised large armies in Coahuila and Sonora respectively. Together they made short work of Huerta, who resigned and fled in June 1914 after repeated military losses to the “Big Four." ...|$|R

There was significant correlation of clinical parameters with severity scores (p=< 0. 05). APACHE II and MODS were shown to have significant association (r= 0. 65). To conclude, early recognition of clinical parameters like hypotension, oliguria, prerenal azotemia, metabolic acidosis, ALI and / or ARDS are of much importance; Levels of Procalcitonin, Lactate with standard severity scores will help to prognosticate the disease process and will guide in management strategies...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{determine}} whether neural invasion in advanced gastric cancer is of clinicopathological significance. METHODS [...] The study population comprised 121 cases of primary advanced gastric carcinoma. Two paraffin wax embedded blocks {{taken from the}} central tissue slice in each primary tumour were used. For <b>definitive</b> <b>recognition</b> of neural invasion, immunostaining for S- 100 protein was applied to one slide; the other slide was stained with haematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS [...] Neural invasion was recognised in 34 of 121 (28 %) primary gastric carcinomas. There were significant differences in tumour size, depth of tumour invasion, stage, and curability between patients with and without neural invasion. The five year survival rates of patients with and without neural invasion were 10 and 50 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis, however, demonstrated that neural invasion was not an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS [...] Neural invasion could be an additional useful factor for providing information about the malignant potential of gastric carcinoma. This may be analogous to vessel permeation which {{is thought to be}} important, but is not an independent prognostic factor...|$|E
