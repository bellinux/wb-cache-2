40|$|Drying {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to total energy consumption in manufacturing processes. As fluidised bed technology is a common method of particle drying, improvements in efficiencies are widely desirable. Low frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> has been found in the literature to reduce gas pumping requirements in fluidised beds and increase drying rates. However, research to date has used pulsation frequency range that tends to be within a 1 - 15 Hz limit. Consequently, a high pulsation frequency range of 200 - 300 Hz was applied to a selection of fluidised bed indicators to determine if a high frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> altered fluidisation when compared to a continuous flow regime. This is the first study to investigate the effects of high frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> of fluidised bed dynamics and drying. The effect of high frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> was studied at three scales: single particle level, 2 -dimensional lab scale fluidised bed, and a 3 -dimensional fluidised bed. Experiments were designed to directly compare pulsed and continuous flow. The high frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> was achieved using a type of fluidic oscillator. This used no additional energy input to pulse the gas flow. A range of pulsation frequencies and amplitudes were achieved through altering the length of a feedback tube on the oscillator and increasing or decreasing the gas flow rate. It was found that the oscillator operated through both the conventional double outlet mode, but also through a single outlet when one was closed off. This allowed for a comparison between both regimes, with the single outlet mode creating a preferable gas flow distribution. The high frequency pulsed flow regime was found to produce a higher pressure drop over the 3 D bed distributor plate than the continuous flow regime. On a single particle level, large Group D single particles were studied through a drying curve whilst suspended in a static crucible in the gas flow or fluidised within a tube. These experiments showed that, in some particles, the pulsed flow regime inhibited or enhanced drying. It also demonstrated that a fluidised single particle has a greater variation in movement under a pulsed flow regime. In the 2 D fluidised bed, bubbles were observed to be larger and more populous in a Group A powder under the pulsed flow regime compared to the continuous flow regime. Bed expansion was found to be greater under the pulsed flow regime in the 3 D bed. Many of the observed differences between pulsed and continuous flow were small, making it difficult to form firm scientific conclusions. However, these results suggest that the addition of a high frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> to a fluidised bed dryer may change the fluidisation regime and characteristics. Whilst low frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> creates a physical interaction between the gas flow pulse cycles and particle displacement or bubble formation, high frequency <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> is shown by this study to potentially influence fluidised bed indicators through gas vibration or boundary layer alteration. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} imposed {{pulsations}} on {{the output of}} five 3 ”-industrial vortex flow meters with a triangular bluff body and various type of sensors was experimentally investigated in a gas flow {{over a wide range}} of frequencies from 20 Hz to 400 Hz and amplitudes ranging from 1 % to 30 % rms of the average flow. During the experimental tests, the impact of pulsation frequencies and amplitudes on the accuracy of the measured flow output could be obtained separately within nearly the full range of operation of the vortex flow meter. Large systematic errors in the measured vortex flow meter output were observed when the vortex frequencies were near the pulsation frequency. Even larger errors were measured at half the pulsation frequency. Lock-in occurred already at very low pulsation amplitudes in the order of 3 % rms of the average flow. The ISO/TR 3313 regards this flow as steady since the <b>flow</b> <b>pulsations</b> are less than 5 % rms. The output error due to <b>flow</b> <b>pulsations</b> observed is mainly negative. It has been observed that, in general, vortex flow meters are insensitive for <b>flow</b> <b>pulsations</b> when the pulsation frequency is a factor 3 less than the vortex shedding frequency. Even in presence of pulsations with amplitudes of 30 % an accuracy of 1 % can be obtained in this region.

Since there are distinct requirements in each field, several types of micro pumps have been designed to meet those requirements. Fluid flow from these micro-pumps is delivered in a series of small discrete volumes, which make up a pulsating flow. In order to reduce the pulsating flow, the multiple micro-pumps should be actuated in parallel. Thus, in the present work, two piezo-electrical diaphragm type micro-pumps are operated in parallel with a microcontroller based sequential switching to maximize the flow rate and minimize the <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation.</b> Micro-pumps are switched in different phase shifts to study the flow pattern.

It is shown {{that the nature of}} airflow around a single particle is different in stationary and pulsing flow. Particle’s aerodynamic characteristics heavily depend on frequency of vortexes separation from the particle’s surface and the configuration of the vortex street itself. Three universal specific zones of dimensionless external flow pulsation’s frequency influence on vortex separation frequency have been discovered. In the first zone the influence is either small or is absent. In the second zone the dimensionless frequency of vortexes detachment decreases with the increasing of <b>flow’s</b> <b>pulsation</b> frequency until they both become equal. In the third zone, the frequencies of <b>flow’s</b> <b>pulsations</b> and vortexes detachment are equal (the lock mode).

40|$|Abstract—Time-intensity {{measurements}} of ultrasonic-contrast microbubbles {{based on the}} dilution theory {{have been used to}} assist blood flow estimation. The compartment model has been employed to describe the dilution process. Under the linear and time-invariant assumption, the time-intensity curve measured at the output of a compartment (i. e., blood mixing chamber) is the convolution of the input time-intensity curve with the compart-ment’s transfer function. Thus, transfer function analysis is possible using deconvolution when the temporal variations in both the input and the output intensities are available. Note that the linear and time-invariant assumption requires a constant flow rate because, with <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation,</b> the flow rate changes with time and the mixing process becomes time varying. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} was to study the effects of <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> on time-intensity measurements. In addition, a deconvolution technique based on a recursive least squares approach is used for transfer function analysis. Both simulations and experiments were performed; the results from which indicate that the pulsation generally does not affect the validity of time-intensity-based flow estimation. The proposed deconvolution technique is also effective for both constant and pulsatile flows; thus, permitting transfer function analysis in various flow conditions. One potential application of this transfer function analysis is to remove the effects of a noninstantaneous input function.

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{are two of}} {{the main}} drawbacks with fluid power  systems. The increasing requirements concerning working environment as well as machines' impact on surroundings put components and systems to harder tests. The surrounding machines, e. g. combustion engines, have made considerable progress regarding the radiated noise. This allows the fluid power system's noise to become more prominent. Noise from fluid power systems has been a research topic for several decades and much improvement has been achieved. However, considerable potential for improvement still remains. In addition to the legislation governing working environment, the machines tend to be used as more multi-quadrant machines, which require more flexible noise reduction features. One of the main benefits with fluid power is the high power density. To increase this value even more, the system's working pressure increases, which correlates with increased noise level. The main source of noise is considered to be the pump and motor unit in the fluid power system. The noise can be divided into two parts: fluid-borne noise and structure-borne noise. The fluid borne noise derives from <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> which is subsequently spread through pipeline systems {{to other parts of the}} fluid power systems. The <b>flow</b> <b>pulsation</b> is created due to the finite stiffness of oil and the limited number of pumping elements. The structure-borne noise generates directly from pulsating forces in the machine. The pulsating forces are mainly created by the pressure differences between high and low pressure ports.

In the moving frame it is represented by a steady average <b>flow</b> and time-periodic <b>pulsation</b> <b>flow.</b> It is shown, that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability mechanism is not valid for pulsation generation in the edge state flow...|$|R
