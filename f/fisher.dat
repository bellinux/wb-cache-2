5|$|In Winter of the <b>Fisher,</b> Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a <b>fisher</b> and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the <b>fisher</b> from a trap and nurses it back to health. The <b>fisher</b> tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the <b>fisher</b> to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E

25|$|Fishing {{techniques}} include hand gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling and trapping. Recreational, {{commercial and}} artisanal <b>fishers</b> use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational <b>fishers</b> fish for pleasure or sport, while commercial <b>fishers</b> fish for profit. Artisanal <b>fishers</b> use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in third-world countries, {{and as a}} cultural heritage in other countries. Usually, recreational <b>fishers</b> use angling methods and commercial <b>fishers</b> use netting methods.|$|R
40|$|Proper postharvest {{processing}} methods will yield export-quality bêche-de-mer and, potentially, {{higher prices for}} <b>fishers.</b> We conducted interview-based surveys of sea cucumber <b>fishers</b> in multiple villages within eight locations in Fiji. From 0 – 71 % of <b>fishers</b> practised postharvest processing of their catch, depending on location. Information sources about {{processing methods}} were largely absent. Poor handling methods in the boat were sometimes used, and some <b>fishers</b> used incorrect techniques for cutting and cooking sea cucumbers. Investment in time by <b>fishers</b> to process their catch also varied among locations. A new training manual, training video and village workshops have built capacity among <b>fishers</b> in postharvest processing methods. The new information tools give hope for higher sale prices and reduced wastage. Further support is needed in Fiji to train <b>fishers</b> in villages not involved in this project. Despite improved knowledge, many <b>fishers</b> experienced problems in accessing coarse salt for processing and getting fair prices by middlemen. To improve income to <b>fishers</b> in the industry, actions are needed to help <b>fishers</b> to access coarse salt and {{to develop and implement}} industry standards on the prices <b>fishers</b> should expect to receive for different grades of bêche-de-mer...|$|R
5|$|The <b>fisher</b> (Pekania pennanti) {{is a small}} {{carnivorous}} mammal {{native to}} North America.

The <b>fisher</b> is closely related to but larger than the American marten (Martes americana). The <b>fisher</b> is a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether or}} not the number of <b>fishers</b> is optimal under an Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQ) program. We consider two cases on the structure of the quota market: (1) cases in which all <b>fishers</b> are price takers, and (2) cases in which large-scale <b>fishers</b> have market power. When all <b>fishers</b> are price takers in the quota market, the social optimum is likely to be achieved given the total allowable catch (TAC) level. On the other hand, when low-cost <b>fishers</b> have market power in the quota market, the inefficiency may be serious: excess entry of low-cost <b>fishers</b> and insufficient exit of high-cost <b>fishers</b> may take place. Moreover, we demonstrate that vessel controls and stock targeting may work for an ITQ program. ...|$|R

However, <b>Fisher</b> argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank votes are not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot.

5|$|Between 1900 and 1940, <b>fishers</b> were {{threatened}} with near-extinction {{in the southern}} part of their range due to overtrapping and alterations to their habitat. In New England, <b>fishers,</b> along with most other furbearers, were nearly exterminated due to unregulated trapping. <b>Fishers</b> became extirpated in many northern U.S. states after 1930, but were still abundant enough in Canada to maintain a harvest of over 3,000 <b>fishers</b> per year (see figure). Limited protection was afforded in the early 20th century, but it was not until 1934 that total protection was finally given to the few remaining <b>fishers.</b> Closed seasons, habitat recovery, and reintroductions have restored <b>fishers</b> to much of their original range.|$|R

40|$|In {{its effort}} to resolve the {{conflict}} between commercial and recreational <b>fishers</b> the New South Wales (NSW) government (NSW Fisheries) banned commercial fishing in the estuarine waters.

To investigate how community consultation {{played a role in the}} decision-making process especially as perceived by the commercial <b>fishers</b> and to determine actual social impacts of the ban on commercial <b>fishers,</b> in-depth interviews were conducted with the commercial <b>fishers.</b> This research reveals that despite the NSW Fisheries' consultations with commercial <b>fishers</b> prior to the closure, the latter were confused about various vital aspects of the decision. It further reveals that, the commercial <b>fishers</b> faced a number of significant changes as a result of this decision.

40|$|The {{value of}} beche-de-mer {{exported}} from small-scale sea cucumber fisheries {{throughout the world}} depends partly on the postharvest processing methods used by <b>fishers</b> or commercial processors. Development programmes to help <b>fishers</b> in value adding need to understand current processing practices. We used questionnaire data to evaluate postharvest processing of sea cucumbers, and compared methods between <b>fishers</b> and commercial processors in Fiji, Kiribati and Tonga. Most <b>fishers</b> in Kiribati, and a minority of Fijian and Tongan <b>fishers,</b> process their sea cucumbers. Few <b>fishers</b> had received training or information on processing methods. The placement of the cut to gut sea cucumbers varied widely, especially among <b>fishers.</b> I-Kiribati <b>fishers</b> salted sea cucumbers for the least number of days. Coconut husks were mostly used in Kiribati as the fuel to heat water for cooking sea cucumbers, whereas wood was mostly used in Fiji and Tonga. <b>Fishers</b> practiced a second cooking less frequently than commercial processors. Smoke curing was not practiced in Tonga, owing to traditional practices, but was done frequently in Kiribati and Fiji. Fijian <b>fishers</b> invested {{the least amount of}} time in processing. We found few women <b>fishers</b> in Kiribati but they were often involved in processing. In both Fiji and Kiribati, other family members were frequently engaged in processing. We show that poor processing methods were often used by <b>fishers.</b> Our study reveals that postharvest processing cannot be generalised among countries, and a holistic view of the role of women and children in fisheries should examine more than just their involvement in fishing...|$|R

40|$|Background: Data {{derived from}} studies of fishers' local {{ecological}} knowledge (LEK) can be invaluable to the proposal of new studies and more appropriate management strategies. This study analyzed the <b>fisher's</b> LEK about trophic relationships of fishes in the southeastern Brazilian coast, comparing fishers' LEK with scientific knowledge to provide new hypotheses. Methods: The initial contacts with <b>fishers</b> were made through informal visits in their residences, to explain the research goals, meet <b>fishers</b> and their families, check the number of resident <b>fishers</b> and ask for fishers' consent {{to participate in the}} research. After this initial contact, <b>fishers</b> were selected {{to be included in the}} interviews through the technique of snowball sampling. The <b>fishers</b> indicated by others who attended the criteria to be included in the research were interviewed by using a semi-structured standard questionnaire. Results: There were interviewed 26 artisanal <b>fishers</b> from three communities of the Ilhabela: Jabaquara, Fome and Serraria. The interviewed <b>fishers</b> showed a detailed knowledge about the trophic interactions of the studied coastal fishes, as <b>fishers</b> mentioned 17 food items for these fishes and six fish and three mammals as fish predators. The most mentioned food items were small fish, shrimps and crabs, while the most mentioned predators were large reef fishes. <b>Fishers</b> also mentioned some predators, such as sea otters, that have not been reported by the biological literature and are poorly known. Conclusions: The LEK of the studied <b>fishers</b> showed a high degree of concordance with the scientific literature regarding fish diet.
