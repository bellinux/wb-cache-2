5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>casing</b> of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

In collaboration with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, the Directorate helped develop a new laser-based ultrasonic scanner to inspect composite parts also for use on the F-22. The Directorate also developed an advanced thermoplastic composite material {{for use in the}} landing gear doors on the F-22. In 2008, the Air Force announced that the Directorate had developed a method of using fabric made of fiber optic material in a friend or foe identification system.|$|E

The chimneys were concrete, lined with heat- and acid-resistant bricks and a stainless steel 'cap'. About 1.4 million cubic feet per minute (670 m3/s) of gas containing 19% oxygen was exhausted from each chimney at a velocity of ~135 ft/s.|$|E
50|$|The ANTLE Trent 500 based {{research}} engine {{has a new}} 5 stage HP compressor {{supplied by}} Rolls-Royce Deutschland. The new low emission lean burn combustor and unshrouded HP turbine units are Rolls-Royce UK supplied. Downstream is a variable-geometry IP turbine from Avio and ITP's new high duty LP turbine. Volvo Aero has provided a new turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>casing.</b> Hispano Suiza’s new accessory gearbox, Goodrich’s new distributed control system, and Techspace Aero’s new oil system are also fitted.|$|E
50|$|Exhausts emit a {{large amount}} of heat into the engine bay, which can have a {{negative}} effect on engine performance by raising the underhood temperatures. As a result, high temperature insulation is used, more commonly known as heat barriers, for exhaust heat management. Thermal barrier ceramic-coatings are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including <b>exhaust</b> manifolds, turbocharger <b>casings,</b> <b>exhaust</b> headers, downpipes and tailpipes. When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore lessening the intake temperature. As well as providing thermal protection, these coatings are also used to prevent physical degradation of the composite due to frictional processes. This is possible because when applied, the ceramic material bonds with the composite (instead of merely sticking on the surface with paint), therefore forming a tough coating that doesn't chip or flake easily.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} designing the mechanical {{components of a}} low-speed axial compressor with cantilevered stators to investigate endwall flow phenomena in the rear stages of industrial gas turbine compressors. The data collected from this research facility will verify and increase the fidelity of CFD models used to design modern industrial gas turbine compressors for Siemens. Siemens provided the aerodynamic design for the compressor while Purdue {{was responsible for the}} inlet, <b>exhaust,</b> and <b>casing</b> designs. At design point, the four-stage compressor has a corrected mass flow rate of 20. 16 kg/s (44. 44 lbm), a corrected rotational speed of 1350 RPM, and a pressure ratio of 1. 09. The compressor is 1. 25 m (4. 1 ft.) in diameter and has a 12. 5 cm (4. 92 in.) annulus height. ^ The aerodynamic and mechanical designs of the inlet and exhaust were completed during this phase of research. The inlet and exhaust systems were designed to maximize work space within the lab. The throttle is also housed within the exhaust system and is controlled by three linear actuators. In addition, preliminary airfoil root designs and a casing design with a bearing traverse system, rotor inserts, and assembly process was prepared. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894-1935 {{was dominated by}} the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed (less than 300 rpm) of the ship's propeller at an overall cost competitive with reciprocating engines. In 1894, efficient reduction gears were not available for the high powers required by ships, so direct drive was necessary. In Turbinia, which has direct drive to each propeller shaft, the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines (one on each shaft) in series, probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series. Also, there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds. The high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first US turbine-powered destroyers, , launched in 1909, which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at 28.35 knots. The use of turbines in several <b>casings</b> <b>exhausting</b> steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications, and is a form of cross-compounding. The first turbine was called the high pressure (HP) turbine, the last turbine was the low pressure (LP) turbine, and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure (IP) turbine. A much later arrangement than Turbinia can be seen on [...] in Long Beach, California, launched in 1934, in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected {{to the ends of the}} two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox. They are the HP, 1st IP, 2nd IP, and LP turbines.|$|R

40|$|The Turbine Rear Frame (TRF), as General Electric {{calls it}} (Rolls Royce calls it Tail Bearing Housing and Pratt & Whitney’s {{name for it}} is Turbine <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Casing),</b> is the part {{downstream}} of the last turbine stage, see figure 1. The TRF is used for mounting the engine onto the aircraft wing and to deswirl (remove the angular component) the outgoing flow. With the increasing demands of fuel efficiency, {{all parts of the}} engine has to be optimized with this in mind. In the production of the parts, deviations such as surface roughness, small bumps, offset between adjacent vanes, change in vane thickness and change in vane angle can occur. These deviations will affect the flow properties in different ways. For example: Increase the pressure loss. Increase the air stream turning angle. Induce separation on the vane. Etc [...] . In this thesis work both local (e. g. bumps) and global (e. g. angles) deviations have been studied. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 75 - 84 Recently, {{synthesis}} gas compressor drive steam turbines have required upgrading {{to increase efficiency}} and reliability for saving both {{operation and maintenance costs}} in many ammonia plants. This paper introduces the latest practical technologies to achieve very high performance. Examples include a highly unique assembly of integral shrouded blades, a new profile design procedure for both fluid loss reduction and increased strength against high-speed and high-stage power. Finite-element and computational fluid dynamics analysis results of new blades and nozzles are discussed while comparing experimental data from a cascade test and a rotating blades shaker test. These results are shown in terms of actual loss distribution, efficiency measurement, and vibration/stress mode on rotating blades including design criteria. Other useful applications of new technologies to reduce steam leakage and increase last stage blade performance are introduced. These involve modification of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>casing</b> and a new turning device. In particular, high speed and high loading are inevitable in {{synthesis gas}} compressor drive steam turbines. In order to improve operation reliability considering these factors, a special cooling design is applied for the thrust bearings to reduce the pad metal temperature. The results of this analysis and basic experimental data are discussed in detail. Furthermore, examples of actual job applications are explained, and high-speed balancing, mechanical running test, and site performance test results are shown...|$|E
