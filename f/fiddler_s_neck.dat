Sexual behaviour began at 3 y old in males, except for penile erections, which sometimes occurred in younger males. Males performed no courtship behaviour. Behavioural oestrus was brief, and consisted of four distinct types of activity: jerking, bellowing, mild aggression towards the male, and pseudomale behaviour. Oestrous females could become very excited by the presence of a male, and the four activities were very flexible in their expression.

The aim of this study is to investigate the correlations among the preoperative cervical sagittal alignment parameters and their correlations with the development of myelopathy in patients with CSM. Methods We retrospectively collected 212 patients with CSM who underwent surgical interventions. Gender, age, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (mJOA), cervical lordosis (CL), C 2 –C 7 sagittal vertical axis (C 2 –C 7 SVA), T 1 slope (T 1 <b>S),</b> <b>neck</b> tilt (NT) and thoracic inlet angle (TIA) were collected before operation. Interobserver and intraobserver reliability were calculated for all measurements (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC). Data were analyzed with Pearson and Spearman correlation tests and multiple linear regression analysis. Results A total of 212 patients with CSM were included in this study (male: 136, female: 76) with an average age of 54. 5 ±  10. 1 years old. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability for all included radiographic parameters presented good to excellent agreement (ICC >  0. 7). No significant differences in demographic and radiological parameters have been observed between males and females (P >  0. 05). We found statistically significant correlations among the following parameters: age with CL (r =  0. 135, P =  0. 049), age with T 1 S (r =  0. 222, P =  0. 001), CL with T 1 S (r =  0. 291, P <  0. 001), CL with C 2 -C 7 SVA (r =  −  0. 395, P <  0. 001), mJOA with age (r =  −  0. 274, P <  0. 001), mJOA with C 2 –C 7 SVA (r =  −  0. 219, P <  0. 001) and mJOA with T 1 S(r =  −  0. 171, p =  0. 013).

40|$|Several {{different}} strategies {{have now been}} used {{to demonstrate that the}} vestibular system can modulate muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in humans and thereby contribute to the regulation of blood pressure during changes in posture. However, it remains to be determined how the brain differentiates between head-only movements that do not require changes in vasomotor tone in the lower limbs from body movements that do require vasomotor changes. We tested the hypothesis that neck movements modulate MSNA in the lower limbs of humans. MSNA was recorded in 10 supine young adult subjects, at rest, during sinusoidal stretching of neck muscles (100 cycles, 35 ° peak to peak at 0. 37 ± 0. 02 Hz) and during a ramp-and-hold (17. 5 ° for 54 ± 9 <b>s)</b> static <b>neck</b> muscle stretch, while their heads were held fixed in space. Cross-correlation analysis revealed cyclical modulation of MSNA during sinusoidal neck muscle stretch (modulation index 45. 4 ± 5. 3 %), which was significantly less than the cardiac modulation of MSNA at rest (78. 7 ± 4. 2 %). Interestingly, cardiac modulation decreased significantly during sinusoidal neck displacement (63. 0 ± 9. 3 %). By contrast, {{there was no significant difference}} in MSNA activity during static ramp-and-hold displacements of the neck to the right or left compared with that with the head and neck aligned. These data suggest that dynamic, but not static, neck movements can modulate MSNA, presumably via projections of muscle spindle afferents to the vestibular nuclei, and may thus contribute to the regulation of blood pressure during orthostatic challenges...|$|R

Carotid baroreceptors were activated by a pressure pulse (5 <b>s)</b> of <b>neck</b> suction (NS, - 80 Torr) and neck pressure (NP, + 40 Torr) during held expiration. At rest the peak change in HR to NS/NP occurred during the first several heartbeats (1 st- 3 rd beat), whereas during mild and moderate exercise peak HR responses occurred {{near the end of}} the NS/NP pulse (6 th- 8 th beat). In contrast, time (s) to the peak change in HR was not different between rest and exercise (P > 0. 05).

The validity of certain indicators used to assess unconsciousness under different stunning and slaughter conditions is under debate. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the absence of threat-, withdrawal-, corneal- and eyelid reflex as indicators to assess unconsciousness in calves subjected to different stunning and slaughter methods. Calves (201 ± 22 kg) were randomly assigned to one of the following four treatments: (1) Captive bolt stunning followed by neck cut in an inverted position (n= 25); (2) Non-stunned slaughter in an upright position (n= 7); (3) Non-stunned slaughter in an inverted position (180 ° rotation) (n= 25); (4) Non-stunned slaughter in an upright position followed by captive bolt stunning 40 <b>s</b> after the <b>neck</b> cut (n= 25). Each calf was equipped with non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes before the slaughter procedure. All reflexes were verified once before the slaughter procedure. At the beginning of the procedure (T= 0 s) calves were stunned (treatment 1) or neck cut in an upright position (treatment 2, 4) or inverted position (treatment 3). Calves of treatment 4 were captive bolt stunned 34 ± 8 <b>s</b> after the <b>neck</b> cut. Reflexes were assessed every 20 s from T= 15 s for all treatments until all reflex tests resulted in a negative response three times in a row and a flat line EEG was observed. In addition, reflexes were assessed 5 s after captive bolt stunning in calves of treatments 1 and 4. Visual assessment of changes in the amplitude and frequency of EEG traces was used to determine loss of consciousness. Timing of loss of consciousness was related to timing of loss of reflexes. After captive bolt stunning, absence of threat-, withdrawal-, corneal- and eyelid reflex indicated unconsciousness as determined by EEG recordings. After non-stunned slaughter, both threat- and withdrawal reflex were on average lost before calves were unconscious based on EEG recordings. The eyelid- and corneal reflex were on average lost after calves had lost consciousness based on EEG recordings and appeared to be distinctly conservative indicators of unconsciousness in non-stunned slaughtered calves since they were observed until 76 ± 50 and 85 ± 45 s (mean±SD), respectively, after EEG-based loss of consciousness. </p...|$|R

40|$|The jaw {{function}} of Smilodon fatalis {{has long been}} a source of debate. Although modern-day lions subdue large prey {{through the use of a}} suffocating throat bite, the dramatically elongated maxillary canines of S. fatalis suggest an alternative bite mechanism. The current literature favors a "canine shear-bite," in which the depression of the cranium by the ventral neck flexors assists the mandibular adductors in closing the jaws. Although the model makes intuitive sense and appears to be supported by scientific data, the mechanical feasibility of "neck-powered" biting has not been experimentally demonstrated. In the present study, the computer-assisted manipulation of digitized images of a high-quality replica of an <b>S.</b> fatalis <b>neck</b> and skull shows that a rotation of the cranium by the ventral neck flexors will not result in jaw closure. Instead, the cranium and mandible rotate ventrally together (at the atlantooccipital joint), and the jaws remain in an open configuration. The only manner by which rotation of the cranium can simultaneously result in jaw closure is by an anterior rotation at the temporomandibular joint. Based on this finding, the author proposes a new Class 1 lever mechanism for S. fatalis jaw function. In this model, the mandible is immobilized against the neck of the prey and a dorsally directed force from the extension of the forelimbs rotates the cranium anteriorly at the temporomandibular joint. The maxillary canines pierce the prey's neck and assist in clamping the ventral neck structures. The model is based on a maximum gape angle of approximately 90 ° and incorporates a secondary virtual point of rotation located slightly anteroventral to the temporomandibular joint. The Class 1 Lever Model is mechanically feasible, consistent with current data on S. fatalis anatomy and ecology, and may provide a basis for similar studies on other fossil taxa...|$|R
40|$|Location: Library balcony Artist 2 ̆ 7 s Commentary January 28, 2004 Significance: This work {{is unique}} in that it {{reflects}} and draws upon relevant case law, theories, ideas, and history examined in the 1 st semester of law school here at the University of Georgia. Considering that our legal education here is premised on case study and in acknowledging and honoring the significance of Justice Holmes 2 ̆ 7 Lowell lectures I felt it only appropriate to title this work The Common Law. The following dialogue explains this work the the artist 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and gives some light to the various elements incorporated into this piece. Criminal Law: The faint beer bottle in the central character 2 ̆ 7 s head draws upon Proctor v. State symbolizing the concept of thought crimes. the two women with joined hands holding a purple tulip (see Torts) to the central character 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>neck</b> draw upon concepts of conspiracy, murder, and attempt. Property: The feather in the hair of the woman (left) represents Johnson v. M 2 ̆ 7 Intosh and the concepts of right to title and right to occupancy. In the central character 2 ̆ 7 s left hand he bear a fox and a time piece on his wrist. Those elements are reflective of Pierson v. Post, the rule of capture, {{and the concept of}} first in time. In the central character 2 ̆ 7 s other hand he holds a twig, which draws upon the ceremonial practices of feudal England in the passing of seisin from one party to another. Civil Procedure: The man in the background in the legendary Rex Grossman, who is serving process in the most effective method, in person. The elongated arms of the woman being served are symbolic of the long-arm statutes provided in state laws. Contracts: The woman (left) is presenting a salt shaker in her right hand, symbolizing Droughty v. Salt and the concept of the donative gift promise. The lines running between the two characters in the background are symbolic of the formation of a contract in the meeting of the minds. Torts: The purple tulip is pulled from the Old English case of Byrd v. Holbrook and symbolizes the spring gun used to protect the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s garden. Here it is being used against the central character and raises the concern of doing with an instrument of device that which one is not permitted to do in person. The holding of hands also represents Summers v. Tice and the concept of joint tortfeasors. The life preserver bearing the name Grayton symbolizes the Grimstad case and the irony embodied in the court 2 ̆ 7 s but-for test. The four (4) dots on the eye of the woman (right) represent foresight, and the eye in her bun of hair represents hindsight. This relates to Eckert v. Long Island R. R. and Terry 2 ̆ 7 s flawed theory on negligence in using hindsight to determine foresight. The cracker in the jaw of the woman (left) draws upon the legend at common law that the kind had the Chancellor of the Writs pass out crackers to those complaining about the insufficient writs of trespass in order to quiet the crowd, thus the Ritz cracker. General Elements: The X 2 ̆ 7 s on the central character are reflective of the battle wounds first in the stomach, then the chest, and then in the neck sustained by Justice Holmes in his service to our country. The large hand of the central character bears on each finger 2 ̆ 2 learn 2 ̆ 2, which is a tribute to Justice Learned Hand. The tress in the background are the same trees visible through the large pane glass of the Law Library, constant companions of those who spend long days devoted to their studies. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel autosomal dominant hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) that clinically mimics limb girdle muscular dystrophy in a Chinese family. We performed a detailed clinical assessment of 36 individuals spanning four generations. The age of onset {{ranged from the}} 30 s to the 50 <b>s.</b> Hip girdle, <b>neck</b> flexion and axial muscle weakness were involved at an early stage. This disease progressed slowly, and a shoulder girdle weakness appeared later in the disease course. Muscle biopsies showed necrotic, regenerating, and rimmed vacuolated fibers as well as congophilic inclusions {{in some of the}} fibers. Electron micrograph revealed cytoplasmic inclusions of 15 - 21 nm filaments. A genomewide scan and haplotype analyses were performed using an Illumina Linkage- 12 DNA Analysis Kit (average spacing 0. 58 cM), which traced the disease to a new locus on chromosome 7 q 22. 1 - 31. 1 with a maximum multi-point LOD score of 3. 65. The critical locus for this unique disorder, which is currently referred to as hereditary inclusion body myopathy 4 (HIBM 4), spans 8. 78 Mb and contains 65 genes. This localization raises the possibility that one of the genes clustered within this region may be involved in this disorder...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe septins are {{a family}} of GTPases {{involved}} in cytokinesis in budding yeast, Drosophila, and vertebrates (see [1] for review). Septins {{are associated with a}} system of 10 nm filaments at the <b>S.</b> cerevisiae bud <b>neck,</b> and heteromultimeric septin complexes have been isolated from cell extracts in a filamentous state [2 – 4]. A number of septins have been shown to bind and hydrolyze guanine nucleotide [2, 5, 6]. However, the role of GTP binding and hydrolysis in filament formation has not been elucidated. Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggest that not all the subunits of the septin complex are required for all aspects of septin function [3, 7]. To address these questions, we have reconstituted filament assembly in vitro by using a recombinant Xenopus septin, Xl Sept 2. Filament assembly is GTP dependent; moreover, the coiled-coil domain common to most septins is not essential for filament formation. Septin polymerization is preceded by a lag phase, suggesting a cooperative assembly mechanism. The slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP-γ-S, also induces polymerization, indicating that polymerization does not require GTP hydrolysis. If the properties of Xl Sept 2 filaments reflect those of native septin complexes, these results imply that the growth or stability of septin filaments, or both, is regulated by the state of bound nucleotide...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the interaction between the}} arterial baroreflex and muscle metaboreflexes (as reflected by alterations in the dynamic responses shown by muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR)) in humans. In nine healthy subjects (eight male, one female) who performed a sustained 1 min handgrip exercise at 50 % maximal voluntary contraction followed by forearm occlusion, a 5 <b>s</b> period of <b>neck</b> pressure (NP) (30 and 50 mmHg) or neck suction (NS) (- 30 and - 60 mmHg) was used to evaluate carotid baroreflex function at rest (CON) and during post-exercise muscle ischaemia (PEMI). In PEMI (as compared with CON) : (a) the augmentations in MSNA and MAP elicited by 50 mmHg NP were both greater; (b) MSNA seemed to be suppressed by NS for a shorter period, (c) the decrease in MAP elicited by NS was smaller, and (d) MAP recovered to its initial level more quickly after NS. However, the HR responses to NS and NP were not different between PEMI and CON. These results suggest that during muscle metaboreflex activation, the dynamic arterial baroreflex response is modulated, as exemplified by the augmentation of the MSNA response to arterial baroreflex unloading (i. e. NP) and the reduction in the suppression of MSNA induced by baroreceptor stimulation (i. e. NS) ...|$|R
