50|$|France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland use the CEE 7/6 {{plug and}} CEE 7/5 socket {{with the same}} size and spacing of the main pins but with a male protective-earth pin on the socket instead of the <b>earth</b> <b>clips,</b> and without the guiding notches at the sides. Most modern moulded Schuko plugs, and good-quality rewirable replacements, are a hybrid version ("CEE 7/7") with an {{aperture}} that accommodates the earth pin of CEE 7/5 sockets. CEE 7/6 plugs that need to be polarised are configured {{in such a way as}} to only be inserted correctly in earthed sockets, however the old CEE 7/1 2-pin unearthed socket is inherently dangerous with equipment that should be polarised, for example table lamps with an Edison screw lamp but only a single pole inline cord switch in lieu of a double pole switch. The safety of polarisation was not helped by several years of confusion when the correct connection of sockets was transposed.|$|R
5000|$|The CEE 7/3 socket and CEE 7/4 plug are {{commonly}} called Schuko. The socket (which is often, in error, {{also referred to}} as CEE 7/4) has a predominantly circular recess which is 17.5 mm deep with two symmetrical round apertures and two <b>earthing</b> <b>clips</b> {{on the sides of the}} socket positioned to ensure that the earth is always engaged before live pin contact is made.

5000|$|... "Schuko" [...] is a {{registered}} trademark referring {{to a system of}} AC power plugs and sockets that is defined as [...] "CEE 7/3" [...] (sockets) and [...] "CEE 7/4" [...] (plugs). A Schuko plug features two round pins of 4.8 mm diameter (19 mm long, centers 19 mm apart) for the line and neutral contacts, plus two flat contact areas on the top and bottom side of the plug for protective earth (ground). The socket (which is often, in error, also referred to as CEE 7/4) has a predominantly circular recess which is 17.5 mm deep with two symmetrical round apertures and two <b>earthing</b> <b>clips</b> {{on the sides of the}} socket positioned to ensure that the earth is always engaged before live pin contact is made. Schuko plugs and sockets are symmetric AC connectors. They can be mated in two ways, therefore line can be connected to either pin of the appliance plug. As with most types of European sockets, Schuko sockets can accept Europlugs. Schuko plugs are considered a very safe design when used with Schuko sockets, but they can also mate with other sockets to give an unsafe result.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{begins with}} the song [...] "Where in the World Can My Lover Be?" [...] by Midge Williams & Her Jazz Jesters playing in the background. As the music begins, West is shown in a Sputnik-like {{spacecraft}} revealing pictures before zooming out of the craft. In the video, Perry, as an alien, drifts through outer space while slowly evolving into a humanoid appearance before landing on an abandoned <b>Earth.</b> <b>Clips</b> are interspersed of large felines hunting game. She comes across a broken robot, resembling a spaceman; upon her kiss {{it turns into a}} naked man, played by Shaun Ross. It is eventually revealed that Perry's legs resemble those of a gazelle. Meanwhile, West is featured in the video floating in a traveling spacecraft. The video also alludes to a presumable future, as Perry finds a box containing a skeleton of a pigeon (a species said to have gone extinct in 2030) and a pair of Vogue sunglasses, which she later wears. Throughout the video, Perry wears heavy cosmetics, including blue and pink make-up, cat-like and reptile-like eyes, and braids resembling those of Medusa.|$|R

5000|$|Cleopatra kills herself {{using the}} poison of an asp. She dies calmly and ecstatically, imagining how she will meet Antony {{again in the}} afterlife. Her serving maids, Iras and Charmian, die also, with Iras dying from heartbreak and Charmian killing herself with another asp. Octavius discovers the dead bodies and {{experiences}} conflicting emotions. Antony's and Cleopatra's deaths leave him free {{to become the first}} Roman Emperor, but he also feels some kind of sympathy for them: [...] "She shall be buried by her Antony. / No grave upon the <b>earth</b> shall <b>clip</b> in it / A pair so famous..." [...] He orders a public military funeral.|$|R
5|$|To {{promote the}} song, Perry and West {{performed}} on the tenth season of American Idol, the 54th Grammy Awards, and at Madison Square Garden for Z100's Jingle Ball. Floria Sigismondi directed the song's music video, which depicts Perry as an evolving alien drifting in outer space before landing on an abandoned litter-covered <b>Earth,</b> interspersed with <b>clips</b> of large felines hunting game. The video garnered positive reviews from music critics.|$|R
5000|$|Shulgin then created [...] "Merry Christmas to the World", another ambitious East-West {{collaboration}} between Shulgin and BBC Worldwide. With music by Shulgin and lyrics and production by Richard Niles it expressed {{the ethos of}} glasnost. London studio musicians performed {{with members of the}} Moscow Symphony and the Soviet Folk Orchestra. Sung by Valeria, the video was directed by Ken Russell who used it in his film [...] "Alice in Russialand" [...] (1998). Shot in Red Square, the clip featured psychic Uri Geller. During a special communication, astronauts from the [...] "Star Township" [...] introduced Valeria while in orbit around the <b>Earth.</b> The <b>clip</b> became the grand finale of the New Year program on the first national TV channel of the Soviet Union.|$|R
60|$|It {{would not}} be true to say that love had come to Albert Lohr as a {{relaxing}} influence, but it had changed {{the direction of his}} energies so radically as to make his whole life seem weaker and lower. As long as his love-dreams went out toward a vague and ideal woman, supposedly higher and grander than himself, he was spurred on to face the terrible sheer escarpment of social eminence; but when he met, by accident, the actual woman who was to inspire his future efforts, the difficulties he faced took on solid reality. His aspirations fell to the <b>earth,</b> their wings <b>clipped,</b> and became, perforce, submissive beasts at the plough. The force that moved so much of his thought was transformed into other energy.|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} {{begins with a}} cold open, the second serial to have a specially-shot pretitles {{sequence}} after Time and the Rani (1987), though Castrovalva (1982) began with a reprise of Logopolis (1981), and The Five Doctors (1983) featured a clip from The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964) before the title sequence. Remembrance cold open features {{a shot of the}} <b>Earth</b> with audio <b>clips</b> from 1963, including excerpts of John F. Kennedy's American University speech and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech. Many other clips from the early 60s were planned but did not make the final cut. Many songs from the time period can also be heard in the background during several scenes in the serial.|$|R
