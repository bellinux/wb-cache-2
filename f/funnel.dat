5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} a <b>funnel</b> cloud and a condensation <b>funnel.</b> According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a <b>funnel</b> cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the 'funnel cloud' term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation <b>funnel</b> is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} <b>funnel</b> clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} <b>funnel</b> clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible <b>funnel</b> is still above the ground, so {{it is difficult to}} discern the difference between a <b>funnel</b> cloud and a tornado from a distance.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible <b>funnel</b> cloud or condensation <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Afghanistan, the CIA <b>funneled</b> {{a billion}} dollars worth of weapons to Pakistani intelligence, which <b>funneled</b> them through Pakistani tribes, which <b>funneled</b> them to Afghan {{resistance}} groups, notably the Mujahideen. [...] At each step, some of the weapons were held back.|$|R
50|$|To {{serve as}} a beacon at night during {{emergencies}} the three <b>funnels</b> on the Empress of Britain were illuminated with powerful flood lights. From the air the <b>funnels</b> could be spotted 50 miles away and ships could spot the illuminated <b>funnels</b> 30 miles distance.|$|R
5000|$|Hirsch <b>funnels</b> {{are shaped}} much like normal <b>funnels,</b> but contain holes or {{sintered}} glass {{at the base}} for quick filtrations.|$|R
5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward <b>funnel</b> with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot <b>funnel</b> gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the <b>funnel</b> also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward <b>funnel</b> had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|While largely out of {{site from}} the bay {{for which it is}} named, Arthur's Baye Mill & Bakery shared a {{building}} with store called The Market Place. The retail is now The Fun Shoppe, with the generically named Medieval <b>Funnel</b> Cakes. There is a Coca-Cola Freestyle location at the <b>funnel</b> cake store.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation <b>funnel.</b> As the <b>funnel</b> descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the <b>funnel</b> cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
50|$|Askold {{had five}} thin <b>funnels</b> which {{gave it a}} unique {{silhouette}} for any vessel in the Imperial Russian Navy. This led British sailors to nickname her Packet of Woodbines after the thin cigarettes popular at the time. However, the five <b>funnels</b> also had a symbolic importance, as it was popularly considered {{that the number of}} <b>funnels</b> was indicative of performance, and some navies were known to add extra fake <b>funnels</b> to impress dignitaries in less advanced countries.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of sub-optimal <b>funnels</b> in combinatorial fitness landscapes {{has been linked}} to search difficulty. The exact nature of these structures — and how commonly they appear — is not yet fully understood. Improving our understanding of <b>funnels</b> could help with designing effective diversification mechanisms for a ‘smoothing’ effect, making optimisation easier. We model fitness landscapes as local optima networks. The relationship between communities of local optima found by network clustering algorithms and <b>funnels</b> is explored. <b>Funnels</b> are identified using the notion of monotonic sequences from the study of energy landscapes in theoretical chemistry. NK Landscapes and the Quadratic Assignment Problem are used as case studies. Our results show that communities are linked to <b>funnels.</b> The analysis exhibits relationships between these landscape structures and the performance of trajectory-based metaheuristics such as Simulated Annealing (SA) and Iterated Local Search (ILS). In particular, ILS gets trapped in <b>funnels,</b> and modular communities of optima slow it down. The <b>funnels</b> contribute to lower success for SA. We show that increasing the strength of ILS perturbation helps to ‘smooth’ the <b>funnels</b> and improves performance in multi-funnel landscapes. Authors listed as ECOM Trac...|$|R
50|$|All had two widely spaced {{pairs of}} <b>funnels</b> except for Smith, {{which had the}} first and fourth <b>funnels</b> {{separated}} from the middle pair.|$|R
5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. The He 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the <b>funnel</b> and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward <b>funnel</b> {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot <b>funnel</b> gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft <b>funnel</b> to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward <b>funnel</b> was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward <b>funnel</b> was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the <b>funnel</b> touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E
5000|$|Dropping <b>funnels</b> {{are similar}} in shape and design, and {{may be used as}} {{separatory}} <b>funnels.</b> They have standard taper ground glass joints at the stem.|$|R
40|$|<b>Funnelling</b> effect, in {{the context}} of searching on networks, {{precisely}} indicates that the search takes place through a few specific nodes. We define the <b>funnelling</b> capacity $f$ of a node as the fraction of successful dynamic paths through it with a fixed target. We claim that there is a <b>funnelling</b> effect if the distribution $D(f) $ of the fraction of nodes with <b>funnelling</b> capacity $f$ shows a power law behaviour. We find that a transition from a search with <b>funnelling</b> effect to that without any such effect can exist and is driven by the parameters defining the network.

5000|$|In her {{original}} Swedish American Line livery the Kungsholms hull and superstructure were painted all-white, with <b>funnels</b> and masts painted yellow, and SAL's blue three crowns logo painted on both <b>funnels.</b> In North German Lloyd service she received the traditional black hull of a transatlantic liner, with the <b>funnels</b> and cargo cranes {{in front of}} the ship painted orange. Following the merger into Hapag-Lloyd, her hull was repainted white with orange and blue decorative ribands, and the blue Hapag-Lloyd logo was added to her <b>funnels.</b> In Costa Cruises service the two ribands on the hull were replaced with a thinner black one, while the <b>funnels</b> were painted yellow with a blue top and the large blue [...] "C" [...] logo of Costa painted on both of them.|$|R
5|$|In Virginia, a large band of {{thunderstorms}} {{associated with}} the hurricane brought strong winds and spawned three tornadoes. A <b>funnel</b> cloud formed in Albemarle County evolved into an F3 tornado after crossing into Greene County. It destroyed two houses and uprooted several trees, inflicting $250,000 in damage (1985USD, $470,000 2006USD). F0 tornadoes were also generated in Goochland County and Hanover County; the two tornadoes damaged a total of ten houses. <b>Funnel</b> clouds were sighted throughout the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area.|$|E
5|$|Peter and Alex Campbell of Penarth {{bought the}} Barry Railway's Red <b>Funnel</b> Paddle Steamers in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Szent István {{differed}} from her half-sisters mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft {{arrangement of the}} other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore <b>funnel</b> which extended from the bridge to the after <b>funnel</b> and on which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk {{in front of the}} mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with torpedo nets.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary purpose}} of <b>funnels</b> on steamships were to allow smoke, heat and excess steam {{to escape from the}} boiler rooms. As liners became larger, more boilers were used. The number of <b>funnels</b> became {{symbolic}} of speed and safety, so shipping companies sometimes added false <b>funnels</b> (like the one sported by the Olympic-class ocean liner) to give an impression of power.|$|R
50|$|They {{were similar}} to the Admiralty M class, but {{completed}} to a modified design by Hawthorn Leslie and Company, Hebburn on Tyne. They had four <b>funnels</b> instead of the three <b>funnels</b> of the Admiralty design. The midships 4 inch gun was shipped between {{the second and third}} <b>funnels.</b> Both ships were laid down in 1914 and completed in 1915. Both survived the war.|$|R
2500|$|In her {{original}} Swedish American Line livery the Kungsholms hull and superstructure were painted all-white, with <b>funnels</b> and masts painted yellow, and SAL's blue three crowns logo painted on both <b>funnels.</b> [...] In North German Lloyd service she received the traditional black hull of a transatlantic liner, with the <b>funnels</b> and cargo cranes {{in front of}} the ship painted orange.

5|$|The ink sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the ink, and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} <b>funnel</b> for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the <b>funnel,</b> the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the ink sac.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{modification}} after the ship's completion was {{the addition of}} a hurricane deck between the turret and the <b>funnel</b> sometime {{after the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
5|$|They were {{intended}} to carry a number of boats aboard, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, two pinnaces, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ships were also to be equipped with a double catapult mounted between the two funnels, and four Arado Ar 196 seaplanes for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft were stored in a main hangar just aft of the forward <b>funnel,</b> along with two smaller hangars, {{one on each side}} of the rear <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, Norddeutscher Lloyd {{launched}} [...] She {{was followed}} {{three years later}} by three sister ships. The ship was both luxurious and fast, managing to steal the Blue Riband from the British. She {{was also the first}} of the fourteen ocean liners with four <b>funnels</b> that have emerged in maritime history. The ship needed only two <b>funnels,</b> but more <b>funnels</b> gave passengers a feeling of safety and power.|$|R
50|$|Havock {{was built}} with {{conventional}} locomotive boilers (giving her two closely spaced <b>funnels)</b> while Hornet was provided with 8 water tube boilers (giving her 4 widely spaced <b>funnels).</b> In other respects they were largely identical.|$|R
50|$|Extra <b>funnels</b> {{not needed}} for diesel {{generator}} exhaust would be dummy <b>funnels.</b> The economic feasibility was more uncertain. The engineering challenges would drive the construction costs to approximately twice {{the cost of}} a modern cruise ship.|$|R
5|$|While in drydock in July 1943, Type 21 air {{search radar}} was {{installed}} {{on the roof of}} the 10-meter rangefinder at the top of the pagoda mast. In August 1944, two Type 22 surface search radar units were {{installed on the}} pagoda mast and two Type 13 early warning radar units were fitted on the <b>funnel.</b> Fusō was the only Japanese battleship to mount radar on her <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|During Florida and Utahs {{reconstruction}} in 1925–1927, their coal-fired boilers {{were replaced}} with four White-Forster oil-fired boilers. The {{reduction in the}} number of boilers allowed their twin funnels to be trunked into one single larger <b>funnel.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, {{the chief}} {{executive}} of UBS Belgium, Marcel Brühwiler, was arrested on suspicion of fraud, while UBS' offices and Brühwiler's residence were searched by police. It is alleged that UBS Belgium actively recruited rich Belgians, proposing to <b>funnel</b> funds to secret Swiss accounts, enabling tax avoidance.|$|E
25|$|Since 1962, when PS Waverleys {{original}} <b>funnels</b> were renewed, replacement items {{had been}} {{slightly out of}} parallel due to their heavier welded steel construction. The problem was resolved in the 2000–03 refit and her two <b>funnels</b> are now parallel.|$|R
5000|$|Separatory <b>funnels</b> {{are similar}} in shape and design, and {{may be used as}} {{dropping}} <b>funnels.</b> They do not always have the ground glass joint at the stem, instead having a narrow tube suitable for insertion into a rubber stopper.|$|R
