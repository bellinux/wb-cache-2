5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with <b>high-lift</b> devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed {{the effects of a}} failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant hydraulic systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced <b>high-lift</b> devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
25|$|In 1930 the {{aircraft}} was tested and {{evaluated by the}} Polish Air Force. Thanks to wing mechanization (flats and slats), it had short take-off and landing. It was very advanced combination of <b>high-lift</b> devices in world's aviation those days. A competing designs Lublin R-X and PWS-5t2, evaluated yet in 1929, were not satisfactory, so the Polish Air Force ordered 60 PZL.2. The aircraft {{took part in the}} second contest for an army co-operation aircraft in July 1931. In spite of advanced <b>high-lift</b> devices and all-duralumin construction of the PZL.2, the air force decided to choose a simpler, cheaper and quite satisfactory Lublin R-XIII plane.|$|E
25|$|On {{an unknown}} date during the 1980s, an unknown Il-86 on {{approach}} to Mineralnye Vody, Russia, suffered a hydraulic failure resulting in asymmetrical {{deployment of the}} <b>high-lift</b> devices. The flight crew brought the machine to a safe landing without further incident. No casualties.|$|E
25|$|Four GT-40PCh6 engine {{generators}} generate {{energy from}} the Kuznetsov NK-86. The APU or ground sources supply 200/115V, 400Hz current to the primary system or two secondary systems (36V/400Hz AC and 27V DC). Recipients include <b>high-lift</b> devices, tailplane trim, deicing, galley lift (elevator) and interior services.|$|E
25|$|Designed for off-runway operations, the {{all-metal}} CH 701 {{has many}} features {{that contribute to}} the aircraft's capabilities, such as a <b>high-lift</b> wing with full-span, non-movable leading edge slots, an all-flying rudder, large tires, flaperons and an inverted elevator. Heintz also designed a unique tricycle gear amphibious float system for the CH 701.|$|E
25|$|A droop or droop nose {{is a type}} of <b>high-lift</b> device {{found on}} the wings of some aircraft. Droops are similar to leading-edge slats, but with the {{difference}} that the entire leading edge section rotates downwards, whereas a slat is a panel that moves away from a wing leading edge when it is deployed.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, two {{problems}} were identified before heavier-than-air flight could be realized. The {{first was the}} creation of low-drag, <b>high-lift</b> aerodynamic wings. The second problem was how to determine the power needed for sustained flight. During this time, the groundwork was laid down for modern day fluid dynamics and aerodynamics, with other less scientifically-inclined enthusiasts testing various flying machines with little success.|$|E
25|$|A new trailing-edge <b>high-lift</b> device {{has been}} adopted with an {{advanced}} dropped-hinge flap {{similar to that of}} the Airbus A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect differentially.|$|E
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple <b>high-lift</b> flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|The Port Victoria aircraft, {{designed}} by W.H. Sayers, was designated P.V.7. It {{was a very}} small single bay tractor biplane, of sesquiplane configuration, with its lower wing much smaller than its upper wing. The wings featured the same <b>high-lift</b> section as used in previous Port Victoria aircraft, and were fitted with ailerons only on the upper wing. It was intended, as was the competing Eastchurch design, to use a 45hp (34kW) geared ABC Gnat two-cylinder air-cooled engine. Armament was a single Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|Initial design {{featured}} podded engines on the aft fuselage and a T-tail {{like the}} 727, and five-abreast seating, but Joe Sutter instead placed the engines under the wings {{to lighten the}} structure, enabling fuselage widening for six-abreast seating. The 737 design was presented in October 1964 at the Air Transport Association maintenance and engineering conference by chief project engineer Jack Steiner, where its elaborate <b>high-lift</b> devices raised concerns about maintenance costs and dispatch reliability. The launch decision for the $150 million development {{was made by the}} board on 1 February 1965.|$|E
25|$|Cantilever three-spar {{structure}} of modified trapezoid planform. Centre section integral with fuselage. Inboard sections, outboard sections and detachable leading and trailing edges. <b>High-lift</b> devices comprise full-span six-segment {{leading edge slats}} (contiguous at engine pylons) at up to 17.5% of chord (drooping to 35°), two-segment fixed-vane double-slotted trailing edge flaps occupying some 75% of the span (deploying to 40°) and five-segment spoilers (outboards used as spoilerons at high speeds, inboards used as lift dumpers on the ground). Two-segment outboard ailerons for low speed roll control. Boundary layer fences over pylons. Engines suspended from the wing on pylons act as anti-flutter weights. Trim range is 16–33% of mean aerodynamic chord.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Vought {{engineer}} Rex B. Beisel was tasked with designing an observation monoplane aircraft for the U.S. Navy {{suitable for a}} multitude of tasks including directing battleship fire. In replacing the standard biplane observation aircraft with a more modern monoplane design, Beisel incorporated innovations becoming the first production type to be assembled with spot welding, a process Vought and the Naval Aircraft Factory jointly developed to create a smooth fuselage that resisted buckling and generated less drag. Beisel also introduced <b>high-lift</b> devices, spoilers and in a unique arrangement, deflector plate flaps and drooping ailerons located on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing were deployed to increase the camber of the wing and thus create additional lift.|$|E
25|$|The B-10 {{featured}} {{innovations that}} became standard internationally {{for the next}} decade: an all-metal low wing monoplane, closed cockpits, rotating gun turrets, retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, <b>high-lift</b> devices and full engine cowlings. The B-10 proved to be so superior that as its 14 operational test models were delivered in 1934 they were fed into the Air Corps mail operation, and despite some glitches caused by pilot unfamiliarity with the innovations, were a bright spot. The first action to repair the damaged image of the Air Corps involved the movement of ten YB-10s from Bolling Field to Alaska, ostensibly for an airfield survey, but timed {{to coincide with the}} release of the Baker Board's report in July.|$|E
25|$|Using {{this many}} landing gear on a swept wing would produce {{considerable}} problems when the aircraft {{tried to turn}} on the ground. It was possible to use steerable landing gear legs for this, but only at the cost of added complexity. An easier solution was to simply use a straight wing so the landing gear were in a line. However, this would limit the design to slower speeds below about Mach 0.7 (see wave drag). This was perfectly acceptable for short-haul role, where the cruise times were so short that added speed would have little actual effect on round-trip times. By limiting themselves to speeds not much greater than propeller transports, the engineers were free to select a wing designed solely for low-speed <b>high-lift</b> performance. The result looked much more like the wing from a 1930s airliner than a modern jet aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Like the P.V.2, the new design, the Port Victoria P.V.9 was a single-engined {{sesquiplane}} (i.e. a biplane {{with its}} lower wing {{much smaller than}} its upper wing) braced with faired steel tubes. The fuselage, wider {{than that of the}} P.V.2, was mounted between the upper and lower wings, almost filling the inter-wing gap, giving an excellent view for the pilot. Armament was a Vickers machine gun synchronised to fire through the propeller disc, with a Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing firing over the propeller. Power was provided by a Bentley BR1 rotary engine. While the designers had hoped to use the same <b>high-lift</b> aerofoil section as used in the P.V.2, this was rejected by the Admiralty, who demanded the use of the more conventional RAF 15 aerofoil, which resulted in a larger aircraft with a reduced climb rate and ceiling.|$|E
25|$|The U-2's flight {{controls}} {{are designed for}} high-altitude flight; the controls require light control inputs at operational altitude. However, at lower altitudes, the higher air density and lack of a power assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly. Control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, {{and a great deal}} of physical strength is needed to operate the controls in this manner. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the <b>high-lift</b> wings in ground effect is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wing is fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a chase car and an assisting U-2 pilot calling off the angles and decreasing aircraft height as the aircraft descends.|$|E
25|$|Droops {{function}} with other <b>high-lift</b> devices on an aircraft {{to increase the}} camber of the wing and reduce the stalling speed. On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} lift device selection deploys the droops (called droop noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their stowed position. Another function of the droops on the A380 is to change the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, the United States Navy {{sought a}} long-range, high-endurance {{interceptor}} aircraft {{to protect its}} carrier battle groups against long-range anti-ship missiles launched from Soviet jet bombers and submarines. The Navy needed a fleet air defense (FAD) fighter with a more powerful radar, and longer range missiles than the F-4 Phantom II to intercept both enemy bombers and missiles. Seeking a FAD fighter, the Navy started with the subsonic, straight-winged aircraft, the Douglas F6D Missileer in the late 1950s. The Missileer was designed to carry six long-range missiles and loiter for five hours, but would be defenseless after firing its missiles. The program was formally canceled in 1961. The Navy had tried variable geometry wings with the XF10F Jaguar, but abandoned it in the early 1950s. It was NASA's simplification which made the variable geometry wings practical. By 1960, increases in aircraft weights required improved <b>high-lift</b> devices, such as variable geometry wings. Variable geometry offered high speeds, and maneuverability with heavier payloads, long range, {{and the ability to}} takeoff and land in shorter distances.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} thought that Microraptor was a glider, and probably lived mainly in trees, because the hindwings {{anchored to the}} feet of Microraptor would have hindered their ability to run on the ground. Some paleontologists have suggested that feathered dinosaurs used their wings to parachute from trees, possibly to attack or ambush prey on the ground, as a precursor to gliding or true flight. In their 2007 study, Chatterjee and Templin tested this hypothesis as well, {{and found that the}} combined wing surface of Microraptor was too narrow to successfully parachute to the ground without injury from any significant height. However, the authors did leave open the possibility that Microraptor could have parachuted short distances, as between closely spaced tree branches. Wind tunnel experiments have demonstrated that sustaining a <b>high-lift</b> coefficient at the expense of high drag was likely the most efficient strategy for Microraptor when gliding between low elevations. Microraptor did not require a sophisticated, ‘modern’ wing morphology to be an effective glider. However, the idea that Microraptor was an arboreal glider relies on it to have regularly climbed or even lived in trees, when study of its anatomy have shown that its limb proportions fall in line with modern ground birds rather than climbers, and its skeleton shows none of the expected adaptations in animals specialized for climbing trees.|$|E
500|$|After it {{was badly}} damaged during an {{emergency}} landing, DD810 was {{converted into a}} prototype of the first strike variant, the Firebrand T.F. Mk II (with the company designation B-45), that flew on 31 March 1943. It was an adaptation of the Mk I with the wing centre section widened by [...] {{to make room for}} the torpedo on the centreline between the mainwheels. Like the Mk I, the TF Mk II only saw a very limited production run of 12 aircraft and they were also allocated for development work, including those assigned to 708 Naval Air Squadron, a shore-based trials unit. Blackburn proposed several versions of the Sabre-powered aircraft including one for the RAF as the B-41, a version with a <b>high-lift</b> wing as the B-42, and the B-43 floatplane, none of which were accepted for further development.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{thorough}} redesign {{was of the}} wing, the objective being to match {{the performance of the}} cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A. Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift-to-drag ratio. Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher aspect ratio, reduced sweep (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from [...] to [...] The wing has a <b>high-lift</b> configuration, employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped ailerons. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700lb (3,035kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000ft (300m) takeoff roll. Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is [...] lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.|$|E
2500|$|From March 1970 {{the bureau}} {{developed}} all-new designs under the Il-86 designation. Instead of the [...] "appropriate technology" [...] {{approach of the}} Il-62, these designs were to have powered controls, complex <b>high-lift</b> devices and advanced automation which would {{reduce the number of}} flightdeck crew.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{structures}} of the first A330-800 were entering production in October 2017 : <b>high-lift</b> devices are installed on the wing in Bremen, fuselage sections are built in Hamburg, the centre wing-box in Nantes, titanium engine pylons in Toulouse [...] and sharklet wingtips in Korea; final assembly will start {{by the end of}} the year for a first flight in 2018.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{suffered a}} deep stall {{in the third}} minute of its flight and crashed to the ground, narrowly missing a busy main road. The ensuing inquest principally blamed the captain for failing to maintain airspeed and configure the <b>high-lift</b> devices correctly. It also cited the captain's heart condition and the limited experience of the co-pilot, while noting an unspecified [...] "technical problem" [...] that the crew apparently resolved before take-off.|$|E
2500|$|While {{technically}} advanced, the Trident (and other aircraft with a T-tail arrangement) had {{potentially dangerous}} stalling characteristics. If its airspeed was insufficient, and particularly if its <b>high-lift</b> devices were not extended {{at the low}} speeds typical of climbing away after take-off or of approaching to land, it could enter a deep stall (or [...] "superstall") condition, in which the tail control surfaces become ineffective (as {{they are in the}} turbulence zone of the stalled main wing) from which recovery was practically impossible.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1968, {{the captain}} of a Trident 1C departing Paris-Orly Airport for London tried to improve climb {{performance}} by retracting the flaps shortly after take-off. This was a non-standard procedure, and shortly afterward he also retracted the leading-edge droops. This configuration of <b>high-lift</b> devices at a low airspeed {{would have resulted in}} a deep stall, but the co-pilot noticed the error, increased airspeed and re-extended the droops, and the flight continued normally. The event became known as the [...] "Paris Incident" [...] or the [...] "Orly Incident" [...] among BEA staff.|$|E
2500|$|His {{professional}} and avocational interests ran together over {{a broad range}} of topics including: low-speed/highlift aerodynamics, airplane design, Reynolds number scale conditions in wind tunnel testing, soaring and human powered flight technology, bioaerodynamics, paleontology, and engineering education. He authored over 90 publications and technical papers, and lectured to {{a broad range of}} university, government, and professional society audiences in all these topic areas. [...] John made significant contributions in a variety of aerodynamic and aircraft design areas, including <b>high-lift</b> aerodynamics, sailplanes, vortex generators, very large aircraft design, undersea gliders, smart wings, and many other concepts.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the minor}} effects include changes to the airflow that lead to {{problems}} in control. For instance, the P-38 Lightning with its thick <b>high-lift</b> wing had a particular problem in high-speed dives {{that led to a}} nose-down condition. Pilots would enter dives, and then find that they could no longer control the plane, which continued to nose over until it crashed. The problem was remedied by adding a [...] "dive flap" [...] beneath the wing which altered the center of pressure distribution so that the wing would not lose its lift.|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1980s, PZL {{was planned}} to produce {{half of the}} Il-86, {{including}} the entire wing, and also to work on Il-86 developments (“Now we are preparing to manufacture units for the next model of the Il wide-body plane,” according to Belczak). From May 1977, the Polish factory manufactured entire empennages including tailplanes and the fin, all control surfaces, <b>high-lift</b> devices and engine pylons for the Il-86, representing [...] "about 16 per cent of these aircraft." [...] Amid labour and political unrest in Poland from 1980 onwards, the Voronezh factory was instructed to retain wing manufacture.|$|E
2500|$|The P.V.5's wing bracing struts {{also carried}} the aircraft's floats, forming a [...] "W" [...] shape {{when viewed from}} the front, with no bracing wires used, while a <b>high-lift</b> wing section, {{developed}} by the National Physical Laboratory and used on the Port Victoria P.V.1 and P.V.2 was again employed. Armament was the specified single synchronised Vickers machine gun, with two 65lb bombs carried internally. The Hispano-Suiza engine was enclosed in an annular cowling and drove a two-bladed propeller. Flat-bottomed pontoon-type floats were fitted, which were angled outwards to divert spray away from the engine and propeller.|$|E
2500|$|Aerodynamics work {{throughout}} the 19th century sought to achieve heavier-than-air flight. [...] George Cayley developed {{the concept of}} the modern fixed-wing aircraft in 1799, and in doing so identified the four fundamental forces of flight - lift, thrust, drag, and weight. [...] The development of reasonable predictions of the thrust needed to power flight in conjunction with the development of <b>high-lift,</b> low-drag airfoils {{paved the way for the}} first powered flight. [...] On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright flew the first successful powered aircraft. [...] The flight, and the publicity it received, led to more organized collaboration between aviators and aerodynamicists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|Investigations {{into the}} event found no {{mechanical}} malfunction {{that could have}} caused the premature leading-edge device retraction, and stated that the aircraft had [...] "just about managed to stay flying". A possible design fault in the <b>high-lift</b> control interlocks came under suspicion, although this was discounted during {{the investigation into the}} crash of Papa India. The event became known as the [...] "Naples Incident" [...] or the [...] "Foxtrot Hotel Incident" [...] (after the registration of the aircraft concerned) at BEA and was examined during the accident inquiry. The forward fuselage of this aircraft is preserved and on public display at the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre, London Colney.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} operating Flight BE 548 was a Hawker Siddeley Trident Series 1 short- to medium-range three-engined airliner. This particular Trident (s/n 2109) {{was one of}} twenty-four de Havilland DH.121s {{ordered by}} BEA in 1959, and was registered to the corporation in 1961 as [...] By {{the time of the}} aircraft's first flight on 14 April 1964, de Havilland had lost their separate identity under Hawker Siddeley Aviation, and Papa India was delivered to BEA on 2 May 1964. The Trident I was equipped with three interconnected <b>high-lift</b> devices on each wing leading edge – two droops outboard and a Krueger flap on the section closest to the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the design}} stage many {{solutions}} involving <b>high-lift</b> devices were explored including flaps blown by the [...] "cruise" [...] engines. The {{flight control system}} proved the greatest challenge to the design team, systems had to be devised to control the aircraft in slow or hovering flight. This was to be achieved by swivelling the lift engines in their mounts combined with varying the thrust of each engine to provide control in pitch, roll and yaw. The lift engines {{were said to be}} a useful safety feature in the event of failure of the main 'cruise' engines. Significant design information was gained from flight trials with the Dornier Do 31 aircraft being developed {{at the same time in}} Germany.|$|E
