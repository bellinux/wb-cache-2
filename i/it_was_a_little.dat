5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit {{frustrating}} {{at first but}} eventually we {{found a way to}} communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down}} the aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E

25|$|The Cappella del Transito is {{the small}} room where St. Francis died on 3 October 1226. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hut serving as a {{primitive}} infirmary for the sick. It is decorated at the outside by the fresco of The transito by Domenico Bruschi (1886). On the inside, above the small altar, is the rope of St. Francis. Behind the altar, there is a glazed terracotta statue of St. Francis by Andrea della Robbia (c. 1490). On the walls there is a fresco by Giovanni Spagna (1520), depicting the earliest followers of St. Francis, with their names above each portrait (Ruffino, Leone, Masseo and Egidio).|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews echoed {{many of the}} {{positive}} aspects of the game. GamePro stated that [...] "Gearbox has done one hell of a job in creating not just an add-on for Half-Life, but a continuation of a masterpiece", praising both level design and story elements, but noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too short.

[...] In another interview, she was asked whether the c-word was based on experience, to which she said, [...] "It was a little bit. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit based {{on the experience of}} having someone call you that and not knowing how to deal with it.".

Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that she sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something with me, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
500|$|Benigno called [...] "The Most Wonderful Day of the Year" [...] a [...] "perfectly {{pleasant}} {{opening that}} the Gleeks sing while they decorate their tree".

Harper said that the song [...] "got the episode off on the right holiday foot", and Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that its performance [...] "almost felt like the beginning of a real holiday musical. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cheesy but also kind of charming and sweet." [...] The next song, [...] "We Need a Little Christmas", Benigno declared [...] "fun but too short". He added, [...] "If there's one thing this number teaches us, it's that Mercedes is being woefully misused on this show and can carry a number as well, if not better than she can finish one." [...] Stack said that the [...] "little taste" [...] included in the show [...] "sounded promising", and Harper [...] "totally loved this song".|$|E
500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the film succeeded in {{being one of the}} good sequels in a while, but that Stone [...] "gets too fancy here and there", the film's [...] "heavy {{reliance}} on multiple screens, graphics and digital tricks makes it feel like one is watching CNN with all its computer-screen busyness." [...] Roger Ebert, reviewing the movie in the Chicago Sun-Times, noted that it ended with a better conclusion when Stone had edited the film after its Cannes viewing, but still felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too long. He considered the film to be sophisticated and said its photography was aesthetically pleasing but stated he wanted it to be [...] "outraged." [...] In The Guardian Peter Bradshaw gave the film two out of five stars, commenting that [...] "despite the pious waffle about market craziness being like cancer, no one is ever shown enduring the actual misery of losing money." [...] Writing for Time magazine, Richard Corliss stated that the film has the [...] "drive, luxe and sarcastic wit of the snazziest Hollywood movies." [...] David Edelstein, writing in New York Magazine, described the film as being [...] "full of promise, with minuscule returns." [...] He concluded that, like Stone's other recent work, it is difficult to distinguish what the project's focus is supposed to be.|$|E
