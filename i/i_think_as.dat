500|$|Graham was {{announced}} as {{cast in the}} role in October 2015. He compared his relationship to Frost to that of Bill and Hillary Clinton, calling them [...] "a power couple" [...] and adding, [...] "I think that Chadwick was probably attracted to her because of her beauty, [...] also a very smart woman, very successful, also probably a Type A. We really strive, both of us <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> a very successful actress and with a very successful business. The world is our oyster. We’re going to make as many pearls as we can." ...|$|E

500|$|As a show, Torchwood {{is highly}} intertextual. The {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} many sides of Jack are shown across various media. One commentator feels that this emphasises Jack's pivotal place in the development and change of modern science fiction heroes. The character's unexpected popularity with a multitude of audiences, would later shape his appearances both as a traditional [...] "action hero" [...] and as a positive role model for younger viewers. Barrowman also remarks that [...] "The beauty of Captain Jack, {{and one of the reasons}} why <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> an actor, I've landed on my feet, is that he's popular with one audience in Torchwood and with another in Doctor Who." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E

500|$|Bob the Sponge is the comic's [...] "announcer". He resembles {{an actual}} sea sponge, {{and at first}} Hillenburg {{continued}} this design because it [...] "was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher." [...] In determining the new character's personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee Herman. He then considered modeling the character after a kitchen sponge, and realized that this idea would match the character's square personality perfectly: [...] "t looked so funny. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> far as cartoon language goes he was easier to recognize. He seemed to fit the character type I was looking fora somewhat nerdy, squeaky clean [...]" [...] To voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now." [...] Dan Castellaneta responded: [...] "I don't agree,... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded {{as it was in the}} first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh." [...] Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as [...] "hogwash", saying [...] "The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now." [...] In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: [...] "I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Since its {{original}} airing, critics have listed [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] {{among the best}} X-Files episodes. TV Guide called it the tenth greatest episode in television history. Review website IGN named it the best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series, writing that the episode [...] " [...] is a distinctive episode of the series, mixing a healthy amount of humor [...] with some very nasty business [...] In just 44 minutes, Boyle creates a fully formed character who makes a big impact in his one and only appearance." [...] Topless Robot named it the ninth-funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the third-best X-Files episode. Charlie Jane Anders and Javier Grillo-Marxuach of io9 included it {{on the list of}} [...] "10 TV Episodes that Changed Television". Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, named the episode the seventh-best installment of the series, noting that it features [...] "a wonderful blend of humor, drama, and pathos, something The X-Files did better than just about any other show this past decade." [...] The cast and crew of the series have expressed their enjoyment of the installment. Duchovny considers [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] to be one of his favorite episodes of the third season. Nutter highlighted it {{as one of the most}} enjoyable entries that he had worked on. He also noted that, [...] "the writing was so tight and so crisp and so fresh that <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> a director, the only thing you have to do is create the atmosphere, set up the characters, set up the shots and you are basically invisible. Then you step back and just let it happen." [...] Series writer and producer Frank Spotnitz stated that the episode worked on many levels and that it is his favorite of the episodes written for the show by Morgan. In 2016, Ira Madison of Vulture.com named it the best episode of the series and [...] "one of the best episodes of television ever", stating that the episode [...] "takes every element that made the series so iconic and throws them all into one heartbreaking installment".|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black." [...] Black's role in the novel also increases significantly, with him {{falling in love with}} Bella and becoming a werewolf, putting the actor in a starring role. Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He gets a lot of attention because he's buff, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I saw him and thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved a lot of credit for the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play as big a role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, and if his character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been as big a hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film, setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic. Lautner won Favorite Breakout Movie Actor at the 35th People's Choice Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Finland's Mika Häkkinen overcame {{some early}} race-day {{adversity}} {{and won the}} second United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis by 11 seconds over newly crowned World Champion and pole-sitter Michael Schumacher before a season-high crowd estimated at 175,000. [...] "This Grand Prix is definitely one of my important victories," [...] Häkkinen said. [...] "Because I rate Monaco, Silverstone and Indianapolis, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> the Grands Prix a Grand Prix driver wants to win. It's something special. So this is something I'm never going to forget." [...] It was the twentieth win of Häkkinen's career, and the last before fulfilling his stated plan to take a year off from racing, which wound up being retirement {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, Cave {{identified}} as a Christian. In his recorded lectures on music and songwriting, he has claimed that any true love song is a song for God and has ascribed the mellowing of his music to a shift in focus from the Old to the New Testaments. He {{does not belong to}} a particular denomination and has distanced himself from [...] "religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked". He said in a Los Angeles Times article: [...] "I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god. It's kind of defending the indefensible, though; I'm critical of what religions are becoming, the more destructive they're becoming. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>as</b> an artist, particularly, it's a necessary part of what I do, that there is some divine element going on within my songs." [...] When asked in 2009 about whether he believed in a personal God, Cave's reply was: [...] "No". When interviewed by Jarvis Cocker on 12 September 2010, for his BBC Radio 6 show [...] "Jarvis Cocker's Sunday Service", Cave stated: [...] "I believe in God in spite of religion, not because of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Rump, power passed temporarily to a council that debated what form the constitution should take. They took up the suggestion of Major-General Thomas Harrison for a [...] "sanhedrin" [...] of saints. Although Cromwell did not subscribe to Harrison's apocalyptic, Fifth Monarchist beliefs—which saw a sanhedrin as the starting point for Christ's rule on earth—he was attracted by the idea of an assembly made up of men chosen for their religious credentials. In his speech {{at the opening of the}} assembly on 4 July 1653, Cromwell thanked God’s providence that he believed had brought England to this point and set out their divine mission: [...] "truly God hath called you to this work by, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>as</b> wonderful providences as ever passed upon the sons of men in so short a time." [...] The Nominated Assembly, sometimes known as the Parliament of Saints, or more commonly and denigratingly called Barebone's Parliament after one of its members, Praise-God Barebone. The assembly was tasked with finding a permanent constitutional and religious settlement (Cromwell was invited to be a member but declined). However, the revelation that a considerably larger segment of the membership than had been believed were the radical Fifth Monarchists led to its members voting to dissolve it on 12 December 1653, out of fear of what the radicals might do if they took control of the Assembly.|$|E
