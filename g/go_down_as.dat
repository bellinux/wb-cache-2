5|$|Starting at 11am on March 14, Thieu {{flew out}} to Cam Ranh for a {{briefing}} with General Phu. The events {{which took place}} after this briefing would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the greatest}} failures in military history. After Phu had outlined the military situation in the Central Highlands, he asked Thieu to bolster the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division with more aircraft and additional brigades to defend Kontum and Pleiku. Thieu refused to send further reinforcements because the South Vietnamese military no longer had the resources. Phu was ordered to move all his units down to the Mekong region where they could continue fighting. General Vien cautioned against moving large military formations down Highway 19; he reminded Thieu of the destruction suffered by the French Mobile Group 100 in the region in 1954. Thieu and his commanders made the decision to use Route 7 instead, in an attempt to surprise the North Vietnamese, who would not expect them to use that road due to its poor condition.|$|E

In addition, in the very long term, the {{demographic transition}} should be reversed via evolutionary pressure for higher fertility and higher mortality.|$|E

25|$|Banks offered 40-year {{mortgages}} and, more recently, 50-year mortgages. While {{some observers}} {{suggest that a}} soft landing will occur, others suggest that a crash in prices is probable. Lower home prices will allow low-income families and young people to enter the market; however, {{there is a strong}} perception that house prices never <b>go</b> <b>down.</b> <b>As</b> of August 2008, while new constructions have come virtually to a halt, prices have not had significant movements, neither up nor downwards. The national average price as of late 2008 is 2,095 euros/m2.|$|E
25|$|Redick set {{a record}} for the most {{consecutive}} free throws made in the ACC with 54. This record began on March 20, 2003 and ended on January 15, 2004. It was broken on January 22, 2012 by Scott Wood from NC State. Redick entered his final post-season {{with a chance to}} <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> the NCAA's all-time leading free-throw shooter. The record, 91.3%, was held at the time by Gary Buchanan of Villanova. In an otherwise triumphant visit to Greensboro Coliseum for the 2006 ACC Tournament and early NCAA Tournament games, Redick struggled at the line, lowering his career free-throw percentage by about 0.5% and finishing his career with 91.16% (660 out of 724).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the team's overall performance, {{the first half of}} the season provided several memorable moments for the players themselves. Highlights included Johnson earning his 300th career victory, becoming the twenty-fourth pitcher in Major League history to do so, as well as struggling starter Jonathan Sánchez tossing a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres on July 10, the first Giants no-hitter since 1976. 2009's pitching staff will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> one of the strongest starting rotations in Giants history– the Giants sent two of their starting pitchers to the All-Star Game, including that year's starter, Tim Lincecum. He went on to win the 2009 NL Cy Young Award, finishing at 15–7. Lincecum became the only pitcher to capture the Cy Young Award in each of his first two full Major League seasons.|$|E

25|$|The 1986 NSWRL Grand Final at the SCG {{between the}} John Monie coached Parramatta and {{defending}} premiers Canterbury-Bankstown, coached by Warren Ryan, and played {{in front of}} one of the smallest Grand Final crowds in years (45,843), would <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> the lowest scoring and only try-less Grand Final in NSWRL history. Parramatta won their 4th premiership in six years with a tough 4–2 win thanks to two Mick Cronin goals to send captain Ray Price, and Cronin, into rugby league retirement on the winning note they deserved after stellar careers for Parramatta, NSW and Australia. Cronin retired from the game having scored 1,971 points in the Sydney premiership (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals, all for Parramatta), at the time the record number of points scored in a career.|$|E
25|$|The playing {{staff was}} {{strengthened}} by the arrivals of J. McLelland, Eric Longden, Jack O'Donnell and Jackie Carr, yet the 1930–31 season must <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} disastrous in the club's history. The players found themselves out of their depth, and proceeded to capitulate to virtually all opposition. In {{the first game of the}} season, Arsenal won 4–1 at Bloomfield Road in front of a crowd of nearly 29,000. The team won the following game four days later, 4–2 at Manchester City, but the remaining nine months of the season proved to be a defensive nightmare. Four goals were conceded on five occasions; five goals four times; six goals twice, seven on three occasions, and finally ten without reply against Huddersfield Town, a result that remains a record victory for the Yorkshiremen, as well as Blackpool's joint-record defeat. All told, the Blackpool back line leaked a First Division record of 125 goals and lost 21 games during a season in which they finished twentieth.|$|E
25|$|Nick Barmby {{marked his}} 500th career {{appearance}} {{against one of}} his former clubs as Middlesbrough visited Hull City for the first ever top-flight match between the two sides. Hull lined up with former Boro captain George Boateng in midfield after his departure during the summer. The previous four league meetings between the two sides had all ended in 0–0 draws, and it looked like the match was heading for another until Tuncay opened the scoring on 79 minutes. Boro's lead didn't last long however, as Bernard Mendy's shot hit the post and rebounded off of goalkeeper Ross Turnbull to <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> an own goal. It got worse for the visitors as just a few minutes later, Hull were awarded a soft penalty when Wheater tangled with Geovanni – a challenge which also saw the Middlesbrough defender receive a red card. TV replays showed that Geovanni was offside when the ball was played to him, but nothing was awarded by the assistant referee. Marlon King converted the penalty to give Hull a 2–1 victory.|$|E

His bad form continued, as he lost to Xavier Malisse in five sets {{in the first round}} of Wimbledon. He was now 9 wins–8 losses since his good run at the South American clay season. Next stop on his tour was the MercedesCup, losing to Albert Montañés for the first time in six meetings in the semifinals, 3–6, 6–7(6–8), despite having two set points in the second set tiebreak. At the German Open, Ferrero defeated Jan Hájek and Jarkko Nieminen, before being upset by Florian Mayer, 7–6(7–3), 2–6, 3–6, for the first time in five meetings. At the Umag Open, Ferrero won his third title of the year, at first struggling against Pablo Cuevas, 4–6, 6–4, 6–4, but cruising through against Alexandr Dolgopolov, Andreas Seppi, and Potito Starace in the final. He then missed the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati Masters due to a knee injury. He returned at the US Open, where he defeated Martin Kližan and Ricardo Mello in straight sets, but lost to Jürgen Melzer 5–7, 3–6, 1–6 in the third round. He missed the rest of the season due to knee and wrist injuries for which he was operated in October.|$|E

Dexter executive producer Clyde Phillips claimed the staff {{did not know}} how Rita would leave until late in the fourth season, but that it began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. Benz was notified the day before the script was distributed to the cast and was disappointed, but found the scene revealing her departure to be [...] "very poetic".

Marcia White of The Express-Times declared Dexter [...] "one of the best cable dramas on TV", and called the final scene between Dexter and Arthur particularly touching. Mark Dawidziak of The Plain Dealer said the episode was shocking and suspenseful, and called Dexter [...] "a series that leaves you guessing as the psychological ambiguities run deeper and darker".|$|E
500|$|The media {{focused on}} Häkkinen {{overtaking}} Michael Schumacher {{for the lead}} on lap 41, and after the race Häkkinen went to Schumacher in the parc fermé and {{told him not to}} make a move like that again.

Derick Allsop of The Independent described the impact the move might have on Häkkinen's career: [...] "Perhaps, he [...] will be recognised as a driver worthy of a place in the pantheon of the sport's heroes." [...] According to McLaren team principal Ron Dennis, [...] "His overtaking manoeuvre I'm sure will <b>go</b> <b>down</b> <b>as</b> one of the greatest in Formula One history", and in February 2001 Häkkinen's move was chosen by more than 60 Formula One historians as the MasterCard Priceless Moment of the 2000 F1 season.|$|E

500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song.

[...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said.

[...] Raziq Rauf writing for the BBC praised the band for the album's musical diversity with its use of electronic songs like album-opener [...] "The Bitter End" [...] and the band's use of technicality and melody in songs.

Scott Lowe of IGN said the song featured an [...] "intriguing jazzy beat layered over pounding bass".
