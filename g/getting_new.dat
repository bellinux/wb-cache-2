25|$|In 1982, {{the first}} reform program was initiated, wherein the {{government}} denationalised {{two of the}} six nationalised commercial banks and permitted private local banks {{to compete in the}} banking sector.

Yet the efficiency of the banking sector could not be improved.|$|E

To boot, Wran had his government foot the bill to install lights good enough for Packer to use. WSC also gained access to Brisbane's Test ground, The Gabba, and were offered use of the Adelaide Oval, which was rejected. Perth and Adelaide were dropped from the itinerary. A strategy of focusing on audiences in Melbourne and Sydney was now in place.|$|E
25|$|Although Helen {{was never}} tried during the McCarthy era, her works {{suffered}} from {{the idea that she}} was a Chinese Communist sympathizer. She often had issues <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> books published and many of her books went out of print. Helen returned to China twice more in her lifetime. The first visit was from 1972 to 1973, following President Richard Nixon's trip in 1972 which eased relations between China and the United States. The second visit was in 1978 when Helen returned to China for six weeks with a camera crew. There she was interviewed and asked to recount her adventures of the 1930s with Edgar. Helen spent {{the rest of her life}} in Connecticut, developing an interest in family genealogy, drafting a novel, and writing short pieces on her experiences in China. She published her autobiography in 1984.|$|E

500|$|In 2011, Cielo {{announced}} {{the creation of}} P.R.O. 16 – the [...] "Going for 2016 Gold" [...] Project. The initiative, designed to serve as Brazilian swimming's [...] "elite squad", gathered Cielo, who would be leading the project, and six other swimmers – André Schultz, Leonardo de Deus, Nicholas Santos, Henrique Rodrigues, Tales Cerdeira and Vinicius Waked – all selected for potential medals in the 2016 Summer Olympics, in Rio de Janeiro. The idea would be to prepare the swimmers also for the main competition in the coming years. For two years, the innovative program, which proposed a system of high level training without relying on the infrastructure of big clubs, worked. But the difficulty of finding sponsors and the change of attitude of the clubs made the training group lose almost all its members. In 2013, Cielo {{was the only one}} left in the project, but highlighted its continuity, with changes in the project, receiving new members and <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> sponsors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} of {{construction}} was to survey the route and determine the locations where large excavations, tunnels and bridges would be needed. Crews could then start work {{in advance of the}} railroad reaching these locations. Supplies and workers were brought up to the work locations by wagon teams and work on several different sections proceeded simultaneously. One advantage of working on tunnels in winter was that tunnel work could often proceed since the work was nearly all [...] "inside". Unfortunately, living quarters would have to be built outside and <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> supplies was difficult. Working and living in winter in the presence of snow slides and avalanches caused some deaths.|$|E

[...] Initially skeptical about the [...] "strong-mayor system", where the mayor holds increased powers relative to other councillors, Miller endorsed a 2005 panel report which gave the mayor additional powers and created a formal city executive. He argued that Toronto needed to restructure itself before <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> powers from the province. [...] Council endorsed the reforms in December 2005.|$|E

In 2008 he returned to TNA after a brief hiatus from a kayfabe coma suffered from multiple ambushes, and tweaked his Shark Boy gimmick into that of a Stone Cold Steve Austin tribute, even going {{as far as to}} drink [...] "Clam Juice" [...] (a reference to Austin's infamous beer drinking) in the ring after his matches. Upon his gimmick change, he would occasionally team up with Curry Man to form a comedic tag team that was a moderate success.

2500|$|Left 4 Dead 2 {{contains}} about 7,800 unique lines of dialogue, a 40% increase over Left 4 Dead. The writers designed {{the characters and}} selected appropriate voice actors who had natural accents for their lines and allowed the actors freedom to help authenticate the roles. They would attend recording sessions for the voice actors {{and allow them to}} ad-lib their lines for their characters, often <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> ideas for character dialogue to be recorded later, particularly in the case of Ellis (voiced by Eric Ladin) and Nick (Hugh Dillon). Randall Newsome, the voice of the boat captain Virgil, was a local actor from Louisiana who naturally spoke Cajun and helped to embellish the role better than the writers could. Faliszek wanted to include a [...] "no-nonsense" [...] woman from a Department of Motor Vehicles, but this character did not make the cut. The developers solicited several bands to include them in the game: Depeche Mode responded eagerly, and allowed Valve to use its music and other imagery in the game, such as on Rochelle's T-shirt.|$|E
2500|$|In {{areas in}} and around Cape Town, netball was a {{favourite}} sport for coloured schools to have {{because it was the}} cheapest one to play. During the 1930s and 1940s, some coloured girls would play rugby. By the time they reached puberty, they were encouraged to start playing a more feminine game such as netball. Rates of sport participation were higher amongst non-Muslim coloured children than amongst Muslim coloured children. In 1940, the Bantu Inter-schools League in Johannesburg had 145 netball teams that shared ten courts. At the time, only 6.6% of black South African students attended school, so their participation in this netball league was small. [...] Issues like hunger and inadequate housing coupled with lack of facilities and the distance to get to them discouraged young black South African girls from playing the sport. Secondary issues for black South African women regarding netball arose because of gender struggles in the black South African community; coloured men controlled most aspects of sport for coloured women, who were dependent on them for getting to use existing sport facilities or <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> facilities built. Despite these issues during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, some dedicated sportswomen worked hard for their sport by organising local leagues and inter-provisional competitions.|$|E
2500|$|While {{freedom of}} {{religion}} is guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution, according to Human Rights Watch, [...] "Egyptians are able to convert to Islam generally without difficulty, but Muslims who convert to Christianity face difficulties in <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> identity papers and some have been arrested for allegedly forging such documents. The Coptic community, however, takes pains to prevent conversions from Christianity to Islam due to {{the ease with which}} Christians can often become Muslim. Public officials, being conservative themselves, intensify the complexity of the legal procedures required to recognize the religion change as required by law. Security agencies will sometimes claim that such conversions from Islam to Christianity (or occasionally vice versa) may stir social unrest, and thereby justify themselves in wrongfully detaining the subjects, insisting that they are simply taking steps to prevent likely social troubles from happening. In 2007, a Cairo administrative court denied 45 citizens the right to obtain identity papers documenting their reversion to Christianity after converting to Islam. However, in February 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the decision, allowing 12 citizens who had reverted to Christianity to re-list their religion on identity cards, but they will specify that they had adopted Islam for a brief period of time.|$|E

2500|$|Vidkun Quisling proclaimed himself prime {{minister}} and appointed a government with members from the National Unity Party. He was quickly set aside and replaced by Josef Terboven, but reinstated in 1942. The Norwegian Campaign continued in Northern Norway and the government fled to London on 7 June. The German occupation resulted in a brutalization of society and 30,000 people were imprisoned. 55,000 people joined the National Unity Party, which became the only legal party. But the nazification process failed after the Supreme Court resigned and both organized sports and bishops boycotted the new regime. A resistance movement was established and became coordinate from London from 1943. Stokker reports that hostile humour against the Germans helped maintain morale and build a wall against collaboration. Jokes made the rounds dripping with contempt for the oppressors, ridicule of Nazi ideology, stressing the cruelty of the Nazis and mocking their inflated self-image. People on the street asked, [...] "Do you {{know the difference between}} the Nazis and a bucket of manure? The bucket." [...] In Post Office lines they explained, [...] "It's rumored that we're <b>getting</b> <b>new</b> stamps bearing Quisling's likeness, but distribution has been delayed because no one knows which side to spit on." [...] The jokes worked to educate Norwegians about the occupation, and encourage a sense of solidarity.
