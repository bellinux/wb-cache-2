50|$|The museum's {{collection}} comprises {{more than}} sixty vehicles from all periods of history, diverse countries of origin and different technologies, including 28 steam locomotives from the late 19th century {{and a copy of}} the first steam locomotive used in the Iberian Peninsula, still used in demonstrations on the first Sunday of the month. The collection also includes diesel and electric locomotives, coaches, a Bogie type Harlan, a signal bridge, and an original <b>interlocking</b> <b>lever</b> frame table used in the Barcelona central railway station.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 15 January 1873 by the East Gloucestershire Railway. It was a simple, single-platform station, built of honey-coloured local Cotswold stone which {{reflected}} {{the architecture of}} the nearby villages. It had a goods shed served by a single siding. By the late 1920s, a signalbox and a loading dock had been added. The signalbox was a standard Great Western model with 17 levers and the only one on the line to have track-circuiting installed. The goods yard contained a loop to allow trains to run-around but this was not signalled for use by passing trains. In 1933, a ground frame locked by an electric <b>interlocking</b> <b>lever</b> from the signal box was installed at the eastern entrance to the loop and a new inner home signal was erected. It was not until the Second World War, when the line was busy with traffic for RAF Fairford, that the Great Western Railway signalled and lengthened the loop to allow two goods trains or one passenger train and one goods service to cross. A second goods siding was also added by October 1944, by which time the ground frame had been removed.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{originally}} six signal boxes {{on the first}} section of the line to open (Hythe to New Romney). All were equipped with Greenly designed fully <b>interlocked</b> <b>lever</b> frames constructed by Jackson Rigby Ltd at New Romney. These were: ...|$|R
50|$|An Interlocking {{machine room}} (IMR) is a {{component}} of the London Underground signalling system. Generally found at platform ends, the rooms consist of pneumatically controlled mechanically and electrically <b>interlocked</b> <b>levers</b> mounted horizontally in an upright lever-frame. It is used to control points and signals.|$|R
50|$|The {{superstructure}} of {{the bridge}} was manufactured by the Phoenix Bridge Company. It consists of a 78 ft plate girder from the southwest bank to a fixed pier, and a 158 ft fishbelly girder from that pier to the northeast bank, turning on the pivot pier. It carries three tracks. Two buildings were erected on the bridge, one for a watchman and the signal levers that protected and operated the bridge, and one to house the gasoline engine that turned it. The <b>interlocking</b> <b>levers</b> on the swing bridge were placed in service on March 4, 1906; {{this was the first}} electro-mechanical <b>interlocking</b> using small <b>levers</b> (rather than the rod-linked armstrong levers typical at the time) on the Pennsylvania Railroad system.|$|R
50|$|The inventors of the hydro-pneumatic system {{moved forward}} to an {{electro-pneumatic}} system in 1891 and this system, best {{identified with the}} Union Switch & Signal Company, was first installed on the Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad at its drawbridge across the Chicago River. By 1900, 54 electro-pneumatic interlocking plants, controlling a total of 1,864 <b>interlocking</b> <b>levers,</b> were in use on 13 North American railroads. This type of system would remain one of two viable competing systems into the future, although it did have the disadvantage of needing extra single-use equipment and requiring high maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the west}} side of the rail via tunnel, four tracks converged into three, and then into two tracks to pass over the Hackensack Drawbridge. By 1913 the rail line, {{including}} the bridges across the rivers, was raised about 30 ft to avoid conflicts with maritime traffic in the newly developing port [...] The draw span of the PD Draw over the Passaic had been relocated 185 ft upstream to create another bridge on a new alignment in 1912.By 1922, plans were made to improve the drawbridge's railway signal layout, increasing the number of <b>interlocking</b> <b>levers,</b> ground signals and bridge signals. The drawbridge tower employed three levermen.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} designs used various ingenious and patented {{methods to}} <b>interlock</b> the <b>levers.</b> Stevens & Sons invented a tappet system that later became almost universal but didn't renew their patent {{so that this}} system was adopted by many other manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Levers work points (aka switch) {{by means}} of cast iron rods and signals {{by means of}} metal cables, the frame itself is very {{complicated}} in that it employs a series of horizontal moving locking bars in order to <b>interlock</b> different <b>levers</b> making it impossible to, for instance, signal a train to run over a point set the wrong way.|$|R
50|$|Large levers on {{the signal}} frame enabled {{operators}} to manually move points, signals or crossing gates. The earliest designs used various ingenious and patented methods to <b>interlock</b> the <b>levers.</b> In later electro-mechanical interlocking, where the points and signals were moved by electricity or electro-pneumatically, the signal frames had much smaller <b>levers.</b> Every <b>interlocking</b> installation is individual and {{unique to the}} location controlled, and the location and configuration of signal frames at a particular train station may vary over time, as needs change.|$|R
5000|$|His {{intricate}} {{images have}} been described as [...] "doodle-bombs" [...] for their free-association of links between various ideas, people and institutions. Age journalist Martin Flanagan wrote that Petty [...] "re-invented the world as a vast scribbly machine with <b>interlocking</b> cogs and <b>levers</b> that connected people in wholly logical but unlikely ways." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} the station building was awarded in 1889, for Â£1809/8/11. A 45 <b>lever</b> <b>interlocking</b> frame, in a signal box, was brought into use in 1890. By this time, the station had a main platform, with a dock platform at the eastern end, a main line and crossing loop, turntable, and a number of sidings. The station was originally provided with a 53 ft turntable. In 1957, it was replaced by a 70-foot unit.|$|R
50|$|Jointly {{constructed}} from 1902 to an enlarged standard LNWR design of 1876, the three storey structure is built of two storeys of red brick and cement, {{with a third}} floor mainly of wooden weather board pin-panel containing the glass windows, all topped by a Welsh slate pitched roof. Access is via a door on the rear, with the lower two floors housing interlocking signalling equipment accessed via two internal wooden staircases. The main operational floor houses a 180 <b>lever</b> <b>interlocked</b> frame, divided into two sections: Abbey Foregate to Sutton Bridge; Shrewsbury station to Crewe Junction.|$|R
