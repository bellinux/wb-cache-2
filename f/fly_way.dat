And I'd fly in the daytime, because there is more going on then. I wonder, now, why it is that Flitter never comes out until after jolly, round, red Mr. Sun has gone to bed behind the Purple Hills. I never see him in the daytime, and I don't even know where he keeps himself. I never thought of it before, but I wonder why it is that he flies only at night. I believe I'll ask Grandfather Frog the very next time I see him." ...|$|E

The airline from Suriname took delivery of PH-KZV (msn 11556) and PH-WXA (11570) in 2014. KLM Cityhopper Fokker 70 PH-KZV was withdrawn from service at Norwich on January 5, 2014 after arriving as KL1515 from Amsterdam, KLM Cityhopper Fokker 70 PH-WXA was withdrawn from service at Amsterdam {{in the morning of}} March 30, 2014 after arriving as KL1486 from Humberside. The aircraft then positioned Amsterdam - Norwich for maintenance early the same afternoon as KL9955 where both aircraft were being prepared for service. The aircraft have subsequently been sold to <b>Fly</b> All <b>Ways,</b> by then a new independent start up airline offering transport to regional destinations. On November 20, 2014 the first aircraft (PH-WXA) landed at the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport of Suriname in <b>Fly</b> All <b>Ways</b> colours. One month later the second <b>Fly</b> All <b>Ways</b> aircraft (PH-KZV) arrived in Suriname. These two are now registered as PZ-TFA & PZ-TFB in Suriname and stationed at the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport where a new hangar was built.|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} October, the {{population}} of monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains migrates to the sanctuaries of the Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve within the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests in the Mexican states of Michoacán and México. They also overwinter {{in areas that are}} privately owned. Some monarchs migrate to other locations such as Cuba and Florida in the fall. Two migratory <b>fly</b> <b>ways</b> exist through North America. One in the Central states leads to the Mexican overwintering areas and a smaller flyway along the eastern North American seaboard. The timing of the eastern flyway lags behind the more central flyway. Monarchs migrating along the coast are less likely of being recovered in Mexico. This suggests that butterflies migrating along the eastern seaboard are migrating to locations other than Mexico, or they have a higher rate of mortality than those migrating inland.|$|R
