5|$|Mansur reached Byzantine-held Antioch {{two days}} after his flight, and Basil II ordered the catepan of that city {{to give him an}} honorable reception; {{providing}} refuge to former rulers of Aleppo was a common Byzantine practice because such ex-rulers could be used to pressure or threaten their successors.

5|$|The Boeotian {{school of}} epic poetry was chiefly {{concerned}} with the genealogies of the gods and heroes; later writers elaborated this web. Several other myths are attached to Orion in this way: A papyrus fragment of the Boeotian poet Corinna gives Orion fifty sons (a traditional number). This included the oracular hero Acraephen, who, she sings, gave a response to Asopus regarding Asopus' <b>daughters</b> <b>who</b> were abducted by the gods. Corinna sang of Orion conquering and naming all {{the land of the}} dawn. Bowra argues that Orion was believed to have delivered oracles as well, probably at a different shrine. Hyginus says that Hylas's mother was Menodice, daughter of Orion. Another mythographer, Liberalis, tells of Menippe and Metioche, daughters of Orion, who sacrificed themselves for their country's good and were transformed into comets.|$|E

He held two offices in the royal household as well as performing other administrative duties for the king. During the Becket controversy (lasting until Becket's death in 1170) between King Henry and Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, de Broc supported the king and was granted the administration of the exiled archbishop's lands during the later half of the 1160s. This earned de Broc three sentences of excommunication from the archbishop because of de Broc's financial exactions from the estates. De Broc was with the four men who murdered Becket in December 1170, although he did not take part in the actual murder.

5|$|The king visited Hanover {{again from}} May to November 1719. Instead of {{appointing}} George to the guardianship, {{he established a}} regency council. In 1720, Walpole encouraged the king and his son to reconcile, {{for the sake of}} public unity, which they did half-heartedly. Walpole and Townshend returned to political office, and rejoined the ministry. George was soon disillusioned with the terms of the reconciliation; his three <b>daughters</b> <b>who</b> were in the care of the king were not returned and he was still barred from becoming regent during the king's absences. He came to believe that Walpole had tricked him into the rapprochement as part of a scheme to regain power. Over the next few years, he and Caroline lived quietly, avoiding overt political activity. They had three more children: William, Mary and Louisa, who were brought up at Leicester House and Richmond Lodge, George's summer residence.|$|E
