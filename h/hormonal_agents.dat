Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
25|$|Puberty occurs {{through a}} long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of {{physical}} changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of <b>hormonal</b> <b>agents</b> into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them {{into a state of}} rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.|$|E

40|$|CLASSIFICATION: <b>hormonal</b> <b>agent</b> Special {{pediatric}} {{considerations are}} noted when applicable, otherwise adult provisions apply. MECHANISM OF ACTION: Buserelin is a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist. It is a synthetic analog of LHRH (also known as gonadotropin releasing hormone [GnRH]). 1 LHRH agonists (LHRHa) initially stimulate {{the release of}} luteinizing hormone (LH, gonadotropin), resulting in a transient elevation in serum androgen in men and serum estradiol in women. However, chronic administration can cause down-regulation of the LHRH receptors, thus inhibiting the secretion of LH and ultimately the sex hormones (androgen, estradiol). By decreasing the testicular production of androgen in men, LHRHa can inhibit the growth of androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Similarly, LHRHa reduce the ovarian secretion of estradiol and progesterone in women, 2 leading to inhibition of estrogen-dependent cancers. In men, LHRHa can reduce serum androgen to castrate level about 21 days after initiation of therapy. Similarly, serum estradiol level is suppressed in women around 4 weeks after initiation of treatment. LHRHa are 50 - 100 times more potent than LHRH. 3 In addition, they have a longer duration of action due to increased receptor affinity and greater biological stability. PHARMACOKINETICS...|$|R

For this purpose, procedures for concentration and fractionation of plasma and urine samples and a sensi-tive bioassay for demonstrating changes in renal sodium excretion were developed. The natriuretic assay utilized rats with mild diabetes insipidus which were maintained in salt and water balance. Using these approaches a natriuretic humoral sub-stance was demonstrated in plasma and urine from nor-mal man and sheep, and in patients with primary al-dosteronism or essential hypertension. It seems likely that this substance participates in day to day regulation of sodium balance because it was not detectable in sodium-depleted subjects and it con-sistently appeared in the sodium-loaded subjects. The <b>hormonal</b> <b>agent</b> may not act immediately and its activity can be apparent for up to 3 hr.
