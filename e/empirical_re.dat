40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the Information Technology {{industry}} has become ever {{more interested in}} evaluating Requirements Engineering (RE) approaches, techniques and tools and comparing their usefulness, effectiveness and utility in specific practical contexts. The increasing interest in empirical evaluation resulted in {{a growing number of}} industry-university collaborations in the RE community, that have been instrumental to generating empirical data through experiments, surveys, case studies, and action research studies. As empirical studies are recognized as indispensable and valuable ways to assess the actual benefits and cost of applying the RE methods and tools proposed in the RE community, the conversation on adopting systematic research methods and evaluation practices intensified. The overall objective of the EmpiRE workshop series at the annual RE conference is to increase the cross-fertilization of Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) methods and RE by actively encouraging the exchange of knowledge and ideas between the communities of ESE and RE. Since its launch at RE’ 11 in Trento, the EmpiRE workshop has been serving as the platform promoting the use of new evaluation techniques from ESE in the area of RE as well as the discussion on new domains and problems in RE where involving ESE will make a great difference. Some outcomes of the past editions of EmpiRE include the identification of open research problems and the possible solutions to these problems regarding: (i) the aspects of RE approaches that can be evaluated; (ii) the factors, criteria, and metrics that are appropriate for empirical evaluation purposes; (iii) the replication of <b>empirical</b> <b>RE</b> studies; (iv) the role of the users’ perspectives in <b>empirical</b> <b>RE...</b>|$|E

This theory posits that the attitude of any individual converges overtime on the arithmetic mean of the attitude-pertinent information received by the individual.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate high school students' (n= 36) understanding of the concept of variable in computer programming and in algebraic context. High school juniors at a large private high school who had completed Algebra I and a computer literacy course were given the Algebra-Computer-English (ACE) Translation Test. The results of this study indicate that high school students with experience in both algebra and computer programming could work with variables in a computer context better than in an algebraic context. When given parallel items in both a computer program and algebraic context, their correct responses were not uniformly distributed. They were better able to translate to English the variables in the computer program than in the algebraic equation. A list of 30 references is included. An appendix includes the ACE Translation Test.

Someone who enters elderly, they have been experiencing impairment in the functions of cognitive, physical, and psychological. So that require attention, comfort, and affection of the family. Elderly not received get support family, in her life make elderly tend to shut off and are unhappy. Samples of this study were 100 elderly people in the village Luwang, District Gatak, Sukoharjo. The sample collection technique on this research using purposive of sampling with the characteristics of the sample as follows: a). Residing in the village Luwang, b). Staying with family (such as: parents, husband/wife, son, grandson, or brother), c). Older than 60 years. The methodology used is quantitative methods using the measure scale of happiness (Oxford Happiness Quesionnaire) and scale of support family and analysis techniques used is a correlation product moment of pearson. Based on the results obtained by analysis of the correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 691 and sg.

Many factors influence happiness. This study aims to determine the relationship between religiosity and happiness in adolescents, the level of religiosity in adolescents, the level of happiness in adolescents, and effective contribution to the happiness of religiosity in adolescents. Researchers chose quantitative methods to achieve the objectives of this research. Subjects in this study were Siwa class XI and XII SMA Muhammadiyah 1 Klaten which consists of four classes, namely class XI IPA 3 IPA first XI, XII IPS 1, and XII IPS 2 totaling 75 people.

40|$|Context and Motivation: Based on {{published}} {{output in}} the premium RE conferences and journals, we observe {{a growing body}} of research using both quantitative and qualitative research methods to help understand which RE technique, process or tool work better in which context. Also, more and more empirical studies in RE aim at comparing and evaluating alternative techniques that are solutions to common problems. However, until now there have been few meta studies of the current state of knowledge about common practices carried out by researchers and practitioners in <b>empirical</b> <b>RE.</b> Also, surprisingly little has been published on how RE researchers perceive the usefulness of these best practices. Objective: The goal of our study is to improve our understanding of what empirical practices are performed by researchers and practitioners in RE, for the purpose of understanding the extent to which the research methods of empirical software engineering are adopted in the RE community. Method: We surveyed the practices that participants of the REFSQ conference have been using in their empirical research projects. The survey was part of the REFSQ 2012 Empirical Track. Conclusions: We found that there are 15 commonly used practices out of a set of 27. The study has two implications: first it presents a list of practices that are commonly used in the RE community, and a list of practices that still remain to be practiced. Researchers may now make an informed decision on how to extend the practices they use in producing and executing their research designs, so that their designs get better. Second, we found that senior researchers and PhD students do not always converge in their perceptions about the usefulness of research practices. Whether this is all right and whether something needs to be done in the face of this finding remains an open question...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a firm’s {{decision}} to retain or fire a poorly per-forming CEO when the CEO’s choice of strategy has long-term cash flow implications beyond the CEO’s tenure (he leaves behind a legacy). Re-placing a CEO becomes expensive and entrenchment emerges, because the firm’s future performance can only partially {{be attributed to}} a newly em-ployed manager. This makes it more expensive to provide incentives to a new manager. Moreover, when the firm chooses to change its strategy it will optimally do so with a different manager, because the incumbent has a vested interest in seeing the new strategy fail: Failure improves the in-cumbent’s reputation because it is regarded as a vindication of his original choice. Changing strategy, however, is costly, because of the high explicit wages that a new manager needs to be paid. Firms therefore exhibit inertia in their adoption of new strategies. We thus endogenise the link between CEO turnover and strategy changes. We derive <b>empirical</b> implications <b>re...</b>|$|R
