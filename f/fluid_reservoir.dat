5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
25|$|A few {{suspension}} refinements {{were made}} for 1964. The front coil springs were changed from constant-rate to progressive or variable-rate and were more tightly wound at the top, while leaf thickness of the rear transverse spring was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling. Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end. The 1964 Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> a small bag of Freon gas that absorbed heat. Chevy added more sound insulation and revised body and transmission mounts for the 1964 Corvette. It also fitted additional bushings to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever. The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation.|$|E
2500|$|Adapters are {{available}} to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of rim brake. Some brake levers have adjustable leverage {{that can be made}} to work with either type of brake. Others vary their mechanical advantage as the lever moves to move the pad quickly at first, then provide more leverage once it contact the brake surface. Hydraulic brake levers move a piston in a <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir.</b> [...] The mechanical advantage of the lever depends on the brake system design.|$|E
30|$|In {{the coding}} of {{vertical}} and horizontal fractures, three different types of fracture fluids have been coded in the system which are viscosity controlled <b>fluids,</b> <b>reservoir</b> controlled <b>fluids</b> and wall-building fluids. Viscosity controlled fluids comprise of viscous or semi-viscous fracture fluids; <b>reservoir</b> controlled <b>fluids</b> consist of fracturing fluids with low viscosity and high fluid loss characteristic, while wall-building fluids build a temporary filter cake. The user can select either viscosity controlled <b>fluids,</b> <b>reservoir</b> controlled <b>fluids</b> or wall-building fluids as the fracture fluids type to be used.|$|R

2500|$|Hydraulic {{disc brakes}} {{make use of}} two common forms of fluid. Automotive grade DOT 4 or DOT 5.1 which are {{hygroscopic}} and has a boiling point of 230°C, and mineral oil which is not hygroscopic and has varying boiling points depending on the type. O-rings and seals inside the brake are specifically designed to work with {{one or the other}} fluid. Using the incorrect fluid type will cause the seals to fail resulting in a [...] "squishy" [...] feeling in the lever, and the caliper pistons are unable to retract, so a scraping disc is common. The brake <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> is usually marked to indicate the type of brake fluid to be used.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} power steering rack with a 14.3:1 gear ratio is used. The front suspension utilizes a double-wishbone arrangement {{and there is a}} multi-link arrangement at the rear with coil-over dampers at all wheels. The dampers are a monotube design, each with a remote <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> that includes an expanding and contracting bellows: a purely mechanical system. The LFA further features six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo monobloc brake calipers with [...] front and [...] rear carbon ceramic discs controlled by Toyota's Electronically Controlled Brake brake-by-wire system. Forged 20-inch BBS wheels fitted with [...] front and [...] rear Bridgestone next-generation Potenza tires are standard. The LFA is equipped with a three-mode Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) stability control system with Sport setting.|$|E
2500|$|To {{maintain}} a near ideal weight distribution, a rear transaxle is used, {{in addition to}} the mounting of the fuel tank ahead of the rear axle and the radiators at the rear. The windshield washer <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> is mounted in the center next to the fuel tank to improve further the center of weight. Overall 48% of the LFA's mass is distributed along the front wheels with 52% at the rear. The [...] fuel tank straddles the exhaust system keeping weight centered along the left-right axis. The engine is connected to the transaxle via a rigid carbon-fiber torque tube which the exhaust system runs directly below. This stacked driveshaft and exhaust arrangement decreases the width of the center tunnel allowing for centrally located seating.|$|E

40|$|Fractures {{generated}} by internal fluid pressure, for example, dykes, mineral veins, many joints and man-made hydraulic fractures, {{are referred to}} as hydrofractures. Together with shear fractures, they contribute significantly to the permeability of <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoirs</b> such as those of petroleum, geothermal water, and groundwater. Analytical and numerical models show that – in homogeneous host rocks – any significant overpressure in hydrofractures theoretically generates very high crack tip tensile stresses. Consequently, overpressured hydrofractures should propagate and help to form interconnected fracture systems that would then contribute to the permeability of <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Field observations, however, show that in heterogeneous and anisotropic, e. g., layered, rocks many hydrofractures become arrested or offset at layer contacts and do not form vertically interconnected networks. The most important factors that contribute to hydrofracture arrest are discontinuities (including contacts), stiffness changes between layers, and stress barriers, where the local stress field is unfavourable to hydrofracture propagation. A necessary condition for a hydrofracture to propagate to the surface is that the stress field along its potential path is everywhere favourable to extension-fracture formation so that the probability of hydrofracture arrest is minimised. Mechanical layering and the resulting heterogeneous stress field largely control whether evolving hydrofractures become confined to single layers (strata&# 172;bound frac&# 172;tures) or not (non-stratabound fractures) and, there&# 172;fore, if a vertically intercon&# 172;nec&# 172;ted fracture system forms. Non-stratabound hydrofractures may propagate through many layers and generate interconnected fracture systems. Such systems commonly reach the percolation threshold and largely control the overall permeability of the <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoirs</b> within which they develop...|$|R
2500|$|The F414 {{uses the}} core of the F412 and its full-authority digital engine control (FADEC), {{alongside}} the low-pressure system from the YF120 engine developed for the Advanced Tactical Fighter competition. One of the major differences between the F404 and the F414 is the fan section. The fan of the F414 is larger than that of the F404, but smaller than the fan for the F412. The larger fan section increases airflow mass by 16% and is [...] longer. To keep the engine in the F404's footprint, the afterburner section was shortened by [...] and the combustor shortened by [...] Another change from the F404 {{is the fact that the}} first three stages of the high-pressure compressor are blisks rather than dovetailed blades, saving [...] in weight. Furthermore, the FADEC guided F414 uses a fuel actuated [...] "fueldraulic" [...] system to manipulate the convergent-divergent nozzle in the afterburner section, which is a system which uses fuel from the aircraft's fuel system as hydraulic fluid, rather than relying on a separate hydraulic system with its associated <b>fluid</b> <b>reservoir</b> ("fueldraulic" [...] systems have become popular in applications such as this, and even in more major systems in some cases).|$|E
