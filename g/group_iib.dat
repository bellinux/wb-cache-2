40|$|The {{synthesis}} of the major chloroplast membrane polypeptides has been studied during synchronous growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Under these conditions, chlorophyll is synthesized during {{the latter part of}} the light period and cell division takes place during the dark period. The profile of the chloroplast membrane polypeptides of C. reinhardtii has been well characterized and shown to contain two major classes by size (Hoober, J. 1970. J. Biol. Chem. 245 : 4327). Polypeptides of group I have a mol wt range of 50, 000 – 55, 000 daltons. The second region consists of at least three polypeptide <b>groups,</b> IIa, <b>IIb,</b> and IIc, having mol wt of 40, 000, 31, 000, and 27, 000 daltons, respectively. The {{synthesis of}} these polypeptides has been measured using a double-labeling technique and a computer-aided statistical analysis. The rate of labeling of group I polypeptides is highest during the early light period and decreases after 6 h of growth. Group IIa is labeled from the beginning of the light period, but little synthesis of IIb occurs before 3 h, and significant amounts of label are not found in IIc before 5 h of growth. After approximately 8 h of light, <b>groups</b> <b>IIb</b> and IIc are synthesized at rates significantly greater than those of the other membrane polypeptides.

40|$|The {{classification}} of stripped-envelope supernovae (SE-SNe) is revisited using modern data-sets. Spectra are analysed using an empirical method to "blindly" categorise SNe according to spectral feature strength and appearance. This method makes {{a clear distinction}} between SNe that are He-rich (IIb/Ib) and He-poor (Ic) and further analysis is performed on each subgroup. For He-rich SNe the presence of H becomes the focus. The strength, velocity, and ratio between absorption and emission of Hα is measured, along with additional analysis of He I lines, in order to categorise the SNe. The He-poor SNe are ordered according to the number of absorption features N present in the spectra, which {{is a measure of the}} degree of line blending. The kinetic energy per unit mass E_k/M_ej is strongly affected by mass at high velocity and such situations principally occur when the outer density profile of the ejecta is shallow, leading to the blending of lines. Using the results, the existing SE-SN taxonomic scheme is adapted. He-rich SNe are split into four <b>groups,</b> <b>IIb,</b> IIb(I), Ib(II), and Ib, which represent H-rich to H-poor SNe. The SNe Ic category of broad-lined Ic (Ic-BL) is abandoned in favour of quantifying the line blending via before peak. To better reflect the physical parameters of the explosions, the velocity of Si II at peak and the half-luminosity decay time t_+ 1 / 2 are included to give SNe Ic a designation of Ic-(v_p,SiII/t_+ 1 / 2).

Unlike the <b>group</b> <b>IIB</b> introns, aI 1 is inactive in 10 mM Mg 2 + (including spermidine) and requires much higher levels of Mg 2 + and added salts (1 M NH 4 Cl or KCl or 2 M (NH 4) 2 SO 4) for ready detection of splicing activity. In KCl-stimulated reactions, splicing occurs with little normal branch formation; a post-splicing reaction of linear excised intron RNA that forms shorter lariat RNAs with branches at cryptic sites was evident in those samples.

Patients and methodsFrom the SEER-database we retrieved gastric cancer patients with a primary adenocarcinoma, of Caucasian or Asian ethnicity and without distant metastases (M 0). The pTNM-stage was determined according to the 7 th edition of the union internationale contre le cancer (UICC) guidelines. ResultsSpanning the period 2004 – 2010, 6136 patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria including 3424 (55. 8 %) men, 2712 (44. 2 %) women, 4629 (75. 4 %) Caucasian and 1507 (24. 6 %) Asian patients. 1524 (24. 8 %) patients underwent total gastrectomy and 4612 (75. 2 %) non-total gastrectomy. Only in 41. 2 % of the patients were > 15 lymph nodes resected. 1857 (31. 0 %) patients received radiotherapy. Patient survival depended on ethnicity, type of surgery and radiotherapy. The discriminating value of the UICC-stage grouping could not be validated for Caucasian patients with > 15 lymph nodes resected and who had not received radiotherapy: stage <b>groups</b> <b>IIB,</b> IIIA, IIIB and IIIC showed substantial overlap in survival ranges.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{indicate}} the patients treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer in which hysteroscopy with biopsy should be considered mandatory. 414 breast cancer patients who underwent hysteroscopy with bioptic evaluation were enrolled in the study. 334 subjects were treated with 20 mg of tamoxifen daily as adjuvant therapy for six up to a hundred months. Of the remaining 80 control patients, which had not received tamoxifen, 30 were in premenopause (Group IA) and 50, in postmenopause (Group IIA). The tamoxifen-treated patients were subdivided in premenopausal (Group IB = 72 patients) and in postmenopausal (<b>Group</b> <b>IIB</b> = 262 patients) groups. All patients were further classified in asymptomatic or symptomatic groups considering whether uterine bleeding was absent or present. The evaluation of the endometrial mucosa was performed by office hysteroscopy. In <b>group</b> <b>IIB</b> patients presenting uterine bleeding, malignant lesions were found in 7. 8 % of the cases. The incidence of premalignant and malignant lesions in IIB patients treated for longer than 3 years (11. 7 %) was higher than that observed in IIB patients treated for less than 3 years (1. 3 %). There was a significant difference in terms of endometrial pathology between <b>Group</b> <b>IIB</b> (32. 8 %) and Group IIA (8 %) (p < 0. 001); and between <b>Group</b> <b>IIB</b> (32. 8 %) and Group IB (13. 9 %) women (p = 0. 003).

In conclusion the hysteroscopy with biopsy should be considered the first diagnostic procedure to perform in tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal patients presenting uterine bleeding and in postmenopausal women treated for longer than 3 years.

Group I was fed a sucrose diet throughout the experiment (66 h) while group II was fasted. Forty-two hours after the start of the experiment, each group was divided into two subgroups (N = 12 each). Subgroup A received a placebo and subgroup B was given acetaminophen (1 g/kg). Twenty-four hours later, the GE of the three test meals was assessed and blood samples were collected to measure the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and acetaminophen. In group IB, the mean AST and ALT values were 515 and 263 IU/l, respectively, while for <b>group</b> <b>IIB</b> they were 4014 and 2472 IU/l, respectively. The mean serum acetaminophen levels were higher in <b>group</b> <b>IIB</b> (120 µg/ml) than in group IB (87 µg/ml). The gastric retention values were significantly higher in <b>group</b> <b>IIB</b> than in group IIA for all three test meals: saline, 51 vs 35 %; glucose, 52 vs 38 % and mayonnaise, 51 vs 29 % (median values).

METHODS: One hundred and twenty five rats were distributed into the following groups: I, IIA, IIB, III, K, L M N, X, XI, XII and XIII. Groups I to X received BBN in drinking water for 14 weeks (wks). Group I was treated with intragastric (ig) propolis at 150 mg/kg body weight, for 44 wks, beginning 30 days before start of BBN. Groups IIA and III were treated with propolis (150 mg/kg), for 40 wks, subcutaneous (sc) and ig, respectively, beginning simultaneously with BBN. On the 32 nd wk, the animals of groups L, M and N were treated ig with L-lysine (300 mg/kg), celecoxib (30 mg/kg) and propolis (300 mg/kg), respectively, up to the 40 th wk.
