50|$|During the Second World War, {{the town}} became a {{secondary}} target for German bombers which {{failed to make}} their primary target elsewhere. On the afternoon of Friday 9 July 1943, a Luftwaffe bomber became separated from its squadron, followed the main railway line and circled the town twice, then dropped seven bombs. Two bombs, one with a <b>delayed-action</b> <b>fuse,</b> fell on the Whitehall Theatre, a cinema on the London Road, where 184 people at the matinée show were watching a Hopalong Cassidy film before the main feature. A total of 108 {{people were killed in}} the raid, including children in the cinema, many of whom were evacuees; and some twenty Canadian servicemen stationed locally, who were either in the cinema when it was hit, or arrived minutes later to help with rescuing survivors. This was the largest loss of life of any single air raid in Sussex.|$|E
50|$|On 14 October 1940 at Chapel Street, Coventry, Second Lieutenant Campbell {{along with}} Sergeant Michael Gibson and Sappers W. Gibson, R. Gilchrest, A. Plumb, R.W. Skelton and Driver E.F.G. Taylor were tasked {{to deal with}} a 250 kg unexploded bomb. The sappers spent almost four days {{uncovering}} the bomb which was found to contain a very damaged <b>delayed-action</b> <b>fuse</b> mechanism which could not be removed in situ. Though any electrical charge within the fuse was thought to have dissipated, Campbell still applied a discharge tool. On the 17 October 1940, Campbell, believing the bomb to be inert ordered it to be moved. It was loaded onto a lorry and taken to Whitley Common where it could be detonated safely. Campbell positioned himself next to the bomb on this journey listening for any timer mechanism that might have been activated by the bomb's removal. The bomb was remotely detonated.|$|E
50|$|Away {{from his}} medical work, Cerletti is {{credited}} with introducing the idea of white uniforms for alpine troops {{in order to reduce}} visibility during the First World War. He also invented artillery missiles with <b>delayed-action</b> <b>fuses.</b> These were used by the Italian and French armies in order to create mine fields between enemy positions.|$|R
5|$|There were 36 Commando raids {{targeted}} against France between 1940–1944, mostly small affairs involving between 10 and 25 men. Some of {{the larger}} raids involved one or more commando units. In March 1942, No. 2 Commando plus demolition experts from seven other Commando units took part in Operation Chariot, {{also known as the}} St. Nazaire Raid. The destroyer HMS Campbeltown, accompanied by 18 smaller ships, sailed into St. Nazaire where Campbeltown was rammed directly into the Normandie dock gates. The Commandos engaged the German forces and destroyed the dock facilities. Eight hours later, <b>delayed-action</b> <b>fuses</b> set off the explosives in the Campbeltown, which wrecked the dock gates and killed some 360 Germans and French. A total of 611 soldiers and sailors took part in Chariot; 169 were killed and 200 (most wounded) taken prisoner. Only 242 men returned. Of the 241 Commandos who took part 64 were killed or missing and 109 captured. Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman and Sergeant Thomas Durrant of the Commandos, plus three members of the Royal Navy, were awarded the Victoria Cross. Eighty others received decorations for gallantry.|$|R
50|$|In March No. 2 Commando plus {{demolition}} {{experts from}} Numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 12 Commandos {{took part in}} Operation Chariot the St Nazaire Raid. The destroyer HMS Campbeltown had 24 Mark VII depth-charges (4 tons) cemented below decks behind the forward gun support. Accompanied by 18 smaller ships, the Campbeltown sailed into port where she was rammed directly into the Normandie dock gates. The commandos engaged the German forces and destroyed the dock facilities. Eight hours later, <b>delayed-action</b> <b>fuses</b> set off the explosives in the Campbeltown which wrecked the dock gates and killed some 360 Germans and French. A total of 611 soldiers and sailors took part in Chariot; 169 were killed and 200 (most wounded) taken prisoner. Only 242 returned immediately. Of the 241 commandos who took part 64 were posted as killed or missing and 109 captured. Among participants in the raid two commandos Lieutenant Colonel Augustus Charles Newman and Sergeant Thomas Durrant together with {{three members of the}} Royal Navy were awarded the Victoria Cross, while 80 others received decorations for gallantry.|$|R

5000|$|This officer {{dealt with}} and defused {{some of the}} first unexploded bombs in this country. In these early pioneer stages new types of bombs were {{constantly}} being found. Captain Barefoot was, therefore, responsible for the discovery of much new and valuable information. On July 28 he assisted Dr Merriman of London in experimenting on and afterwards defusing three unexploded bombs of a new shape at Great Yarmouth. By then Captain Barefoot had defused thirty or more such bombs of varying types and shapes. On the night of September 1 Captain Barefoot received information about unexploded bombs blocking the LNER main line. There were six live bombs in one place. This was a time when <b>delayed-action</b> time <b>fuse</b> bombs were much in use. In view of the importance of clearing the line at all costs, Captain Barefoot and his men deliberately ignored the safety period of four days then laid down. By 7am work was begun and continued without cessation in relays throughout the day. Captain Barefoot assisted personally in this remarkably expeditious operation, and by the evening the line had been cleared and at 6.40pm the first train was running. Normally this work would have taken a week to perform. Captain Barefoot worked on one of the first parachute magnetic mines dropped in this country. At the time we had very little knowledge of the mechanism of these mines, and much was learnt in these initial stages.|$|R
