25|$|I am {{ashamed of}} what I tell them: {{that they should}} indeed worry about making an {{accusation}} because what they fear is likely to come true. Not {{one of the women}} I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{despite a}} few setbacks, {{military}} action {{seemed to go}} in Gebhard's favor, until October, 1583, when the Elector Palatine died, and Casimir disbanded his army {{and returned to his}} brother's court as guardian for the new duke, his 10-year-old nephew. In November, 1583, from his castle Arensberg in Westphalia, he wrote to Francis Walsingham, adviser and spymaster to Queen Elizabeth: [...] "Our needs are pressing, and you [...] and the Queen's other virtuous counsellors we believe can aid us; moreover, since God has called us to a knowledge of Himself, we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> our counsellors that you love and further the service of God." ...|$|E

She suggested that some of the lyrics off the album are too predictable, but said that [...] "some places [...] display some of the best songwriting we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the band so far". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, opining that it [...] "has the feel of a blockbuster rock album" [...] but suggesting that the Christian songwriting on the record would limit its success.|$|E
500|$|Wordsworth did {{not reveal}} the {{inspiration}} for the character of Lucy, and over the years the topic has generated intense speculation among literary historians. Little biographical information can be drawn from the poems—it is difficult even to determine Lucy's age. In the mid-19th century, Thomas DeQuincey (1785–1859), author and one-time friend of Wordsworth, wrote that the poet [...] "always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that 'Lucy', repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>from</b> gossiping people about Hawkshead, some snatches of tragic story, which, after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight materials." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1918, LDS {{president}} Joseph F.

In his 1966 book Mormon Doctrine, LDS theologian (and, later, apostle) Bruce R. McConkie wrote that [...] "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should know better than to believe or spread such false information. One of these false and deceptive documents that has cropped up again and again for over a century is the so-called White Horse Prophecy." ...|$|E

500|$|The male sun {{had always}} been {{associated}} with Iranian royalty: Iranian tradition recalls that Kayanids had a golden sun as their emblem. From the Greek historians of classical antiquity {{it is known that}} a crystal image of the sun adorned the royal tent of Darius III, that the Arsacid banner was adorned with the sun, and that the Sassanid standards had a red ball symbolizing the sun. The Byzantine chronicler Malalas records that the salutation of a letter from the [...] "Persian king, the Sun of the East," [...] was addressed to the [...] "Roman Caesar, the Moon of the West". The Turanian king Afrasiab is recalled as saying: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> wise men that when the Moon of the Turan rises up it will be harmed by the Sun of the Iranians." [...] The sun was always imagined as male, and in some banners a figure of a male replaces the symbol of the sun. In others, a male figure accompanies the sun.|$|E
500|$|You, King Gelon, {{are aware}} the Universe {{is the name}} given by most astronomers to the sphere the center {{of which is the}} center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the {{straight}} line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, {{as a consequence of the}} assumptions made, that the Universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Inner Child" [...] was {{the first}} episode to air after a two-month hiatus. It was delayed by about 30 minutes because American Idol ran long for the night. The episode won its ad-hoc 9:30–10:30 Eastern timeslot, with about 9.6 million live viewers and a 9 share among viewers 18–49. Fringe also helped Fox win the night in total number of viewers. When asked by a {{reporter}} if he was [...] "infuriated" [...] with Fox because of the Idol-induced delay, co-creator J.J.

2500|$|... 1909 {{saw another}} {{mention of a}} Mokèlé-mbèmbé-like creature, in Beasts and Men, the {{autobiography}} of famed big-game hunter Carl Hagenbeck. He claimed to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> multiple independent sources about a creature living in the Congo region which was described as [...] "half elephant, half dragon." [...] Naturalist Joseph Menges had also told Hagenbeck about an animal alleged to live in Africa, described as [...] "some kind of dinosaur, seemingly akin to the brontosaurs." [...] Another of Hagenbeck's sources, Hans Schomburgk, asserted that while at Lake Bangweulu, he noted a lack of hippopotami; his native guides informed him of a large hippo-killing creature that lived in Lake Bangweulu; however, as noted below, Schomburgk thought that native testimony was sometimes unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 January 1981, 86-year-old Sir Norman Stronge, Bt, former Speaker of the UK Houses of Parliament, and {{his only}} son, James, 48 (both former MPs) were murdered by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The house was then burnt to the ground. The {{bodies of the}} father and son were later {{recovered}} from their blazing home. The two men were targeted as they sat in the main library of their 230-year-old mansion. Members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army forced entry into the Abbey by bombing the heavy front doors. Afterward the building was fire-bombed. The fire raged until the next morning, destroying the contents of the Abbey, and the house burned to the ground.

2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that.

2500|$|The team {{continues}} to cite polls showing general {{public opinion in}} opposition to changing the name. One poll was part the 2014 poll of issues regarding the NFL, which included one question indicating 71% {{of the general public}} are in favor of keeping the name, with 18% in favor of a change. On their website the team states: [...] "This poll, along with the poll taken among Native Americans by the Annenberg Institute, demonstrates continued, widespread and deep opposition to the Redskins changing our name. The results of this poll are solidly in line with the message we <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> fans and Native Americans for months – our name represents a tradition, passion and heritage that honors Native Americans. We respect {{the point of view of}} the small number of people who seek a name change, but it is important to recognize very few people agree with the case they are making." [...] The Oneida Indian Nation [...] "believes more Americans would favor changing the team name of the Washington NFL club if they understood the full context of what the Oneidas and others consider a racial slur." [...] Mike Florio points out that since an AP poll taken in April 2013 showed 79% in favor of keeping the name; the 71% result in the new poll is a significant decrease in support in a short time. A 2014 AP-Gfk Poll, however, showed 83% support keeping the name.|$|E
