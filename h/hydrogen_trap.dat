40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to model carbide {{precipitation}} in steels of a quaternary system which includes two substitutional elements. The work focuses on secondary hardening steels which are used for high-strength components, where hydrogen embrittlement {{is one of the}} major factors responsible for failure. It is believed that carbide particles can act as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> sites, thus reducing the risk of embrittlement. The thesis begins with a review of the physical metallurgy of secondary hardening steels and the phenomena of hydrogen embrittlement and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping.</b> The basic theory for the precipitation processes, including the nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth of particles, is reviewed in Chapter 2. Significant progress has recently been made in modelling the overall kinetics of transformations which occur simultaneously. The new theory, also reviewed, adopts classical nucleation and diffusion-controlled growth concepts and takes into account the capillarity effect. In the present work, a modified model has been developed for the precipitation of needle-shaped carbides, and a new model for plate-shaped carbides. The models are then verified experimentally, using five steels designed specifically for this purpose. Using the chemical compositions of the steels and thermodynamic data, the carbide precipitation, dissolution and coarsening kinetics at 600 °C were estimated. It is found that reasonable agreement can be obtained between experiment and theory for ternary steels, when multicomponent diffusion and capillarity effects are taken into account. This applies to both needle and plate-shaped particles. The same approach was then used successfully for quaternary steels. For the specific steels studied, M 2 C- and M 4 C 3 -type carbides are expected to be <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> sites which improve the hydrogen embrittlement properties. Experimental results on the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> capacity of the steels confirm this expectation and the relationships between the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> capacity and the features of M 4 C 3 carbide particles are discussed.

High-density micropores were observed in high-purity Al–Mg alloys, but their density and volume fraction were much lower in pure aluminum.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} for the hydrogen embrittlement of Ni-Ti superelastic alloy aged at room temperature after immersion in APF solution {{is dependent on the}} aging time. The effect of trap sites of absorbed hydrogen on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of Ni-Ti superelastic alloy was not sufficiently taken into consideration in the present study. Gamaoun et al. (2011) reported that the hydrogen embrittlement of hydrogen-charged Ni-Ti superelastic alloy was detected after aging at room temperature for 24 h, and this damage may have been due to hydrogen diffusion throughout the entire specimen via weak activation energy trap sites. However, changes in the hydrogen thermal desorption behavior were not confirmed by aging at room temperature in the present study (Fig.  5). The hydrogen thermal desorption behavior reflects the state of hydrogen in metals (Choo and Lee 1982; Takai and Watanuki 2003; Takasaki et al. 1995; Ogawa et al. 2005 b); therefore, {{it is unlikely that the}} complete recovery of tensile strength by aging at room temperature for 240 h is due to the changes of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trap</b> sites due to hydrogen diffusion.|$|E

40|$|From the {{diffusivity}} and solubility data {{of hydrogen}} in both annealed and as cold rolled Pd {{measured by the}} electrochemical permeation method, it could be discussed that {{the major source of}} the more reduced diffusivity and/or the more enhanced solubility of hydrogen in the cold rolled Pd than the annealed one is the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> at dislocations and the surrounding stress fields.

The causes of HE susceptibility include very high crack-tip tensile stresses and a reservoir of diffusible hydrogen that is trapped reversibly with a binding energy, Eb, of 11. 5 _+ 0. 5 kJ/mol at (Fe,Cr,Mo) 2 C precipitates. This reversibly trapped hydrogen repartitions to interstitial sites proximate to the highly stressed crack tip and, subsequently, may retrap at martensitic lath interfaces to produce substantial local hydrogen concentrations and transgranular embrittlement. These results are pertinent to the control of HE in this modem ultra-high strength steel with a cadmium-plated coating and co-deposited hydrogen (H). Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy demonstrates that 190 °C baking removes the detrimental hydrogen associated with (Fe,CrMo) 2 C traps in both precharged but unplated steel {{as well as in}} thin porous, cadmium-plated steel. Restoration of a high fracture toughness and a ductile fracture mode correlates directly with the removal of hydrogen from (Fe,CrMo) 2 C traps as well as other low energy trap states.

40|$|DoctorThe {{hydrogen}} assisted cracking (HAC) {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} concerns for the linepipe steel when the high strength low alloy (HSLA) linepipe steel is exposed to acidic crude oil containing hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). Although <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> in the steel as well as the interaction between hydrogen and lattice iron have been widely accepted as the primary cause of hydrogen related cracking and a great deal of researches have attempted to explain the relationship among hydrogen behavior in the steel, microstructure and the cracking characteristics, the mechanism of hydrogen induced cracking (HIC) and sulfide stress cracking (SSC) have not been clearly understood. This dissertation is dealing with two research objectives. One is to design a proper electrochemical hydrogen permeation technique (HPT) to assess the <b>hydrogen</b> diffusion and <b>trapping</b> behavior in the steel. Another is to investigate the effect of microstructure and constant elastic load on the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency of linepipe steel. Eventually, they are correlated with HIC and SSC characteristics. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency of ferrite/degenerated pearlite (F/DP), ferrite/acicular ferrite (F/AF) and ferrite/bainite (F/B) was assessed using the HPT with minor modification in reference to ISO 17081. It was revealed that the AF and B acted as the reversible trapping site and the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>trapping</b> efficiency was increased in the order of DP, B and AF, with AF being the most efficient. Initiation site of internal crack was proved to be not non-metallic inclusions often reported as the typical initiation sites of cracks, but the locally agglomerated M/A constituents for the steel with F/AF or F/B microstructure since M/A constituents are easily embrittled by hydrogen. As the microstructure changed from F/AF to F/B, the HIC susceptibility increased, and this can be explained by high toughness of the AF which is impeding the crack propagation. For the electrochemical permeation study on the <b>hydrogen</b> diffusion and <b>trapping</b> behavior of linepipe steel under constant load, the HPT combined with the constant load test (CLT) was especially designed. The stable oxide film anodically grown in 0. 1 M NaOH solution was used instead of thin palladium (Pd) coating to avoid poor reliability and reproducibility triggered by non-uniformity of Pd film during the elastic deformation of steel membrane. As a result, it was proved that the oxide film can be applicable to the designed HPT even without Pd coating if carefully controlled. Regardless of hydrogen charging condition, increase in the elastic load increased the amount of diffusible hydrogen. It is explained by the lattice expansion during elastic deformation of the steel and easy hydrogen diffusion through enlarged interstitial sites. Increased diffusible hydrogen is available to react with defects in the steel microstructure as well as to embrittle the surrounding microstructure around an inclusion, accelerating SSC propagation...|$|R
