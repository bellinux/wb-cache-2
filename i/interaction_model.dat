Although similar in concept to the wired movies feature released as part of QuickTime 3.0, QuickTime interactive was much more ambitious.

2500|$|The {{availability}} of both amplitude and {{phase of the}} scattered field measured in nano-FTIR allows for the recovery of both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, i.e. finding the index of refraction and the extinction coefficient of the sample. While such recovery for arbitrarily-shaped samples or samples exhibiting collective excitations, such as phonons, requires a resource-demanding numerical optimization, for soft matter samples (polymers, biological matter and other organic materials) {{the recovery of the}} dielectric function could often be performed in real time using fast semi-analytical approaches. One of such approaches is based on the Taylor expansion of the scattered field with respect to a small parameter that isolates the dielectric properties of the sample and allows for a polynomial representation of measured near-field contrast.

For <b>modeling</b> such partner <b>interactions</b> as flow of message exchanges, different top-down approaches, covered under the term <b>interaction</b> <b>modeling,</b> are provided. Like for workflow models, correctness constitutes a fundamental challenge for <b>interaction</b> <b>models</b> as well; e. g., to ensure the boundedness and absence of deadlocks and lifelocks. Due to their distributed execution, in addition, <b>interaction</b> <b>models</b> should be message-deterministic and realizable, i. e., the same conversation (i. e. sequence of messages) should always lead to the same result, {{and it should be}} ensured that partners always have enough information about the messages they must or may send in a given context.
