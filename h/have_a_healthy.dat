5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> oral environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E

Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going to have to be honest with her.|$|E

500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E
500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans were singing Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player and I respect the fans have individuals they like. But we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> squad here and I picked what I felt was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E

Harris did not campaign, and collected less than $5,000 in campaign contributions. On May 2, 2006, Ney defeated him 68%–32%. On the day of the election, Greg Giroux of Congressional Quarterly noted: [...] "I'd be surprised if Harris got more than 20 or 25 percent. That would be a sign that there is a chunk of the Republican base that's disenchanted with the incumbent."

[...] The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: [...] "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded {{it in such a way}} that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The leafy {{foliage of}} a grapevine's canopy will be {{dependent}} on the particular grape variety and its propensity for vigorous growth. These leaves emerge from shoots on the fruiting cane {{in a manner similar}} to the grape clusters themselves. A vine is described as [...] "vigorous" [...] if it has a propensity to produce many shoots that are outwardly observable as a large, leafy canopy. The ability of the grapevine to support such a large canopy is dependent on the health of its root system and storage of carbohydrates. If a vine does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> and extensive root system in proportion to its canopy, then it is being overly vigorous with parts of the vine (most notably the grape clusters) suffering due to lack of resources. While it may seem that more foliage would promote increased photosynthesis (and such carbohydrate production), this is not always the case since the leaves near the top of the canopy create excess shading that hinders photosynthesis in the leaves below. One of the objectives of vine training is to create an [...] "open canopy" [...] that allows limited excess leaf growth and allows plenty of sunlight to penetrate the canopy.|$|E

2500|$|Donald Winnicott, {{who was a}} {{pediatrician}} and child psychoanalyst, had an immense influence on Bowlby's work and career. Bowlby and Winnicott had several similarities within their professional work as {{they were the first}} to explain the importance of social interactions at an early age. Both Bowlby and Winnicott argued that humans come into the world with a predisposition to be sensitive to social interactions and to need these interactions in order to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> development. However, although Bowlby and Winnicott's ideas were similar, they took vastly different approaches when dealing with their research. For example, Bowlby was interested in how a child's environment is internalized and affects the child's development, while Winnicott was more interested in [...] "the way the inner world engages with and thereby is affected by external events". Despite their differences in approaching their research interests, Bowlby explained in an interview that his research for the World Health Organization influenced policies regarding child care; however, {{none of this would have}} been possible without the help of Winnicott. Winnicott worked more at a clinical level than Bowlby which influenced several social workers as he spent his career working to change policies. Bowlby explained that Winnicott is one of the more important individuals who was able to push Bowlby's work to change policies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} episode of the sixth season, the {{audience}} discovers that Peyton was {{on the receiving end}} of Lucas's phone call. He waits to see if she actually arrives, and moments later, he finds her through the crowd, making her way toward him with bags packed. They share passionate kisses, Peyton glowing with happiness, and then board the plane on their way to Las Vegas. When they get there, they spend the night in a kinky Vegas hotel room. The next day, they go to the wedding chapel, but the tackiness of the place convinces them that this was the wrong decision. Instead, Peyton takes Lucas to the hotel room where he first proposed to her and they do it all over again, but this time Peyton says [...] "yes" [...] before he has even asked the question. With the upcoming release of his new book, Lucas travels to New York to meet with Lindsey, and eventually tells her about his engagement to Peyton. He soon starts his book tour, but it fails fast and is canceled, so he returns home to Peyton. After the two resolve problems and fears of moving in together, Lucas is offered a movie deal by Julian Baker. Julian asks Lucas questions about Peyton before she gets there, and after she runs into Julian near the bathroom, it is revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. For three weeks, Peyton fails to tell Lucas about Julian, and Lucas is angry when he discovers their past on his own. Although he is initially angry, they patch things up, and Peyton convinces Lucas to continue taking a part in the making of the film, despite his reluctance to work with Julian. The film is to be shot in Tree Hill, North Carolina. He also learns Peyton is expecting their first child. Though they initially have problems with Peyton's pregnancy, the fact that she may die if the baby is born, the two are eventually married by the lake where they first met, and have their reception at Tric. They soon <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>healthy</b> daughter, Sawyer Brooke Scott, which Peyton names after her best friend Brooke (similar to the naming of James Lucas Scott), and the two ride off into the sunset.|$|E
