40|$|A novel {{iterative}} procedure for designing multiband single-layer reflectarrays is presented. The multiband frequency behavior {{is achieved by}} simultaneously providing the desired phases at each operating frequency. A suitable reflectarray element shape formed by several concentric loops loaded with double stubs has been selected for achieving multiband operation. The problem of mutual coupling among the different self-similar resonating elements laying on the same substrate is analyzed and mitigated by employing an innovative iterative design approach. The proposed design approach is demonstrated by designing a tri-band single-layer reflectarray with widely spaced frequencies operating at 3. 9 GHz (C-band), 7. 5 GHz (X-band), and 12. 5 GHz (Ku-band). The single-layer prototype is compact and lightweight {{as it has been}} fabricated on a thin Kapton <b>film</b> <b>glued</b> on to a Rohacell HF 31 substrate.

Due to {{the difficulties in}} detaching metaphase chromosome spreads from the glass slide, this approach has been restricted. We introduce a simplified protocol in which the metaphase chromosome spreads are made on a flexible thermoplastic membrane (Aclar <b>film)</b> <b>glued</b> to the routine microscopic glass slides. The chromosome spreads are then impregnated with 1 % osmium tetroxide, stained with freshly prepared 2 % tannic acid, dehydrated, and flat-embedded in epoxy resin. After polymerization, the epoxy resin sheet is easily detached from the Aclar film and all chromosome spreads retain on the resin sheet. Each chromosome spread is identified under a light microscope, demarcated, trimmed then attached to a pre-polymerized blank epoxy resin block. Ultrathin sections are cut and observed under a transmission electron microscope. Application of this method to chromosome research is suggested to provide useful information on the chromosome morphology and ultrastructure in relation to various conditions and/or function. </p...|$|R

By undertaking this exercise, {{we would like to}} evolve an analytical framework {{that can be used for}} designs of coatings.

In this part, we used a previously derived Hankel transform procedure to derive stress and strain in a birefringent polymer <b>film</b> <b>glued</b> to a strong substrate and subjected to spherical indentation. We measure surface radial strains using strain gauges and bulk film stresses using photo elastic technique (stress freezing). For a boundary condition based on Hertzian traction with no film interface constraint and assuming the substrate constraint to be a function of the imposed strain, the theory describes the stress distributions well. The variation in peak stresses also demonstrates the usefulness of depositing even a soft film to protect an underlying substrate...|$|R
40|$|Depth-sensing nanoindentation (DSNI) is a {{very popular}} {{technique}} that is used for evaluation of mechanical properties of both homogeneous thin films and bulk material samples. Recently it has been proposed by the authors to apply the DSNI to components of highly inhomogeneous materials that could contain pores and cracks. The extended techniques assume that the DSNI is applied to very thin films (the thickness is about 10 – 20 μm) of the tested inhomogeneous material glued to a transparent rigid substrate. The combination of DSNI and transmitted light microscopy allows us to visualize the regions of tested components. Because we study not a bulk material sample but rather a thin <b>films</b> <b>glued</b> to the substrate, the approximating functions have {{to be used to}} extract the real elastic modulus of the tested component. We present the results of evaluation of elastic moduli of coal samples at varying depth of maximal indentation using seven approximating functions.

There has been particular interest in conducting high-throughput screening studies using microscale devices, for example in stem cell research. Microwells have emerged as the structure of choice for such tests. Most manufacturing approaches for microwell fabrication are based on photolithography, soft lithography, and etching. However, some of these approaches require extensive equipment, lengthy fabrication process, and modifications to the existing microwell patterns are costly. Here we show a convenient, fast, and low-cost method for fabricating microwells for cell culture applications by laser ablation of a polyester film coated with silicone glue. Microwell diameter was controlled by adjusting the laser power and speed, and the well depth by stacking several layers of film. By using this setup, a device containing hundreds of microwells can be fabricated in a few minutes to analyze cell behavior.

Among the available technologies, heat sealing is widely applied along with solvent based gluing that is the more traditional technique. In this paper, welds of thin polymeric films have been produced {{by means of a}} solid-state Laser source and the solvent based technique with the aim to compare their performances. Thin films specimens were cut from commercial rolls used in labelling applications or prepared from purposely-designed polymer blends by compression between the heated plates of a laboratory press.

40|$|When a {{material}} is mechanically loaded or experience environmental {{changes such as}} for example thermal or pressure variations it is affected, in some way, due to these new conditions. In order to measure engineering properties related to these structural changes, such as for example deformation and strain, we need to gain information about them that are precise and reliable. There exist many different methods for such measurements. However, most often these methods measure the pure surface response due to the deforming mechanism, since this is what can be observed directly by use of cameras and various sensors. We therefore {{know a lot about}} how the material surface behaves but not much about how the structure beneath the surface behaves. As long as the material structure is reasonably homogeneous this may be enough but as the complexity of the material structure increase it gets more important to obtain information from the inside of the material. In this thesis two techniques with the ability to measure internal deformations in optically non-transparent materials are presented. The fundamental principle of both the techniques is the same. The techniques utilize a correlation based routine to estimate deformations from two and three dimensional image data collected with x-ray-based methods. The first technique, called Digital Speckle Radiography (DSR), measures two-dimensional deformation fields, in a single plane within the examined material. The deformations are estimated by the use of image correlation applied to two-dimensional digital x-ray images. The second technique, called Tomographic 3 D-DSP, measures the three-dimensional unrestricted deformation, in every point of the examined object. Here the correlation procedure is carried out on volumetric object data collected with computed tomography (CT). Three separate experiments have been carried out, to investigate the behaviour of the two techniques. In two of the experiments the two-dimensional technique is applied. In the first of these the flow profile of an alumina powder is measured as it flows through a silo configuration. In the second experiment the motion in a thin <b>film</b> of <b>glue,</b> sandwiched between two wooden plates, exposed to shear, is measured. Finally in the third experiment the three-dimensional technique is used to measure the deformations in bone tissue when being exposed to a mechanical load.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that torn meniscal tissue {{increases the likelihood of}} degenerative arthritis of the knee. Efforts have therefore been directed toward meniscal repair techniques. Surgical adhesives have the theoretical advantage of minimizing the tear gap and providing full contact of the bonded surfaces, which would aid in meniscal repair. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the mechanical strength of a newly discovered biological adhesive (frog glue) and to compare its strength to currently available biological adhesives for meniscal tissue repair. A longitudinal tear was created along the periphery of freshly dissected sheep menisci. Four adhesives were used to reduce the cut surfaces: (1) frog glue (nontoxic, biocompatible glue secreted by an Australian species of frogs of the genus Notaden, n = 12); (2) fibrin glue (n = 11); (3) gelatin glue (n = 12); and (4) cyanoacrylate glue (n = 12). The samples were incubated in wet conditions for 24 hours, tested using a tear propagation method, and the peel strength was calculated. The test groups were compared using analysis of variance. In all cases, tearing occurred along the tissue-adhesive interface. Cyanoacrylate formed a hard brittle <b>film</b> on the <b>glued</b> surfaces, whereas the other glues remained rubbery. The strongest bond (mean ± SEM) was made by the cyanoacrylate glue (149 ± 10 N/m) followed by the frog glue (97 ± 9 N/m). The frog glue was found to be 5 times stronger than the fibrin glue (20 ± 3 N/m), and 2. 5 times stronger than the gelatin glue (39 ± 8 N/m). There was a statistically significant difference between each of the groups (P < 0. 001), except between the gelatin and fibrin glues. Cyanoacrylate provided the strongest bond, whereas gelatin and fibrin glues were weak bonding agents. The frog glue demonstrated superior mechanical strength over the 2 other biological glues. Based on its excellent mechanical properties and advantageous biological and structural characteristics, the frog glue has great potential for further investigations and could be considered for meniscal repair in the future. 5 page(s...|$|R

Primerjali smo kinetike navlaževanja masivnih bukovih preskušancev in zlepljenih preskušancev (uporabili smo tekoča PVAc, UF, MUF, FRF in epoksidna lepila ter FF lepilni film) ter vzporednih preskušancev, ki so bili brez lepilnih spojev, so pa bili izpostavljeni pogojem lepljenja. Difuzijske koeficiente smo določili z uporabo nestacionarne metode. Ugotovili smo, da tanki lepilni spoji, izdelani s tekočimi lepili, niso bariera, ki bi učinkovito zadržala prodiranje vezane vode v lepljenec. Večji upor ustvarjajo le spoji s FF lepilnim filmom. Med difuzijskimi koeficienti, izračunanimi iz analitičnih rešitev in rešitve enačbe prvega reda, obstajajo statistično značilne razlike. Prečno difuzijo vodne pare in vezane vode v lesu lahko opišemo kot sistem prvega reda. In the wood-glue-wood system, the glue-bond {{presents}} an additional resistance,hindering the water transition. The increased {{resistance of the}} glued test pieces is the consequence of adhesive being present in the bond, soas of altered wood properties, mainly the increased density and locally decreased wood hygroscopicity, resulting {{as a consequence of}} wood exposed to the gluing conditions. Using an unsteady-state method, the diffusion coefficients were defined. The kinetics of absorption of the massive beech test pieces, glued test pieces (PVAc, UF, MUF, PRF and epoxy liquid adhesives and PF film were used), and parallel ones with no glue bonds but exposed to the gluing conditions, were compared. It was established that the thin glue bonds made by using liquid glues do not present a barrier, which could effectively hinder the transition of bound water into the glued piece. A higher resistance was presented just by FF <b>glue</b> <b>film</b> bonds. There exist statistically significant differences among diffusion coefficients, calculatedby analytical solutions and solutions of an equation of the first order model. Transverse diffusion of water vapour and bound water can be described as the first order system...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two related topics were investigated: * The {{deformation}} of detector modules {{located in the}} endcap of the CMS tracker * The effect of misalignment of the tracker support structure {{on the performance of}} the CMS tracker 0. 1 Deformation Measurements In chapter two the possible deformations of the TEC modules under temperature changes have been investigated. A test setup to measure module deformation was designed and built. The optical measurement principle of the test stand utilises the reflecting wafers of the modules. The polished side of the sensors acts as a mirror, that reflects a regularly patterned grid of white dots towards a CCD camera. Any deformation of the surface leads to a distortion of the reflected pattern. These distortions are used to reconstruct the shape of the surface. The setup is capable of reconstructing sagittas of at least 10 µm over the length of the biggest TEC modules (209 mm). After calibration of the test stand first measurements were conducted on a dummy module. The measurements showed severe deformations of the frame (120 µm) and the hybrid (200 µm), and medium deformation of the wafers (40 µm). In order to reduce the deformation of the module components, several solutions were proposed and tested: * The deformation of the frame was mainly caused by a small heat collecting piece (HCP) glued {{on one side of the}} frame. Adding a counter part for each HCP on the other side of the carbon fiber frame to cancel their effects was shown to be the right way to reduce frame deformations. It was also seen that <b>glue</b> <b>films</b> of a homogenous thickness are important to ensure the performance of this compensation method. Finally, changing the material of the HCP from aluminum to compressed graphite removed the frame deformation due to the HCPs almost completely (Z+X -> muon(+) muon(-) +X * pp -> b bbar +X -> Jets+X The simulations showed the great impact of tracker deformations on tracker performance. Not only the reconstructed track parameters are affected, but also the overall ability to find the true particle tracks is dramatically reduced for events with high particle densities. The laser alignment system was shown to greatly enhance the performance of a misaligned tracker. It increases the accuracy of the momentum resolution to values about 5 to 7 times better than without alignment. For the endcaps this is only two times worse than for the ideally aligned tracker. The track finding efficiency is reasonably increased for great particle densities. But the most important improvement is the reduction of the fake rate by a factor of 15 to a value that should greatly help the alignment with tracks to be successful...|$|R
