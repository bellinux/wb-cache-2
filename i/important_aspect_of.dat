5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> all {{of these}} {{examples}} of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century {{is that they are}} used as sound effects in programme music.

5|$|Daara J {{was formed}} in 1997 and quickly became popular in Senegal from the release of their first {{cassette}} album, Daara J. They followed in 1999 with a more politically themed recording, Xalima, which integrated numerous musical ideas and instruments from Senegal and other African countries. 2003's Boomerang was critically acclaimed and furthered the combination of various musical and lyrical influences of the previous two recordings. Activism has also been an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the group's philosophy since it was founded.|$|E

This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire.

5|$|Wind shear is an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> a squall line. In low {{to medium}} shear environments, mature {{thunderstorms}} will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, {{enough to help}} create a leading edge lifting mechanism ‚Äì the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E

Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that the most <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The {{earliest}} written references to the islands date back to Roman times.

When Scotland {{became part of the}} Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, trade with northern Europe decreased. Fishing has continued to be an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the economy up to the present day.

5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikoliƒá {{it has been shown}} that some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia‚Äîat least for some type of qualia.|$|E
5|$|Multiple vassalage {{became an}} <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Romanian {{diplomacy}} after the Christian Balkan states (Bulgaria, Serbia) {{one by one}} fell to the Ottoman Empire in the course {{the second half of}} the 14th century. For example, Mircea the Elder (1386‚Äì1418) accepted the suzerainty of Poland in 1387 and that of Hungary in 1395, and Wallachia was paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417. When accepting Hungarian suzerainty, the princes of Wallachia usually also received the district of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü in Transylvania from the Hungarian monarchs, for example in 1366 King Louis I of Hungary (1342‚Äì1382) granted the region to Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia (1364‚Äì1377), with the title of duke, and Prince Mircea the Elder received it from King Sigismund (1387‚Äì1437).|$|E
