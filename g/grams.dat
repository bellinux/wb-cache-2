40|$|The seed {{moisture}} level marking {{the onset of}} imbibitional injury (breakpoint) was determined for two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cvs `Tendercrop' (TC) and `Kinghorn Wax' (KW). At 20 °C the breakpoints were 0. 15 <b>gram</b> H 2 O/gram dry weight (<b>gram</b> per <b>gram)</b> for TC and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> for KW. When seeds were imbibed at 5 °C, the breakpoints were 0. 19 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> (TC) and 0. 16 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> (KW). Below the breakpoint germination changed 4. 6 %/ 0. 01 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> for all treatments. Imbibition rates were maximal at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> and 0. 33 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> after 20 minutes imbibition. Rates of electrolyte leakage were correlated with the imbibition rate maximum at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> but were unaffected by the maximum at 0. 33 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram.</b> The transition from tightly bound to semibound water occurred at 0. 09 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> for KW and TC, respectively. T 1 values increased exponentially as seed moisture decreased from 0. 47 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> to 0. 05 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram.</b> 13 C-NMR sugar signals increased at {{moisture level}}s above 0. 14 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> and plateaued at approximately 0. 33 <b>gram</b> per <b>gram</b> seed moisture. These {{results suggest that the}} breakpoint moisture level for imbibitional damage is a function of temperature while the injury process is similar at both 5 and 20 °C. Imbibition and leakage rate maxima reflect transitions in the states of seed water. NMR data support the application of the Water Replacement Hypothesis to seeds. Thus, imbibitional injury may be related to specific, temperature dependent moisture levels that are determined by water binding characteristics in the seed tissue...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was planned to {{investigate}} the effect of spices on in vitro protein digestibility in decorticated forms of bengal <b>gram</b> (Cicer arietinum), black <b>gram</b> (Phaseolus mungo), green <b>gram</b> (Phaseolus radiatus) and red <b>gram</b> (Cajanus indicus). The spices used were chilli (Capsicum annum), pepper (Pepper nigrum L.), coriander (Coriander sativum) and a mixture of these. Legumes were pressure cooked with 5. 0 % of freshly powdered spices and in vitro protein digestibility determined using pepsin and pancreatin enzymes by standard techniques. Samples without spices served as controls. The results reveal that protein content of legumes ranged from 20. 5 to 23. 0 g/ 100 g. The percent protein hydrolysed for legumes without spices were 63. 4 for bengal <b>gram,</b> 65. 8 for black <b>gram,</b> 60. 0 for green <b>gram</b> and 55. 4 for red <b>gram.</b> Casein sample could be hydrolysed {{to the extent of}} 78. 8 %. Chilli powder decreased digestibility significantly by 50, 78, 73, 60 and 69 % in casein. bengal <b>gram,</b> black <b>gram,</b> green <b>gram</b> and red <b>gram,</b> respectively. Pepper exhibited a variable effect of altering the digestibility to 93 % in casein and red <b>gram,</b> 106 % in black <b>gram</b> and green <b>gram</b> and 98 %, in bengal <b>gram,</b> which were not significant. Coriander also decreased digestibility by 48, 76, 87, 77 and 73 % and mixture of spices by 74, 91, 96, 96 and 82 % in casein, bengal <b>gram,</b> black <b>gram,</b> green <b>gram</b> and red <b>gram,</b> respectively. It can be concluded that spices do influence in vitro protein digestibility in legumes to varying extent...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 <b>grams</b> a day, while 35% took 60 <b>grams</b> a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
