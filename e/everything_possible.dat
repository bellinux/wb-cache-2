5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to improve their own lot.|$|E
5|$|President Andrew Johnson {{appointed}} Ewing as U.S. Minister to Holland, {{where he}} served from 1866 to 1870. This appointment may have drawn the ire of the Radical Republicans, for Speaker of the House James G. Blaine urged President Ulysses S. Grant that Ewing be recalled and replaced with his brother, Charles Ewing. Blaine told the President that Hugh was 'acting badly'. Blaine himself was disingenuous, having represented to prominent politicians in Ohio including Senator John Sherman {{that he was doing}} <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to nominate his close personal friend, former Ohio General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, for the post. Nonetheless, Blaine's request to recall General Ewing was never acted upon, possibly due to the influence of his sister, whose husband General Sherman was a very close friend to President Grant.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to having}} severe PTSD and {{being unable to}} do her job {{correctly}} anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides {{to go to work}} after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did <b>everything</b> <b>possible.</b> Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang {{to come up with a}} wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.|$|E

25|$|Gay {{people could}} seldom be {{convinced}} that heterosexual sex would {{provide them with the}} same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex.

These events forced Roosevelt to recognise, finally and fully, the provisional government installed in France by de Gaulle.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} the award depends on, in part, {{the value of the}} salved vessel, the degree of risk {{involved}} and the degree of peril the vessel was in. Legal disputes do arise from the claiming of salvage rights. To reduce the amount of a claim after an accident, boat owners or skippers often remain on board and in command of the vessel; they do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to minimise further loss and seek to minimize the degree of risk the vessel is in. If another vessel offers a tow and the master or owner negotiates an hourly rate before accepting then salvage does not apply.|$|E
25|$|When {{the mine}} was {{returned}} to the company in June 1944, production was scaled down and thirty men were discharged. The manager began to plan how best to work the mine {{to keep it in}} profit, while making sure no ore reserves would be lost when the mine did close. <b>Everything</b> <b>possible</b> was done to control costs and maximise income. But this was not the high output mine the Basinghall Mining Syndicate had seen itself running, and they announced production would cease in 1946. However, in the year to September 1946 the mine made its best profit to date, of £19,926. A steady development programme kept production constant, and with a good lead price the company was content to leave the mine open.|$|E
25|$|The film then {{depicts the}} grandfather's {{struggle}} {{to accept the}} reality {{that the only way}} to save his grandson is at the cost of his eyesight. He tries to come to terms with the situation and his personal agony is shown in scenes, like taking second opinion, explaining his grandson the reality and his desire to show him <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> before his grandson loses his eyesight. For some reason, the surgery has to be postponed by a day. That afternoon, grandfather and grandson disappear from the hospital ward and a frantic search follows. Confronted by an angry surgeon on their return, the grandfather states quite simply that he wanted to show Parshya the sights of the city for one last time.|$|E

25|$|Screen shot: Screen {{shots are}} blind shots, {{in which the}} goalie can not find the {{location}} of the puck. Goalies should never anticipate or guess when and where the puck will hit. In the screen shot, another player (usually an opponent, but sometimes the goaltender's own teammate) stands between the shooter and the goaltender, obscuring the goaltender's vision of the shot. On a screen shot, the goaltender must do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to try to see the shot, dropping to the butterfly stance and thrusting their glove out at the sound of a shot is not the best idea in the modern game. Some goalies, such as Ed Belfour or Ron Hextall, went as far as (illegally) punching players in the head or slashing their legs.|$|E
25|$|Other {{points of}} the {{agreement}} included the exchange of technical advisers, cooperation on coastal patrols, and the aerial photographing of strategic areas within Colombia.

Colombia also made it clear that, although it was fully supportive of the fight against the Axis, it would do <b>everything</b> <b>possible</b> to limit the amount of American military activity taking place on or from its territory. The Colombians did not invite the United States to build its own military bases within their country, as Ecuador and other South American countries did. They felt that the defense of Colombia should be carried out by Colombians, and the United States did not object.|$|E
