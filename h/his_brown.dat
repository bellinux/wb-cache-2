25|$|A {{compact and}} {{straightforward}} rock {{song from the}} 1980s, structured with Tony Franklin's fretless bass hook at the beginning, combined with Jimmy Page's guitar scratch on the third line in the verse, Rodgers' reverbed vocal, and followed by a wah pedal inflected guitar solo. Chris Slade plays a steady drum beat throughout. On live performances, the song was introduced with a drum solo from Slade, leading into Franklin's opening bass line. Page utilized <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> 1960s Fender Telecaster guitar featuring a Parsons and White B-string bender on tour with this song.|$|E

25|$|Cardinal José Saraiva Martins, prefect for the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, celebrated Mass for 15,000 devotees on April 24 at the Shrine of Holy Mary of Grace, San Giovanni Rotondo, {{before the}} body went {{on display in}} a crystal, marble, and silver sepulcher in the crypt of the monastery. Padre Pio is wearing <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> Capuchin habit with a white silk stole {{embroidered}} with crystals and gold thread.

Officials extended the display through September, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani {{settled in}} Le Bateau-Lavoir, a commune for penniless artists in Montmartre, renting himself {{a studio in}} Rue Caulaincourt. Even though this artists' quarter of Montmartre was {{characterized}} by generalized poverty, Modigliani himself presented—initially, at least—as one would expect {{the son of a}} family trying to maintain the appearances of its lost financial standing to present: his wardrobe was dapper without ostentation, and the studio he rented was appointed in a style appropriate to someone with a finely attuned taste in plush drapery and Renaissance reproductions. He soon made efforts to assume the guise of the bohemian artist, but, even in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> corduroys, scarlet scarf and large black hat, he continued to appear as if he were slumming it, having fallen upon harder times.|$|E

25|$|As {{he entered}} St. Peter's Square to address an {{audience}} on 13 May 1981, Pope John Paul II {{was shot and}} critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca, an expert Turkish gunman {{who was a member}} of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves. The assassin used a Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times. John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds. Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove <b>his</b> <b>Brown</b> Scapular during the operation. One of the few people allowed in to see him at the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery. The pope later stated that Our Lady of Fátima helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.|$|E
500|$|In Soul Edge, Li Long {{appears as}} a tall, Asian male with <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> hair tied in a knot atop his head with long, thick sideburns. His facial contours, {{expressions}} and hairdo were designed to be sharp, intended to suggest the [...] "assassin" [...] side of his character, as well as imply the image of Chinese culture in the character. A large light brown jacket with green trimming covers his arms, while a large belt wraps around his midsection. Dark brown pants ending in white trimming cover his legs, and blue and white stripped shoes cover his feet. His alternate character model varies significantly, featuring a shaved head, blue and gray vest with an open collar, small gold belt, green pants, and blue and red striped shoes. Li Long stands [...] tall.|$|E

500|$|Promoted to the {{permanent}} rank of colonel on January 2, 1881, Raynolds continued serving with the Corps of Engineers supporting {{a variety of}} harbor and river navigational improvements {{until his retirement in}} 1884, after a military career that spanned 40years. As he approached retirement, Raynolds was elected a trustee of the Presbyterian Church. According to West Point classmate Joseph Reynolds, who saw him at the West Point graduates reunion in 1893, Raynolds maintained a vigorous and healthy appearance long after his retirement, <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> hair, [...] "then but slightly sprinkled with gray". Raynolds died on October 18, 1894 in Detroit, Michigan, leaving his widow a substantial estate for the time, estimated at between US $50,000 ($ today) and $100,000 ($ today). After providing for his widow, his will directed that after her death, the entire estate would be donated to the Presbyterian Church. Raynolds was interred in West Lawn Cemetery in Canton, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Grossberg's {{design was}} changed for Trials and Tribulations, with <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> suit {{changed to a}} red one: this was because the Game Boy Advance system's screen made his previous design blend in too much with the brown courtroom. Iwamoto based the design of Godot on Rutger Hauer's role in Blade Runner. He was originally going to be depicted as drinking bourbon whiskey and smoking, {{as part of his}} [...] "hard-boiled" [...] image; when the development team realized that this could have a bad influence on children, they made him drink coffee instead. As Takumi and Hideki Kamiya had joined Capcom around the same time and had desks near each other, Kamiya had asked Takumi for a voice role ever since the development of Justice for All; eventually, Takumi gave him the role of Godot. Takumi explained the role as a hard-boiled guy, so Kamiya decided to adapt the dialogue and shout [...] "Objection, baby!". Takumi said {{that it was a good}} take, but that the in-game graphics just say [...] "Objection!", so it could not be used.|$|E

He was again a heel and began working as part of Luscious Johnny Valiant's stable with Greg [...] "The Hammer" [...] Valentine and Brutus Beefcake.

2500|$|Pope John Paul II stated that: [...] "Scapular is {{essentially}} a habit which evokes {{the protection of the}} Blessed Virgin Mary in this life and in the passage to the fullness of eternal glory."

2500|$|The icon, {{traditionally}} half-length when in a semi-dome, {{which became}} adopted for panel icons also, depicts Christ fully frontal with a somewhat melancholy and stern aspect, {{with the right}} hand raised in blessing or, in the early encaustic panel at Saint Catherine's Monastery, the conventional rhetorical gesture that represents teaching. The left hand holds a closed book with a richly decorated cover featuring the Cross, representing the Gospels. An icon where Christ has an open book is called [...] "Christ the Teacher", {{a variant of the}} Pantocrator. Christ is bearded, <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> hair centrally parted, and his head is surrounded by a halo. The icon is usually shown against a gold background comparable to the gilded grounds of mosaic depictions of the Christian emperors.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{was known}} for {{assisting}} white men in distress and swore {{in the presence of}} the Great Spirit [...] "Wakan Tanka" [...] that <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> hand had never risen to kill a white man. Blue Horse's friend E.A. Burbank reported: “At my hotel in Pine Ridge I chanced to meet a white Indian trader who owned a store about twenty-five miles from the agency. He said that a good many years before a band of Sioux had captured twelve of his comrades and planned to burn them at the stake. Blue Horse, who lived forty miles distant, heard of their intentions and immediately mounted his horse and rode as fast as he could to where the Indians held the whites captive. The trader said he never saw an Indian or a white man work harder than Blue Horse did that day to save the lives of those twelve men, which he was able to accomplish, and from that time on, he said whenever he met Blue Horse he always gave him money and tobacco in recognition of his aid to white men in distress.” Blue Horse’s Wágluȟe village afterward became noted as a place of refuge for white travelers.|$|E
2500|$|Robert of Anjou was {{the third}} son of King Charles II and Mary of Hungary. Charles II’s first son Charles Martel of Anjou had died by 1295, putting his second son Louis next {{in line for the}} throne. [...] Louis, however, did not desire the crown of Naples, and would instead become bishop of the diocese of Toulouse in 1296. Louis and Charles II died in 1297 and in 1308 respectively, leading to Robert’s {{coronation}} in 1309. By 1317, Louis, with the help of Robert’s royal influence, was canonized as Saint Louis of Toulouse. [...] The Neapolitan House of Anjou now possessed its own saint, which Robert of Anjou would use to his political advantage. It was around this year that the Sienese painter Simone Martini was commissioned, most likely by Robert of Anjou, to paint the Altarpiece of St Louis of Toulouse, now in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte. In this altarpiece, Saint Louis of Toulouse sits enthroned in <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> sackcloth and crimson jeweled cope, holding his crozier with his right hand and donning his bishop’s mitre on his haloed head. Two angels hover over him, sustaining the crown of sainthood above his mitre. As he receives the celestial crown, the Saint, with his left hand, offers the Neapolitan crown to his brother Robert of Anjou, shown in profile, who kneels before him.|$|E
2500|$|The story {{follows the}} {{attempts}} {{of five children}} to clear {{the name of their}} friend Sticky by trailing and catching a homeless thief with disagreeable manners; a [...] "ghastly type" [...] to be identified by <b>his</b> <b>brown</b> boots. The boots are possibly a reference to the 1931 monologue Brahn Boots by Stanley Holloway, which was still regularly played on BBC Home Service radio in the 1950s. The song's lyrics describe the apparent low-class taste of a man clad in brown boots, but he is too modest to say that he has given his good black boots away to the poor; it is really a parable on the subject of unquestioning snobbery. An obvious clue not followed by the children is that the thief initially enters the shop asking for the previous Wednesday's newspaper. The book's publication in 1955 and the timing of the plot during the June half-term holiday possibly indicate the Children and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act of 6 June 1955. If this is so, then the disagreeable man could be taken to be the author's characterisation of D. C. Thomson & Co., or its cartoonist Bill Holroyd, who published children's cartoons such as Jack Silver and His Dog Black. This cartoon was later lampooned by Viz as Jack Black and his Dog Silver. It is perhaps also significant in this context that the publication of Half-Term Trail in 1955 follows press commentary on the first few books of The Cherrys series, and that Scott did not like to be compared with Enid Blyton. In Will Scott's story, the children pursue the brown-booted man unquestioningly, and they are described thus: ...|$|E
