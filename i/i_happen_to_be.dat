2500|$|I {{heard that}} if a tree follows a rope it will be straight, and if an empress {{followed}} suggestions she would be holy. [...] Therefore, the ancient holy rulers always had seven advisors {{who were willing to}} speak honestly and willing to die if their suggestions were not followed. [...] Your Imperial Majesty is willing to receive our weed-like suggestions, and <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> serving here in an administration that has no taboos. [...] I am willing to offer my wild words.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1896 Hearst {{dispatched}} Bierce to Washington, D.C. to foil this attempt. The {{essence of}} the plot was secrecy; the railroads' advocates hoped to get the bill through Congress without any public notice or hearings. When the angered Huntington confronted Bierce {{on the steps of}} the Capitol and told Bierce to name his price, Bierce's answer ended up in newspapers nationwide: [...] "My price is one hundred thirty million dollars. If, when you are ready to pay, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> out of town, you may hand it over to my friend, the Treasurer of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally {{the minister}} chides the audience for its scepticism: “I know you don't believe me because <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a Black man. Well, you can look {{it up in a}} book I’m {{going to tell you about}} that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis of a wide range of generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{production}} of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was [...] "amazed" [...] by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a [...] "buffoon". He felt that the character had gotten [...] "progressively braver" [...] throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying [...] "how they love this guy now". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she [...] "likes to keep her life separate" [...] and [...] "wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey [...] "earns his spot on board the TARDIS". Clarke stated that he didn't {{want to focus on}} his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating [...] "the fact that <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a black actor is beside the point, I'm an actor first". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series.|$|E
