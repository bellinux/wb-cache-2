He examines some food items provided for him, and notes that they are edible, yet clearly not made of any familiar substance from Earth. Kubrick's film leaves all this unstated.|$|E

The paper {{on the role of}} earthworms in soil formation was read out by Darwin at the Geological Society of London on 1 November 1837. This was an uncommonly mundane subject for the society, and his peers may have hoped to hear of something more grandiose, even seeing this paper as highlighting Darwin's growing idiosyncrasies. The leading geologist William Buckland subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as [...] "a new & important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence {{on the surface of the}} <b>Earth—in</b> fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} reported {{detecting the}} spectral signatures of anthracene and pyrene in the ultraviolet light emitted by the Red Rectangle nebula (no other such complex molecules {{had ever been}} found before in outer space). This discovery was considered a confirmation of a hypothesis that as nebulae of the same type as the Red Rectangle approach the ends of their lives, convection currents cause carbon and hydrogen in the nebulae's core to get caught in stellar winds, and radiate outward. As they cool, the atoms supposedly bond {{to each other in}} various ways and eventually form particles of a million or more atoms. The scientists inferred that since they discovered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)—which may have been vital in the formation of early life on <b>Earth—in</b> a nebula, by necessity they must originate in nebulae.|$|E
50|$|This factor {{appears to}} less {{advantage}} in the unfolding of the views concerning life after death. Throughout all periods of Babylonian-Assyrian history, the conception prevailed of a large dark cavern below the earth, {{not far from the}} Apsu—the fresh water abyss encircling and flowing underneath the <b>earth—in</b> which all the dead were gathered and where they led a miserable existence of inactivity, amid gloom and dust. Occasionally a favoured individual was permitted to escape from this general fate and placed in a pleasant island. It would appear also that the rulers were always singled out for divine grace, and in the earlier periods of the history, owing to the prevailing view that the rulers stood nearer to the Gods than other mortals, the kings were deified after death, and in some instances divine honours were paid to them even during their lifetime.|$|E
50|$|Iji {{meets with}} Dan, who {{reveals that the}} Komato are {{planning}} to destroy the planet's surface {{in an attempt to}} annihilate the remaining Tasen. Dan urges Iji to destroy the Phantom Hammer—a device that will destroy the shields currently protecting <b>Earth—in</b> order to secure time before the Alpha Strike. Iji boards a Komato ship, destroying the Phantom Hammer and a Komato sentry sent to stop her. However, another ship deploys its own Phantom Hammer, destroying the shields. Dan is kidnapped by Asha, who has caught on to Iji's plan to see Tor and awaits her {{at the end of the}} sector. Two options are available when Iji encounters Asha and Dan, and she is either able to rescue him, or he dies. If Dan dies, then Iji suffers a breakdown, and continues to talk to a non-existent Dan for the remainder of the game. Whatever the outcome, Iji encounters the remaining Tasen forces hiding in a fortified base. Here, depending on how the player has played Iji, one of three options can occur: (1) Iosa breaks in an annihilates all the Tasen, (2) some Tasen manage to escape before the break-in, or (3) the shelter opens and allow for Iji to pass through (and therefore intercept Iosa before she can kill the Tasen). Outside the base, Iji disputes with Iosa, and eventually defeats her after a prolonged fight.|$|E
30|$|The {{suggestion}} that the morphology of the geomagnetic field can be tested by inspecting the statistical distribution of palaeomagnetically-determined inclination angles has been challenged {{on the grounds that}} typical plate velocities require extremely long sampling intervals—perhaps exceeding the age of the <b>Earth—in</b> order to adequately sample the Earth’s surface. Here, we investigate this problem by means of a random walk model and conclude that an interval equivalent to Phanerozoic time (600 Myr) is generally sufficient.|$|E

40|$|The {{poems in}} Crossing {{search for the}} ineffable and numinous on <b>Earth—in</b> objects, current and {{historical}} events, natural and psychological phenomena, and in particular personae, real or imagined. This work comes from a deep nostalgia for both the past and present. Elements such as slant rhyme and refrain play a heavy role in these poems. Refrain, particularly, acts {{as a kind of}} engine for the poems, perhaps because I am so influenced by music and its mechanisms. The first section reflects these interests; the poems experiment with sound and musicality. The main experiment in these poems is the elimination of particular vowels. The question arises: can words sing without their vowels? Many of the poems in Crossing address the visual arts and music, looking for harmonic linkages between literature, painting, sculpture, music, and dance. For example, one of the long poems, “Numbers,” is partly inspired by the book and documentary The Rape of Europa, which concerns the art that was looted and lost during World War II. In a sense, the poems want to “find” lost things, to dwell in what has gone missing...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory advection-diffusion {{tests are}} {{performed}} on two regional soils-Brown Earth and Red <b>Earth-in</b> {{order to assess}} their capacity to control contaminant migration with synthetic contaminant solution of sodium sulphate with sodium concentration of 1000 mg/L. The test was designed to study the transport/attenuation behaviour of sodium {{in the presence of}} sulphate. Effective diffusion coefficient (De) that takes into consideration of attenuation processes is used. Cation exchange capacity is an important factor for the attenuation of cationic species. Monovalent sodium ion cannot usually replace other cations and the retention of sodium ion is very less. This is particularly true when chloride is anion is solution. However, sulphate is likely {{to play a role in}} the attenuation of sodium. Cation exchange capacity and type of exchangeable ions of soils are likely to play an important role. The effect of sulphate ions on the effective diffusion coefficient of sodium, in two different types of soils, of different cation exchange capacity has been studied. The effective diffusion coefficients of sodium ion for both the soils were calculated using Ogata Bank’s equation. It was shown that effective diffusion coefficient of sodium in the presence of sulphate is lower for Brown Earth than for Red Earth due to exchange of sodium with calcium ions from the exchangeable complex of clay. The soil with the higher cation exchange retained more sodium. Consequently, the breakthrough times and the number of pore volumes of sodium ion increase with the cation exchange capacity of soil...|$|E
