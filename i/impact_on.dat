The proposed action recommends a portion of WSAs 030 - 401 / 040 - 408 Adobe Town for wilderness designation (10, 920 acres) and a portion for nonwilderness designation (74, 790 acres). The proposed action also recommends all of WSA 030 - 407 Ferris Mountains for wilderness designation (22, 245 acres). Several significant environmental issues were developed during the study process. Issues common to both WSAs include: (1) <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> wilderness values, (2) <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> energy and mineral development, (3) <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> raptors, and (4) <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> recreational off-road vehicle (ORV) use.

Appropriate regulations {{ensure that the}} ordinance protects the interests of residents and the environment while allowing a developer to build a profitable and productive wind facility.

Ordinances which require the following items will most likely limit or eliminate all negative impacts associated with wind energy facilities:  Appropriate setback distances of turbines from populated areas and environmentally sensitive areas.  Pre-construction studies to predict potential impacts.  The submission of mitigation plans before construction.  Consultation with environmental agencies and experts when determining mitigation measures for environmental impacts.

40|$|Abstract: In {{assessing}} {{the impacts of}} information communication technologies (ICTs) on tourism businesses, this study adopted a case study blueprint, with a questionnaire survey being used to collect data from selected tourism businesses. The respondents rated ICT <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> tourism on a 5 - point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ (1) to “strongly agree” (5). The {{results show that the}} <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> hotels were perceived as ranging from 4. 07 (improved company image) to 4. 92 (increased market share), whereas the <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> bed and breakfast establishments were perceived as ranging from 3. 88 (improved company image) to 4. 86 (speeded up service). The <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> travel agents were perceived as ranging from 4. 48 (improved service quality) to 4. 94 (improved service quality), whereas the <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> tour guides were perceived as ranging from 4. 58 (improved company image) to 4. 81 (heightened customer satisfaction levels). The <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> backpackers were perceived as ranging from 3. 78 (improved company image) to 4. 75 (increased market share). Since ICT was perceived to <b>impact</b> relatively little <b>on</b> company image improvement, tourism businesses should use such technology to improve company image.

40|$|Jennifer Manlove, Heather Fish, Kristin Anderson Moore Child Trends, Bethesda, MD, USA Background: US {{adolescents}} {{have high}} rates of teen pregnancy, childbearing, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), highlighting the need to identify and implement effective programs that will help improve teen sexual and reproductive health. Materials and methods: This review identified 103 random-assignment evaluations of 85 programs that incorporated intent-to-treat analyses and assessed <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> pregnancy, childbearing, STIs, and their key determinants – sexual activity, number of sexual partners, condom use, and other contraceptive use – among teens. This review describes the evidence base for five broad program approaches, including abstinence education, comprehensive sex education, clinic-based programs, youth development programs, and parent–youth relationship programs. We also describe programs with <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> key outcomes, including pregnancy/childbearing, STIs, and those that found <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> both sexual activity and contraceptive use. Results: Our review identified 52 effective programs: 38 with consistent <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> reproductive health outcomes, and 14 with mixed findings (across subpopulations, follow-ups, or multiple measures of a single outcome). We found {{that a variety of}} program approaches produced <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Parent–youth relationship programs and clinic-based program evaluations more frequently showed impacts than other program approaches, although we also identified a number of abstinence-education, comprehensive sex education, and youth-development programs with <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Overall, we identified nine program evaluations with <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> teen pregnancies or births, five with <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> reducing STIs, and 15 with <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> both delaying/reducing sexual activity and increasing contraceptive use (including condom use). Conclusion: Future efforts should conduct replications of existing program evaluations, identify implementation components linked to impacts, rigorously evaluate programs that appear promising, and expand the evidence base <b>on</b> programs that <b>impact</b> hormonal and long-acting contraceptive method use.
