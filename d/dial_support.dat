50|$|The Canon EOS 50 (also {{known as}} the ELAN II in America and the EOS 55 in Japan) is an autofocus, {{autoexposure}} 35mm SLR camera. It was aimed at the advanced amateur market, and featured a rear command <b>dial,</b> <b>support</b> for custom functions, and an optional BP-50 battery grip, with a dedicated portrait shutter release. The body was constructed of plastic, with the lens mount and top deck enclosed in an aluminium cover.|$|E

(a serial communications / terminal emulation program) and the System/75 BBS software written for the DOS operating systems. System/75 BBS was a full featured message board and file sharing center.

The LRA itself appeared {{settled into}} their Sudanese base camps and only periodically crossed the border. [...] Some {{of the hundreds}} of thousands of civilians displaced by the war began to return to their homes. The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly of the day when the [...] "protected camps" [...] would be disbanded.|$|R
50|$|Compuspec {{has also}} {{developed}} enhanced {{versions of this}} <b>dialler</b> technology that <b>support</b> voice prompts for customer-specific feature selection, softcall blocking, alternate network access multiple access dialler and anti-fraud detection and prevention. With softcall blocking, calls to certain destinations are automatically limited in duration or prevented. Alternate network access is useful where network reliability requires fall-back to alternative networks. Payphone anti-fraud diallers (typically used in payphones) detect 12 types of phone fraud. New diallers also allow some call destinations to be routed via low cost VoIP carriers.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{tutorial}} {{and reference}} manual for DIAL, a diagrammatic animation language that allows parallel processes {{to be represented}} in a compact graphical "time line". DIAL provides a soft animation machine whose instruction set is determined by a user-provided backend. Unlike more recent animation notations that rely on bitmapped displays, and hence on special editors and extensive run-time <b>support,</b> <b>DIAL</b> requires only a conventional full-screen editor for editing and no run-time support beyond its compact interpreter. DIAL is implemented in C and runs {{on a wide variety}} of System V and Berkeley versions of UNIX...|$|R

Speaker-dependent voice <b>dialling</b> is also <b>supported</b> by the mobile. The phone also has volume keys in its side which makes it easy for volume increment and decrement. The input is through numeric keypad and Soft keys. It also has the feature of Predictive Text Input. The SAR head is 1.46 W/kg and that of body is 0.35 W/kg.|$|R
5000|$|Following the incident, Jiang Qing, in {{a speech}} to Red Guard {{organizations}} in Henan province, introduced the idea of [...] "use words to attack but use arms to defend" [...] (i.e. wen-gong wu-wei). The incendiary remarks were taken by rebel organizations around the country as an endorsement of armed struggle, and led to the escalation of violent factional clashes across the country. The ensuing violence, some of which were directed squarely at various local PLA units, led Mao and his radical supporters to <b>dial</b> back their <b>support</b> for armed rebellion, likely due to their fears of a more widespread PLA reprisal. In order to appease the PLA and calm nerves among senior military leaders, Wang Li was arrested in August 1967, then scapegoated as the main instigator of the factional violence in Wuhan and sent to prison.|$|R
50|$|Every {{place in}} the {{countries}} and territories of the NANP already belongs to a numbering plan area (NPA). Assigning a new area code requires either geographically splitting an existing numbering plan area (split plan) and reassigning the subscribers in the new, smaller area to a new area code, or assigning an additional area code to an existing numbering plan area, which is called an overlay plan. The first new area codes were geographic splits, until the geographical areas were at risk of becoming unreasonably small. Since then, most new area codes are overlaid. When a numbering plan area {{has more than one}} area code, telephone companies usually can no longer <b>support</b> <b>dialing</b> seven-digit local numbers, and require ten-digit dialing for all calls within the geographical area. Imposing ten-digit dialing for local calls effectively converts every local number in these geographical areas into a ten-digit local number. Universal ten-digit local numbering is arguably inevitable, as more geographical areas get overlaid.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mothers In Motion (MIM), a {{community-based}} lifestyle behavioral intervention, {{was designed}} and conducted to help low-income overweight and obese young mothers prevent further weight gain via promotion of stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. This paper presents intervention effect on body weight (primary outcome) and summarizes lessons learned. Methods Participants (N[*]=[*] 612) were recruited from 7 Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) offices in Michigan and were individually randomized to an intervention n=[*] 410) or a comparison (n[*]= 202) group (2 : 1 ratio). During the 16 -week intervention, intervention participants watched theory-based culturally sensitive videos (in DVD format) featuring peers from the target audience to learn skills for managing stress, eating healthier, and being more physically active. They also <b>dialed</b> into peer <b>support</b> group teleconferences to enhance skills learned in the videos and increase motivation for lifestyle behavioral changes. Body weight, the primary outcome, was measured at baseline, immediately after the 16 -week intervention, and 3  months after the 16 -week intervention. Intervention effect was tested via general linear mixed model for repeated measures, using baseline measures as adjusting covariates. Results At baseline, {{the mean age of}} the participants was 28. 5 [*]±[*] 5. 0  years (intervention: 28. 4 [*]±[*] 5. 0, comparison: 28. 9 [*]±[*] 5. 0); the mean body weight was 190. 2 [*]±[*] 1. 4 lbs (intervention: 191. 8 [*]±[*] 30. 0, comparison: 188. 5 [*]±[*] 29. 1); and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32. 2 [*]±[*] 4. 4 (intervention: 32. 2 [*]±[*] 4. 4, comparison: 31. 7 [*]±[*] 4. 2). Of sample, 64. 7 % were obese. At 3  months after the 16 -week intervention, no significant weight differences were found between the intervention (188. 3 [*]±[*] 10. 6 lbs, BMI: 31. 6 [*]±[*] 1. 8) and comparison groups (187. 7 [*]±[*] 10. 6 lbs, BMI: 31. 53 [*]±[*] 1. 8) when controlling for baseline body weight. Conclusions This lifestyle behavioral intervention that focused on stress management, healthy eating and physical activity was not effective in helping low-income overweight and obese young mothers prevent further weight gain.
