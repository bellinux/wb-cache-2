40|$|Exposure of {{the mature}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed to water {{results in the}} rapid release of pectinaceous {{mucilage}} from the outer cells of the testa. Once released, mucilage completely envelops the seed in a gel-like capsule. The physical force required to rupture the outer cell wall of the testa comes from the swelling of the mucilage as it expands rapidly following hydration. In this study, we show that mutations in the transcriptional regulator LEUNIG_HOMOLOG (LUH) cause a mucilage <b>extrusion</b> <b>defect</b> due to altered mucilage swelling. Based on sugar linkage and immunomicroscopic analyses, we show that the structure of luh mucilage is altered, having both an increase in substituted rhamnogalacturonan I and in methyl-esterified homogalacturonan. Also correlated with the structural modification of luh mucilage is {{a significant decrease in}} MUCILAGE MODIFIED 2 (MUM 2; a β-galactosidase) expression in the luh seed coat, raising the possibility that reduced activity of this glycosidase is directly responsible for the luh mucilage defects. Consistent with this is the structural similarity between mum 2 and luh mucilage as well as the observation that elevating MUM 2 expression in luh mutants completely suppresses the mucilage <b>extrusion</b> <b>defect.</b> Suppression of the luh mutant phenotype was also observed when LEUNIG, a transcriptional corepressor closely related to LUH, was introduced in luh mutants {{under the control of the}} LUH promoter.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Plateout is an <b>extrusion</b> <b>defect</b> that has caused formulators and processors major problems {{throughout the history of}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) processing. It is an unwanted deposit that forms on the die, calibration and degassing sections of extrusion equipment that can cause unacceptable streaking and scoring on the final product through continued deposition. Extrusion companies must therefore periodically strip their equipment to stop excessive formation, but the downtime associated with this cleaning procedure is obviously costly. The purpose of this thesis is to develop an understanding of the lubrication mechanisms within lead stabilised rigid PVC compounds using polyethylene (PE) wax as a source for external lubrication, in order to make formulation recommendations to minimise plateout. Plateout samples supplied by commercial processors were analysed to identify deposit prone additives. Of the techniques investigated, laser ionisation mass analysis (LIMA), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and infra-red spectroscopy by the diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform (DRIFT) method identified calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide and dibasic lead phosphite as the bulk of die plateout. Additive interactions were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hot-stage microscopy. Majority of the additives in a lead stabilised window profile formulation did not interact, but molten calcium stearate and normal lead stearate did not recrystallise when mixed together. To simulate commercial processes, a laboratory-scale twin-screw extruder equipped with a plateout sensitive die was used to analyse window profile formulations containing various homopolymer grades of PE wax and oxidised PE or high-density PE lubricants. Structural properties that influence physical properties such as melting point and viscosity were related to their tendency to plateout. The influence of calcium stearate and normal lead stearate dosage on lubrication and plateout performance was also investigated using experimental design...|$|E

Outline of the is as follows: At first, cavity of pipe, or channel material, is filled up by liquid of low temperaturemelting material, for instances, {{low temperature melting}} alloy, ice (or water) and wax. Then low temperaturemelting material is solidified to be a soluble core of pipe. Authors call this soluble core the ‘lost core [1 - 4]. ’ Thethird, the material is compressed longitudinally as a composite billet, and extruded for lateral direction. Afterdeformation, low temperature melting material is melted and removed. The authors think the process is suitablefor production of cross-fittings because such the product has constant sections for lateral direction. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have examined the process with experiments [1] and numericalanalysis with ANSYS 9. 0.

Then by heat treatment the strength/hardness of the material is properly adjusted and after that the pressure vessel parts have to be continuously inspected with an inspection and handling cycle time of 3 s. Inspection of the axis-symmetric parts is asked for surface breaking extrusion defects as well as for surface parallel delaminations in the bulk volume. Futhermore, the material strength is a quality characteristic that has to be nondestructively registered and documented. The inspection is performed by eddy current probes and an EMAT, of which the eddy current impedance measurements are used for surface-breaking <b>extrusion</b> <b>defect</b> detection and sizing (single frequency technique with digit al locus curve filtering) and strength characterization (3 -frequency technique with digital filtering for signal-to-noise enhancement).

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{effects of}} tensile stresses in liquids. Areas of application include bearing lubrication and polymer processing, in which liquids may {{be subjected to}} hydrostatic tension or large shear stresses. 	A primary thrust {{of this research is}} the development of a criterion for liquid failure, or cavitation, based upon the general state of stress in the liquid. A variable pressure, rotating inner cylinder, Couette viscometer has been designed and used to test a hypothesized cavitation criterion. The criterion, that cavitation will occur when a principal normal stress in a liquid becomes more tensile than some critical stress, is supported by the results of experiments with the viscometer for a Newtonian liquid. Based upon experimental observation of cavitation, a model for cavitation inception from crevice stabilized gas nuclei, and gaseous, as opposed to vaporous, cavitation is hypothesized. 	The cavitation inception model is investigated through numerical simulation, primarily using the boundary element method. Only Newtonian liquids are modeled, and, for simulation purposes, the model is reduced to two dimensions and the limit of negligible inertia is considered. The model includes contact line dynamics. Mass transport of dissolved gas through the liquid and in or out of the gas nucleus is considered. The numerical simulations provide important information about the probable nature of cavitation nucleation sites as well as conditions for cavitation inception. 	The cavitation criterion predicts cavitation in simple shear, which has implications for rheological measurements. It can cause apparent shear thinning and thixotropy. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting a possible link between shear cavitation and <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects</b> such as sharkskin. A variable pressure capillary tube viscometer was designed and constructed to investigate a hypothesized relationship between shear cavitation and <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects.</b> Results indicate that despite the occasional coincidence of occurrence of cavitation and sharkskin defects, cavitation cannot explain the onset of <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects.</b> 	If nuclei are removed, then liquids can withstand a negative hydrostatic pressure. A falling body viscometer has been constructed and used to investigate the effect of negative pressures on viscosity. It is found that current pressure viscosity models can be accurately extrapolated to experimentally achievable negative pressures. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Ward O.

Backward extrusion is a popular industrial technique for the manufacture of tube and cans. This report serves to examine the forming loads, metal flow and <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects</b> arising during the backward extrusion of aluminium cups. The report surveys the literature of extrusion with particular interest in backward extrusion. Extrusion was carried out {{with the aid of a}} specially constructed 50 mm backward extrusion tool designed and manufactured by the author. Five extrusion ratios were examined, using both the direct and indirect extrusion directions and flat, conical and nosed punch ends were used to examine metal flow and forming loads for various punch profiles. Forming loads were found to be much greater for direct extrusion and the usual relationship was derived for load/extrusion ratio characteristics. The effects of friction and lubrication were examined and these effects on load and flow patterns were noted. Incremental forming of split billets with grids scribed on the mid-plane was carried out for a variety of punch profiles. This revealed the evidence of a dead metal region forming and arc below the end of flat punches. The geometry of dead metal regions was compared with that derived by an upper bound technique and found to agree well. Also, upper bound loads using this model were derived and found to compare favourably. Forming using conical punch profiles showed that the adoption of a smooth profile similar in geometry to the dead metal zone reduced extrusion leads significantly. <b>Extrusion</b> <b>defects</b> were examined and found to fall into three categories, namely cavitation, internal cracking and shearing of the corner. Cavitation was found to occur when the base thickness becomes smaller than the wall thickness, which was also proved theoretically. Also cracking was found to occur only at large extrusion ratios during direct extrusion. Finally, in the light of conclusions drawn from the work, recommendations were made as to suggestions for further work which could usefully continue the present work...|$|R

40|$|Sheet metal {{extrusion}} is a {{metal forming}} {{process in which}} the movement of a punch penetrates a sheet metal surface and it flows through a die orifice; the extruded parts can be deflected to have an extrusion cavity and protrusion on the opposite side. Therefore, this process results in a narrow region of highly localized plastic deformation due to the formation and microstructure effect on the work piece. This research investigated the characteristics of the material-flow behavior during the formation and its effect on the microstructure of the extruded sheet metal using the finite element method (FEM). The actual parts and FEM simulation model were developed using a blank material made from AISI- 1045 steel with a thickness of 5 [*]mm; the material’s behavior was determined subject to the punch penetration depths of 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % of the sheet thickness.

Numerical simulations of extrusion revealed an advantage of the die bearing cooling, which {{can be accomplished by}} locating the cooling channels close to the die/bearing surface.

To {{prepare for the}} next contraction, myocytes must extrude calcium from intracellular space via the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX 1) or sequester it into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, via the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase 2 (SERCA 2). In mammals, defective calcium extrusion correlates with increased intracellular calcium levels and may be relevant to heart failure and sarcoplasmic dysfunction in adults. We report here that mutation of the cardiac-specific NCX 1 (NCX 1 h) gene causes embryonic lethal cardiac arrhythmia in zebrafish tremblor (tre) embryos. The tre ventricle is nearly silent, whereas the atrium manifests a variety of arrhythmias including fibrillation. Calcium <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects</b> in tre mutants correlate with severe disruptions in sarcomere assembly, whereas mutations in the L-type calcium channel that abort calcium entry do not produce this phenotype. Knockdown of SERCA 2 activity by morpholino-mediated translational inhibition or pharmacological inhibition causes embryonic lethality due to defects in cardiac contractility and morphology but, in contrast to tre mutation, does not produce arrhythmia. Analysis of intracellular calcium levels indicates that homozygous tre embryos develop calcium overload, which {{may contribute to the}} degeneration of cardiac function in this mutant. Thus, the inhibition of NCX 1 h versus SERCA 2 activity differentially affects the pathophysiology of rhythm in the developing heart and suggests that relative levels of NCX 1 and SERCA 2 function are essential for normal development...|$|R

The presence of <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects</b> and raw material impurities were shown to degrade properties with respect to wrought alloys. The performance of LCAs was investigated for several alloys and cell morphologies. The results showed that out-of-plane properties exceeded model predictions and in-plane properties fell short due to missing cell walls and similar defects. Strength was shown to outperform several existing cellular metals by as much as an order of magnitude in some instances. Energy absorption of these materials was shown to exceed 150 J/cc at strains of 50 % for high strength alloys. Finally, the suitability of LCAs as an energetic capsule was investigated. The investigation found that the LCAs added significant static strength and as much as three to five times improvement in the dynamic strength of the system. More importantly, it was shown that the pressures achieved with the LCA capsule were significantly higher than the energetic material could achieve alone. High pressures, approaching 3 GPa, coupled with the fragmentation of the capsule during impact increased the likelihood of initiation and propagation of the energetic reaction.

40|$|Abstract––In extrusion, {{the desired}} shape is {{obtained}} by plastic deformation of the billet material achieved by forcing {{it through a}} die. In any simple homogeneous and uniaxial compression (or tension), the metal flows plastically when the stress reaches {{the value of the}} flow stress. Once the applied force exceeds the shear strength of the material, sticking friction at the container surface becomes the dominant friction mode, and deformation takes place through shear in the bulk of the material. Non homogeneous metal flow through an extrusion die can directly affect product quality, productivity and die life. The complexity of a die profile is an indicator of {{how difficult it is to}} extrude the profile. Some investigations about the effect of die complexity on extrusion pressure, product quality and die life can be found in this published literature. However the effect of profile complexity on metal flow through the extrusion die has not been explored much. such a study can directly contribute toward die design improvement and reduction of <b>extrusion</b> <b>defects</b> related to metal flow. This article investigates the effect of shape complexity on the dead metal zone(DMZ) and metal flow through cold extrusion experiments and finite element simulations on some solid profiles.

40|$|Two {{critical}} {{stages of}} mammalian oocyte regulation are prophase I arrest, {{which is important}} for sustaining the oocyte pool, and the progression through meiosis I (MI) to produce fertilizable eggs. We {{have found that the}} spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR 1 regulates both stages in mouse oocytes. We show that oocytes depleted of BubR 1 cannot sustain prophase I arrest and readily undergo germinal vesicle breakdown, a marker for reentry into MI. BubR 1 -depleted oocytes then arrest before completing M 1, marked by failure of polar body <b>extrusion.</b> Both meiotic <b>defects</b> in BubR 1 -depleted oocytes are due to reduced activity of the master regulator known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), brought about through diminished levels of the APC coactivator Cdh 1...|$|R
30|$|In summary, we {{proposed}} the nano-CZ growth {{mechanism for the}} catalytic growth of CNTs. Within the nano-CZ mechanism, the catalyst particle acts as a nano crucible to nucleate and maintain the CNT growth, a chiral CNT grows in a screw extrusion manner. The nano-CZ model will lead to an uneven quality distribution along the CNT as confirmed by many groups [43 – 45], and we attribute the phenomenon mainly to the dynamic GRD of defects in the CNT during its growth. It {{should be noted that}} there may be certain limitations to the nano-CZ mechanism, and the details of the CNT screw <b>extrusion</b> and the <b>defect</b> dynamics need further in-depth investigations. The proposed nano-CZ mechanism may also apply to the catalytic growth of many other 1 D nanostructures; the recent growths of ZnO nanotubes and nanowires have shown similar behaviors [46]. Since material properties strongly depend on the corresponding structural quality, local physical and chemical properties are expected to change along these 1 D nanostructures. By exploring the nano-CZ model further, it is promising to obtain CNTs and many other 1 D nanomaterials with desired properties for various applications.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, there has been {{considerable}} attention {{to the evolution of}} Al-based MMCs developed by powder metallurgy (P/M) route of manufacturing. The main advantage of this kind of manufacturing process is the good distribution of reinforcing particles, low processing temperature and the ability to produce near net shape products with intricate designs (Min et al. 2005; Torralba et al. 2003). A number of studies have been conducted to study the effects of reinforcement of very hard metals as well as ceramics in different grades of aluminium series of powder matrix (El-Kady and Fathy 2014; Jabbari Taleghani et al. 2014; Abdollahi et al. 2014). Layers of oxide formation take place in the P/M specimen during sintering, as aluminium is highly prone to oxide formation. During thermo-mechanical treatments, the covered oxide layer breaks due to highly induced shear stress, leading to a strongly bonded microstructure and improved mechanical properties which eliminate the main drawback of AMCs (Schatt et al. 1997). The use of traditional shear-faced die in <b>extrusion</b> causes product <b>defects</b> owing to the existence of higher velocity relative difference at die exit (Zhang et al. 2012 a; 2012 b). The use of mathematically contoured die (preferably zero, die entry and exit angle) for the MMC extrusion is highly recommendable.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possibility of multidisciplinary therapy of injury and other defects of the upper and lower jaws. The imperfections originate primary (cleft, oligodontia) or secondary (cysts, accidents, tumors, inflammation etc.). The incidence in the Czech Republic is criminal in 28 %, sports in 12 %, and home accidents in 9 %. The cleft genetic register includes at the present time more than 4500 families from Bohemia. The multidisciplinary therapy involves the following disciplines: prosthodontics, maxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, orthodontics, speech pathology, psychology, otorhinolaryngology, genetics, and social work. Dental care of adult patients is not simple. The five case reports demonstrate the prosthetic treatment of adult patients by multidisciplinary therapy: surgeon, orthodontist and prosthodontist. The aim of our therapy is to receive the integration oforthodontic treatment or surgi cal prerestorative therapy with prosthodontic restoration, to enable esthetic harmony and functional efficiency of dental arches. The case reports describe: • unfitting orthodontic treatment with central incisor <b>extrusion,</b> • bone <b>defect</b> after implant disintegration, • polytrauma after traffic accident, • status post partial resection of the right upper jaw after fibrosarcoma - rest oroantral communication and total bilateral cleft, • hypertelorism, hands and feet malformation, left side oronasal communication from palate to fornix.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{conducted}} {{a longitudinal study}} (duration 2 years), including 294 individuals (mean age 45 years, 58 % female), {{in order to examine}} associations between meniscal extrusion, knee structure, radiographic changes and risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) in a largely non-osteoarthritic cohort. Meniscal <b>extrusion,</b> tibiofemoral cartilage <b>defect</b> score and cartilage volume, and tibial plateau bone area were determined using T 1 -weighted fat-saturated magnetic resonance imaging. At baseline the presence of medial meniscal extrusion was significantly associated with body mass index (odds ratio [OR] per kg/m 2 = 1. 13, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 02 - 1. 25), past knee injury (positive versus negative history: OR = 3. 73, 95 % CI = 1. 16 - 11. 97), medial tibial bone area (OR per cm 2 = 1. 37, 95 % CI = 1. 02 - 1. 85), and osteophytes (OR per grade = 4. 89, 95 % CI = 1. 59 - 15. 02). Two-year longitudinal data revealed that medial meniscal extrusion at baseline was associated with a greater rate of loss of medial tibiofemoral cartilage volume (extrusion versus no extrusion: - 1. 4 %/year; P < 0. 05) and greater risk for increased medial femoral cartilage defects (OR = 2. 59, 95 % CI = 1. 14 - 5. 86) and lateral tibial cartilage defects (OR = 2. 64, 95 % CI = 1. 03 - 6. 76). However, the latter two associations became nonsignificant after adjustment for tibial bone area and osteophytes. This study suggests that increasing body mass index and bone size, past knee injury, and osteophytes may be causally related to meniscal extrusion. Most importantly, meniscal extrusion at baseline is associated with greater loss of knee cartilage over 2 years, and this seems to be mediated mostly by subchondral bone changes, suggesting extrusion represents one pathway between bone expansion and cartilage loss...|$|R
40|$|Extrusion is a {{continuous}} solid state deformation process which {{is widely used}} in the aluminium industry. The demand for aluminium extrudates are growing and extruders are pressurized to extrude products {{as fast as possible}} without lowering the quality of the product. Important extrusion parameters and conditions are exit temperature, extrusion speed and alloy composition. It is widely accepted in extrusion industry that <b>extrusion</b> surface <b>defects</b> increase when the extrusion speed and exit temperature are increased for a constant alloy. One of the major surface defects is the so-called die pick-up and it is presently uncertain if increase with extrusion speed (from a low 25 m/min) would result in an increase of the number of die pick-up defect. Die pick-up appears like a scratch mark or comet {{on the surface of the}} extrudate which damages the appearance. Previous research suggests that second phase particles, eutectic reactions (555 °C - 600 °C), extrusion process conditions and die conditions may influence the cause of die pick-up. However the influencing factors for die pick-up are not well established. The research started by determining the lowest melting temperature for AA 6060 alloy as this temperature limit the highest temperature above which incipient melting starts. This temperature corresponds to the eutectic melting temperature for AA 6060 alloy. Eutectic melting was only detected above 610 °C and therefore the exit temperature could be increased to a maximum of 610 °C. For an AA 6 xxx alloy system the lowest melting temperature is 555 °C if Mg 2 Si and excess silicon were present. However as Mg 2 Si may have fully dissolved into the solid solution, no reaction can take place. A preliminary investigation was conducted to study the characteristics of the newly installed extrusion control and monitoring system. Through this study the relationship between the set extrusion speed and the actual extrusion speed was established. It was found that the actual extrusion speed was lower than the set extrusion speed and was further complicated by the capacity limit of the extrusion pressure. Exit temperature measurements were accurate, however it was measured about 1 m away from the die exit. Experiments were carried out to estimate the exit temperature drop and hence the exit temperature measurements were corrected accordingly. Thus, the aim of the present research was to establish the relationship between die pick-up and extrusion conditions (extrusion speed, exit temperature and die condition) and to propose the likely formation mechanism for die pick-up. In this research AA 6060 alloy was used and was extruded at 25 m/min, 30 m/min, 35 m/min, 40 m/min and 45 m/min. The exit temperature was found to increases from 542 °C to 567 °C. Three types of die pick-up was identified which were named as normal pick-up, die line pick-up and lump pick-up. Normal pick-up occurred regardless of the extrusion speed and exit temperature; however the amount of normal pick-up did not increase when the extrusion speed was increased. Die line pick-up occurred when the extrusion speed was 45 m/min and appeared only on the die lines. Lump pick-up is not significant since it was very rare. AA 6060 (0. 4 %Mg and 0. 5 %Si) alloy has about 0. 27 % excess silicon and therefore at 555 °C, Mg 2 Si particles react with aluminium and excess silicon to form liquid. However normal pick-up and die line pick-up still occurred at temperatures lower and higher than 555 °C and therefore it confirms that eutectic reactions do not influence formation of pick-up. Therefore die pick-up is most likely to be caused due to a mechanical process rather than a metallurgical process...|$|R
