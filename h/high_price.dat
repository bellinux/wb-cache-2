5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains the <b>high</b> <b>price</b> of curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from 238U {{in a series of}} nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and <b>high</b> <b>price.</b> 245Cm and 247Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore {{could be used in}} portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E

Cannibalization was strongly associated with abuses of the compensation system and the misapplication of sales service methods.
