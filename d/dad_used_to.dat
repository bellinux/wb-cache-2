40|$|An {{advantage}} of the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is that mobile nodes can self-organize the network topology {{without the help of}} network infrastructure. However, for the perfect selforganization of the MANET, each mobile node needs to self-configure its address. Even though a mobile node configures a unique address during the booting time, its address may conflict with nodes in other MANETs since MANETs containing the same address can be merged. The address autoconfiguration protocol implemented in this work consists of the strong DAD (Duplicate Address Detection) and the weak DAD. A unique address of a node is assigned by the strong DAD during the booting time and the weak <b>DAD</b> is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> detect address conflict and resolve address conflict during the ad hoc routing. In this work, we have implemented address autoconfiguration in the IPv 6 -based MANET using AODV as the routing protocol.

Dielectric behavior of the irradiated tubers was also investigated to emphasize if microwaves treatments are suitable for food processing in terms of nutritional factor preservation. The main results of this work consist on the relevance of the water contents in potato matrixes during the baking processes since these have a crucial role to keep lossy features, to avoid thermal damages and to preserve antioxidant. The best compromise in terms of short baking time and reduced water and phenolic losses is obtained using 500 W as power input...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — IP address autoconfiguration poses a {{challenge}} for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) since {{it has to be}} done to ensure correct routing. Protocols for IP address autoconfiguration can be classified into two categories. In the stateless category, nodes in the network do not keep IP allocation information, thus duplicate address detection (<b>DAD)</b> is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> resolve possible address conflicts. Protocols in the stateful category require nodes, cooperatively or separately, to maintain state information and ensure address uniqueness. They use either a full replication or no replication scheme to maintain IP information. In this paper, we propose a quorum based IP address autoconfiguration protocol in MANETs using partial replication. Making the compromise between message overhead and data consistency, quorum voting enforces data consistency by ensuring a fresh read upon every access so that each node is configured with a unique IP address. The protocol is scalable and no central server is involved. Extensive experiments are implemented comparing the configuration latency, message overhead and address reclamation cost between our protocol and existing stateful protocols. The simulation results show that nodes are configured in lower latency and the message overhead for maintaining the network is fairly low. Moreover, the proposed protocol greatly enhances the address availability by keeping proper redundancy...|$|R
40|$|Micellar {{electrokinetic}} chromatography (MEKC) with {{diode array}} detection (<b>DAD)</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> separate two dioxin related compounds viz. 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-furan (TCDF) using 20 mM sodium cholate, 20 mM sodium tetraborate-decahydrate with 5 % v/v organic modifier (3 : 1 acetonitrile-methanol). To enhance sensitivity of detection, normal stacking mode (NSM-MEKC) which is the simplest stacking mode was used just by dissolving the analytes in water and injected into the capillary as a long plug. The hydrodynamic injection time was optimized by varying the injection time length in the ranges of 1 s, 4 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 40 s and 50 s at constant hydrodynamic pressure of 50 mbar. From the optimum injection time obtained, calibration graphs of both TCDF and TCDD were constructed to calculate the detection limit obtained. A detection sensitivity enhancement factor (SEFLOD) of 330 was achieved for 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD achieving a detection sensitivity of 0. 05 ppm while for 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF the SEFLOD was 65 with a detection sensitivity of 0. 34 ppm. Stacking efficiencies were {{compared to that of}} normal mode (NM- MEKC) whereby no stacking is involved...|$|R
