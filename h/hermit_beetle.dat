50|$|Osmoderma eremita, the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> or Russian leather beetle, is {{a species}} of European beetle in the Scarabaeidae family. Adults reach between 28 and 32 mm in length.|$|E
5000|$|Larvae {{develop in}} hole of various host plants, mainly ash (Fraxinus excelsior), beech (Fagus sylvatica) and elm (Ulmus spp.). The life cycle lasts 4-6 years. [...] Pupation occurs in spring. [...] These beetles are predatory. They {{especially}} prey <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> (Osmoderma eremita) and rose chafer (Cetonia aurata).|$|E
40|$|One {{aim of the}} MIPP Project ([URL] was {{to develop}} {{non-invasive}} monitoring methods for selected saproxylic beetles. In this paper, a method is proposed for monitoring the larvae of Osmoderma eremita in their natural habitat (i. e. hollow trees), using a conservation detection dog (CDD). Wood mould sampling (WMS), the standard method to detect <b>hermit</b> <b>beetles</b> and other saproxylic insects inside tree hollows, is time-consuming and exposes the target species and the whole saproxylic communities to some risks. In contrast, CDDs pose no risk to the species living inside trees while, at the same time, offer {{a powerful tool for}} surveying the insects. In this paper, the methods applied to train the dog are presented, together with the results for accuracy (the overall proportion of correct indications), sensitivity (the proportion of correct positive indications) and specificity (the proportion of correct negative indications) obtained once the CDD had been fully trained. Results are presented for nitrocellulose filters with the odour of the target species, for larvae living inside hollow trees, for frass and for the remains of adults. A comparison of the efficiency between CDD and WMS showed that employing the dog was much less time-consuming than WMS. The literature on training CDDs for nature conservation tasks, with particular reference to cases involving Coleoptera, was also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} {{analysis was}} carried out on the European <b>hermit</b> <b>beetles</b> (the Osmoderma eremita species complex) to explore their genetic diversification and the robustness of previous morphologically based taxonomic arrangements. Complete sequences of mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase I gene were obtained from 26 individuals. Mean levels of interspecific sequence divergence ranged from 0. 044 to 0. 186. The results indicate a clear-cut distinction between two clades. The first one includes the W-European O. eremita Scopoli 1763; and the two Italian endemic taxa Osmoderma italicum Sparacio, 2000 and Osmoderma cristinae Sparacio, 1994; from southern peninsular Italy and Sicily, respectively. The second one includes the widespread E-European Osmoderma barnabita; and the southern Balcanic Osmoderma lassallei Baraud and Tauzin, 1991 from Greece and European Turkey. Within the two clades, molecular and morphological data well support a specific rank for O. lassallei and O. barnabita on one side, and for O. eremita and O. cristinae on the other side, while the taxonomic position of O. italicum, {{more closely related to}} O. eremita, is still uncertain. Current geographical distribution, interspecific genetic diversification, and very low levels of intraspecific genetic divergence in western European populations of O. eremita sensu stricto are hypothesized {{to be the result of}} multiple speciation events (mainly occurred in refugial forest areas of the Italian and Balkan peninsulas and Sicily before and during the Pleistocene glacial peaks), followed by fast post-glacial northward and westward expansion of some specie...|$|R

It includes, firstly, {{an analysis of the}} habitat requirements of the violet click beetle, Limoniscus violaceus, and secondly, an analysis of the association of several saproxylic beetles with the presence of the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle,</b> Osmoderma barnabita, in hollows...|$|E
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} are {{the most}} important insect parasites, therefore they are used in the production of biopreparations. Application of nematode based biopreparations in biological methods of pest control has many positive and negative features, some of them, however, raise some doubts. Particularly doubtful features are the selectivity in colonising and killing potential hosts by nematodes. Apart from pests, the ecosystems to which entomophilous nematodes have been introduced are inhabited by benefi cial insects and those that are legally protected. One of such species is the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> (Osmoderma eremita), very endangered and strictly protected species according to the Bern Convention, listed in the second and fourth appendix to the Habitat Directive and mentioned in many European Red Books e. g. in Red List of Nearly Extinct and Endangered Animals in Poland and in Polish Red Book of Animals. The marbled rose chafer Protaetia lugubris, in spite of its rarity it is not the protected species. Its habitat preferences {{are similar to those of}} the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle,</b> which makes it potentially endangered in the same way as O. eremita. Kornelia Kucharsk...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the thesis that ecological ideas have a strong impact on state politics. Examples confirming this thesis include three very well-known cases of change of a decision by politicians as a result of protest campaigns carried on by ecologists. The first example is the suspension of the felling of trees in the Białowieska Forest, the second one refers to the change of the route of the Augustów ring road, and the third one is the suspension of construction of the road because of the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle.</b> Conclusions of the paper are general in nature: unconventional initiatives of ecological activists attract the government’s attention to their activity and, at the same time, induce them to change their earlier decisions...|$|E
40|$|The LIFE project “MIPP” - Monitoring of Insects with Public Participation (11 NAT/IT/ 000252) {{is focused}} on {{selected}} insect species (five Coleoptera, three Lepidoptera, one Orthoptera), all included in the annexes II and IV of the Habitats Directive (HD) 92 / 43 /EEC. One important aim is a citizen science initiative where every person may become a citizen scientist and collect faunistic data on the above species throughout Italy. Another objective of the project MIPP {{is the development of}} standard methods for monitoring the conserva- tion status of the five target beetle species. One innovative method employed is a sniffer-dog (“Osmodog”), trained to find the rare and endangered <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle,</b> Osmoderma eremita, which lives in veteran, hollow trees. The dog detects the strong smell of mature peach produced by adult males and an odor produced by the larvae. Another objective of the project MIPP is the dissemination of topics such as HD, Natura 2000, importance of dead-wood, Life projects, insect monitoring and conservation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>Hermit</b> <b>beetle,</b> Osmoderma eremita (Coleoptera: Cetoniidae) is an emblematic and {{endangered}} species of the saproxylic communities. A monitoring programme was planned for ten years in France (Sarthe department) to gain a best understanding of the local conservation stakes of this protected species. The monitoring includes capture – mark – recapture and radio-tracking methods to analyse the occupancy rate of hollow trees, {{the size of the}} populations and the dispersal behaviour of the adults. We present in particular the data collected during the fi rst season of radio-tracking of this programme. No dispersal was observed with capture – mark – recapture but this method brought out the adults emerged in small numbers (one to seven adults per tree). Radio-tracking enabled the observation of the movements of one individual. The range of these movements reached almost 700 m. Such a distance had never been observed and could lead to new insights about the dispersal abilities of O. eremita. Furthermore, this observation led us to first considerations regarding the management of chesnut orchards, a key habitat for conservation of O. eremita in Sarthe department (France). Particularly, we emphasized the potential positive effect of keeping grafted trees producing drupes and the potential negative effect of coppices on the effi ciency of individual movements...|$|E
40|$|Pheromone {{monitoring}} {{could provide}} unique {{spatial and temporal}} information about rare and threatened insect species for conservation purposes. Pheromone traps may be especially valuable in detecting fluctuations and declines in vulnerable species, if trap catch {{can be related to}} population density. We exploited the pheromone-kairomone system of the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> Osmoderma eremita and its predator, the red click beetle Elater ferrugineus, to monitor variation in their flight activity during 7 years (2001 – 2002, 2005 – 2009). Spatial and temporal flight activity of O. eremita and E. ferrugineus were highly correlated over individual trap replicates and trap days. Yearly flight activities of both species were correlated within two core sites included during all years of the study, and positively affected by temperature both within and between years. Flight activity could not be directly translated to variation in abundance in either species, however. Dispersal rate was likely the main factor explaining flight activity in O. eremita. Normalizing the flight activity of E. ferrugineus against that of O. eremita did not eliminate most of the variability, however, suggesting that flight activity of E. ferrugineus was governed both by dispersal rate and by population density. Higher fluctuations in population density of E. ferrugineus likely render it more vulnerable to local extinction, which may explain the greater rarity of this species. We suggest that preserving large assemblies of suitable hollow trees would be absolutely essential for buffering against stochastic population fluctuations and securing the long-term persistence of E. ferrugineus...|$|E
40|$|To {{predict how}} organisms cope with habitat {{fragmentation}} {{we must understand}} their dispersal biology, which can be notoriously difficult. We used a novel, multi-pronged approach to study dispersal strategies in the endangered saproxylic <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> Osmoderma eremita, exploiting its pheromone system to intercept high numbers of dispersing individuals, which is not possible with other methods. Mark-release-recapture, using unbaited pitfall traps inside oak hollows and pheromone-baited funnel traps suspended from tree branches, was combined with radio telemetry (in females only) to record displacements. Dispersal, modelled as a probability distribution of net displacement, {{did not differ significantly}} between sexes (males versus females recaptured), observation methods (females recaptured versus radio-tracked), or sites of first capture (pitfall trap in tree versus pheromone trap – distance from original dispersal point unknown). A model including all observed individuals yielded a mean displacement of 82 m with 1 % dispersing 1 km. Differences in body length were small between individuals captured in pitfall versus pheromone traps, indicating that dispersal is rarely a condition-dependent response in O. eremita. Individuals captured in pheromone traps were consistently lighter, indicating that most dispersal events occur relatively late in life, which agrees with trap catch data. In addition, most (79 %) females captured in pheromone traps were mated, showing that females typically mate before leaving their natal tree. Our data show that integrating odour attractants into insect conservation biology provides a means to target dispersing individuals and could greatly improve our knowledge of dispersal biology in threatened species...|$|E
40|$|Population EcologyInternational audienceEstimating {{demographic}} parameters in {{rare species}} is challenging {{because of the}} low number of individuals and their cryptic behaviour. One way to address this challenge is to gather data from several regions or years through mark-release-recapture (MRR) and radiotrackingmonitoring. However, the comparison of demographic estimates obtained using these methods has rarely been investigated. Using 5 years of intensive MRR and radio-tracking surveys of an elusive and endangered saproxylic insect, the <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> (Osmoderma eremita), in two regions of France, we aimed to estimate population size at the adult stage for each sex separately and to assess differences in demographic parameter estimates between survey methods. We found that males were approximately {{three times more likely}} to be recaptured than females. Taking this into account, we determined that the sex ratio was male-biased in almost all populations, except in Malus trees, where it was female-biased. Temporal fluctuations of sex ratios were also detected in one region. The radiotracking transmitter (450 mg) allowed only the largestindividuals ([2 g) to be targeted. However, we found that, among non-equipped individuals, the larger males survived better than the smaller males. We also confirmed that transmitter-equipped individuals survived approximately 25 % better than non-equipped individuals. Extrapolatingthe estimates from radio-tracking surveys to the population scale may result in overly optimistic population projections. Our results revealed large temporal and spatial variations in population size and sex ratios. This knowledge is crucial for predicting the persistence of smallpopulations in fragmented landscapes. This study also questioned the representativeness of radio-tracking surveys for insect species in estimating demographic parameters at the population scale...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{molecular}} {{analysis on the}} European hermit beetles (the Osmoderma eremita species-complex), recently published in a companion paper, are shortly dis- cussed and commented. These results indicate a clear-cut distinction between two clades. The first one includes the W-European O. eremita Scopoli, 1763, and the two Italian endemic taxa O. italicum Sparacio, 2000 and O. cristinae Sparacio, 1994, from southern peninsular Italy and Sicily, respectively. The second one includes the widespread E-European O. barnabita Motschulsky, 1845 (nom. resurr.), and the southern Balcanic O. lassallei Baraud & Tauzin, 1991 from Greece and European Turkey. Within the two clades, molecular data well support a specific rank for O. lassallei and O. barn­abita on one side, and of O. eremita and O. cristinae on the other side, while the taxonomic position of O. italicum, more closely related with O. eremita, is still uncertain, waiting for analysis of additional specimens of this very rare taxon. Current geographical distribution, interspecific genetic diversification, and relatively low levels of intraspecific genetic divergence in O. eremita sensu stricto, are hypothesized {{to be the result}} of multiple speciation events (mainly occurred in refugial forest areas of the Italian and Balkan peninsulas and Sicily before and during the Pleistocene glacial peaks), followed by fast post-glacial northward and westward expansion of some species. The need of further genetic data on the rare and threatened <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> species and the importance of more detailed information on their distribution ranges are emphasized and discussed, in order to plan conservation strategies in the near future. An updated worldwide checklist of the species of the genus Osmoderma is finally presented...|$|E
40|$|Hermit beetles of {{the genus}} Osmoderma (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae) {{are known for their}} fruity odour, which is {{released}} in large amounts by males. Two species {{of the genus}} occur in Europe, the eastern Osmoderma barnabita (Motschulsky) and the western Osmoderma eremita (Scopoli). Previous studies on Swedish populations of O. eremita showed that the compound responsible for the characteristic scent, gamma-decalactone, functions as a sex pheromone for the attraction of conspecific females. Male O. eremita only release the (R) -enantiomer of the lactone, and both sexes are anosmic to the opposite enantiomer. As the distribution areas of the two <b>hermit</b> <b>beetle</b> species partly overlap, it may be expected that they use different enantiomeric compositions of gamma-decalactone as pheromones to promote species discrimination. This paper reports on the identification of the sex pheromone of O. barnabita. Surprisingly, males from a Polish population produce only the (R) -enantiomer of gamma-decalactone, and conspecific females show equal attraction to the (R) -enantiomer and a racemic mixture of the compound, indicating that O. barnabita is anosmic to the (S) -enantiomer, similarly to what was observed for O. eremita. A mtDNA sequence analysis of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene of Polish and Swedish beetles confirmed their taxonomical status as O. barnabita and O. eremita, respectively, with an average sequence divergence of 10. 5 % between beetles from the two studied areas. Although genetic data suggest that these species diverged several million years ago, they still rely on the same enantiomer of gamma-decalactone for mate finding. Thus, the male-produced pheromone in Osmoderma spp. may be regarded as a territorial signal being exploited by females, rather than a cue for determining species identity. Our data show that the same compound can be used to facilitate monitoring of both beetle species, which are considered indicator species of the species-rich fauna of saproxylic insects in Europe...|$|E
40|$|The Life Project "Monitoring {{of insects}} with public participation" (LIFE 11 NAT/IT/ 000252) had {{as the main}} {{objective}} to develop and test methods for the monitoring of five beetle species listed in the Annexes of the Habitats Directive (92 / 43 /EEC) : Osmoderma eremita (<b>hermit</b> <b>beetle,</b> Scarabaeidae), Lucanus cervus (European stag beetle, Lucanidae), Cerambyx cerdo (great capricorn beetle, Cerambycidae), Rosalia alpina (rosalia longicorn, Cerambycidae) and Morimus asper/funereus (morimus longicorn, Cerambycidae). The data gathered represent {{an important contribution to}} the monitoring of these target species in Italy. The methods developed for monitoring of the target species are intended for use by the local management authorities and staff of protected areas. These developed methods are the result of extensive fieldwork and ensure scientific validity, ease of execution and limited labour costs. The detailed description of methods and the results for each species are published in separate articles of this special issue of Nature Conservation. A second objective of the project was to gather faunistic data with a Citizen Science approach, using the web and a mobile application software (app) specifically built for mobile devices. The validation of the records collected by the citizens was carried out by experts, based on photographs, which were obligatory for all records. Dissemination activities represented the principal way to contact and engage citizens for the data collection and also offered the possibility of providing information on topics such as Natura 2000, the Habitats Directive, the role of monitoring in nature conservation, the importance of forest ecosystems and the ecological role of the saproxylic insects. An innovative method tested during the project was the training of a dog for searching and monitoring the elusive hermit beetle; the trained dog also added a "curiosity" factor to attract public attention towards this rare insect and the issues mentioned above...|$|E
