5|$|The 1762 act {{created the}} Witham Navigation Commissioners and the Witham <b>Drainage</b> General Commissioners, who {{continued}} to promote <b>drainage</b> schemes actively, creating a <b>drainage</b> network known as the Witham Navigable Drains that transformed much of northern Lincolnshire from fen to farming land. Today many of these channels are managed by the Witham First, Third and Fourth District Internal <b>Drainage</b> Boards and Upper Witham Internal <b>Drainage</b> Board. These four internal <b>drainage</b> boards reduce the flood risk to the surrounding properties, land and environment.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this <b>drainage</b> and the <b>drainage</b> from {{much of the rest}} of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger <b>drainage</b> area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E

5|$|On Twomile Run {{above the}} acid mine <b>drainage,</b> {{a total of}} 19 macroinvertebrate taxa {{including}} 5 members of the orders Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera were observed in 1998. Below the acid mine <b>drainage,</b> {{there were only two}} taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Above the acid mine <b>drainage</b> on Middle Branch, ten macroinvertebrate taxa were observed, of which five belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Below the acid mine <b>drainage,</b> there were two taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. In 1999, the macroinvertebrate density ranged from 197 to 1916 individuals per square meter. The concentration of fecal coliform in the water at Cross Fork is 2000 individuals per liter and the concentration of fecal streptococcus is 2400 individuals per liter.|$|E

40|$|Background The European trout (Salmo trutta species complex) occurs {{across a}} very wide altitudinal range from lowland rivers to alpine streams. Historically, the major European river systems {{contained}} different, evolutionarily distinct trout lineages, and some of this genetic diversity has persisted in spite of extensive human-mediated translocations. We used AFLP-based genome scans to investigate the extent of potentially adaptive divergence among major <b>drainages</b> and along altitudinal gradients replicated in several rivers. Results The proportion of loci showing evidence of divergent selection was larger between <b>drainages</b> than along altitudinal transects within <b>drainages.</b> This suggests divergent selection is stronger between <b>drainages,</b> or adaptive divergence is constrained by gene flow among populations within <b>drainages,</b> although the latter could not be confirmed at a more local scale.

5|$|The pH of {{the stream}} itself ranges from 3.6 to 8.4, while the pH of the {{abandoned}} mine <b>drainage</b> ranges from 2.9 to 7.4. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Mahanoy Creek ranges from 2.5 to 13.1 milligrams per liter, while the concentration in the watershed's abandoned mine <b>drainage</b> ranges from 0.1 to 9.7 milligrams per liter. The dissolved iron concentration in the stream ranges from under 0.01 milligrams per liter to 6.8 milligrams per liter. The dissolved iron concentration in the abandoned mine <b>drainage</b> ranges from 0.01 to 33 milligrams per liter. The amount of dissolved aluminum in the creek ranges from 0.01 to 8.9 milligrams per liter and the concentration in the abandoned mine <b>drainage</b> ranges from under 0.01 to 17 milligrams per liter.

5|$|The preglacial <b>drainage</b> {{pattern was}} {{controlled}} by the rock structure. Ver Steeg reconstructed a preglacial <b>drainage</b> pattern that shows major streams flowing east in the slate belts. Short tributaries and short north-south segments of the major streams cut across ridges which formed small gaps that are still present.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and <b>drainage</b> schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, {{and the success of}} the <b>drainage</b> system {{led to the formation of}} Internal <b>drainage</b> boards and the construction of other pumping stations.|$|E
40|$|Debris flows {{caused by}} heavy rains {{occurred}} in November of 2006 on several Cascade volcanoes. Mt. Adams experienced debris flows {{in seven of}} eighteen <b>drainages</b> including Adams Creek, Big Muddy Creek, Lewis Creek, Little Muddy Creek, Muddy Fork, Rusk Creek and Salt Creek. Six debris flows occurred on the northeast side of the mountain. A landslide initiated one debris flow, three were initiated by heavy water flow and in channel landslides, and three were initiated by a coalescence of eroded channels (headless debris flows). Four pre- 2006 debris flows {{were found in the}} Cascade Creek, Crofton Creek, Hellroaring Creek and Morrison Creek <b>drainages.</b> Every 2006 debris flow initiated in Quaternary glacial drift. Attributes of the <b>drainages</b> were investigated to determine differences between <b>drainages</b> with debris flows and those without.

5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface <b>drainage</b> network and the internal karst <b>drainage</b> system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground <b>drainage</b> system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E

5|$|Banksia verticillata {{is seldom}} seen in cultivation. The natural growing {{conditions}} {{point to a}} sunny aspect and good <b>drainage</b> as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor <b>drainage.</b> It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.|$|E

Conclusions Our results indicate that adaptive genetic divergence is common both between major European river systems and along altitudinal gradients within <b>drainages.</b> Alpine trout appear to be a promising model system to investigate the relative roles of divergent selection and gene flow in promoting or preventing adaptation to climate gradients. </p...|$|R

5|$|<b>Drainage</b> schemes {{were first}} {{authorised}} {{during the reign}} of Queen Elizabeth I, but from 1632, a group of Adventurers took control of the <b>drainage,</b> in return for which they were granted land. They faced the problem that the outfalls of the River Welland and the River Glen were not sufficiently low to enable proper <b>drainage</b> by gravity, and most schemes included improvement to the rivers. John Perry, an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, began work in 1730, and was followed by John Grundy, Sr., a pioneer in applying scientific principles to civil engineering problems. His son, John Grundy, Jr., was another capable engineer, who was retained as a consultant after he resigned as full-time Surveyor of Works.|$|E
