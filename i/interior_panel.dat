Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The <b>interior</b> <b>panel</b> of the door and window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between the shutters and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E

40|$|In a car side crash, the <b>interior</b> <b>panels</b> of {{the door}} and B-pillar could have a direct contact with the {{occupant}} of a struck car, which is a risk for occupant chest injuries. Therefore, the objective of the study is to enhance car safety performance for occupant chest protection by optimising the <b>interior</b> <b>panel’s</b> properties and design parameters. A production passenger car finite-element model was developed and used to analyse the <b>interior</b> <b>panels</b> design for occupant protection. Prescribed structural motion technology was employed to reduce the computation time. The elastic modulus and thickness of the <b>interior</b> <b>panels</b> {{of the door}} and B-pillar are considered as design parameters. An optimisation of the <b>interior</b> <b>panels</b> was carried out by using the response surface methodology with quadratic functions. The efficiency of the optimisation was identified by reducing the risk of thorax injury by 25 %...|$|R

2500|$|Toyota {{announced}} that the 2014 model year would be the final production year of the FJ Cruiser for the U.S. Market, therefore to add uniqueness to {{the final version of}} the Trail Teams Special Edition, Toyota designated the final version to be the Trail Teams Ultimate Edition which features a few special upgrades. The 2014 Trail Teams Ultimate Edition FJ Cruiser comes in a Heritage Blue paint scheme (resembling an original FJ40 Land Cruiser factory paint color), and for the first time features a white grille bezel that again pays tribute to the iconic Land Cruiser FJ40. The remaining vehicle trim remains black, similar to previous versions of the Trail Teams Special Edition. [...] While all of the Trail Teams FJ Cruisers feature a race-inspired TRD/Trail Teams off-road suspension designed by Bilstein, the Ultimate Edition features a new rear remote reservoir suspension. The suspension also raises the vehicle slightly taller than stock as to achieve a leveled stance. The Ultimate Edition is also equipped with a special 1/4 inch thick aluminum TRD skid plate, designed to help with the approach angle for the front of the vehicle and provide better protection while off-roading. Significant interior differences that are unique to the 2014 Trails Team Ultimate Edition include; the <b>interior</b> <b>panel</b> inserts are black rather than color matched to the exterior color of the vehicle, the radio bezel is silver, and a special [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] dash plaque is affixed to the dash on the passenger side indicating the special edition is only [...] "One of 2500." [...] Additionally, the seating fabric inserts are color matched to coordinate with the Ultimate Edition's unique silver/black interior, rather than the exterior color as in previous years.|$|E

Instead, they found the substantial impact stress had been shared over a widespread area along the entire structure of the passenger compartment [...] "box", protecting the occupants as intended by the design.|$|E
