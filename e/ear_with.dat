5|$|At {{first the}} art of music sought purity, limpidity and {{sweetness}} of sound. Then different sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the <b>ear,</b> <b>with</b> deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E

5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a hollowed shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by <b>ear,</b> <b>with</b> players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E

25|$|The Eustachian tubes, {{passages}} that connect the middle <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> the pharynx, are very complex in crocodilians. Unlike {{those of other}} vertebrates, the tubes are made of several interconnected branches. This branching is fully developed in Sebecus, and probably appeared much earlier in crocodylomorphs.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to analyze the tubotympanal mucociliary {{function}} in otitis media with effusion (OME), human serum albumin labeled with technetium 99 m was instilled into 36 <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> effusion and 16 without. The clearance function of the tubotympanum was measured quantitatively. The viscoelasticity of the effusions was measured and was compared with the clearance rate. The clearance rate was significantly lower in <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> effusion than in those without. A significant negative correlation was observed between clearance rate and dynamic viscosity at dynamic viscosities above 2 poise. It is concluded that <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> effusion have significantly lower mucociliary clearance than those without, and that the viscosity of the effusions {{plays an important role}} in the mucociliary dysfunction in OME...|$|R

25|$|Regurgitation {{through the}} aortic valve, if marked, is {{sometimes}} audible to a practiced <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> a high quality, especially electronically amplified, stethoscope. Generally, {{this is a}} very rarely heard murmur, even though aortic valve regurgitation is not so rare. Aortic regurgitation, though obvious using echocardiography visualization, usually does not produce an audible murmur.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} may {{be missed}} in most early cases because {{the examination of}} the <b>ear,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of pain with manipulation, is nearly normal. In some early cases, the most striking visual finding is the lack of earwax. As a moderate or severe case of external otitis resolves, weeks may be required before the ear canal again shows a normal amount of it.|$|E
25|$|Alternobaric vertigo {{is caused}} by a {{pressure}} difference between the middle ear cavities, usually due to blockage or partial blockage of one eustachian tube, usually when flying or diving underwater. It is most pronounced when the diver is in the vertical position; the spinning is towards the <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> the higher pressure and tends to develop when the pressures differ by 60cm of water or more.|$|E
30|$|Both {{the group}} of 18 <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> high-multiple and {{the group of}} 134 <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> low- and medium-multiple SOAEs show the absence of {{multiples}} of PMD at 200 and 300 Cent (Figure[*] 4). A periodicity of increased SOAE probability based on the PMD does not appear. Also this observation indicates that the spectrum of emission generators along the cochlea may primarily be stochastic and may secondarily be shaped by close-range mutual suppression.|$|R

25|$|Ear {{piercing}} {{is mentioned}} in the Bible in several contexts. The most familiar refers to a Hebrew slave who was to be freed in the seventh year of servitude but wishes to continue serving his master and refuses to go free: “…his master shall take him before God. He shall {{be brought to the}} door or the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> an awl; and he shall then remain his slave for life” (Exodus 21:6).|$|E

However, Jeongsu Nam lies to Jacheong Bi that he met Mun Doryeong, and tries to have an affair with Jacheong Bi. Jacheong Bi kills Jeongsu Nam by {{piercing}} his <b>ear</b> <b>with</b> a thorned branch. Jeongsu Nam's soul flies away, turning into an owl.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the author}} made {{an attempt to}} detect {{secretory}} IgA antibodies against viruses in the middle ear fludds of 128 ears of 113 children (1 -ll yr.). The study included 114 ears of 100 children with chronic otitis media with effusions and 14 ears of 13 patients <b>with</b> blue <b>ear</b> drum conditions. The method employed was the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the validity of which was established by a preliminary study. Antibodies to adeno, respiratory syncytial (RS) and parainfluenza type 2 (Para 2) viruses were detected in 15 (13. 2 %), 7 (6. 1 %) and 10 (8. 8 %) <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> chronic otitis media with effusions, respectively, while they were detected in 2 (14. 3 %), 3 (21. 4 %) and 2 (14. 3 %) <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> blue <b>ear</b> drum conditions, respectively. In those <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> positive antibodies to viruses, the specific antibody activity against each virus was demonstrated by absorption test. Most of the <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> positive antibodies to RS and Para 2 viruses were those of patientt aged under 6 years, while the <b>ears</b> <b>with</b> positive antibody to adenovirus were found in 4 {{or more years of}} ages. In selected cases, the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies with higher titers in the fluids than in the corresponding sera may indicate that specific antibodies to viruses were produced locally in the middle ear as a response to those infections. The results obtained provided supportive evidence for the hypothesis that some viruses are involved in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in children...|$|R
