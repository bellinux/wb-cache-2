25|$|Pacific salmon are {{harvested}} {{throughout the world}} as a source of food in countries ranging from the United States to South Korea. Over the past century, Pacific salmon have been extensively fished through both recreational, artisan and commercial fishing. In fact, since the 1970s there has been a nearly threefold increase in catch of Pacific salmon. As this catch has increased, a selection of reduced body size has been observed. In Japanese Chum Salmon, for example, between 1970 and 1988 there has been a continuous decrease in body weight averaging between 11 and 32 percent. In part, this decline in body weight has been related to the size selective effect of fishing gear used in the <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> populations. Salmon of larger body weight are more apt to be caught during fishing efforts, causing lower body weight to be a beneficial character trait for survival. Thus, Pacific salmon have become continuously smaller in body size. However, studies have also shown that for Pacific salmon a larger mean size at the time of reproduction increases the survival of offspring. The life history of salmon favors delayed reproduction because fecundity increased with body size. Consequently, the smaller body size of salmon results in a negative impact on population growth by decreasing the survivability of progeny, and thus decreasing the growth rate of populations. This reduction of productivity in Pacific salmon is, in part, seeded in the overfishing and has caused a reduction in population sizes throughout Pacific salmon species. Today, it seems that population numbers of Pacific salmon are on the rise, however the consequences from the overfishing in the 70s and 80s are still being reflected with the average body size of salmon being smaller than before the event of overfishing.|$|E

40|$|Many {{groups and}} {{individuals}} are involved in decision making for the allocation of the salmon resource. A comprehensive study of the economics of salmon ranching in New Zealand has not previously been undertaken. Before informed decisions can be made, such a study is essential. In this project, the economic potential of salmon ranching is examined, and the major variables that influence the economic return are identified. Preliminary to the economic analysis, the features of commercial salmon ranching in New Zealand are outlined. Quinnat salmon biology is described, and the environmental parameters that influence the operation of a salmon ranch are discussed. The history of commercial <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> in New Zealand is detailed, along with the influence of salmon anglers on ranching policy. Local and export markets for salmon are examined for each product category, and the prospects in the major markets are assessed. A simulation model that incorporates the important linkages between biological and economic variables is developed. The model is {{used to determine the}} net benefits to the nation from operating a salmon ranch. Subsequently, the sensitivity of economic return to the biological and economic variables is tested. Finally, the model is used to evaluate the effect of three aspects of salmon management policy on economic return, namely; ranch location, other forms of salmon aquaculture, and disposal of salmon caught at sea. Results show that salmon ranching can yield an "acceptable" economic return to the nation under certain conditions. Economic return is found to be most sensitive to the biological variables of hatchery carrying capacity, hatchery mortality, and survival of released salmon. Market price and feed costs are identified as the most significant of the economic variables. Ranch location is revealed to be a crucial factor in determining the economic return from salmon ranching. Taking these results into account, the characteristics of a salmon ranching investment are examined and found to diverge significantly from alternative investments. From this, it is concluded that unless salmon ranches can be located at or near river mouths, development of a salmon ranching industry that also enhances the sports fishery is unlikely to occur...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade the salmon farming {{industry}} has expanded rapidly and gone towards consolidation, thus the complexity of planning has increased. Therefore, the need for better planning tools has arisen. In this master thesis a stochastic optimization model for ordering and deployment of smolt and <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> is developed {{based on the work}} of Hæreid (2011), Langan and Toftøy (2011) and Overaas and Rynning-Tønnesen (2012). The most important improvements in this thesis are more realistic modelling of freshwater production, a more realistic decision process for ordering and deployment of smolt and time dependent aggregation of production sites. The basis for this thesis is the long term tactical planning problem of making smolt delivery and deployment plans and harvest salmon, in an environment where several parameters regarding production are uncertain. The most important sources of uncertainty in seawater production are growth, price and mortality. The model aim is to make profitable decisions while consider these risks. All relevant constraints regarding production capacities and governmental regulations are considered, and all input data reflect a real salmon producer. In order to ensure solvability with the available hardware, some simplifications of the model have been made, the most important being deterministic price and feed conversion rate. The model is implemented in three versions; a deterministic, a two-stage and a three-stage stochastic model. These models have been implemented for Marine Harvest Region Mid. Data are collected from public available information about Marine Harvest, and the user interface is MS Excel. The results improve marginally when stochastic programming is used, compared to deterministic. However, the plans made by the stochastic model are better. Using a deterministic model can result in a large amount of smolt being destroyed. This happens as the model will have ordered too many smolt for the scenarios where biomass development turns out to be higher than expected. The stochastic model avoids destruction of smolt, as it considers all possible scenarios. Stochastic programming therefore seems like a better tool for long term production planning in the salmon farming industry. Furthermore, this thesis shows that average harvest weight should be adjusted in correlation to seasonal temperature variations to increase profit. By lowering the lower bound for allowable harvest interval from 5. 5 - 6. 5 kg to 4. 0 - 6. 5 kg, the profit can increase by 450 million NOK in a five year period. Lastly, the model indicates that freshwater production is not as limiting for saltwater production as previous work suggests. </p...|$|E

40|$|About 60 % of {{the world}} s salmon {{production}} is farmed. Supply <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> {{has more than doubled}} since 2000 with an annual growth of 7 %. The EU and the US are by far the largest markets for Atlantic salmon. However, emerging markets are growing at significantly higher rates than these traditional markets, resulting in increasing demand for salmon. In Norway, the history <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> farming is a history of an expansive and dynamic export industry. Since the beginning <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> farming in the 1970 s, the salmon farming industry in Norway has moved from a local small-scale industry to a global multinational, billion-dollar industry exporting about 90 - 95 % of its production to more than 100 countries all over the world. Historically, the spot price <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> has been very volatile. The main cause for high volatility is inelastic short-run supply, which is a consequence of biological factors and a quite long production cycle. The biological nature of the production cycle implies that the desired output does not always meet its target, and therefore there will be periods of over- and undersupply, which cause salmon prices to fluctuate. Unstable supply and volatile salmon price has led to unpredictable cash flows and variability in profits for salmon farmers. Also, uneven supply <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> from farmers have created distortions in the value chain and affected other agents in the salmon industry. In this master thesis a mathematical model for optimal <b>harvest</b> time <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> given different <b>harvest</b> strategies is developed. The most important characteristic of the model is that it enables distribution <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> over certain months in order to investigate the difference in profits between a non-smooth harvest profile and a smooth harvest profile. In order to ensure solvability, some simplifications of the model have been made, the most important being that seasonal variations are only incorporated in prices and not in production costs and fish growth. Also, an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>salmon</b> farming value chain is conducted based on interviews and information from agents in the industry. The goal of this thesis work is to investigate the hypothesis that a smoother <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> provides the salmon farming value chain with additional value. We have used the mathematical model to find the potential loss or benefit the farmer would face by implementing a smooth harvest strategy rather than harvesting only a few times each year. Then in order to investigate whether a smoother <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> is value-adding or costly, we have conducted an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>salmon</b> farming value chain. The analysis was performed through interviews with different agents in the value chain. We combine our model results and findings from our value chain analysis to decide if smoother harvest indeed generates additional value. Our findings show that with a smoother <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon,</b> the salmon farmer loose approximately 9 % of potential profits generated from its operations. Hence, a smoother harvest is costly for the salmon farmer viewed in isolation. Also, findings show that the biomass development in the sea is less fluctuating with a smoother harvest compared to a scenario when harvesting is performed only 2 times per year. Findings show that it is the processors in the value chain that would profit the most from a smoother harvest. Interestingly, results show that retail chains do not experience variations in supply <b>of</b> <b>salmon,</b> indicating that the Norwegian market for salmon are saturated before salmon is exported. Other interesting findings are the industry concern <b>of</b> high <b>salmon</b> prices and its consequences. We have found that high salmon prices may lead to international competition and higher cost levels, which make higher prices a threat to the industry in the future. Also, with the government not issuing more licenses in the near future, high salmon prices are expected to continue. Through a new regulation proposal, called rolling MAB, the government wants to facilitate a more market oriented production <b>of</b> <b>salmon,</b> and hence more stable supply. We have found that the main motivation behind a rolling MAB is to facilitate more value creation in terms of processing in coastal areas...|$|R
40|$|Salmon is an {{anadromous}} species that during its feeding and spawning migrations is sought after catch for commercial and recreational fisheries.

Stocks <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> in Alaska are generally at very high levels, although some salmon stocks declined rapidly in Western Alaska in the late 1990 s. Stock status in the Russian Far East is somewhat mixed. In Japan, survival rates for chum salmon, the primary species, declined in the late 1990 s but abundance is still at relatively high levels. The total commercial <b>harvest,</b> by weight, <b>of</b> Pacific <b>salmon</b> declined slightly more than 15 % from 1993 to 2001, although the total <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> pink and chum salmon remained almost constant throughout that period.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A primary {{objective}} of the management practices of the Oregon State Game Commission is to maximize and sustain the annual <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> and steelhead by sportsmen fishing in Oregon. Assessment of these practices is dependent upon an accurate determination of total annual sports harvest throughout the state. Present total harvest figures are derived under a report card system which requires each salmon-steelhead angler fishing in Oregon to purchase and subsequently return to the Game Commission a punch card giving dates, rivers, and numbers <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> and steelhead caught during the year. Unfortunately, only about 30 percent of the salmon-steelhead anglers return their cards. Lacking information on the <b>harvest</b> characteristics <b>of</b> anglers not returning punch cards, estimates of total annual catch, total catch by river, month, and type of angler {{have been made by}} simple expansion of punch card reported catch. Inherent in this method of estimation are the assumptions that the average catch per angler by month, by river, by type of angler, and for the year are the same for anglers returning and for anglers not returning punch cards. This paper reports on an evaluation of these assumptions and on the method for estimating total catch. Evaluation of the assumptions is based on comparisons of catch rate estimates from sample data (not punch cards) collected from both anglers returning and anglers not returning punch cards. Sample data was collected by means of double return postcard questionnaires in a sample survey during 1951. Stratified sampling was employed with allocations approximately proportional to the angler-fishing months in each stratum. Variances for the catch rate estimates made for both groups of anglers were estimated using replicated subsampling. Nearly all comparisons indicate that the catch rates for anglers not returning punch cards were significantly lower than the catch rates for anglers returning punch cards.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Abstract. - Increasing the {{abundance}} <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> in coastal Oregon {{rivers and streams}} is a high priority public policy objective. Salmon runs have been reduced from pre-development conditions (typically defined as the 1 850 s), but it is unclear by how much. Considerable resources have been allocated to restoring salmon runs, but it is uncertain what the current recovery potential is {{because much of the}} freshwater and estuarine habitat for salmon has been altered. The goals of all recovery efforts are based on assumptions, often unstated, for what the size if the runs were prior to significant habitat alteration, coupled with an estimate of the amount and quality of freshwater and estuarine habitat currently available. At one extreme, it may be that current run sizes reflect the recovery potential <b>of</b> the existing <b>salmon</b> habitat. At the other extreme, the recovery potential may be as high as the mid 1800 levels. Historical salmon runs sizes on the Oregon coast were estimated using two methods: (1) Converting aboriginal population levels and their salmon consumption rate into numbers of salmon; (2) Extrapolating cannery pack into numbers <b>of</b> <b>salmon.</b> Annual aboriginal <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> all <b>salmon</b> species is estimated to have been approximately 10 million pounds/year or between 1. 75 million and 5. 36 million salmonids, a harvest level similar to that occurring during the height of commercial fishing on Oregon's coastal rivers in the late 1 800 s and early 1 900 s.

This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|R
40|$|Fishing impacts {{biodiversity}} {{on multiple}} levels, potentially resulting in unintended feedbacks to economic {{performance of the}} fishery over time. For example, targeting observable traits within a population can impact genetic diversity, targeting populations within a species can impact population diversity, and targeting valuable species can impact biodiversity at the ecosystem level. The natural science and economics literatures, however, have given {{little attention to the}} impact of fishing on population diversity, even though population diversity is directly linked ecosystem services and estimates of population extinction rates are three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates. Here we develop a stochastic bioeconomic model that links the <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>salmon</b> populations by a single commercial fishery to the trajectory of population diversity in a salmon stock complex. We parameterize our model with biological and economic data from the Copper River Chinook salmon fishery. We show that markets can incentivize the degradation of population diversity, reducing infra-marginal fishery rents and increase the variability in financial returns to the fishery. Factors impacting the magnitude of our results include the level and distribution <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> efficiency and market conditions. We also show that second-best management can conserve population diversity and improve welfare. Furthermore, depending fishermen’s time preferences, this management strategy is potentially self-financing...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 <b>Salmon</b> {{management}} philosophies <b>of</b> {{the five}} <b>salmon</b> jurisdictions <b>of</b> the North Pacific (Japan, Russia, Canada, Alaska and the American Northwest) are examined {{in a historical}} and geographic context. The first objective {{is to provide a}} synthesis <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> management experience across the North Pacific, to serve as a context for the professionals and private citizens involved in day-to-day salmon management. The second objective is to elucidate the relative role of geography versus deliberate management action in shaping contemporary salmon management philosophies, on the basis <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> management experience. <b>Harvest</b> trends, species composition, regulatory actions, property rights, technological innovation, climate variability, habitat alteration, markets, international agreements, and science are reviewed for each jurisdiction over time. The source material is drawn from a variety of scholarly and popular published sources, in Russian and English. The inferred <b>salmon</b> management philosophies <b>of</b> the five jurisdictions vary in their emphasis on three primary salmon management objectives: maximizing biomass production, preserving salmon harvest communities, and conserving salmonid genetic and life history diversity. All initially heavily emphasized biomass production, except for Canada. Only Japan, and Alaska after statehood, have given moderate or great emphasis to community preservation. Among the five jurisdictions, the only two to emphasize biodiversity conservation are the Pacific Northwest United States and British Columbia, Canada. The initial species endowment of each jurisdiction, the landscape, climate variability and the cultural heritage <b>of</b> the dominant <b>salmon</b> harvesters are more critical at shaping salmon management philosophies than are incremental regulatory decisions over time. For instance, Japan's salmon ranching philosophy accrued from the availability of species without freshwater life history stages and the need to support a large human population. Favorable climate conditions in the 1970 s facilitated the Japanese emphasis on hatchery chums and an engineering approach to contend with flooding and the demand for energy and water supplies. Change in salmon management philosophies, such as the shift to an emphasis on biodiversity conservation in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest, occurs when the legal <b>harvest</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>salmon</b> harvester subgroups changes during a period <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> decline. In the case of the latter two jurisdictions, the increased legal rights of native peoples have catalyzed a shift from an emphasis on biomass production to biodiversity conservation...|$|R
40|$|World marine {{fisheries}} {{suffer from}} economic and biological overfishing: too many vessels are harvesting too few fish stocks. Fisheries economics has explained {{the causes of}} overfishing and provided a theoretical background for management systems capable of solving the problem. Yet only {{a few examples of}} fisheries managed by the principles of the bioeconomic theory exist. With the aim of bridging the gap between the actual fish stock assessment models used to provide management advice and economic optimisation models, the thesis explores economically sound harvesting from national and international perspectives. Using data calibrated for the Baltic salmon and herring stocks, optimal harvesting policies are outlined using numerical methods. First, the thesis focuses on the socially optimal <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>salmon</b> stock by commercial and recreational fisheries. The results obtained using dynamic programming show that the optimal fishery configuration would be to close down three out of the five studied fisheries. The result is robust to stock size fluctuations. Compared to a base cas...|$|R
40|$|The Anadyr {{basin of}} Chukotka {{is the largest}} {{producer}} <b>of</b> chum <b>salmon</b> in the Russian Northeast Pacific coast (Korotaev et al. 2002). On average, the proportion <b>of</b> chum <b>salmon</b> catches in the Anadyr basin is 75. 3 % of the catches of all other Pacific salmon in Chukotka. This represents up to 12 % of the biomass for the total annual catch <b>of</b> chum <b>salmon</b> in the Russian Far East (Fig. 1). In addition, the chum salmon fishery {{plays an important role}} in the traditional life of the native population in Chukotka. Fig. 1. Proportion of Anadyr basin chum salmon catches by biomass of the total annual catch <b>of</b> chum <b>salmon</b> in the Russian Far East (right y-axis) and the catch (thousand tones) <b>of</b> chum <b>salmon</b> in the Russian Far East (left y-axis), 1971 - 2012. The annual monitoring of the Anadyr chum salmon stock includes recording of commercial and non-commercial catches and biological data sampling from adult migrants. The <b>harvest</b> <b>of</b> Anadyr chum <b>salmon</b> began about 100 years ago and has been ongoing since 1910 (Fig. 2). The data collected from monitoring programs are essential for accurate estimations of population size and quota limits for chum salmon. In the recent period, the low numbers of adult migrants was observed in 1968 (0. 7 million), 1991 (0. 7 million), and 2002 (0. 8 million; Fig. 3). The maximum number chum salmon migrants to the Anadyr basin was observed in 1983 (7. 3 million), and the annual average is 2. 8 million fish (Chereshnev 2008). The main chum salmon spawning grounds are concentrated in the middle and upper rivers of the Anadyr basin, principally the Anadyr, Velikaya, and Kanchalan rivers (Putivkin 1994). The quantity <b>of</b> chum <b>salmon</b> on spawning grounds fluctuates over a wide range from 0. 234 to 2. 81 million fish with an annual average (optimum) of 1. 5 - 2. 0 million fish. The number of smolts varies from 34 million in 1992 up to 495 million in 1990, and the average annual catch if 265 million fis...|$|R
