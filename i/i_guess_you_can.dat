500|$|While {{playing for}} the Giants in October 1965, he told an interviewer: [...] "I'm playing {{football}} to convey Christianity either indirectly or directly and to give me access to you people. [...] The eye of American is upon the sports' field, so I can reach more people playing football. [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say {{my goal is to}} spread a Christian message." [...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence. [...] He then joked, [...] "There's nothing really wrong with good, clean violence." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 3, Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} that actor Jorge Garcia {{would be making}} a cameo appearance in an upcoming Fringe episode. Garcia, who previously starred as Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes from J.J. Abrams' Lost, appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter {{at the start of}} the episode. Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, [...] "He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say he's obsessed. And this particular point in time where the episode of Fringe starts, time is fleeting and he's just... under the gun." [...] On his character's possible reappearance, Ruck commented, [...] "I think not... Technically yes , but probably not." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 2002, at UFC 40, {{nearly four}} years after the {{confrontation}} at UFC 19, Shamrock returned to the UFC to fight Ortiz in a title match for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship. Shamrock's apparent size advantage did not factor into the fight, however; Shamrock experienced difficulty cutting weight {{for the first time and}} cut too much weight, weighing in at 201lbs, 4lbs under the 205lb. limit. Ortiz shed light upon his feelings before the fight in his book This is Gonna Hurt: The Life of a Mixed Martial Arts Champion; [...] "Ken Shamrock is a real good fighter. I was not intimidated by him, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say I was a little bit afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt {{shook off}} the affectionate clasp--Sheldy liked to hold hands {{for a long}} time--and snarled, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>can</b> run the show without me. Sorry, Smeeth; got to beat it. G'day." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert awarded Best Worst Movie 3 out of 4 {{stars and}} said, [...] "The lesson, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> is that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{only be the}} flavor of the month for about 30 days, {{sometimes}} 31. Troll 2 was February." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> there's nothing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. Talk {{to these}} frightened girls while I go see what's {{to be done}} with that thick-skulled robber," [...] he replied, and, telling the girls that there was no more danger, he went out.|$|R
2500|$|LSU had 266 {{yards of}} total {{offense in the}} game and Rice {{compiled}} 144. Passing contributed to only 48 yards between both teams as the rainy conditions forced them to stick to the running game. Cannon gained 53 yards on nine carries as the game's leading rusher. The performance by LSU impressed the pollsters, who ranked the team fifteenth after being unranked prior to the game. Coach Dietzel said in the locker room after the game:"It was gratifying to score a victory over a team coached by a man that I respect as much as coach Neely. We made mistakes Saturday night [...] we made up for them in hustle and desire. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sum up what I feel about these boys in four words...I'm proud of them. I do believe that the condition of the playing field and adverse weather conditions prevented either team from finding out their true strength or weaknesses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, {{who seemed}} to {{recognize}} that protests would be useless, [...] "it's quite a long journey. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> afford it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Mr. Van Reinberg assented, [...] "but the fact's {{there all}} the same. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> stay where you are, Mr. Courage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They've {{no use for}} a {{hotel at}} Green River. Sometimes a rancher comes in for his mail and a survey party jumps off. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's all. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> stop at the post office. The man who keeps it runs a small store." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said. [...] "Don't stir." [...] She {{addressed}} John Jago very reluctantly: [...] "If {{you are so}} much {{in earnest}} about it, Mr. John, I suppose it must be. <b>I</b> can't <b>guess</b> what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly {{have to say to}} me which cannot be said before a third person. However, it wouldn't be civil, I suppose, to say 'No' in my place. You know it's my business to wind up the hall-clock at ten every night. If you choose to come and help me, the chances are that we shall have the hall to ourselves. Will that do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{wife has}} taken a fancy to Mrs. Fletcher," [...] he said. [...] "We just call her Minnie because there's no {{particular}} reason to handicap her with her husband's name. She's a mighty smart honest woman, {{and we knew that}} story about you was a lie from the beginning--did our best to keep it from her, but I think she knew. We were startled some when she lit out with the sleigh, but she came back half-dead, and we asked no questions until she told us. She's been sick and fretful since, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> there's nothing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. When we can't keep a sick woman who has done good work for us a while we'll give up the business. She'll be pert again directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've begun quite satisfactorily," [...] {{said the}} corporal, [...] "and there's {{nothing more to}} be done to-night. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> quit and have supper, boys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I can't cook nautical," [...] said Willy, [...] "and I don't {{intend to}} try! But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> eat the food if it isn't {{strictly}} naval." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not for the {{pleasure}} of your company. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get right off now if you want to. I thought you'd rather I tooled you back to London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I will, Robert Herrick," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "But first, let's see all clear. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know," [...] he said, with {{imperious}} solemnity, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know {{the bottom is}} out of this Farallone speculation? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know it's right out? and if this old island hadn't been turned up right when it did, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know where you and I and Huish would have been?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, you got nerve. You got {{the nerve}} of a Republican on Fourteenth Street, like the fellow says. You must want it. Well, all right, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have {{it if the}} boss don't kick." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir LUCIUS O faith! <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> weren't come empty-handed--Well--let me {{see what}} the dear {{creature}} says.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. We'll {{take the}} last {{question}} first. Somebody tore off a shutter and we carried <b>you</b> on it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> know you got a dago's knife between your ribs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, they're bad competition. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> don't {{realize the}} Pulling Power that Personality has in a {{neighborhood}} business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they've {{finished}} the line posts; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> start in," [...] said the surveyor. [...] "You {{look as if}} you could keep those scoops from rusting. Good luck go with you! Stir round and heave those rails down, boys!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Sergeant, [...] "I figure we have stores {{enough to see}} us down to the {{settlements}} all right, and we'll be glad of your company.

6000|$|... "That's your affair, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{settle it}} in court to-morrow.

6000|$|He {{scratched}} his nose thoughtfully. [...] "Over in that tall, dead stub {{you can see}} from here is an old home of mine," [...] said he.
