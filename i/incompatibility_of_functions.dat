This legal institute is typical {{for all types of}} state systems, however efforts to legally regulate it as appropriate exist usually only in certain systems (in particular in democratic systems). This institute can be basically divided in so called <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> and the conflict of interests as such (i. e. the conflict between the public and the private interest). <b>Incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> can be characterized as the basic requirement of each democratic legal state, which is reflected in the impossibility to concentrate functions (and related powers) which represent individual elements of state power. This first of all pre-empts misusing the entrusted public function and trust, further it also pre-empts misusing power up to the potential possibility of establishing authoritarian or totalitarian regimes. Therefore incompatibility can arise in particular where the division of powers exists, thus in particular in a democratic legal state. Separation of three individual basic pillars (i. e. legislative, executive and judicial powers) thus has its value in impossibility to concentrate functions from any of those pillars in the hands of [...] ...|$|E
50|$|To be {{eligible}} to be elected {{it is necessary to}} be of Dutch nationality, to be over eighteen in age and not to have been excluded from the right to vote (Article 56); there are also certain <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> (Article 57), the most important of which is that a minister not belonging to a demissionary cabinet cannot {{be a member of the}} States General, a stark contrast with the situation in United Kingdom or Germany. This principle underlies the political dualism of Dutch politics. The Houses investigate the Letters of Credence of new members, in this case a written affirmation by the central voting office that they have indeed obtained the necessary number of votes. After the investigation new members swear four oaths: the oath of purification, the oath of allegiance to the Constitution and the oath of loyal discharge of their office are demanded by Article 60; the oath of loyalty to King and Statute is demanded by Article 47 of the Statute of the Kingdom, the higher Constitution of the Realm. All other issues pertaining the elections are regulated by formal law; delegation is possible (Article 59).|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the States-Provincial and the {{municipal}} council are directly elected by their constituents. The conditions {{of the right to}} elect and be elected are the same as those regarding the elections of the House of Representatives (Article 129 sub 1). However, formal law may give inhabitants of municipalities, that do not have the Dutch nationality, the right to elect, and be elected in, the municipal council, if they meet the other conditions (Article 130). This right has indeed been given to certain categories of foreign nationals, e.g. all citizens of the European Union. The elections take place within a system of proportional representation (Article 129 sub 2); the vote is secret and the organisation of the voting is regulated by law (Subarticle 3). The term of the States-Provincial and the municipal council is four years, unless formal law determines otherwise (Subarticle 4) Law determines possible <b>incompatibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>function,</b> and may determine that family ties, marriage or the commission of acts indicated by such law may lead to a loss of membership (Subarticle 5). E.g. membership of a municipal council is incompatible with that of the Council of Ministers; a lawyer will lose his membership of a municipal council if he represents his municipality in court. All members vote without mandate (Subarticle 6). This is a reference to the situation under the Republic when the {{members of the}} States of a province voted on instruction from the city councils they represented.|$|R

As employees are being inundated with increasing information produced by these new technologies, studies suggest that many are not able to effectively use the new information for business decisions. This paper discusses how the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> task, cognitive <b>functioning,</b> training, and information attributes may hinder employees from effectively using certain information in making decisions in the context of activity-based costing systems.

40|$|Attempts at {{understanding}} the urbanization process in Southeast Asia have, in recent years, {{focused on the}} emergence of extended metropolitan regions around primate cities. Many have argued that with a landscape of intensively mixed 'rural' and 'urban' activities, such regions represent a distinctive Asian form of urbanization and {{a challenge to the}} conventional urban-rural dualism. The implication, both in theoretical and policy terms, is that such regions of mixed land use form new 'urban' landscapes that will persist into the future on the basis of balanced 'agro-industrial' development. Drawing on fieldwork in a town on Manila's agricultural periphery, this paper argues that such understandings present a static view of these regions, limited by macro-level data and analysis. A more ethnographic understanding of the social processes of 'everyday urbanization' at the interface of the 'urban' and the 'rural' dispels any sense of a stable rural-urban landscape or balanced development. The evidence points to an <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b> leading to the gradual 'squeezing out' of agriculture due to a changing economic calculus in agricultural households brought on by labour market shifts; environmental conflicts between agricultural and urban-industrial activities; social and cultural transformations in rural society; a political framework of bureaucratic corruption in the regulation of urbanization; and the influence of personalized power relations in agrarian society.

40|$|The {{prison is}} a social {{institution}} designed to meet a multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>functions.</b> Some <b>of</b> these <b>functions</b> are very explicitly expressed by leg-islators, court decisions and prison of-ficials, whereas others must be in-ferred. In most debates concerning the effects of incarceration, etc., the discussion is centered around the com-patibility or <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>function</b> <b>of</b> resocializing rhe inmates on one hand, {{and all the other}} func-tions generally imputed to the prison on the other. It is our belief that only a careful study of what happens to an incarcerated violator of a legal norm can give us an answer to the problem. As the author happened to be imprisoned for a period of six months in Norway's largest prison (maximum prisoner population around 350) as a conscientious objector, he was given ample opportunity to reflect on the question. The conditions for partici-pant observation were unusually good, and the data thus collected were later (after the release) supplemented by systematic interviews of 35 prisoners and 20 guards, questionnaires to 30 of the guards and long informal in-terviews with prison officials. The samples are small and not entirely representative (because the interview-ing was on a voluntary basis), but it is felt that the general lack of socio-logical studies of non-American pris-ons justifies the presentation of data that do not satisfy all methodological standards.

Thus, various approaches {{have been made}} to improve the surface hydrophilicity of PLA. In the present paper, PLA materials were surface modified by alkaline hydrolysis. The indication of the reduction in water contact angle value, from 65 ˚ to 50 ˚ and 15 ˚, in 0. 01 M and 1 M alkaline concentration respectively, proven surface hydrophilicity of PLA film was improved. Further alkaline treatment after 24 hours shows not significant reduction in contact angle. Whereas, the erosion of film surfaces treated under 1 M alkaline solution have been observed under polarized optical microscopy. Intrinsic viscosity measurement was also conducted to monitor the surface treatment process. As a whole, surface treatment was successful and sufficient when no further decreased in contact angle value, thus prevent extensive surface erosion...|$|R
40|$|Starting from pAO 3, a plasmid {{consisting}} of a quarter of colicinogenic factor El (ColEl) DNA, various small ColEl derivatives were constructed by in vitro recom-bination {{and their ability to}} achieve autonomous replication was examined. The 436 base pair HaeUI-C fragment of pAO 3 contained information for replication when it was recombined with the non-replicating Amp fragment. However, when it was connected to other DNA fragments, the resulting hybrid molecules were not iso-lated as plasmids. The present results indicate that the additional region of about 240 base pairs next to the HaeUl-C fragment of ColEl is also essential for the main-tenance of a plasmid state. Moreover, using various small ColEl derivatives, the DNA region responsible for the interference and <b>incompatibility</b> <b>functions</b> <b>of</b> ColEl DNAs was located. The results indicate that the interference and incompatibility functions are coded by the same ColEl DNA segment and are not essential for the maintenance of a plasmid state.

40|$|We {{propose a}} class <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> {{measures}} for quantum observables based on quantifying {{the effect of}} a measurement of one observable on the statistics of the outcomes of another. Specifically, for a pair of observables A and B with purely discrete spectra, we compare the following two probability distributions: one resulting from a measurement of A followed by a measurement of B on a given state, and the other obtained from a measurement of B alone on the same state. We show that maximizing the distance between these two distributions over all states yields a valid measure <b>of</b> the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> observables A and B, which is zero if and only if they commute and is strictly greater than zero (and {{less than or equal to}} one) otherwise. For finite dimensional systems, we obtain a tight upper bound on the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> any pair of observables and show that the bound is attained when the observables are totally non-degenerate and associated with mutually unbiased bases. In the process, we also establish an important connection between the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> a pair of observables and the maximal disturbances due to their measurements. Finally, we indicate how these measures <b>of</b> <b>incompatibility</b> and disturbance can be extended to the more general class of non-projective measurements. In particular, we obtain a non-trivial upper bound on the <b>incompatibility</b> <b>of</b> one Lüders instrument with another. Comment: 11 pages; close to published version; typos fixe...|$|R
