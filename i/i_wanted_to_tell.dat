500|$|In May 2012 Daft Punk's {{collaboration}} with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue {{about his life}} {{for use in a}} track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas asked me if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of my life. Then they would {{know what to do with}} it." [...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{creative}} {{team was}} writer Jamie Delano and artist John Ridgway, with Dave McKean supplying distinctive painted and collage covers. Delano introduced a political aspect to the character, about which he stated: [...] "...generally I {{was interested in}} commenting on 1980s Britain. That was where I was living, it was shit, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> everybody." [...] The book, originally published as a regular DC Comics title, became a Vertigo title with the imprint's launch in March 1993 (issue #63 of the series). In October 2011, {{it was announced that}} this would join DC titles in being published digitally on the same day as its physical release, starting in January 2012.|$|E

500|$|Whedon {{approached}} Nathan Fillion to {{play the}} lead role of Malcolm Reynolds; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that [...] "it was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> those stories." [...] Fillion later said he was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he learned the series had been cancelled. Fillion has called his time on Firefly the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job {{he has had to}} it.|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> and we were getting to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Lil X on the weekend of July 4, 2010 in Los Angeles. [...] Minaj took to her Twitter, asking fans who {{they would like to}} see portray her love interest in the video. Minaj was interviewed on the set of [...] "Your Love" [...] by MTV News while wearing a pink and purple kimono as a geisha for the video. In the interview, Minaj said, [...] "We wanted to have geisha themes, samurai themes, stuff like that. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a love story. It's just kinda liking a guy, where he's not really for you to like — the forbidden fruit — and me and this other girl happen to like him and we go to war." [...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E

500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris {{would have to do}} that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through the years, {{the lyrics}} became more personal.

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked when we could see it again – that was the moment I knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E

[...] "I was not able to dance, I couldn't even really bop my head. It's the simple things that you take for granted — not being able to perform for that amount of time, and also knowing that it could be gone in an instant." [...] said Jason during an interview. [...] "I wouldn't change the accident for anything because I've grown so much from it," [...] Jason admits. Derulo then decided to channel all of this creative energy into studio time, on writing and recording his third album. He had written over 300 songs, recorded between 100 and 120 of those songs for the album and had to narrow them down to 12. A very difficult process for him as he states [...] "I wanted {{to be sure that the}} album was a roller coaster ride, that every single song was totally different from the last... I wanted to be sure this album was far different from that one, to make sure that the growth was present. I'm 23 now. I really wanted this album to be a direct representation of who I am.
