40|$|In {{machine design}} we {{always want to}} save space, save energy and produce as much power as possible. We can often reduce accelerations, {{inertial}} loads and energy consumption by changing construction. In this study the old cardan gear mechanism (hypocycloid mechanism) has been compared with the conventional slider-crank mechanism in air pumps and four-stroke engines. Comprehensive Newtonian dynamics has been derived for the both mechanisms. First the slidercrank and the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> have been studied as lossless systems. Then the friction losses {{have been added to}} the calculations. The calculation results show that the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> can be more efficient than the slider-crank machines. The smooth running, low mass inertia, high pressures and small frictional power losses make the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> clearly better than the slider-crank machines. The dynamic tooth loads of the original cardan gear construction do not rise very high when the tooth clearances are kept tight. On the other hand the half-size crank length causes high bearing forces in the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines.</b> The friction losses of the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> are generally quite small. The mechanical efficiencies are much higher in the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> than in the slider-crank machines in normal use. Crankshaft torques and power needs are smaller in the cardan gear air pumps than in the equal slider-crank air pumps. The mean crankshaft torque and the mean output power are higher in the cardan gear four-stroke engines than in the slider-crank four-stroke engines in normal use. The cardan gear mechanism is at its best, when we want to build a pump or an engine with a long connecting rod (≈ 5 ⋅crank length) and a thin piston (≈ 1. 5 ⋅crank length) rotating at high angular velocity and intermittently high angular acceleration. The cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> can be designed also as slide constructions without gears. Suitable applications of the cardan <b>gear</b> <b>machines</b> are three-cylinder half-radial engines for motorcycles, sixcylinder radial engines for airplanes and six-cylinder double half-radial engines for sport cars.

40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} <b>gear</b> <b>machining</b> {{methods such as}} hobbing {{and shaping}} pose limitations on manufacturer's ability to efficiently manufacture gears in small and medium batches.

The paper discusses additional benefits of the two new methods in enabling new gear design strategies and efficient machining of special gear forms. In conclusion, {{it was found that}} the new methods are capable of providing better quality gears than the traditional methods in pre heat operations.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to propose a novel design methodology for identifying the optimal design of external spur <b>gear</b> <b>machines.</b> Due to the existence of complex inter-dependencies between design parameters and the performance of the machine, presently their designs are extensively based on empirical procedures, with limited recourse to simulations. In {{this research}} the problem of optimizing the volumetric performance, minimizing internal cavitation, pressure peaks and noise emissions has been addressed by means of a multi-objective optimization algorithm that optimizes the most important components of the external <b>gear</b> <b>machines.</b> The performance of the particular design configuration of the machine was accurately predicted using the simulation tool HYGESim (HYdraulic <b>GEar</b> <b>machines</b> Simulator), providentially modified within the research.

The design methodology was successfully applied for two different design solutions, specifically for high pressure and low pressure applications. The optimal designs for both these applications were identified and their improvements in performance were compared with existing commercial design. Qualitative trends representing the different mutual inter-relationships between the design variables that influence the performance of the machine were also characterized. ...|$|R

ArcelorMittal has developed specific programs for machinability testing in turning, {{low and high}} speed drilling and <b>gear</b> <b>machining.</b> Machinability is evaluated through cutting forces, chip shape, surface quality and tool life. <b>Gear</b> <b>machining</b> {{is one of the}} main machining operations involved in powertrain manufacturing operations. The literature proposes many papers dealing with this process however there are too few studies interested in steel machinability evaluation while <b>gear</b> <b>machining.</b> This paper focuses on a particular gear manufacturing process, i. e. gear hobbing, and more precisely on steel machinability for gear hobbing applications. Tools as well as kinematics of gear hobbing are quite complex. This paper proposes a comprehensive experimental protocol for machinability testing. This protocol is based on a European standard. Tests are performed on a machine tool using a commercially available cutting tool. Tests provide the range of cutting conditions for five different steel grades. Both steels have a ferrite-pearlite structure with yield stress from 530 to 800 MPa and ultimate tensile stress from 680 to 900 MPa. Four grades are devoted to bar machining. The last one is devoted to forming and then machining operations. Many metallurgical solutions are investigated to enhance machinability such as lead addition or increase in sulfur content or calcium treatment. This paper analyses the influence of steel composition and structure on machinability. It shows the relevance of metallurgical solutions for machinability enhancement even for powertrain applications. Cutting conditions clearly depend on the metallurgical solution even if specific cutting force is finally close. The main difference is found on tool wear with tool life ratio from 1 to 1. 5...|$|E

For these processes, special machine tools designed with peculiar manuals for calculating the gear geometry, and the setting-up processes were developed.

These processes are different in productivity and quality of <b>gear</b> <b>machining.</b> Due to these circumstances, manufacturers created many modifications, with different qualities of the gear-cutting processes. Presently, there are following technologies: continuous indexing (face-hobbing) and single indexing (face-milling) that unlimitedly available to the user.
