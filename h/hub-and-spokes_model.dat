40|$|This chapter {{will provide}} an {{overview}} of Australian perspectives on the US alliance in light of ongoing and emerging challenges in the Asia-Pacific region. After a brief discussion of the motivations behind the signing of the ANZUS treaty, {{the first part of the}} chapter examines the historical context of the alliance, with a particular focus on the longstanding and ongoing tussle in Australia between independence in foreign policy making vis-à-vis broader structural constraints. While this debate has been a constant feature of the political scene in Australia, it has come into particular focus since the US withdrawal from Vietnam, which marked a turning point in Australian perspectives with regard to its own role in Asia. The collision of ideas surrounding Australian identity and Australian national interest has been reflected in policy approaches as successive governments have sought to strike a balance between the two exigencies and thus, most optimally ensure Australia’s strategic future. The chapter concludes by examining current perspectives through the lens of an ongoing debate taking place in Australian academic circles about what the rise of China means for Australia and its commitment to the US alliance, and considers options for caucus-style cooperation with fellow US allies beyond the <b>hub-and-spokes</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{management}} {{is one of}} the most innovative and effective tools available to company managers in the face of economic challenges and a context of imposed organisational changes. For companies attempting to acquire new information, the forms of their inter-company collaboration are crucial, since these play a large role in determining the related knowledge transfer processes. Companies involved in industrial districts have the advantage of grasping knowledge from others, thanks to the relationships established among the parties. The literature generally holds that knowledge transfer requires a sense of equality and fairness among the firms, to create conditions in which firms will share their own knowledge for joint competitive advantage. However, empirical evidence demonstrates that value chains are often characterised by hierarchical relationships and asymmetry among the parties, and that this holds true even for of industrial districts. Situations of power-based relations contrast with the traditional Marshallian conception of the district, and conform more to the <b>hub-and-spokes</b> <b>model.</b> Hub-and-spokes districts are characterised by the presence of one or more large firms, with vertical integration between these and the smaller firms. Surrounding the hub companies there will be a much larger number of suppliers, holding long-term contracts and other forms of commitment. The literature suggests that knowledge transfer processes in hub-and-spoke districts may be different than those of other types of districts, due to the needs of the larger companies and particularly the underlying power structures. The current work identifies the structure of the Basilicata petroleum district, a hub-and-spoke business district centred on Eni SpA’s Distretto Meridionale (DIME). It analyses the power and socio-cultural relations present in the business district, showing their impact on processes of knowledge creation and transfer...|$|E
40|$|There {{are various}} names and {{descriptions}} for rural knowledge centers, but their main role is facilitate {{the access to}} managed or direct information services for rural families. India {{is home to a}} very large number of pilot projects in this sector over the last about ten years. The number of internet-connected rural knowledge centers varies but is believed to be close to 10000 as of mid- 2006. The recent decision of the Government of India to establish about 1, 00, 000 Common Service Centers has generated altogether new possibilities and opportunities to design and make available a wide range of information services for the rural poor in India. Earlier studies indicated that the access to government information, and information on education were the two priority information demands. A number of projects include provision of governance-related information as a key service. Education mostly relating to IT literacy is offered on many projects although systematic efforts to measure the importance and impact of such information are not yet available. One of the significant challenges that India faces is the recurrence of disasters that lead to large scale disruption of economic and development activities and causes considerable distress among the victims. Over a period of time, relief measures have become affordable in many situations but the cumulative losses are staggering. The Disaster Management Authority of India has identified drought and earthquakes as among the phenomena that can cause deep and lasting distress among the victims while generating massive economic losses to the system as a whole. There is a need to identify new systems that combine early warning arrangements with access for appropriate support services. Over the last two years, ICRISAT has made an effort in partnership with CRIDA to study the possible use of rural knowledge centers in enhancing drought preparedness at the micro-regional level among the rural families. The pilot is premised on the assumption that a country such as India has reasonable arrangements for early warning communication in a top-down manner. International experience shows that such top-down flow of important information must combine with a bottom-up process for its rapid and effective use by the intended recipients, namely the rural families. The rural knowledge centers, operating in an interactive <b>hub-and-spokes</b> <b>model</b> for local value-addition and dissemination and capture, could provide the right interfaces to generate such blended communication...|$|E

Improving their attractiveness in relation to the jets was the introduction of active noise-reduction systems, which reduced cabin noise to levels comparable, or even lower, than the RJ's. Bombardier found their Dash 8 to be in high demand once again, and shifted production to their latest model, the Bombardier Q400.|$|R

In the bus model, the EAI system is the bus (or is implemented as a resident module in an already existing message bus or message-oriented middleware).|$|R
5000|$|While the {{bus system}} is a {{hub-and-spoke}} paradigm, it is more akin to a traditional aviation <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> than to the traditional public transit <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> because it has multiple hubs, both primary and secondary in nature, with the routes themselves usually being non-stop. The four theme parks, Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom, as well as Disney Springs, operate as the five primary hubs. Each of these five hubs have service to the 22 resorts, {{as well as to}} the other hubs. There are some routes that do not have direct bus service, mostly when the same route is served by monorail, ferry, and/or walkway. An example of this is the service from Epcot to and from either the Magic Kingdom or Disney's Hollywood Studios, which have monorail and ferry connections respectively, as well as from Disney Springs to the parks (though one-way service from the parks to Disney Springs is provided after 4 p.m.).|$|R

50|$|The <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> {{has also}} been used in {{economic}} geography theory to classify {{a particular type of}} industrial district. Ann Markusen, an economic geographer, theorized about industrial districts, with a number of key industrial firms and facilities acting as a hub, with associated businesses and suppliers benefiting from their presence and arranged around them like the spokes of a wheel. The chief characteristic of such hub-and-spoke industrial districts is the importance of one or more large companies, usually in one industrial sector, surrounded by smaller, associated businesses. Examples of cities with such districts include Seattle (where Boeing was founded), Silicon Valley (a high tech hub), and Toyota City, with Toyota.|$|R
50|$|AGT was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} means of providing mass transit services aimed at serving rider loads higher than those that could be served by buses or trams, but smaller than those served by conventional subways. Subways were too expensive to install in areas of lower density - smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones - which often suffer the same gridlock problems as larger cities. Buses could be easily introduced in these areas, but did not offer the capacities or speeds that made them an attractive alternative to car ownership. Cars drive directly from origin to destination, while buses generally work on a <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> that can up to double trip length. Stops along the route increase this even more.|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} of the Western Hemisphere {{in recent years have}} shown interest in participating in preferential trading arrangements (PTA) in anticipation of expanding exports. Results in this paper show that export expansion depends upon the type of agreement that is formed and who else is participating. Trade of two agricultural commodities are examined; wheat, and fruit and vegetable juices. Five~As are examinedeactrincludingtheunited States and one or more ‘Western Hemisphere countries. Recently the United States {{and a number of other}} Western Hemisphere countries have shown interest in participating in preferential trade agreements (PTA). 1 A PTA would reduce or remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade between the {{countries of}} the PTA, but each country’s barriers to trade with non-member countries would remain unchanged. The most common reason for a country to want to join a PTA is to expand its exports. In the context of recent events in the Western Hemisphere, there are several alternative types of PTAs that could evolve. The objective of this pa-per is to see if the type of PTA matters for trade of agricultural commodities. Two “case-study” commodities are examined: wheat, and fruit and vegetable juices. In a recent article by Richard Lipsey entitled “The Case for Trilateralism”, Lipsey outlines three models of PTAs: the <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model,</b> overlapping regional free trade areas, and plurilat-eral regionalism. In the <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model,</b> one country, presumably the United States, could have separate bilateral free-trade agreements with each of the participating countries (Wonnacott).

Within our study we investigate whether {{the scope of the}} Hub-and-spoke architectural framework can be extended to capture behavioural phenomena in other areas of cognition. The visual world paradigm (VWP) has contributed significantly {{to our understanding of the}} information and processes involved in spoken word recognition. In particular it has highlighted the importance of non-linguistic influences during language processing, indicating that combined information from vision, phonology, and semantics is evident in performance on such tasks (see Huettig, Rommers & Meyer, 2011). Huettig & McQueen (2007) demonstrated that participants’ fixations to objects presented within a single visual display varied systematically according to their phonological, semantic and visual relationship to a spoken target word. The authors argue that only an explanation allowing for influence from all three knowledge types is capable of accounting for the observed behaviour. To date computational models of the VWP (Allopenna et al, 1998; Mayberry et al, 2009; Kukona et al, 2011) have focused largely on linguistic aspects of the task and have therefore been unable to offer explanations for the growing body of experimental evidence emphasising the influence of non-linguistic information on spoken word recognition. Our study demonstrates that an emergent connectionist model, based on the <b>Hub-and-spoke</b> <b>models</b> of semantic processing, which integrates visual, phonological and functional information within a central resource, is able to capture the intricate time course dynamics of eye fixation behaviour reported in Huettig & McQueen (2007).

50|$|Airlines quickly {{moved to}} a {{hub-and-spoke}} system, whereby an airline selected an airport, the hub, as the destination point for flights {{from a number of}} origination cities, the spokes. Because the size of the planes used varied according to the travel on that spoke, and since hubs allowed passenger travel to be consolidated in “transfer stations”, capacity utilization increased. The <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> survives among the legacy carriers, but the low-cost carriers (LCCs), now 30 percent of the market, typically fly point to point. The network hubs model offers consumers more convenience for routes, but point-to-point routes have proven less costly for airlines to implement. Over time, the legacy carriers and the LCCs will likely use some combination of point to point and network hubs to capture both economies of scale and pricing advantages.|$|R

40|$|<b>Hub-and-spoke</b> <b>models</b> of {{semantic}} representation {{suggest that}} coherent concepts are formed from {{the integration of}} multiple, modality-specific information sources with additional modality-invariant representations—most likely stored in the ventrolateral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). As well as providing the necessary computational mechanisms for the complexities of feature integration, these modality-invariant representations also license a key aspect of semantic memory—semantic-based generalization. Semantic dementia allows us to investigate this aspect of conceptual knowledge because (a) the patients have a selective and progressive semantic degradation and (b) this is associated with profound ventrolateral ATL atrophy. Specifically, the boundaries between concepts become degraded in semantic dementia and, when tested using the appropriate materials, the patients make simultaneous under- and overgeneralization errors. We found {{that the rate of}} these errors were a function of typicality and psuedotypicality of the items as well as the severity of the patients' semantic impairment.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{evidence suggests that}} language-mediated eye gaze around the visual world varies across individuals and is partly determined by their level of formal literacy training. Huettig, Singh & Mishra (2011) showed that unlike high-literate individuals, whose eye gaze was closely time locked to phonological overlap between a spoken target word and items presented in a visual display, low-literate individuals eye gaze was not tightly locked to phonological overlap in the speech signal but instead strongly influenced by semantic relationships between items. Our present study tests the hypothesis that this behaviour is an emergent property of an increased ability to extract phonological structure from the speech signal, {{as in the case}} of high-literates, with low-literates more reliant on syllabic structure. This hypothesis was tested using an emergent connectionist model, based on the <b>Hub-and-spoke</b> <b>models</b> of semantic processing (Dilkina et al, 2008), that integrates linguistic information extracted from the speech signal with visual and semantic information within a central resource.

Anatomical gap junctions connect RMG to multiple classes of sensory neurons known to promote aggregation, and to ASK sensory neurons, which are implicated in male attraction to hermaphrodite pheromones 5.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{evidence}} from multiple neuroscience techniques indicates that regions within the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) are a critical node in the neural network for representing conceptual knowledge, yet their function remains elusive. The <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> holds that ATL regions {{act as a}} transmodal conceptual hub, distilling the various sensory-motor features of objects and words into integrated, coherent conceptual representations. Single-cell recordings in monkeys suggest that the ATLs are critically involved in visual associative learning; however, investigations of this region in humans have focused on existing knowledge rather than learning. We studied acquisition of new concepts in semantic dementia patients, who have cortical damage centred on the ventrolateral aspects of the ATLs. Patients learned to assign abstract visual stimuli to two categories. The categories conformed to a family resemblance structure in which no individual stimulus features were fully diagnostic; thus the task required participants to form representations that integrate multiple features into a single concept. Patients were unable to do this, instead responding only {{on the basis of}} individual features. The study reveals that integrating disparate sources of information into novel coherent concepts is a critical computational function of the ATLs. This explains the central role of this region in conceptual representation and the catastrophic breakdown of concepts in semantic dementia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor a {{large city}} bus transit service, a point to point route network, {{attempting}} to connect each node to every other node results in large number of routes in the network which makes it practically very complex to understand and operate the services. To overcome these limitations a different transit network design approach is required. A combination of traditional destination oriented routes along with direction oriented routes, which is called as Hub and Spoke network could be better for operating bus transit in large network. Previous research works done using <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>model</b> mainly concentrates on airline network, where the influencing factors and variables for network design could be substantially different than transit network. This paper presents an approach to develop hub and spoke route network for bus transit services. Whole process consists of obtaining potential hubs, finding optimum location of hubs and allocation of non-hub nodes to hub nodes, generating inter hub and intra-hub routes and the frequencies for running buses. The model developed {{in this study is}} tested on the Mandl's Swiss network of fifteen nodes. The Mandl's network is most widely used by many researchers to analyze their models developed for point to point bus transit route network.
