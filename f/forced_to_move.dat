5|$|After the war, de Peyster served {{overseas}} as a dignitary. When {{he returned}} to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking to each other.

A material with larger grain size is able to have more dislocations pile up, leading to a bigger driving <b>force</b> for dislocations <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from one grain to another. Thus you will have <b>to</b> apply less <b>force</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> a dislocation from a larger than from a smaller grain, leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.|$|R
5|$|Just after half-time, Leicester City {{had their}} strongest scoring chance, when Andy Lochhead {{received}} a headed knockdown from Allan Clarke, but Lochhead's shot went {{high above the}} goal.

5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million {{can be attributed to}} the destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> inland for shelter.|$|E

5|$|While the Parthians {{regained the}} territories {{lost in the}} west, another threat arose in the east. In 177–176BC the nomadic {{confederation}} of the Xiongnu dislodged the nomadic Yuezhi from their homelands {{in what is now}} Gansu province in Northwest China; the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the Saka (Scythian) tribes. The Saka were <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> further west, where they invaded the Parthian Empire's northeastern borders. Mithridates was thus forced to retire to Hyrcania after his conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E

Moore wished to marry Walter although their relationship had begun to deteriorate, while Parks and Moore created competing workout DVDs after plans to make the project a joint venture proved unsuccessful. Toward the end of the season, Williams attempted to revive her failing marriage to Stewart with therapist sessions.|$|E

On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
