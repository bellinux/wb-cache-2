40|$|A novel {{biofilter}} that removes ammonia {{from air}} streams and converts it to nitrogen gas {{has been developed}} and operated continuously for 300 days. The ammonia from the incoming up-flow air stream is first absorbed into water and the carrier material, zeolite. A continuous gravity reflux of condensed water from the exit of the biofilter provides moisture for nitrifying bacteria to develop and convert dissolved ammonia (ammonium) to nitrite/nitrate. The down-flow of the condensed water reflux washes down nitrite/nitrate preventing ammonium and nitrite/nitrate accumulation at the top region of the biofilter. The evaporation caused by the inflow air leads to the accumulation of nitrite to extremely high concentrations {{in the bottom of}} the biofilter. The high nitrite concentrations favour the spontaneous chemical oxidation of ammonium by nitrite to nitrogen (N 2).

The purpose of the paper is to show how traditional way of dosing N-source for marginal availability to nutrient deficient influents results in poorly settling activated sludge regardless of the application of aerated or non-aerated selectors. External N-source calculated for marginal availability resulted in nutrient deficiency due to the relatively high yield experienced (0. 7 g biomass COD/g substrate COD). In the <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> system with overall N-deficiency, rapidly increasing overproduction of extracellular polysaccharide was experienced, leading to SVI (Sludge Volume Index) values up to 600 cm 3 g − 1. In the system with the non-aerated selector, initial nutrient deficiency could only be detected in the second reactor. Since neither overgrowth of floc-forming GAOs (Glycogen Accumulating Organisms) nor denitrification could be experienced, the non-aerated reactor operated as low-DO (Dissolved Oxygen) basin, attributing to the drastic overgrowth of filamentous bacteria leading to SVI values > 1000 cm 3 g − 1.

In this study, the migration behaviour of the waterborne pathogenic microorganisms Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Yersinia enterocolitica was investigated in water saturated granular systems. Both facultative bacteria were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and further acclimatized to a microaerophilic or <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> environment for 21 h. Experiments were conducted using laboratory-scale packed columns over controlled extreme dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The observed differences in the transport potential of these pathogens were found to depend strongly on the antecedent growth conditions under the tested environmental settings as well with the environmental DO in certain conditions. Further microbial characterization using cell titrations and FTIR spectroscopy gave a greater insight on the source of the surface charge that was found to dominate the attachment phenomena in sand packed columns. Techniques also revealed a probable role of other cell surface macromolecules (LPS) that could account for non-DLVO behaviour. The results illustrate the importance of considering physicochemical conditions relevant to the natural subsurface environment when designing laboratory transport experiments as evidenced by variations in microbe migration as a function of the DO under growth and acclimation.

Compressibility effects within self-aerated flows are examined. It is shown that Mach numbers as large as 2 will occur in localised aerated regions on large structures. A probe was developed which measured stagnation pressure and air concentration. The compressible nature of self-aerated flows is taken into consideration in formulating a relationship between these measurements and the velocity of the water. This expression is found to overestimate the velocity by about 7 % over a wide range of flow conditions. A velocity probe was also developed, based on a cross-correlation technique. This latter probe was the more successful and is recommended for future measurements within self-aerated flows. Profiles of stagnation pressure, air concentration and velocity were measured at each of five positions down the spillway for each of two discharges.

In <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> cells (245 μM dissolved O 2 in the medium) besides heme B only heme A was found while in low-oxygen cells (< 10 μM dissolved O 2) heme O was present at a concentration even higher than that of heme A.

At the same time thus the occurrence of heme O (cytochrome o) in cyanobacteria does of course not imply the existence of an ‘alternative oxidase’ since according to the well-known ‘promiscuity of heme groups’ both hemes O and A are likely to combine with one and the same apoprotein...|$|R

Microbiol. 68 : 5554 - 5562, 2002). Therefore, we investigated whether different phylogenetic groups of heterotrophic picoplankton from the coastal North Sea {{were able to take}} up a simple carbon source under anoxic conditions. Oxic and anoxic incubations (4 h) or enrichments (24 h) of seawater with radiolabeled glucose were performed in July and August 2003. Bacteria with incorporated substrate were identified by using a novel protocol in which we combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and microautoradiography of cells on membrane filters. Incorporation of glucose under oxic and anoxic conditions was found in α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster of the Bacteroidetes at both times, but not in marine Euryarchaeota. In July, the majority of cells belonging to the α-proteobacterial Roseobacter clade showed tracer incorporation both in oxic incubations and in oxic and anoxic enrichments. In August, only a minority of the Roseobacter cells, but most bacteria affiliated with Vibrio spp., were able to incorporate the tracer under either condition. A preference for glucose uptake under anoxic conditions was observed for bacteria related to Alteromonas and the Pseudoalteromonas-Colwellia group. These genera are commonly considered to be strictly aerobic, but facultatively fermentative strains have been described.

In this study, we examined whether water column flow velocity has an effect on gas exchange, and hence on internal oxygen partial pressures (pO 2) in the Mediterranean seagrass, Cymodocea nodosa. We measured the internal pO 2 in the horizontal rhizomes of C. nodosa in darkness at different mainstream flow velocities, combined with different levels of water column oxygen pO 2 using an experimental flume in the laboratory. Flow velocity clearly had an effect on the internal oxygen status. In stagnant, but <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> water the mean internal pO 2 was 6. 9 kPa, corresponding to about 30 % of air saturation. The internal pO 2 increased with increasing flow velocity reaching saturation of around 12. 2 kPa (60 % of air saturation) at flow velocities 7 cm s 1. Flow had a relatively larger influence on internal pO 2 at lower water column oxygen concentrations. By extrapolating linear relationships between internal and water column pO 2 in this experimental setup, rhizomes would become anoxic at a water column oxygen pO 2 of 4 – 4. 5 kPa (20 % of air saturation) in flowing water, but already at 6. 4 kPa (30 % of air saturation) in stagnant water. Water flow may play an important role for seagrass performance and survival in areas with poor water column oxygen conditions and may, in general, be of importance for the distribution of submerged rooted plants...|$|R

The treatments were {{laid out in a}} randomized complete block design with four replicates. Measurements were done in the 1991 wet season, 1992 dry season (four treatments), and the 1992 wet season (only treatment 3). Methane emission rates from the experimental plots showed pronounced seasonal and diel variations. The diel pattern of methane emission rates followed a consistent pattern, with highest rates observed in the early afternoon and lowest rates in the early morning. Methane emission rate was generally hig hest at the ripening stage. The average methane emission rate during the 1992 dry season (190 mg CH 4 m(- 2) d(- 1)) exceeded the average flux rates of the 1992 wet season (79 mg CH 4 m(- 2) d(- 1)) by a factor of 2. 4.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the T 2 -weighted axial MRI of 256 patients with diseases unrelated to their paranasal sinuses were reviewed between May 2002 and June 2003. The findings were categorized according to the anatomic location and the imaging characteristics of the abnormality.

Unilateral or bilateral involvement and septal deviation were also noted. A sinus was considered normal if it was <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> and no soft-tissue density was apparent within the cavity. Results: Among our cases, 111 (43. 5 %) were male and 145 (56. 5 %) were female. Of these patients, abnormalities in one or more of the sinus groups were found in 110 subjects (42. 9 %), 55. 5 % of which were male and 44. 5 % were female (P= 0. 001). Maxillary sinus abnormalities were observed in 66. 4 % of the patients, while ethmoid sinus abnormalities were found in 63. 6 %. Of the ethmoid abnormalities, 21 % were found in the anterior section, 9 % in the middle ethmoid, and 8 % in the posterior ethmoid. The most common abnormality found was mucosal thickening.

40|$|The {{sliding force}} was a {{contributing}} factor to the displacement of caissons from the Kamaishi composite breakwater during the Great East Japan tsunami 2011 (Arikawa et al., 2012). The pressure reduction on the landward wall of the caisson due to non-aeration of the overflowing jet gives rise to an additional horizontal force which increases the sliding force. The estimation of this additional horizontal force and the proper understanding of the physical processes which cause it are imperative in establishing stability of a caisson breakwater during tsunami overtopping. Tsunami is associated with accelerating flows with massive heads that results in detached overflow nappes. In this research, a simplified tsunami was modelled in the laboratory as a steady breakwater overflow and the respective pressure drop behind the overflow nappe is derived. The nappe trajectories are derived theoretically based on general projectile motion for both the aerated and non-aerated scenarios. This ballistic model is validated using measurements of the physical model. For the <b>aerated</b> <b>nappe,</b> the theoretical results and measurements are in agreement. For the non-aerated nappe, the ballistic model provides comparatively high deviations from the measured nappe. A sensitivity analysis of pressure reduction indicates the deviations {{can be attributed to}} the derived pressure drops. In addition, the governing physical processes related to caisson breakwater overflowing are investigated. The flow conditions below the overflow nappe are hydrostatic, which is implied by a time-averaged stationary water level below the nappe. The dynamic pressure arising from the stagnation pressure at the jet impingement on the flume bed is estimated and is compared with the pressure drop behind the nappe. The results suggest the above-mentioned dynamic pressure is negligible with respect to the pressure drop. Thus, it is concluded that the governing mechanism responsible for the pressure reduction is the air entrainment process during jet impingement. The air entrainment rate from the cavity behind the nappe is compared against the impinging velocity of the overflow jet. The results suggest that air entrainment rate increases with increasing jet impingement velocity, establishing the fact that higher inertia forces leads to rapid air entrainment. The ratio of additional horizontal force due to non-aeration to the total horizontal force is found to be between 0. 15 and 0. 25. However, some eccentricities are evident with extreme tail water depths and flow rates. Scaled-up forces are obtained using Froude scaling criteria. Reynolds numbers suggest that the flow is fully turbulent at both the lab and field scales, while Weber numbers show that surface tension effects might be more pronounced in the lab than in the field. As surface tension effects may affect the direct scaling up of model tests to field scale, the utility of numerical model simulations is apparent. In OpenFOAM, the k-epsilon turbulence model with the InterFoam solver is used for this purpose. Prior to investigating the validity of OpenFOAM to simulate the caisson overflowing scenario, the model is validated for open channel flow. The results indicate that OpenFOAM correctly simulates the open channel flow with respect to the logarithmic profile and the free-surface slope. Furthermore, simulation of the flow atop the caisson very closely matches that of the physical laboratory model test. The model results for nappe behaviour follows existing trends found in literature. The simulated overflow nappe is a clinging nappe rather than a detached one due to the inability of the 2 D model to allow air into the void behind the nappe. The significance of the present study has various aspects. The ballistic model enables the derivation of the nappe’s trajectories during steady overflow of a caisson breakwater. As a result, an explicit relationship between kinematics (ballistics) and dynamics (forces) can be developed. The estimation of the additional horizontal force due to non-aeration effects pave the way to improve design guidelines for the stability of caisson breakwaters during tsunami overtopping.

40|$|Biotreatment {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} means to reduce the organic and nutrient contents of liquid waste streams prior to their final discharges to the environment. Despite the fact that numerous bioreactor configurations and system schemes are currently available for a wide variety of environmental applications, it remains a major challenge to design a bioreactor system that is capable of offering effective and integrated functions of biodegradation, biomass-liquid separation, and biomass retention. For many environmental applications, the bioreactors are required to operate under low-substrate concentration conditions in order to meet stringent discharge requirements and as a result, both biodegradation rates and bioreactor biomass holdup are inevitably low. Auxiliary means are often used in conjunction with the bioreactors to rectify the problems. For instance, gravity clarifiers are incorporated as an integral part in the conventional activated sludge systems (suspended-growth systems) to capture and recycle the biomass as well as to produce low-SS (SS: suspended solids) effluent streams. On the other hand, small, fluidized media particles are used in biofluidized bed reactors (attached-growth systems) to form biofilm communities that effectively immobilize and retain the bacterial cells. In many cases, secondary clarifiers are not required to produce low-SS effluent streams. A novel bioreactor system, which combines desired characteristics of both suspended-growth and attached-growth systems, has been developed at the University of Pennsylvania. An upflow bioreactor is utilized to grow and maintain the biomass communities with the desired properties. In-situ, submerged-bubble oxygenation is replaced to eliminate intensive gas effervescence in the bioreactor to create a quiescent hydrodynamic environment that enables effective gravitational separation of bacterial cells from the axial liquid flow. The axial liquid flow, in turn, permits the formation of a biomass matrix, which can be described as continuous, interlocking, mat-like architecture, and loosely-structure with large void spaces. An external oxygenator, which is coupled to the upflow bioreactor, is employed to provide oxygenation and mixing of both feed and bioreactor effluent streams. A <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> stream, which is diverted from the oxygenator vessel, is used as the vehicle for the delivery of oxygen, substrates, and nutrients into the biomass matrix to sustain and control the desired biodegradation reactions. The chemoautotrophic biomass matrix performing the autotrophic nitrification and denitrification (AND) reactions and a heterotrophic biomass matrix responsible for the combined carbon and nitrogen (C/N) removal are grown and maintained to test the effectiveness of the bioreactor system. At a specific substrate loading rate, oxygen influx is employed as main experimental variable to control the extents of reactions to be achieved as well as to manipulate the reaction pathways to be maintained.

40|$|The yeast Pichia stipitis is of biotechnological {{importance}} {{because of}} her ability to ferment the sugar xylose to ethanol. This is not very widespread among yeast. Xylose can be obtained out if the wood composite hemicellulose, what makes wastes of paper and wood industry a possible source for bioethanol and biofuel. To {{pave the way to}} efficient biofuel production the physiological and genetically particularities of P. stipitis need to be better understood Within this work we first tested the ability of Pichia stipitis to use amino acids as carbon and nitrogen source. For this reason we performed growth experiments on several distinct amino acids. The gained results showed that P. stipitis is able to use glutamate, aspartate and proline as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. This is a trait, not very common and not very well examinated in yeasts. Only a few yeasts are known to possess this ability. To see how distributed this ability is, a choice of 34 yeasts strains, belonging to 24 species, was tested. Their growth on glutamate, aspartete and proline was determined. 20 of the tested yeasts were able to use amino acids as carbon source. This ability does not depend on the belonging to a defined cladus. After this observation we took a more detailed look at the behaviour of P. stipitis during growth on glutamate as carbon and as nitrogen source. An interesting result was that the ethanol yield and formation rate was higher when glutamate was used as nitrogen source compared to ammonium. In both cases glucose was used as carbon source. Another result of the experiment was that glutamate was used as carbon source simultaneously with glucose. In this constellation seems to be no carbon catabolite repression caused by glucose. When cultivated with glutamate as carbon source, P. stipitis secretes a great amount of ammonium into the medium which has so far not been described for yeasts. An ammonium secretion seems to point at an efficient ammonium export system. The growth experiments with glutamate as carbon source showed that P. stipitis grows after adaption with a rate similar to that on medium with glucose and glutamate or glucose and ammonium. The biomass yield is also very similar to that in cultivation with glucose, drawn to the yield per mol C-source. To get an insight into the physiological background of the utilization of glutamate as carbon source the activity of the glutamate dehydrogenases GDH 1 and GDH 2 was examinated. The activity of the catabolic GDH 2 was measured whenever glutamate or aspartate were present in the medium. The highest activity was measured with glutamate or aspartate as carbon source. It was observed that the GDH 2 activity is increased when ammonium is present in cultures with glutamate or aspartate as carbon source. No activity of the GDH 2 was found during cultivation on glucose and ammonium. The activity of the anabolic GHD 1 was only found in presence of glucose and ammonium, even if glutamate was also present. The correlation between glutamate utilization and GDH 2 activity leads to the idea of disrupting the PsGDH 2 gene. For this reason a strain disrupted in the PsKU 80 gene was constructed. This was done to circumvent the high rate of non-homologous integration of DNA, transformed into P. stipitis. The disruption of the KU 80 gene was successful and the gained mutant showed nearly 100 percent of homologous integration of DNA after transformation. This strain provides a useful tool for further genetic approaches on P. stipitis. Further information about these strain is given in the article send with these synopsis. Using the KU 80 strain we performed the disruption of the GDH 2 gene in P. stipitis. The gained transformant was unable to use glutamate as carbon or nitrogen source. It was also unable to use aspartate or proline as carbon source. But to a limited amount it was able to use these two amino acids as nitrogen source. A retransformation with an amplificate of the GDH 2 ORF restored the ability to utilize glutamate. After these experiments a random mutagenesis was performed to obtain mutants that are unable to utilize glutamate as carbon source. It might have been possible to indentify other factors involved into the regulation of glutamate utilization by these experiments. The random mutagenesis delivered two mutants which were unable to use glutamate as carbon source. But they were still able to use it as nitrogen source. In a plasmid-rescue these mutants were identified as ubiquitin ligase and cytochrome-C-oxidase subunit V (COX 5). The COX 5 mutant was chosen for further characterization. This was done by determination of the substrate spectrum, measuring of the ethanol formation under different aeration conditions, and by testing the sensitivity to inhibitors of the respiratory chain. The COX 5 mutant was unable to utilize any kind of non-fermentable carbon source. No activity of cytochrome-C-oxidase was detectable in crude cell extracts of the mutant. According to these observations {{it seems likely that the}} respiratory chain is no longer able supply energy for the cells. The COX 5 mutant forms significantly more ethanol under <b>fully</b> <b>aerated</b> conditions, compared to wild type and transformation strain. The ethanol formation is also higher on glucose compared to xylose. Under less aerated conditions the ethanol yield of the COX 5 mutant was lower but still higher than in the wild type. These findings lead to the estimation that in the COX 5 mutant the fermentative pathways are more active than in the wild type under highly aerated conditions. Growth experiments with SHAM, the inhibitor of the alternative oxidase, showed that the COX 5 mutant is completely sensitive to SHAM. The gas exchange was affected by SHAM in the same way. The wild type shows only minor reactions to high SHAM concentrations. This sensitivity of the mutant to SHAM shows the importance of the alternative oxidase after the lost of cytochrome-C-oxidase activity. The role seems to lie in maintaining the redox-balance of the cell, not in energy supply. If the alternative oxidase would deliver energy the mutant should be able to grow on non-fermentable substrates. Cultivations with KCN reduced the drymass yield of the wild type, but increased the one of the mutant. These observations were also supported by measuring the gas exchange. The gas exchange of the mutant was also increased in presence of KCN. Concerning these findings a stimulation effect of the KCN on the alternative oxidase could be possible...|$|R
