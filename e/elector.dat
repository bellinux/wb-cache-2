5|$|Bill C-31 also {{introduced}} {{the use of}} a unique personal identifier for each <b>elector</b> in the National Register of Electors, and changed the date by which electronic <b>elector</b> lists are to be made available to Members of Parliament for an electoral district to 15 November from 15 October.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, George {{resigned}} as field marshal, never {{to go on}} active service again. In 1710, he was granted the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Empire, an office formerly held by the <b>Elector</b> Palatine—the absence of the <b>Elector</b> of Bavaria allowed a reshuffling of offices. The death of the Emperor in 1711 threatened to destroy {{the balance of power}} in the opposite direction, so the war ended in 1713 with the ratification of the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip was allowed to succeed to the Spanish throne but was removed from the French line of succession, and the <b>Elector</b> of Bavaria was restored.|$|E
50|$|New Jersey’s electoral {{vote was}} split, with {{four of the}} <b>electors</b> pledged to Lincoln being elected because the alternative, a fusion ticket of <b>electors</b> {{supporting}} other candidates, saw the Breckinridge and Bell <b>electors</b> finish behind all other candidates. and three Douglas <b>electors</b> being elected.|$|R
50|$|There were 29 two-member {{constituencies}} and 179 single-member constituencies. Out of the 179 constituencies, 27 were {{reserved for}} Scheduled Castes and 1 {{was reserved for}} Scheduled Tribe. There were 73,01,080 <b>electors</b> in single member constituencies while 27,05,851 <b>electors</b> in two-member constituencies. Total <b>electors</b> in the state were 100,06,931 and the <b>electors</b> who were entitled to vote were 1,25,15,312 (including two-member constituencies). 39,59,518 <b>electors</b> voted in single member constituency while 24,60,641 <b>electors</b> caste their vote in double-member constituencies. Poll percentage in the state was 51.3%.|$|R
50|$|Three Georgia <b>electors</b> {{had voted}} for Greeley for president. Their votes for Greeley were {{rejected}} because Greeley was dead when the <b>electors</b> cast their ballots.

5|$|Violante Beatrice, the {{youngest}} {{child of the}} <b>Elector</b> of Bavaria, Ferdinand Maria, and Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, was born on 23 January 1673 in Munich, the capital of Bavaria. Her siblings were Maria Anna Victoria, Dauphine of France, <b>Elector</b> Maximilian II and Joseph Clemens, Archbishop of Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Although Gebhard had {{gathered}} some troops around him, {{he hoped to}} recruit support from the Lutheran princes. Unfortunately for him, he had converted to another branch of the Reformed faith; such cautious Lutheran princes as Augustus I, <b>Elector</b> of Saxony, balked at extending their military support to Calvinists and the <b>Elector</b> Palatine was unable to persuade them to join the cause. Gebhard had three primary supporters. His brother, Karl, had married Eleonore, Countess of Hohenzollern (1551–after 1598), and Gebhard could hope that this family alliance with the power-hungry Hohenzollerns would help his cause. Another long-time ally and supporter Adolf, Count von Neuenahr, was a successful and cunning military commander whose army secured {{the northern part of}} the territory. Finally, John Casimir (1543–1592), the brother of the <b>Elector</b> Palatine, had expressed his support, and made a great show of force in the southern part of the Electorate.|$|E

50|$|In the end, {{efforts to}} persuade more <b>electors</b> {{to vote against}} Trump {{ultimately}} failed, and Trump won 304 <b>electors</b> on December 19. Trump's electoral lead over Clinton even grew because {{a larger number of}} <b>electors</b> defected from her: Trump received 304 of his 306 pledged <b>electors,</b> Clinton 227 of her 232.|$|R
50|$|Roughly one {{in every}} hundred active {{citizens}} became <b>electors.</b> <b>Electors</b> paid taxes equal to 10 days work a year: typically 5 to 10 livres. There were about 50,000 <b>electors</b> in France at the time. These <b>electors</b> also met in assemblies where they nominated deputies, judges, and members of other departments.|$|R
50|$|The {{actual number}} of popular votes {{received}} by Kennedy and Nixon in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters voted for 12 separate <b>electors.</b> The vote totals of 458,638 votes for Kennedy and 274,472 votes for Nixon reflect the number of votes for the Kennedy and Nixon <b>electors</b> who received {{the highest number of}} votes. However, the Republican and Democratic <b>electors</b> receiving the highest number of votes were outliers from the other 11 <b>electors</b> from their party. The average vote totals for the 12 <b>electors</b> were 455,629 votes for the Democratic <b>electors</b> and 273,110 votes for the Republican <b>electors.</b> This shrinks Kennedy's election margin in Georgia by 1,647 votes to 182,519.|$|R
5|$|The envisioned status {{elevation}} did {{not merely}} serve a decorative purpose, but was regarded a necessity {{to prevail in}} political competition. Though Frederick III held the elevated status of a prince <b>elector,</b> this status was also gained by Maximilian I of Bavaria in 1623, during the Thirty Years' War, also by the <b>Elector</b> of the Palatinate in the Peace of Westphalia (1648), and by Ernest Augustus of the House of Hanover in 1692. Thus, the formerly exclusive club of the prince-electors now had nine members, six of whom were secular princes, and further changes seemed possible. Within the circle of prince-electors, August the Strong, <b>Elector</b> of Saxony, had secured the Polish crown in 1697, and the House of Hanover had secured succession of the British throne. From Frederick III's perspective, stagnation in status meant loss of power, and this perspective seemed to be confirmed when the European royals ignored Brandenburg-Prussia's claims in the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697).|$|E
5|$|Towering {{over the}} Rhine valley, the Godesburg's {{strategic}} position commanded the roads leading {{to and from}} Bonn, the <b>Elector</b> of Cologne's capital city, and Cologne, the region's economic powerhouse. Over time, the Electors strengthened its walls and heightened its towers. They added a small residence in the 14th century and the donjon (also called a Bergfried or keep) developed as a stronghold of the Electoral archives and valuables. By the mid-16th century, the Godesburg was considered nearly impregnable and had {{become a symbol of}} the dual power of the Prince-electors and Archbishops of Cologne, one of the wealthiest ecclesiastical territories in the Holy Roman Empire. The Cologne War, a feud between the Protestant <b>Elector,</b> Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, and the Catholic <b>Elector,</b> Ernst of Bavaria, was yet another schismatic episode in the Electoral and archdiocesan history.|$|E
5|$|With Eugene's {{forces at}} Höchstädt {{on the north}} bank of the Danube, and Marlborough's at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and the <b>Elector</b> debated their next move. Tallard {{preferred}} to bide his time, replenish supplies and allow Marlborough's Danube campaign to flounder in the colder weeks of Autumn; the <b>Elector</b> and Marsin, however, newly reinforced, were keen to push ahead. The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed on a plan and decided to attack Eugene's smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube.|$|E
5000|$|Over 22 occasions, a {{total of}} 179 <b>electors</b> have not cast their votes for President or Vice President as {{prescribed}} by the legislature of the state they represented. Of those, 71 <b>electors</b> changed their votes because the candidate to whom they were pledged died before the electoral ballot (1872, 1912). Two <b>electors</b> chose to abstain from voting for any candidate (1812, 2000). [...] The remaining 106 were changed by the <b>elector's</b> personal interest, or perhaps by accident. Usually, the faithless <b>electors</b> act alone. An exception was the 1836 election, in which all 23 Virginia <b>electors</b> acted together.|$|R

50|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to ascertain how many more <b>electors,</b> especially Republican <b>electors,</b> considered becoming faithless and voting for a Republican other than Trump, it was reported that at least an additional 20 Republican <b>electors</b> had already accepted the free-of-charge anonymous legal counsel and support provided for Republican faithless <b>electors</b> to assist them in voting against Trump.|$|R
5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the <b>elector</b> without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the <b>elector</b> politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the <b>elector</b> by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the <b>elector</b> introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E
5|$|In 1611 John Sigismund, <b>Elector</b> of Brandenburg {{was allowed}} by the Commonwealth sejm to inherit the Duchy of Prussia fief, {{after the death of}} Albert Frederick, the last duke of the Prussian Hohenzollern line. The Brandenburg Hohenzollern branch led the Duchy from 1618.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Johnson {{received}} only forty-eight electoral votes. One <b>elector</b> from Virginia and all eleven from South Carolina voted for Van Buren for president but selected {{someone other than}} Johnson for vice-president. Johnson lost {{his home state of}} Kentucky again and added to the embarrassment by losing his home district as well.|$|E
5000|$|The 1960 {{election}} {{was the only}} election that saw unpledged <b>electors</b> actually elected to the electoral college. In that year, a slate of eight unpledged <b>electors</b> in Mississippi won a plurality of the vote there (116,248 votes, or 39% of the total). In Alabama, where the vote was not for the presidential candidates but for individual <b>electors,</b> five of the eleven elected Democratic <b>electors</b> were pledged to Democratic nominees John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and six were unpledged. Louisiana's popular vote went to a slate of <b>electors</b> pledged to Kennedy and Johnson, but a slate of unpledged <b>electors</b> on the ballot there won 169,572 votes (21% of the vote).|$|R
2500|$|The {{current system}} of {{choosing}} <b>electors</b> is called the [...] "short ballot". In most states, voters choose a slate of <b>electors,</b> {{and only a few}} states list on the ballot the names of proposed <b>electors.</b> In some states, if a voter wants to write in a candidate for president, the voter is also required to write in the names of proposed <b>electors.</b>|$|R

5|$|McCreary was {{nominated}} {{to serve as}} a presidential <b>elector</b> for the ticket of Democrat Horatio Seymour in 1868; though he declined to serve, he attended the national convention as a delegate.

5|$|Paul {{received}} one electoral vote from a Texas faithless <b>elector,</b> South Texas College {{political science professor}} William Greene (who had been pledged to Donald Trump), in the 2016 presidential election, making Paul the oldest person ever to receive an electoral vote.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Schellenberg {{was part}} of the Grand Alliance's {{campaign}} of 1704 to prevent the Franco-Bavarian army from threatening Vienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. The campaign began in earnest on 19 May when the Duke of Marlborough began his 250-mile (400km) march from Bedburg near Cologne towards the <b>Elector</b> of Bavaria's and Marshal Marsin's Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Marlborough had initially deceived the French commanders– Marshal Villeroi in the Spanish Netherlands and Marshal Tallard along the Rhine– into thinking his target was Alsace or the Moselle farther to the north. However, when the <b>Elector</b> was notified on 5 June of Marlborough's march from the Low Countries, he had correctly predicted that it was his principality of Bavaria that was the Allies' real target.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2016 {{election}} cycle, {{the threshold}} of 270 electoral votes {{to win the presidency}} outright could have been thwarted by garnering a minimum of at least 12% of all Republican <b>electors</b> to become faithless, that is, 37 of 306 Republican <b>electors.</b> However, critics have noted, that garnering this many <b>electors</b> would be extremely unlikely, as <b>electors</b> vote more than 99% of the time as pledged.|$|R
50|$|By {{comparison}} when universal manhood suffrage {{was introduced}} for the 1918 general election, there were 12,913,166 registered male <b>electors</b> in the United Kingdom (including University <b>electors),</b> {{as opposed to}} the registration at the December 1910 general election of 7,709,981 (again including University <b>electors).</b>|$|R

5|$|The Electress became {{pregnant}} in 1692; however, she miscarried. It {{is thought that}} soon after arrival she contracted syphilis from the <b>Elector,</b> which explains why Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm failed to produce any children.|$|E
5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard {{as if he had been}} studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before <b>Elector</b> Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next stop was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend any of the three concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed <b>Elector</b> Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E
5|$|To that point, {{the federal}} government, through Elections Canada, assumed {{responsibility}} for ensuring that every eligible <b>elector</b> was registered for each electoral event. For the 1988 federal general election, this required about 110,000 enumerators, who would canvass door-to-door so {{the cost and}} effort to the individual was minimal.|$|E

50|$|Section 128 {{has been}} amended once, by the 1977 referendum. The change {{provided}} for the participation of <b>electors</b> in territories of Australia in referendums. <b>Electors</b> in territories which can be represented in the House of Representatives (currently the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) are counted in determining whether a majority of all <b>electors</b> in Australia approve a change. <b>Electors</b> in other territories (called external territories) cannot vote in referendums.|$|R
25|$|The {{failure of}} {{negotiations}} between Emperor Louis IV and the papacy led in 1338 to the declaration at Rhense by six <b>electors</b> {{to the effect that}} election by all or the majority of the <b>electors</b> automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. As result, the monarch was no longer subject to papal approbation and became increasingly dependent on the favour of the <b>electors.</b> Between 1346 and 1378 Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg, king of Bohemia, sought to restore the imperial authority. The Golden Bull of 1356 stipulated that in future the emperor was to be chosen by four secular <b>electors</b> and three spiritual <b>electors.</b> The secular <b>electors</b> were the King of Bohemia, the Count Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of Saxony, and the Margrave of Brandenburg; the three spiritual <b>electors</b> were the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Cologne.|$|R
