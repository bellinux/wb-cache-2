25|$|The soundtrack for Lord of the Rings Online has {{received}} much praise for its quality and variety. It features compositions from Turbine composer Stephen Digregorio {{as well as}} original songs from acclaimed video game composer Chance Thomas. Other composers include Geoff Scott, Brad Spears, and Egan Budd. According to Thomas, all references that {{were made to the}} music of the peoples of Middle-earth in the books were used to extrapolate as much information as possible about the instruments and styles that each race would have used to create their music. This information was then used as the base for creating the score. Additionally, 61 songs from the game were made available for free in mp3 format using a <b>download</b> <b>manager</b> released by Turbine.|$|E

2500|$|Build 4015 (build date of March 28, 2003) {{was leaked}} to the Internet on April 28, 2003. A number of {{features}} Microsoft {{had been working on}} were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, also moved and enlarged the Windows logo to {{the left side of the}} Start button a lot of additional configurability for the sidebar (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of [...] "Libraries" [...] (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. Libraries were later included in Windows 7. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new <b>Download</b> <b>Manager</b> shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style <b>download</b> <b>manager,</b> though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and the Sidebar made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|E
