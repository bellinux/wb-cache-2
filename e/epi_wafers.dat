5000|$|Solar cells, or {{photovoltaic}} cells (PV) for producing electric power from sunlight {{can be grown}} as thick <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> on a monocrystalline silicon [...] "seed" [...] wafer by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250 µm) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots. Solar cells made with this technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost if the CVD can be done at atmospheric pressure in a high-throughput inline process. [...] In September 2015, the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (Fraunhofer ISE) announced the achievement of an efficiency above 20% for such cells. The work on optimizing the production chain was done in collaboration with NexWafe GmbH, a company spun off from Fraunhofer ISE to commercialize production. The surface of epitaxial wafers may be textured to enhance light absorption. [...] In April 2016, the company Crystal Solar of Santa Clara, California, {{in collaboration with the}} European research institute IMEC announced that they achieved a 22.5% cell efficiency of an epitaxial silicon cell with an nPERT (n-type passivated emitter, rear totally-diffused) structure grown on 6-inch (150 mm) wafers. In September 2015 Hanwha Q Cells presented an achieved conversion efficiency of 21.4% (independently confirmed) for screen-printed solar cells made with Crystal Solar epitaxial wafers.|$|E
5000|$|Silicon <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> {{were first}} {{developed}} around 1966, and achieved commercial acceptance {{by the early}} 1980s. Methods for growing the epitaxial layer on monocrystalline silicon or other wafers include: various types of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) classified as Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Two [...] "kerfless" [...] methods (without abrasive sawing) for separating the epitaxial layer from the substrate are called [...] "implant-cleave" [...] and [...] "stress liftoff". A method applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are the same material employs ion implantation to deposit {{a thin layer of}} crystal impurity atoms and resulting mechanical stress at the precise depth of the intended epi layer thickness. The induced localized stress provide a controlled path for crack propagation in the following cleavage step. In the dry stress lift-off process applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are suitably different materials, a controlled crack is driven by a temperature change at the epi/wafer interface purely by the thermal stresses due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the epi layer and substrate, without the necessity for any external mechanical force or tool to aid crack propagation. It was reported that this process yields single atomic plane cleavage, reducing the need for post lift-off polishing, and allowing multiple reuses of the substrate up to 10 times.|$|E
40|$|Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) epi wafer {{manufacturing}} at {{thousands of}} wafers per week requires careful {{monitoring and control}} to ensure excellent quality and high yields. All product <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> undergo non-destructive testing which gives data on epi wafer sheet resistance, particle density, and surface roughness. These non-destructive measurements give only a limited view of wafer quality, therefore periodic destructive testing of selected <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> (HBT device fabrication and measurement) is required. It is highly desirable to directly measure key epi layer parameters on each product wafer {{in order to continue}} pushing toward the goals of perfect quality and yields. Therefore we have been working with the Laytec EpiTT in situ optical reflectance monitoring system. These data allow for immediate detection of shifts in the epi layers. Therefore problems can be detected and corrective actions taken before failed wafers are grown...|$|E

Good surface morphology {{with a low}} defect density has been obtained, even for epi thickness of 38 µm. Comprehensive characterization techniques conducted on the epi material obtained in this process have independently confirmed the high purity and low density of crystalline imperfections. Low temperature PL displays clear free exciton I 77 recombination while no L 1 line is discernable.

We {{known it}} has been an accepted industry practice for equipment vendors to sell ‘technology packages’, i. e. not only the reactor and associated items, but also the recipes to help get you running. Often this includes growing a few <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> in the vendor's lab to help your device guys make some prototypes.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses (XPS) for native oxides of (100) and (110) as-grown n-InAs <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> show an increase in As-oxide on the (100) surface {{and an increase in}} InOx on the (110) surface. In addition, XPS analyses of high-k (Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2) on n-InAs epi show that the intrinsic native oxide difference between (100) and (110) epi surfaces were eliminated by applying conventional in-situ pre-treatment (TriMethyAluminium (TMA)) before the high-k deposition. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) characterization of HfO 2 and Al 2 O 3 MOSCAPs on both types of n-InAs surfaces shows very similar C-V curves. The interface trap density (Dit) profiles show Dit minima of 6. 1 × 1012 / 6. 5 × 1012 and 6. 6 × 1012 / 7. 3 × 1012 cm− 2 eV− 1 for Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2, respectively for (100) and (110) InAs surfaces.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} limiting dark current mechanisms in InAs/GaSb type-II superlattice (T 2 SL) infrared detectors {{is key to}} improve the electrooptical performance of these devices. We present a six-component dark current analysis which, for the first time, takes account of sidewall-related dark current contributions in mesa-etched T 2 SL photodiodes. In a wide temperature range from 30 K to 130 K, the paper compares limiting mechanisms in two homojunction T 2 SL photodiode wafers for the long-wavelength infrared regime. While the two <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> were fabricated with nominally the same frontside process they were grown on different molecular beam epitaxy systems. In the available literature a limitation by Shockley-Read-Hall processes in the space charge region giving rise to generation-recombination (GR) dark current is the prevailing verdict on the bulk dark current mechanism in T 2 SL homojunction photodiodes around 77 K. In contrast, we find that investigated photodiode wafers are instead limited by the diffusion mechanism and the ohmic shunt component, respectively. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis of the various dark current components {{has led to an}} interesting observation on the temperature dependence of the shunt resistance in T 2 SL homojunction photodiodes. Our results indicate that the GR and the shunt mechanism share the same dependence on bandgap and temperature, i. e., a proportionality to exp(-E-g/ 2 kT) ...|$|E

40|$|Nanotopography {{refers to}} 10 - 100 nm surface height {{variations}} that exist on a lateral millimeter length scale on unpatterned silicon wafers. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of deposited or grown films (e. g., oxide or nitride) on such wafers can generate undesirable film thinning {{which can be}} of substantial concern in shallow trench isolation (STI) manufacturability. Proper simulation {{of the effect of}} nanotopography on post-CMP film thickness is needed to help in the measurement, analysis, diagnosis, and correction of potential problems. Our previous work has focused on modeling approaches that seek to capture the thinning and post-CMP film thickness variation that results from nanotopography, using different modeling approaches. The importance of relative length scale of the CMP process used (planarization length) to the length scale of the nanotopography on the wafer (nanotopography length) has been suggested. In this work, we report on extensive experiments using sets of 200 mm <b>epi</b> <b>wafers</b> with a variety of nanotopography signatures (i. e., different nanotopography lengths), and CMP processes of various planarization lengths. Experimental results indicate a clear relationship between the relative scales of planarization length and nanotopography length: when the planarization length is less than the nanotopography length, little thinning occurs; when the CMP process has a larger planarization length, surface height variations are transferred into thin film thickness variations. In addition to presenting these experimental results, modeling of the nanotopography effect on dielectric CMP processes is reviewed, and measurement data from the experiments are compared to model predictions. Results show a good correlation between the model prediction and the experimental da [...] ...|$|E

Allen Presented in {{this work}} is a novel design {{technique}} for CMOS integration of RF high Q integrated filters using positive feedback and current mode approach. Two circuits are designed {{in this work}}: a 100 MHz low-noise and high Q bandpass filter suited for an FM radio front-end, and a 2. 4 GHz low-noise and high-Q bandpass filter suited for a Bluetooth front-end. Current-mode approach and positive feedback design techniques are successfully used {{in the design of}} both circuits. Both circuits are fabricated through a 0. 18 um CMOS process provided by National Semiconductor Corp. The 100 MHz circuit achieves 3. 15 uV RF sensitivity with 26 dB SNR, and the total current consumption is 12 mA. The center frequency of the filter is tunable from 80 MHz to 110 MHz, and the Q value is tunable from 0. 5 to 28. 9. 1 dB compression point is measured as - 34. 0 dBm, combined with noise measurement results, a dynamic range of 54. 1 dB results. Silicon area of the core circuit is 0. 4 square millimeters. The center frequency of the 2. 4 GHz circuit is tunable from 2. 4 GHz to 2. 5 GHz, and the Q value is tunable from 20 to 120. The 1 dB compression dynamic range of the circuit is 50 dB. Integrated spiral inductors are developed for this design.
