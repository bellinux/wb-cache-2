5|$|An {{investigation}} {{conducted by}} the office of the Prosecutors General of the Soviet Union (1990–1991) and the Russian Federation (1991–2004) confirmed Soviet responsibility for the massacres but refused to classify this action as a war crime or an act of genocide. The investigation was closed {{on the grounds that the}} perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, and since the Russian government would not classify the <b>dead</b> <b>as</b> victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable.|$|E

5|$|A {{second season}} of episodic video games {{developed}} by Telltale Games {{was announced in}} July 2007. Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space followed the same overall format as Save the World, with each episode having a contained storyline with an overarching storyline involving laundering of {{the souls of the}} <b>dead.</b> <b>As</b> with Save the World, episodes were originally published on GameTap before being made available for general release. The season consisted of five episodes and ran from November 2007 to April 2008. Nowlin and Kasten both returned to reprise their voice roles. In addition to the main games, a twenty-minute machinima video was produced, taking the form of a Sam & Max Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|After the New Avengers {{are forced}} to allow Osborn to capture Luke Cage when he needs medical treatment, the team uses a {{tracking}} device Osborn had planted in Cage to trick him into blowing up his own house, after rescuing Cage from Osborn's custody. Osborn then creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming it poses a national security threat. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor's world to fall to Earth. In the middle of Osborn's fight with Captain America, Stark removes Osborn's armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams {{that they do not}} know what they have done, only for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all <b>dead</b> <b>as</b> the Void is released. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary, he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.|$|E

The Seditionistas also took several casualties, with five men dead and at least nine others wounded, of whom two later died. A Japanese man was found among the <b>dead,</b> <b>as</b> were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen as evidence that the Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego. The American soldiers were commended for their bravery during the raid, and Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of {{the flesh of the}} dying and <b>dead.</b> <b>As</b> he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of wooden posts, which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the <b>dead.</b> <b>As</b> no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E

5|$|In Lightning Returns, it is {{revealed}} that the contradicting desires of Yeul's incarnations have brought Caius back, with his body and soul becoming one with chaos and thus being beyond salvation. Lightning engages in a fight in the remains of Valhalla before learning of Caius's condition, along with his intention to stay in Nova Chrystalia to serve as custodian of the new Unseen Realm to guide the dead. Caius is seen after Bhunivelze's defeat, where he explains that the Yeuls intend to become the new goddess of the <b>dead.</b> <b>As</b> a final act before the new Unseen Realm is completely formed, Caius allows the final incarnation of Yeul to depart with Noel for the new world.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many <b>dead</b> <b>as</b> possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E

It is this group of individuals who become crucial in duping Parker into believing that he is actually a clone of himself created by the Jackal, while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as Ben Reilly – is actually the original.|$|E

He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{mounted a}} third attack {{late in the}} afternoon, around 3:00. Several times German {{soldiers}} attempted to penetrate the American lines. The Americans left their foxholes and in close combat fired on the attackers to push them back down the hill. At one point PFC Milsovech spotted a medic working on and talking to a soldier he felt certain was already <b>dead.</b> <b>As</b> mortar fire on his position got more accurate, Milsovech noticed a pistol on the supposed medic's belt, and decided he must be calling in fire on their position. He shot and killed him. Bouck contacted Regimental Headquarters once more, seeking reinforcements. At 3:50, Fort sent the unit's last update to Regimental headquarters in Hünningen. He reported they were still receiving some artillery fire but were holding their position against an estimated enemy strength of about 75, who were attempting to advance from Lanzerath towards the railroad to the northwest.|$|E
5|$|There was {{initially}} confusion as various conflicting reports of Nhung's demise surfaced, one source telling journalists that Nhung {{lived in a}} cottage within the grounds of Minh's villa and shot himself outside his house.

Other reports at the time said that Nhung was found <b>dead</b> <b>as</b> a result of strangulation at the Joint General Staff headquarters. According to variations of this line, Nhung either hanged himself in custody or was murdered by an unknown hand.|$|E

After {{a series}} of other story pitches, Lidster was asked to work on one of Russel T Davies’s standby plots {{concerning}} a spooky 24-hour supermarket to center on Jack and Ianto. Described as “Die Hard in a Supermarket”, it was set shortly after Ianto was brought back from the <b>dead</b> (<b>as</b> was originally planned, before this storyline shifted to Owen). It would have involved getting a woman named Maggie, the supermarket’s last customer, out alive. The store would have been possessed by a demonic creature from the rift that manifested only {{late at night and}} which feds of the human life-force. Ianto would have able to save the day due to being already dead.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot <b>dead</b> <b>as</b> they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Friday the 13th (1980), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) stalks and murders the teenagers preparing Camp Crystal Lake for re‑opening. She {{is determined to}} ensure that the camp does not reopen after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake due to the negligence of two staff members. The last counselor, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King), fends off Mrs. Voorhees long enough to grab a machete and decapitate her. In Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Jason (Steve Daskewisz/Warrington Gillette) is revealed to be alive and fully grown. After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for <b>dead</b> <b>as</b> Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. During the events of Friday the 13th Part III (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the machete from his shoulder and finds his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.|$|E
