50|$|Behe {{uses the}} {{mousetrap}} as an illustrative {{example of this}} concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bar.</b> All of these must be {{in place for the}} mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function. Intelligent design advocates claim that natural selection could not create from scratch those systems for which science is currently unable to find a viable evolutionary pathway of successive, slight modifications, because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.|$|E
50|$|In his 2008 book Only A Theory, {{biologist}} Kenneth R. Miller challenges Behe's {{claim that}} the mousetrap is irreducibly complex. Miller observes that various subsets of the five components can be devised to form cooperative units, ones that have different functions from the mousetrap and so, in biological terms, could form functional spandrels before being adapted to the new function of catching mice. In an example taken from his high school experience, Miller recalls {{that one of his}} classmates...struck upon the brilliant idea of using an old, broken mousetrap as a spitball catapult, and it worked brilliantly.... It had worked perfectly as something other than a mousetrap.... my rowdy friend had pulled a couple of parts --probably the <b>hold-down</b> <b>bar</b> and catch-- off the trap {{to make it easier to}} conceal and more effective as a catapult... leaving the base, the spring, and the hammer. Not much of a mousetrap, but a helluva spitball launcher.... I realized why Behe's mousetrap analogy had bothered me. It was wrong. The mousetrap is not irreducibly complex after all.|$|E
