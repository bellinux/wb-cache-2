50|$|The {{organization}} {{partnered with}} Philippe Starck {{to design a}} kit {{that would make it}} easier to set up libraries in disaster zones and areas affected by conflict. This {{led to the creation of}} the <b>Ideas</b> <b>Box,</b> a mobile, pop-up library equipped with books, e-readers, tablets, laptops, cameras, a digital library, and web-based content, including Wikipedia and Khan Academy videos. The <b>Ideas</b> <b>Box</b> breaks down into tables and chairs, and provides its own internet access and energy source. It has been used in a variety of contexts, including refugee and IDP camps, demobilization zones and Native American reservations.|$|E
50|$|It {{was formed}} in 2007. The {{organization}} distributes 50,000 books annually and developed the <b>Ideas</b> <b>Box,</b> a mobile library and multimedia center that provides informal learning opportunities to refugees and other vulnerable groups.

This paper evaluates four different creativity techniques, namely Hall of Fame, Constraint Removal, Brainstorming, and <b>Idea</b> <b>Box,</b> using creativity workshops with students and industry practitioners. In total, 34 creativity workshops were conducted with 90 students from two universities, and 86 industrial practitioners from six companies. The {{results from this study}} indicate that Brainstorming can generate by far the most ideas, while Hall of Fame generates most creative <b>ideas.</b> <b>Idea</b> <b>Box</b> generates the least number of ideas, and the least number of creative ideas. Finally, Hall of Fame was the technique that led to the most number of requirements that was included in future releases of the products. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The studio-gameon {{event was}} {{supported}} by the Institute of the Creative Industries and Innovation and the Faculty of IT as part of the State Library of Queensland GAME ON exhibition (ex Barbican, UK) The studio produced a full game in six weeks. It was a curated event, a live web-based exhibition, a performance for the public and the team produced a digital / creative work which is available for download. The studio enabled a team of students to experience the pressures of a real game studio within the space of the precincts but also very much in the public eye. It was a physical hypothesis of the University's mantra - "for the real world" statement: Studio GameOn is an opportunity running alongside the GAME ON exhibition at the State Library of Queensland. The exhibition itself {{is open to the public}} from November 17 th through to February 15 th. The studio runs from January 5 th to February 13 th 2009. The Studio GameOn challenge? To put together a team of game developers and make a playable game in six weeks! The studio-game on team consists of a group of game developers in training - the team members are all students who are either half-way through or completing a qualification in game design and all its elements - we have designers, artists, programmers and productionteam members. We are also fortunate to have an Industry Board consisting of local Queensland Games professionals: John Passfield (Red Sprite Studios), Adrian Cook (WIldfire Studios) and Duncan Curtis and Marko Grgic (The 3 Blokes). We also invite the public to play with us - there is an <b>ideas</b> <b>box</b> both on-site at the State Library and a number of ways to communicate with us on this studio website...|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} an {{investigation}} of open source, crowdsourcing, and public engagement in the public and nonprofit sectors through four cases: (1) Changemakers competitions, (2) Peer to Patent in the U. S., (3) Future Melbourne 2020 in Australia, and (4) <b>Idea</b> <b>Box</b> in Japan. Macintosh’s (2004) case analytical framework is adopted to systematically document the four cases for comparisons. From the literature three components are identified to understand the open source and crowdsourcing models: initiator, mechanism for information selection, and beneficiary. Three components are used to examine how governments or nonprofits adopt the open source model or crowdsourcing model to facilitate public engagement. The conclusion is that different designs of the projects might lead to different scales of public engagement, defined by Savar & Denhardt (2010). Finally, some potential issues and challenges of implementing the open source and crowdsourcing models to facilitate engagement in public affairs are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>idea</b> for <b>Box</b> {{originated}} as {{a college}} business project that Levie was working on in 2004. The project examined cloud storage options for businesses and after contacting several organizations to ask how they are storing their content and data, Levie {{came to the conclusion}} that the market was fragmented. Levie saw an opportunity to build an online file storage business as a way for individuals to access and store documents and files.|$|R

50|$|Alternative goals:Several {{variants}} {{adjust the}} requirements for completing a level. For example, in Block-o-Mania the boxes have different colours, and {{the goal is to}} push them onto squares with matching colours. Sokomind Plus implements a similar <b>idea,</b> with <b>boxes</b> and target squares uniquely numbered. In Interlock and Sokolor, the boxes also have different colours, but the goal is to move them so that similarly coloured boxes are adjacent. In CyberBox, each level has a designated exit square, and the goal is to reach that exit. In a variant called Beanstalk, the elements of the level must be pushed onto the goal in a fixed sequence.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>idea</b> of a <b>boxing</b> {{kangaroo}} originates {{from the}} animal's defensive behavior, {{in which it}} will use its smaller forelegs (its [...] "arms") to hold an attacker in place while using the claws on its larger hind legs to try to kick, slash or disembowel them.

5000|$|Jones {{lived in}} the village of Cwmaman, near Aberdare, where he became friends with neighbours, Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together. Showing a talent for writing in his youth, he {{considered}} being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college. The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but, as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material, he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics. Jones also flirted with the <b>idea</b> of <b>boxing</b> as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level. Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics' debut album, including his account of his teen years on a market stall. These are documented in [...] "More Life in a Tramps Vest" [...] from Stereophonics' first album released in 1997, Word Gets Around.|$|R

The New York Avenue apartments were named the Jeanette Apartments, after his wife. Later, they were known as the Fralinger Apartments.|$|R
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters.

Fifteen years after the “state of conserva-tion” published by the DoA and Ifpo, the International Conference in Rome (2014) {{gave me the opportunity}} to propose new iconographical approaches. The bay opened on the west aisle of the audience hall offered a rich iconographic panorama, as if this aisle was a kind of box full of pictures. How had the owner organized them and how can we de-scribe and finally represent this aisle? I found an “answer” in a Byzantine manuscript, “The Christian Topography” attributed to Kosmas Indikopleustes, around the <b>idea</b> of <b>boxes</b> of pictures. The change from miniatures to an architectural size and megalog-raphy, could explain an evolution through the Umayyad califate.

In five points, I will try to open a new field of research, though not without considering that the next restoration will find other new evidence...|$|R
