5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do <b>it</b> <b>carefully,</b> but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants to do before death.|$|E
25|$|Mommsen {{followed}} by a generation the historian Barthold Niebuhr, who had made significant advances in Roman studies. Niebuhr elevated the standards of scholarship and, in doing so, brought to light the lack of rigor of earlier work. He insisted on investigating the original sources. By his perceptive questioning, he challenged the surviving Latin and Greek historical literature, especially regarding earliest Rome. Niebuhr sifted <b>it</b> <b>carefully</b> in order to separate out what genuinely reflected the actual events: stories sourced in persons with personal knowledge, as opposed to inventions created apart from the event and containing suspect information, e.g., legend or folktales thoroughly scrambled with myth and fiction. He relied {{in part on the}} emerging field of source criticism to shed new light on the old writings. Niebuhr's Roman History was highly praised.|$|E

25|$|When he was 19, Wharton apprenticed with an {{accountant}} {{for two years}} and became proficient in business methods and bookkeeping. At 21, he partnered with his older brother Rodman to start a business manufacturing white lead. Wharton's chemistry mentor, Martin Boye, had developed a method to refine cottonseed oil and the Wharton brothers tried but failed to develop a profitable method to extract it. In 1849 Wharton started a business manufacturing bricks using a patented machine which pressed dry clay into forms. There was substantial competition in the brick business, which was affected by cyclical business swings, and after several trips to sell bricks and the brick-making machines, Wharton found the prospects for making good profits were dim. However, from the endeavor he gained valuable experience. In 1853, Wharton joined the Pennsylvania and Lehigh Zinc Company near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, first managing the mining operation and later the zinc oxide works. Wharton proved himself by negotiating a new charter for the works, and in the difficult financial environment of 1857–1858 he took over control of the zinc works, managing <b>it</b> <b>carefully</b> so that it turned a profit. In 1860 Wharton, after some challenging negotiations with the directors of the company, developed for Lehigh Zinc the first plant to manufacture metallic zinc in America. Looking into the next business cycle, he leased the plant for four years and eventually made a robust profit from the sale of metallic zinc, used in making brass, which picked up in the Civil War years.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{portions}} of Champollion's works were edited by Jacques and published posthumously. His Grammar and Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian {{had been left}} almost finished and was published posthumously in 1838. Before his death, he had told his brother [...] "Hold <b>it</b> <b>carefully,</b> I {{hope that it will}} be my calling card for posterity". It contained his entire theory and method, including classifications of signs and their decipherments, and also a grammar including how to write and conjugate nouns and verbs. But it was marred by the still tentative nature of many readings, and Champollion's conviction that the hieroglyphs could be read directly in Coptic, whereas in fact they represented a much older stage of the language which differs in many ways from Coptic.|$|E

In it, the author repeatedly expounds the doctrine that the universe consists of only two places, the Earth below the firmament and heaven above <b>it.</b> <b>Carefully</b> drawing on arguments from scripture, he describes the Earth as a rectangle, 400 day's journey long by 200 wide, surrounded by four oceans and enclosed by four massive walls which support the firmament.

He planted and carefully tended it; it grew into a plant that he identified as a dahlia. He made cuttings from the plant during the winter of 1872-1873. This was an entirely different type of flower, with a rich, red color and a high degree of doubling. In 1874 van der Berg catalogued it for sale, calling it Dahlia juarezii to honor Mexican President Benito Pablo Juarez, who had died the year before, and described it as [...] "...equal to the beautiful color of the red poppy. Its form is very outstanding and different in every respect of all known dahlia flowers.".|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} control strips, both {{located on the}} inward-facing {{sides of the border}} fences. The {{secondary}} [...] "K2" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran alongside the signal fence {{to the rear of the}} Schutzstreifen, while the primary [...] "K6" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran along the inside of the border fence or wall. The K6 strip ran almost uninterrupted along the entire length of the border. Where it ran across roads, the road surface would be ripped up to make way for the control strip; where the border ran along streams and rivers, the strip was constructed parallel with the waterways. In places where the border was prone to escape attempts, the control strip was illuminated at night by high-intensity floodlights (Beleuchtungsanlage) installed on concrete poles, which were also used at vulnerable points such as rivers and streams crossing the border. The strip was patrolled several times a day by guards, who would inspect <b>it</b> <b>carefully</b> for signs of intrusion.|$|E
2500|$|Working {{with visual}} effects {{supervisor}} Dan Glass, Trumbull {{used a variety}} of materials for the creation of the universe sequence. [...] "We worked with chemicals, paint, fluorescent dyes, smoke, liquids, CO2, flares, spin dishes, fluid dynamics, lighting and high speed photography to see how effective they might be," [...] said Trumbull. [...] "It was a free-wheeling opportunity to explore, something that I have found extraordinarily hard to get in the movie business. Terry didn't have any preconceived ideas of what something should look like. We did things like pour milk through a funnel into a narrow trough and shoot it with a high-speed camera and folded lens, lighting <b>it</b> <b>carefully</b> and using a frame rate that would give the right kind of flow characteristics to look cosmic, galactic, huge and epic." [...] The team also included Double Negative in London. Fluid-based effects were developed by Peter and Chris Parks, who had previously worked on similar effects for The Fountain.|$|E

[...] Pherson is a sound {{technician}} who tries {{to figure out the}} secret of the Great Machine's power so that he can make money from it. [...] He captures a sound bite of Hundred in action, and studies <b>it</b> <b>carefully</b> to determine the source {{of the power of the}} Great Machine's [...] "voice." [...] After Pherson hears his pet African Grey parrot repeat the recorded phrase (duplicating frequency and timbre in a manner Pherson's audio gear cannot), he gains the ability to hear and talk to animals. He learns a means for disrupting Hundred's powers and utilizes it in pursuit of his cause of extremist animal rights. He goes on to draw out Hundred; however, Hundred turns his powers against him, resulting in his death by mauling by a pack of dogs, followed by an explosion which brings part of a building down on him. Despite this, Kremlin asserts that Pherson is still alive. [...] Pherson's parrot, which has been seen in the present time of the book, also appears to have both an increased intellect and some of the same powers.|$|E
2500|$|The largely unenthusiastic press {{reaction}} to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith {{in the concept of}} an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. [...] In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. [...] Gene Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: [...] "I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to <b>it</b> <b>carefully,</b> the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody was so afraid of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't remember much recording." ...|$|E
2500|$|Incendiary and flaming {{weapons were}} used in warfare for centuries prior to the {{invention}} of Greek fire. They included a number of sulfur-, petroleum-, and bitumen-based mixtures. Incendiary arrows and pots containing combustible substances were used {{as early as the}} 9th century BC by the Assyrians and were extensively used in the Greco-Roman world as well. Furthermore, Thucydides mentions that in the siege of Delium in 424 BC a long tube on wheels was used which blew flames forward using a large bellows. The Roman author Julius Africanus, writing in the 3rd Century AD, records a mixture that ignited from adequate heat and intense sunlight, used in grenades or night attacks:Automatic fire also by the following formula. This is the recipe: take equal amounts of sulphur, rock salt, ashes , thunder stone, and pyrite and pound fine in a black mortar at midday sun. Also in equal amounts of each ingredient mix together black mulberry resin and Zakynthian asphault, the latter in a liquid form and free-flowing, resulting in a product that is sooty colored. Then add to the asphalt the tiniest amount of quicklime. But because the sun is at its zenith, one must pound <b>it</b> <b>carefully</b> and protect the face, for it will ignite suddenly. When it catches fire, one should seal it in some sort of copper receptacle; in this way you will have it available in a box, without exposing it to the sun. If you should wish to ignite enemy armaments, you will smear it on in the evening, either on the armaments or some other object, but in secret; when the sun comes up, everything will be burnt up.In naval warfare, the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) is recorded by chronicler John Malalas to have been advised by a philosopher from Athens called Proclus to use sulfur to burn the ships of Vitalianus. Greek fire proper, however, was developed in c. 672 and is ascribed by the chronicler Theophanes to Kallinikos (Latinized Callinicus), an architect from Heliopolis in the former province of Phoenice, by then overrun by the Muslim conquests: ...|$|E
