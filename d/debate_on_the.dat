5|$|The Scottish {{independence}} referendum has {{led some}} islanders {{to call for a}} <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> constitutional position of the Western Isles, linked with similar initiatives in Orkney and Shetland.|$|E
5|$|Amongst those {{calling for}} change have been Tony Beddison, then {{chairman}} of the Australia Day Committee (Victoria), who argued for change and requested <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue in 1999; and Mick Dodson, Australian of the Year in 2009, who called for debate as to when Australia Day was held.|$|E
5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different fields. For example, the book illuminates the progress of Darwinism, camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> purpose of animal coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.|$|E

5|$|Bryan {{had been}} a dark horse {{candidate}} with little support in the convention. His speech, delivered {{at the close of}} the <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> party platform, electrified the convention and is generally credited with getting him the nomination for president. However, he lost the general election to William McKinley and the United States formally adopted the gold standard in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{formation}} of an SNP minority government after the Scottish parliamentary election of May 2007, a new <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abolition of tolls was opened by Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson on 31 May 2007, where it was agreed by a large majority. Toll levies at that point totalled £16million annually.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evaluation}} {{of the book is}} from a variety of perspectives, including the history of Darwinism, the history of the Thayer <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> purpose of camouflage, the mechanisms of camouflage, sexual selection, and mimicry. Beddard is seen as having covered a wide swath of modern biology with both theory and experiment.|$|E

5|$|On December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill: a cloture vote {{to end the}} filibuster. The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, {{with all}} Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote). The bill was {{endorsed}} by the AMA and AARP.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, the Senate {{voted for}} cloture by a 70-30 vote, thus {{overcoming}} {{the threat of}} filibuster and limiting further <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bill. On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77-19 vote (Democrats 47-16, Republicans 30-2); only Senators representing Southern states voted against it.|$|E
5|$|On this basis, an anti-drug {{campaign}} was initiated by Baba lovers in the United States, Europe and Australia.

5|$|There {{had already}} been public <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fate of retired cricketers, and {{counties}} had improved pay and conditions for their professional players. For example, several counties, including Yorkshire, had instituted winter pay before Pullin's writings were published. However, former players did not benefit from these reforms.|$|E
5|$|As it was, Heilmann's {{conclusion}} was so persuasive that it forestalled further <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject {{even in the}} face of additional conflicting evidence. In 1936, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp described a new theropod from the Jurassic of North America, Segisaurus. Like Oviraptor, Segisaurus had an unmistakable clavicle, but unlike Oviraptor, it was also plainly identified as being such in the paper that described it. Despite this, the implication of a wishbone-bearing dinosaur was blatantly ignored until much later, and for many years the state of dinosaur research stagnated, possibly due to the effects of the Depression and World War II.|$|E
5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E

5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It {{was in the midst}} of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to deflect criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X would now be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, {{stated that}} he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons {{for the presence of}} water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department did not intend to amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E
5|$|Fences and Windows was {{published}} as a trade paperback by Picador in the US, Vintage Canada in Canada, and Flamingo in the UK. It {{was released in}} October 2002 with little promotion. The resulting sales were lower than expected. A portion of the book's proceeds was given to a legal defense fund for activists and for education concerning global democracy. Just after the book's release, a <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic of globablization was held between Klein and The Economist journalist Sameena Ahmad in New York.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, NATO officially {{recognized}} three aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia. Macedonia {{has been}} prevented from joining the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topic of membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin used {{thermodynamics}} {{to estimate}} the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject; {{it was only when}} radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old. The perception of Earth shifted again in the 20th century when humans first viewed it from orbit, and especially with photographs of Earth returned by the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg {{cast his}} first {{vote in the}} House of Commons, in support of Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg {{delivered}} his maiden speech on 7 July, in a <b>debate</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of propaganda. He called for {{the lifting of the}} ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a potentially valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E
