5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally.

After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium,</b> calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|E

50|$|Six dancers were {{introduced}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dancing <b>podium</b> and three dancing routines were shown (i.e. disco, boy bands, Michael Jackson, etc.).

The DJ (sometimes wearing props for the routine) tells everyone {{the name of the}} artist and song. The power dancer dances to the song first and then the partner. At the end, only the studio audience could vote. The results were shown after the first commercial break, after the interview with what the audience selected, and after what moves the dancer made, after the first and second commercial break only. The dancer with the most vote moves on and goes to the safe zone while the other turns in his/her dancing shoes. The process is repeated until there is two dancers and one dancing routine left. The randomizer selects the power dancer and the power dancer must either pass to a partner or dance. The top 3 semifinalists move on after this round.|$|R
