5|$|After {{a show in}} Indianapolis, Insane Clown Posse's {{tour bus}} stopped at a Waffle House in Greenfield, Indiana. When a {{customer}} began to harass Spaniolo and Bruce, a fight broke out between the customer {{and all of the}} bands' members. Months later on June 4, 1998, Bruce and Utsler pleaded guilty to misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges (reduced from battery) in an Indiana court and were fined $200 each. Members of Twiztid, Myzery, and Psycho Realm were charged with battery. The group's tour was briefly derailed in January 1998, when their tour bus <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> a highway and down an embankment, leaving Frank Moreno of Psycho Realm with a concussion. As a result of the accident, Insane Clown Posse postponed two shows scheduled for Cleveland, Ohio, on January 22 and 23, but honored their promise to perform on January 25 and 26. They face a lawsuit over alleged sexual harassment.|$|E
25|$|On 11 October 1797 the Batavier {{took part}} in the Battle of Camperdown under Captain Jan Jacob Souter. Early in the battle, the ship was under heavy fire, but soon she <b>drifted</b> <b>off,</b> and she {{eventually}} left the scene and fled to Texel.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Cambrian, the supercontinent Pannotia broke up and Avalonia <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> northwards from Gondwana. This {{independent}} movement of Avalonia started from a latitude of about 60° South. The {{eastern end of}} Avalonia collided with Baltica, a continental plate occupying the latitudes from about 30°S to 55°S, as the latter slowly rotated anticlockwise towards it. This happened {{at the end of}} the Ordovician and during the early Silurian.|$|E

25|$|The {{next morning}} the {{garrison}}'s Indian escort had <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> and the garrison was attacked in the woods by perhaps 700 Indians. Some 22 soldiers, including all the officers except Stuart, equal {{to the number of}} Cherokee chief hostages killed at Fort Prince George, and 3 civilians were killed and 120 or more were taken prisoners. Captain Demeré alone was tortured, scalped, made to dance and beaten until he died for betraying the surrender agreement.|$|E
25|$|Pisagua <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> leeward {{after the}} collision, {{but managed to}} survive with severe damage to the bow and foremast. Towed to Dover for {{immediate}} sea-going repairs, she was then towed to Hamburg where she was condemned. She was rebuilt as a whale factory ship and operated by Søren L. Christensen,. On 12 February 1913, Pisagua was stranded at Low Island, South Shetland Islands. Although insured for NOK 318,000, she was subsequently condemned and written off {{at a loss to}} her owners.|$|E
25|$|Despite these changes, the {{failures}} kept coming. After a six-month gap, Midas 5 orbited on April 9, 1962. The satellite reached orbit successfully, but experienced a massive power failure during the sixth orbit. Eight months later, Midas 6 lifted off (December 17) but {{never made it}} to orbit. At liftoff, an improper disconnect of the hydraulic rise-off caused loss of booster engine hydraulics fluid during ascent. The Atlas <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> its flight path and the Range Safety destruct command was sent 82 seconds into the launch.|$|E

25|$|The West Bridge {{has been}} struck by sea traffic twice. While the link was still under {{construction}} on 14 September 1993, the ferry M/F Romsø <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> course in bad weather and hit the West Bridge. At 19:17 on 3 March 2005, the 3,500-ton freighter MV Karen Danielsen crashed into the West Bridge 800 metres from Funen. All traffic across the bridge was halted, effectively cutting Denmark in two. The bridge was re-opened shortly after midnight, after the freighter was pulled free and inspectors had found no structural damage to the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The battle went on {{with the}} English trying to board the ship three times. All three {{attempts}} however were repelled by the Portuguese - putting up a brave fight knowing the riches were too great to lose. The captain of the Mayflower George Cave was killed which discouraged his men from attacking. The crew of Sampson was repulsed with losses and fighting continued for several hours with the four ships moored to each other. Shortly after, the other two ships, having lost hope of mastering Chagas <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> and Nicholas Downton was severely wounded and William Antony later was mortally wounded.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over {{to see what the}} problem was. He found her moaning, with her head slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the side of her head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in {{classical}} Antiquity, the warships of the 6th century did not feature rams; naval combat was therefore dominated by missile exchanges and boarding actions. In {{this form of}} combat, experience {{and the ability to}} maintain a formation of ships was essential, and the Byzantine crews held the advantage over the inexperienced Goths. Soon, in the heat of battle, some Gothic ships <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> the main body and were easily destroyed, while others sailed too close together and were unable to maneuver. In the end, the weary Gothic fleet disintegrated and their ships fled as best as they could. They lost 36 ships, and Gibal was captured, while Indulf with the remainder fled towards Ancona. As soon as he came close to the Gothic army's camp, he beached his ships and set them on fire.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{carried on}} with minor {{variations}} {{for the next}} two nights, with half-hearted parleys carried out in daytime since the Japanese apparently did not dare to attack during the day. In addition to repeating the manoeuvers of the first night, Arima tried a variety of different methods to subdue the ship. First he tried sending two samurai to board the ship in disguise and kill Pessoa on deck, but this failed as the two were not allowed onto the ship. He then sent divers to cut the cables of the ship's anchor, but this was also unsuccessful. On the third night Arima sent forth a flotilla of fire ships, but they all <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> in the wind save one, which slammed into the bow cable of the carrack but was cleared without much difficulty.|$|E
25|$|A soldier {{informed}} Gavin {{that the}} windspeed at the landing site was 56km/h (about 34 miles per hour). During the planning phase, 24km/h (about 14.5 miles per hour) had been assumed. After {{one hour of}} flying, the plane crew could see the bombardment of the invasion beaches. Gavin ordered his men {{to prepare for the}} jump, and a few minutes later was the first paratrooper to jump from the plane. Due to the higher-than-expected windspeed, he sprained his ankle while landing. After assembling a group of 20 men, his S-3, Major Benjamin H. Vandervoort, and his S-1, Captain Ireland, he realized that they had <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> course and were miles from the intended landing areas. He could see signs of combat twenty miles onwards; he gathered his men and headed towards the combat zone.|$|E

25|$|In the Fall of 1729, a {{ship from}} Satsuma {{bound for the}} {{province}} of Osaka <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> course and ended up landing at Cape Lopatka, in Russia. Upon arrival, the crew were attacked {{by a group of}} cossacks led by Andreï Chtinnikov. Out of seventeen members, only two survived: a trader named Soza, and the pilot's son and apprentice, Gonza. The two were sent across the country to the capital of Saint Petersburg, where they were received in audience by Empress Anna Ivanovna, and later baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. They went on afterwards to teach Japanese, and helped establish the first Japanese-language school in Russia. Gonza, who was also fluent in Russian, wrote and edited a number of books about the Japanese language, using the Cyrillic alphabet to transliterate words. These transliterations provide not only the oldest record of the Satsugū dialect, but have also been cited for their comprehensive evidence of the history, phonology and variability of the Japanese language.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure to}} relieve Fort Loudon forced the {{garrison}} to surrender with Captain Demeré and the garrison allowed {{to retain their}} arms and enough ammunition {{to make the trip}} back to the colony provided they left the remaining arms and stores of ammunition to the Cherokee led by Ostenaco. Its garrison marched out of the fort on August 9 with a Cherokee escort. The Indians entered the fort and found 10 bags of powder and ball buried and the cannon and small arms thrown in the river to keep them from the Cherokee. The Indians, angered by the broken agreement, went after the garrison. The next morning the escort had <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> and the garrison was attacked in the woods by perhaps 700 Indians. Some 22 soldiers, equal to the number of Cherokee chief hostages killed at Fort Prince George, and 3 civilians were killed and 120 taken prisoners. Panic and consternation reigned in Charleston at the news. A truce of six months was agreed to during which peace attempts failed.|$|E
25|$|The main beaches on the Dieppe {{waterfront}} {{are almost}} a mile long. Following strafing of the defenses by aircraft, {{and a short}} bombardment by destroyers, aircraft laid a blanket of smoke on Dieppe Harbour. LCSs with heavy machine-guns and smoke mortars engaged targets ashore and provided a smoke-screen over the eastern headlands. The LCSs continued to engage targets all morning, but also suffered extensively from the defenders' fire. The first wave of LCAs touched down between 05:20 and 05:23. They carried The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry to Red Beach and The Essex Scottish Regiment to White Beach. Once the infantry left the armour-plated protection of the LCAs {{they were in a}} killing field. None of the preparatory fire had diminished the defense, and the new tank landing craft, designed to deliver tanks to accompany the assault infantry, were ten minutes late. As the smoke <b>drifted</b> <b>off,</b> the Canadians found themselves savagely pinned down. Their landing craft, LCAs and LCM(Mk. I)s, had orders to collect off the coast in the boat pool - an area covered in smoke. Adding to the tragedy, the floating reserve, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, were sent to reinforce the Essex Scottish, who had been incorrectly reported as making good progress. The Fusiliers were transported in LCP(L) Eureka boats made of seven-plywood; they provided no protection from bullets or shrapnel. The Fusiliers received fire all the way in to the beach, and only 125 of them made it back to England. On White Beach, LCAs landed 369 men of A Commando Royal Marines in withering fire - none got more than a few yards ashore.|$|E

25|$|On Green {{beach at}} the same time that No.4 Commando had landed, the South Saskatchewan Regiment's 1st Battalion was headed towards Pourville. They beached at 04:52 without having been detected. The {{battalion}} managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could open fire. However, on the way in, some of the landing craft had <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> course and most of the battalion found themselves west of the River Scie rather than east of it. Because they had been landed in the wrong place, the battalion, whose objective was the hills east of the village, had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before the Saskatchewans managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had positioned machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped their advance. With the battalion's dead and wounded piling up on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, the commanding officer, attempted to give the attack impetus by repeatedly and openly crossing the bridge, in order to demonstrate that it was feasible to do so. However, despite the assault resuming, the South Saskatchewans and the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, who had landed beside them, were unable to reach their target. While the Camerons did manage to penetrate further inland than any other troops that day, they were also soon forced back as German reinforcements rushed to the scene. Both battalions suffered more losses as they withdrew; only 341 men were able to reach the landing craft and embark, and the rest were left to surrender. For his part in the battle, Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

Land interaction and drier air weakened the eye, and on May9 the cyclone weakened to tropical storm status. The next day Manou weakened to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued its last advisory. MFR continued tracking the storm until it dissipated on May13.|$|E
500|$|Markley {{continued}} his playboy lifestyle at a beach house he purchased in Los Angeles. He produced Jim Stallings' (J. J. Light) European hit [...] "Heya" [...] and the {{album of the}} same name before vanishing from the music business. According to various accounts by band members and Fowley, in 1972 Markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low-profile after an incident involving two underage girls. Markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates; however, Fowley recollected a conversation with Stallings in 1992: [...] "He [...] told me that Bob had been sitting in this rowing boat on a lake near Las Vegas - he was like a recluse. It got loose from its moorings and he <b>drifted</b> <b>off</b> alone for a day and a half. He was already pretty messed up, but he got very badly dehydrated. When they eventually found him he was taken to some hospital and placed on a life-support system, unable to speak or think". Markley died on September 9, 2003 in a hospital in Gardena, California; he was 68.|$|E
