40|$|Objective: To reduce {{operator}} {{exposure to noise}} from vibrating screens at coal preparation plants. Background: Hearing loss {{is one of the}} most common occupational illnesses in the United States. In the U. S. mining industry, hearing loss is 2. 5 to 3 times greater than what is expected for the average population that is not exposed to occupational noise. Furthermore, studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) showed that by age 50, 90 % of coal miners have a hearing impairment versus only 10 % of the population that is not exposed to occupational noise. A NIOSH cross-sectional survey of coal preparation plants showed that 43. 5 % of employees were overexposed to noise. The study also found that vibrating screens were one of the top five loudest types of equipment at these plants - as well as the most numerous - making them a key noise source to address. Approach: A team of NIOSH researchers, in partnership with Conn-Weld Industries, Inc., conducted noise source identification studies on a Conn-Weld G-Master 1000 dewatering vibrating screen. They determined that, above 1 kHz, the mechanism housings are the main noise sources. A common technique to control noise from a source to a receiver - in this case, the operator's ear - is to block the noise from the source with an acoustic enclosure. NIOSH has developed such an enclosure to surround the mechanism housings, thereby reducing the noise that reaches the operator's ear. The enclosure is a modular design with components that can be hand-carried and installed on any Conn-Weld G-Master 1000 vibrating screen, including retrofits. This design can also be modified to adapt to other sizes or types of vibrating screens. It consists of a steel frame (Figure 1), which provides a stiff structure, and panels that enclose the noise source. The panels act as a barrier to block the noise from reaching the operator. A layer of acoustic foam lining the panels on the inside of the enclosure absorb a portion of the noise. In addition, the frame-and-panel design allows easy access to service ports on the mechanism housings or removal of a mechanism altogether, without disassembling the entire enclosure (Figures 2 - 3). Results: Four different panel materials were tested with the steel <b>enclosure</b> <b>frame.</b> The best results were achieved with an enclosure made with damped steel panels. Laboratory testing in the NIOSH hemi-anechoic chamber showed that the enclosure with damped steel panels reduces the sound power transmitted by the vibrating screen by up to 2 dB(A), per ISO 3744. In the frequency range for which the enclosure was designed (1. 0 - 10 kHz), the damped steel panels reduce levels by 4 dB (Figure 4) compared to the baseline configuration with constrained layer damping (CLD) treatments on the mechanism housings.

5|$|Observed {{by humans}} {{since the dawn}} of history, the {{behaviour}} of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881. Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies. Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass <b>framed</b> <b>enclosures.</b> Individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of colours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the sanctuary was designed by Fleay, who used a compass to ensure that each cage received breezes and the morning sun. Fleay designed the cages and specified the dimensions and the [...] "furniture". The cages were always painted [...] "Lawn Green" [...] with [...] "Mail Red" [...] roofs. The timber was not undercoated or chemically treated. Chickenwire covered the platypus tank and raptors' cages to keep out carpet snakes. The sanctuary opened its doors to its first visitors on Easter Sunday 1952. Steadily new cages were built by David Fleay and his volunteers. The wedge-tailed eagles had a large timber <b>enclosure</b> with a <b>frame</b> inside {{in which they could}} build a nest. The cages had an inner shell of wire netting to guard against cyclonic blows and carpet pythons.|$|R
40|$|External wall <b>enclosure</b> of <b>frame</b> {{buildings}} {{is usually}} {{carried out in}} the form of sandwich laying, with protectively-decorative brick facing and inside layer made of aerocrete or foam concrete blocks, or slot-hole ceramic stones which fill he space between monolithic floor slabs and columns or cross-section ferro-concrete walls. The face layer of external walls is carried out of high-quality brick, and sometimes from plastered mineral wool heater. Layered walls with face brick layer in CIS countries have received wide application since the middle of 90 th years of last century in connection with toughening of standard requirements for thermal resistance. Thus, without possessing corresponding standard base and the building experience, many decisions have been borrowed abroad, and first of all from the European countries where layered walls have started to take root widely for 20 - 30 years earlier. Operation of layered walls, especially in many-storeyed frame-monolithic housing construction, already in the first 3 - 5 years has revealed a number of serious lacks which in many cases led to an emergency condition of walling. In the paper the most typical faults of cladding of frame buildings, defects of masonry works at protectively-decorative brick face veneer erected in technology of sandwich laying, are given. The analysis of the reasons of faults origin is made, offers on raise of reliability of facing layer are given...|$|R

A large number of simulations are performed, allowing for an accurate estimate of the critical values of the main system parameter, the Rayleigh number Ra, at which bifurcations occur. A single value of the geometric aspect ratio A of the system is considered, for which transition is found to be characterized by an imperfect period-doubling cascade, an uncommon behaviour in thermofluid systems. Peculiarities of the route to chaos are highlighted, such as the existence of a window of quasiperiodic flow, and the detection of high-order period orbits...|$|R
40|$|This {{symposium}} {{brings together}} perspectives from geography, philosophy, alternative education and {{sport and exercise}} science to consider {{a sense of place}} and agency in education beyond the classroom. Drawing on embodied perspectives to decenter the assumptions of the classroom as <b>enclosure</b> which <b>frame</b> much educational research (Lundie 2015). In place of the enclosure as locus of methodology, the challenges of non-formal and expansive educational settings refocus educational enquiry on the intrinsic, ipsative and intersubjective dimensions of the learner in their interactions with place, peers and nature. Introducing the research programme for Space, Place and Agency in Childhood and Education at the University of St Mark and St John, Plymouth, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Faculty of Education and Social Science and the Faculty of Sport and Health Science, the symposium will feature speakers who cross boundaries and challenge traditional dichotomies between formal, informal and non-formal education. The symposium will focus on methodological innovations which support educational research in contexts beyond the classroom, drawing upon current research projects in European youth work, disability sport education and alternative early years provision. Paper 1 – Mark Leather: More than 'activities': using a sense of place in outdoor education Paper 2 – David Lundie: More than 'methods': ipsative and interpersonal perspectives on decentering the classroom Paper 3 – Kass Gibson: More than 'murder': ethics and hunting in New Zealand reconsidered Paper 4 – Julie Evans: More than 'play': space, agency and the classroom in early years Dr Leather’s paper presents empirical evidence from an action research project to demonstrate how a combination of formal and informal pedagogy can lead to a sociocultural and historical understanding of place and enrich the learning experience when teaching sailing. Adopting a Deweyan pedagogy of place that holistically integrated research, theory and practice (Ord & Leather 2011), students completed focus group interviews, photo elicitation and written reflections, evidencing a meaningful relationship between sociocultural history of place and the activity itself. Drawing on the sport for development movement, which engages health and civic education, informal recreation and environmental education, Kass Gibson’s paper draws on mixed method qualitative research into sport (Gibson 2012) to explore students’ relationships to the culture of hunting (Gibson 2014). Bringing together indigenous ontologies with the methodological personalism refined by colleagues in this research group (Beacom & Golder 2015), this paper explores the normative, pedagogical and sustainability implications of hunting and its place in outdoor education. Exploring the relation between the ‘offered’ curriculum and the ‘received’ curriculum in early years (Rogers & Evans 2007), Dr Evans’ paper reintroduces the concept of space and enclosure as ethnographic actor in context (Lundie 2015). Drawing on myriad autoethnographic representational strategies of the young people in the setting (Pahl 1999), Evans’ ethnography seeks to enable children’s voices to represent the physical limitations they experience. This paper reframes the Reception classroom as a ‘poverty of space’, acting upon the development and socialisation of young children...|$|R
