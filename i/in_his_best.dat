5|$|The opening story arc of Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which premiered in September 2011, is set {{prior to}} Ultimate Fallout #4, and details how Miles {{received}} his superhuman abilities. After Oscorp scientist Dr. Conrad Markus uses Parker's blood {{to recreate the}} formula that created Spider-Man, the Prowler (Aaron Davis) steals the formula, and in the process, one of the spiders created by Markus crawls into the Prowler's duffel bag. Days later, the Prowler's nephew, grade-schooler Miles Morales, is bitten by the spider {{during a visit to}} Aaron's apartment. Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter Parker has, but does not tell his parents, Jefferson and Rio, due to his father's distrust of superheroes, confiding only <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> friend, Ganke Lee.|$|E
5|$|Don Vito {{brought the}} {{organization}} to its highest perfection without undue recourse to violence. The Mafia leader who scatters corpses all over the island {{in order to achieve}} his goal is considered as inept as the statesman who has to wage aggressive wars. Don Vito ruled and inspired fear mainly by the use of his great qualities and natural ascendancy. His awe-inspiring appearance helped him. … His manners were princely, his demeanour humble but majestic. He was loved by all. Being very generous by nature, he never refused a request for aid and dispensed millions in loans, gifts and general philanthropy. He would personally go {{out of his way to}} redress a wrong. When he started a journey, every major, dressed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> clothes, awaited him at the entrance of his village, kissed his hands, and paid homage, as if he were a king. And he was a king of sorts: under his reign peace and order were observed, the Mafia peace, of course, which was not what the official law of the Kingdom of Italy would have imposed, but people did not stop to draw too fine a distinction.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Hall {{was among}} the best {{on the ground in}} an interstate match between the VFL and the SANFL, {{finished}} in third in the Devils' best and fairest count, and was runner up in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award. The 2006 season saw Hall named best on ground in his 100th VFL match, a 24-point win over Frankston. He was again runner up in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and also finished as runner up in the team's best and fairest count. In 2007 journalist Matt Burgan, writing for the AFL website, named Hall <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> 22 players currently from Tasmania, with Hall and Cameron Thurley the only two players who were not listed with an AFL club at the time of selection. Hall was named in the Devils' leadership group {{at the beginning of the}} 2007 season. He represented Tasmania in an interstate match against Queensland and was awarded the Lefroy Medal as best on ground for the Tasmanians. Hall finished the year winning his first Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and coming third in the best and fairest.|$|E

5|$|Miler {{started his}} {{campaign}} for Test selection when the servicemen arrived in Perth and played their first match against Western Australia. Miller put <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> batting performance {{of the season with}} an 80 in a drawn match, before being rested in the match against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, which again ended in a draw. Miller finally returned to his home town on 2 January 1946 and was reunited with family and friends before taking on Victoria. Miller top-scored in both innings with 37 and 59 as the military men fell to an innings defeat, troubled by the off spin of Ian Johnson. Miller and the servicemen had another difficult time against New South Wales, as their opponents made 7/551 and Miller went wicketless. Miller faced his biggest challenge in Australian conditions in his quest for Test selection when he went out to bat. The Australian selectors had not been in England for the Victory Tests to witness his ability and Miller had not played to his potential on Australian soil. Local Australian opinion was that because the Services had played poorly in Australia, their achievements in England must have been against poor opposition.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher clinched his ninth pole position of the season, his second at the circuit, with a time of 1:37.397. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who recorded a lap time 0.463 seconds slower than the pole sitter. Coulthard qualified third and suffered a worrying moment when a fire on his McLaren caused petrol to seep into his eye and admitted the incident could have escalated if not dealt with quickly. Barrichello, who was still suffering from flu, qualified fourth having been pushed from second position in the closing seconds of the session. Wurz qualified fifth, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> qualifying performance of the season. Villeneuve secured the sixth fastest time despite having to walk to the pit lane when his BAR's engine was turned off on his final run. Irvine made changes to his set-up and secured seventh although he believed he could have been quicker as he backed off through turn 15. Ralf Schumacher lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap and managed eighth. Trulli and Frentzen rounded out the top ten qualifying positions for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second and lost time with a braking issue. Herbert, in his final Formula One race, qualified twelfth and struggled with understeer following an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella, de la Rosa and Verstappen. Jenson Button qualified 16th and encountered traffic during the session which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. The Sauber, Prost and Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 17 to 22.|$|E

25|$|On the tour, {{his modest}} returns {{in the state}} matches {{and the success of}} the Test opening bowlers Peter Pollock and Joe Partridge with medium-pace support from Trevor Goddard and Eddie Barlow kept him out of the Test side until the Third Test.

25|$|Brunswick sent 5,723 {{troops to}} North America, of whom 3,015 {{did not return}} home {{in the autumn of}} 1783. Some losses were to death or desertion, but many Brunswickers became {{familiar}} with America during their time with the Convention Army, and when the war ended, they were granted permission to stay by both Congress and their officers. Many had taken the opportunity to desert as the Convention Army was twice marched through Pennsylvania German settlements in eastern Pennsylvania. As the Duke of Brunswick received compensation from the British for every one of his soldiers killed in America, it was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> interest to report the deserters as dead, whenever possible. The Duke even offered six months' pay to soldiers who remained or returned to America.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being the}} short course World Champion, Seto was still {{coming into the}} 2013 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain {{relatively}} unknown, mostly due to Japanese medley star Kosuke Hagino.

25|$|Blair was a fast bowler who {{was never}} quite able to carry his {{enormous}} success for Wellington in the Plunket Shield over into the Test arena. In 59 matches for Wellington from 1951–52 to 1964–65 he took 330 wickets {{at an average of}} 15.16. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> season, he took 46 wickets in the five matches of 1956–57 at an average of 9.47, twice taking nine wickets in an innings. The next season, he took 34 at 11.20, then in a trial match {{at the end of the}} season he took five wickets in each innings for North Island against South Island. But in the series that followed a few months later in England, he took only three wickets in three Tests, at an average of 70. He achieved his best Test match figures, 7 for 142, in what turned out to be his last Test, against South Africa at Auckland in 1963–64.|$|E
25|$|Born in Pitsmoor, Sheffield, Ulyett {{joined the}} local Pitsmoor club {{at the age}} of sixteen and, from 1871 to 1873, played as a {{professional}} in Bradford. In 1873, he made his Yorkshire debut, at Bramall Lane against Sussex, and remained a valued member of the team for the next twenty years, passing 1,000 runs in ten seasons and fifty wickets in three. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> batting year of 1883 Ulyett achieved the remarkable feat of scoring 1,562 runs – eleven runs from being the leading run scorer – without a single century. Not until Charles Harris in 1935 did any batsman score more runs without a century, and only David Green in 1965 – a somewhat similar style of hard hitting opener – has since come remotely so close to being the leading run scorer of a season without scoring a century. He took his career-best figures of seven for thirty against Surrey in 1878 and, in 1887, made his highest score, 199 not out against Derbyshire.|$|E
25|$|Next up was an away {{series against}} the West Indies, early in 1968. D'Oliveira didn't turn <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> showing in the five matches, scoring only 137 runs {{at an average of}} 27.4. He did a lot of bowling, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, {{it was time for a}} five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D'Oliveira's top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the {{subsequent}} three Tests. He was recalled by the selectors for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968–69 Test series in South Africa. He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country.|$|E
