5|$|Foster {{looked for}} a {{director}} and Peter Bogdanovich came to his attention. Bogdanovich's agent, Jeff Berg, set up a special screening of his client's soon-to-be released The Last Picture Show (1971) for Foster with McQueen in attendance. They loved it and met with the director and a deal was made. However, Warner Bros. approached Bogdanovich with an offer to direct What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand, with the stipulation {{that he had to}} start right away. The director wanted to do both, and the studio refused. When McQueen found out, he became upset and told Bogdanovich {{that he was going to}} <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> else to direct The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|During a brief {{concert at}} the Tool and Die club in San Francisco, Dead Kennedys {{frontman}} and Alternative Tentacles overseer Jello Biafra witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan. Biafra invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; if they could <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to lend them studio time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss). However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position {{was taken over by}} Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated. The last of these, King Coffey (born Jeffrey Coffey), is still with the band to this day.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown {{into a pair of}} steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Touch {{sequences}} {{fall into}} two different types, repetitive and strategic. Repetitive is when one person touches and the other person reciprocates.

Returning guest stars include Mathew Horne and Niky Wardley and with Ami Metcalf as Alice.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the evacuation, the American Embassy had distributed a 15-page booklet called SAFE, short for [...] "Standard Instruction and Advice to Civilians in an Emergency." [...] The booklet included a map of Saigon pinpointing [...] "assembly areas where a helicopter will pick you up." [...] There was an insert page which read: [...] "Note evacuational signal. Do not disclose to other personnel. When the evacuation is ordered, the code will be read out on Armed Forces Radio. The code is: The temperature in Saigon is 105 degrees and rising. This {{will be followed by}} the playing of I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas." [...] Frank Snepp later recalled the arrival of helicopters at the Embassy while the song was playing over the radio as a [...] "bizarre Kafkaesque time".

500|$|Romano {{described}} Kim as a [...] "very ambitious, very skilled, very smart" [...] character, {{and attempted}} to make her {{as much of a}} role model as possible. The actress also described the character as [...] "a really confident, sweet girl who everybody loves. And she is a heroine who little girls look up to. ... She is a typical role model, perfect in every way. How could you not like Kim?" [...] Romano initially doubted that the show would be successful, but eventually admitted that [...] "the animation was great and the writing was amazing. It's done so that kids and adults can enjoy it; families can share an amazing experience together." [...] Additionally, Romano's character greatly influenced her own career, and considers Kim to be a positive role model for young girls. Romano identified the season one episode [...] "Mind Games" [...] in which Kim and Ron switch bodies as her favorite. By the end of the series, Romano was 21 years old and attending Columbia University for political science. Kim's final line in the series is [...] "uuhhh...huh?", which Romano recorded tearfully due to the series ending. Writing for 7M Pictures, Kevin Carr considered the fact that Kim is only a voice-acted role beneficial to the series because [...] "they could always <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> else to mimic her original voice" [...] should Romano depart, unlike Lizzie McGuires Hilary Duff.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can any of you imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. It {{was just a matter of}} time before he made it big." ...|$|E

On the filming, Jagger said in Rolling Stone: [...] " [...] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, to <b>get</b> <b>someone</b> as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.'
