5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu. Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> intended to be read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the document is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, a {{detailed}} {{list of all}} passengers and crew was published by J.H. Lewis, Printer & Publisher, albeit with several errors and spelling mistakes. That <b>document</b> <b>was</b> used as {{the main source of}} the following survivors' table.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the {{document}} until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is believed she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the document. It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E

5|$|The Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu (State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, 6 Urk 11) is the dower {{document}} for the Byzantine princess Theophanu. Written in Latin, the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the Early Middle Ages after the marriage of Theophanu to Emperor Otto II in 972, which made her the Holy Roman Empress. The <b>document</b> <b>was</b> prepared by Otto II and exemplifies an instance of political and cultural contact between the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. It serves {{as an example of}} Ottonian Renaissance art, and the calligraphy of the manuscript has led it to be {{regarded as one of the}} most beautiful diplomatic documents of the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the negotiations, Adams {{successfully}} {{demanded that}} {{the right of the}} United States to the fisheries along the Atlantic coast be recognized. The American negotiators were able to secure a favorable treaty securing most lands east of the Mississippi, and the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> signed on September 3, 1783.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Alabama Territory {{was formed}} from part of Mississippi Territory. When {{the state of}} Alabama was created from part of the Tombigbee District in 1819, Toulmin was chosen to {{represent}} Baldwin County at the state's constitutional convention in July 1819. He served on the Committee of Fifteen that drafted the first Constitution of Alabama. The <b>document</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the Kentucky Constitution of 1800, which contained more democratic provisions {{than some of the}} older state constitutions.|$|E

5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, kings and bishops, and purple parchment was rarely used for writing.

40|$|Questioned <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> <b>documents</b> whose {{authenticity}} <b>is</b> disputed. <b>Documents</b> <b>are</b> {{destroyed by}} fires {{and other means}} to conceal criminal activities. Charred or burnt <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> a type of questioned <b>document</b> that <b>are</b> likely to contain vital information. These <b>documents</b> <b>are</b> mainly linked to ransoms, forgery, fraud, suicide and other white collar offences. This study aimed to evaluate {{the ability of a}} Video Spectral Comparator (VSC- 6000) for the enhancement of writings on charred documents and to determine the effectiveness of flood light and white spot beam in VSC on charred <b>documents.</b> A passage <b>was</b> written by different types of writing instruments on different types of writing paper available in Malaysia. Then the handwritten <b>documents</b> <b>were</b> burned until the writings became invisible. The charred <b>documents</b> <b>were</b> viewed under flood light and the white beam by adjusting the wavelengths. Results showed that the writings on the charred document exhibited appreciable enhancement suitable for forensic investigation. The writings were comparatively more visible under the white spot beam than the flood light beam. These findings were recorded through photography. The present study provides a promising method and an effective alternative way to enhance writings on charred documents...|$|R
5|$|The Constitution of the State of New Jersey is {{the basic}} {{governing}} document of the State of New Jersey. In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for East Jersey, West Jersey and united New Jersey {{while they were still}} colonies, the state has been governed by three constitutions. The first was issued on July 2, 1776, shortly before New Jersey ratified the United States Declaration of Independence and the second was issued in 1844. The current <b>document</b> <b>was</b> issued in 1947 and has been amended several times.|$|E
5|$|The Convention {{had given}} the Committee {{extraordinary}} authority to provide for state security ever since {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary War in early 1793. Committee members were originally intended to serve for periods of only thirty days before replacements were elected, so they needed to work quickly. Saint-Just took charge of the issue and led the development of the French Constitution of 1793. Before the end of his first term, the new <b>document</b> <b>was</b> completed, submitted to the Convention, and ratified as law on 24 June 1793.|$|E
5|$|The <b>document</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} to the British Museum in 1924 by Walter Rothschild; today it is held in the British Library, which separated from the British Museum in 1973, as Additional Manuscripts number 41178. From October 1987 to May 1988 it was lent outside the UK for display in Israel's Knesset. The Israeli government are currently in negotiations to arrange a second loan in 2018, with plans to display the document at Independence Hall in Tel Aviv.|$|E

5|$|The <b>document</b> <b>was</b> then {{deposited}} in the temple that housed the Treasury (the aerarium). While a senatus auctoritas (vetoed Senate motion) had no legal value, it did serve to show {{the opinion of the}} Senate. If a senatus consultum conflicted with a law (lex) that was passed by a Roman Assembly, the law overrode the senatus consultum, because the senatus consultum had its authority based in precedent, and not in law. A senatus consultum, however, could serve to interpret a law.|$|E
5|$|These {{instructions}} {{stated that}} {{the objectives of the}} Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the <b>document</b> <b>was</b> a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an {{additional}} <b>document</b> <b>was</b> granted, the Articuli super Cartas (The Articles upon the Charters).

Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the sheriff of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Document</b> mosaicing <b>is</b> {{a process}} that {{stitches}} multiple, overlapping [...] images of a document together {{in order to produce}} one large, high resolution composite. The <b>document</b> <b>is</b> slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of the <b>document</b> <b>are</b> snapshotted by the camera’s field of view. As the document slid under the camera, all motion of the <b>document</b> <b>is</b> coarsely tracked by the vision system. The <b>document</b> <b>is</b> periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50%. The system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document.|$|R
