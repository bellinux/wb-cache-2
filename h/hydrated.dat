We test this hypothesis by stochastically simulating <b>hydrate</b> growth in pore space of a simple cubic packing of mono-sized spherical sediment grains, and assume three extreme nucleation preferences {{in the absence of}} heat or mass transport limitations, and without interfacial surface tension: (1) Homogeneous nucleation produces isolated nuclei and a highly porous <b>hydrate</b> mass; (2) Heteroge-neous nucleation results in combined surface coating and frame-building <b>hydrate</b> structures; and (3) Preferential heterogeneous nucleation on pre-existing <b>hydrate</b> surfaces leads to <b>hydrate</b> growth into the pore space. Spatial distribution of <b>hydrate</b> is analyzed to investigate the surface coating density, grain connectivity and mass density of <b>hydrate</b> cluster. Results show that surface coating density is predominant for heterogeneous nucleation and grain connectivity by <b>hydrates</b> is lower than the <b>hydrate</b> volume fraction in all cases.

Research on methane <b>hydrate</b> on pore-level may contribute to a greater understanding of the fundamentals and characteristics of <b>hydrate</b> formation and production schemes. This thesis presents a series of experiments conducted in a two-dimensional synthetic micromodel. The main objective of the experiments was to determine and interpret methane <b>hydrate</b> characteristics on pore-level using microscopy, during <b>hydrate</b> formation and dissociation with different water solutions. In the experiments, deionized water and saline water of 2. 0, 3. 5 and 5. 0 wt% sodium chloride (NaCl) were used. The saturation changes for water, gas and <b>hydrate</b> were estimated to determine water and gas behavior in each experiment. There were conducted 16 successful <b>hydrate</b> formations, where ten were primary formations and six were secondary formations. During primary <b>hydrate</b> formation, the temperature and pressure values were fixed, and <b>hydrate</b> growth was induced by forcing agitation on water and gas in the micromodel. The temperature was in the range 1. 0 - 4. 1 °C, and the pressure was in the range 80. 0 - 110. 0 bar. During secondary <b>hydrate</b> formation, the temperature was approximately 4. 0 °C, and the pressure was increased to above the <b>hydrate</b> stability line. Primary <b>hydrate</b> formation was faster and more homogeneous than secondary <b>hydrate</b> formation, independent of water salinity. <b>Hydrate</b> growth occurred mainly within the gas, but was one time observed to occur in the water phase. Initial <b>hydrate</b> growth occurred on the water-gas interface at the pore walls and continued to grow in the gas towards the pore center. Salt was the limiting factor when <b>hydrate</b> was being formed with saline water of 3. 5 wt% NaCl and higher, and in these experiments <b>hydrate</b> required greater driving forces to form. The <b>hydrate</b> formation rate was observed to decrease with increasing salinity. There were performed 13 controlled <b>hydrate</b> dissociations by either pressure reduction or thermal stimulation. The patterns of <b>hydrate</b> dissociation by depressurization were the opposite of the patterns of <b>hydrate</b> dissociation by thermal stimulation. When <b>hydrate</b> was dissociated by depressurization, <b>hydrate</b> generally dissociated {{from the center of the}} pores towards the water-gas interface at the pore walls. Further dissociation was favored when the <b>hydrate</b> was in direct contact with free gas bubbles. When <b>hydrate</b> was dissociated by thermal stimulation, <b>hydrate</b> generally dissociated from the water-gas interface at the pore walls towards the center of the pores. The experiments showed that with high connectivity between the <b>hydrates,</b> <b>hydrate</b> dissociated more uniformly. The saturation profiles gained from images showed that dissociation by thermal stimulation was more uniform than dissociation by pressure reduction. <b>Hydrate</b> was dissociated by reducing the pressure in increments of 0. 7 bar or by increasing the temperature in increments of 0. 1 °C. The stepwise pressure and temperature technique showed that <b>hydrate</b> dissociated over a range of pressure and temperature steps. The required number of pressure and temperature steps from initial <b>hydrate</b> dissociation to complete <b>hydrate</b> dissociation, increased with increased salinity. This is believed to be due to a continuous decrease in salinity in the local water phases when pure water was liberated from the dissociating <b>hydrate</b> structure. The <b>hydrate</b> phase became more stable towards the low-saline water phases, and as a consequence of pore water freshening, the <b>hydrate</b> phase required lower pressures and higher temperatures to dissociate. Local <b>hydrate</b> saturations within the gas and isolated <b>hydrate</b> saturations in the pore space were observed to remain, while the surrounding <b>hydrate</b> dissociated. These local <b>hydrate</b> saturations seemed to become stable toward local low-saline water, and are believed to be the main reason why dissociation was prolonged for saline water...|$|R

X-ray computed tomography (CT) was used to monitor saturation changes in water, gas, and <b>hydrate</b> during <b>hydrate</b> formation, water flow, and <b>hydrate</b> dissociation. The sand column was packed in several segments having vertical and horizontal layers with two distinct grain-size sands. The CT images showed that as <b>hydrate</b> formed, the water and <b>hydrate</b> saturations were dynamically redistributed by variations in capillary strength of the medium (the tendency for a material to imbibe water), which changed with the presence and saturation of <b>hydrate.</b> Water preferentially flowed through fine sand near higher hydrate-saturation regions where the capillary strength was elevated relative to the lower <b>hydrate</b> saturation regions. <b>Hydrate</b> dissociation initiated by depressurization varied with different grain sizes and <b>hydrate</b> saturations...|$|R
40|$|The methane (CH 4) -carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{swapping}} {{phenomenon in}} naturally occurring gas <b>hydrates</b> {{is regarded as}} an attractive method of CO 2 sequestration and CH 4 recovery. In this study, a high pressure microdifferential scanning calorimeter (HP μ-DSC) was used to monitor and quantify the CH 4 -CO 2 replacement in the gas <b>hydrate</b> structure. The HP μ-DSC provided reliable measurements of the <b>hydrate</b> dissociation equilibrium and <b>hydrate</b> heat of dissociation for the pure and mixed gas <b>hydrates.</b> The <b>hydrate</b> dissociation equilibrium data obtained from the endothermic thermograms of the replaced gas <b>hydrates</b> indicate that at least 60 % of CH 4 is recoverable after reaction with CO 2, {{which is consistent with}} the result obtained via direct dissociation of the replaced gas <b>hydrates.</b> The heat of dissociation values of the CH 4 + CO 2 <b>hydrates</b> were between that of the pure CH 4 <b>hydrate</b> and that of the pure CO 2 <b>hydrate,</b> and the values increased as the CO 2 compositions in the <b>hydrate</b> phase increased. By monitoring the heat flows from the HP μ-DSC, {{it was found that the}} noticeable dissociation or formation of a gas <b>hydrate</b> was not detected during the CH 4 -CO 2 replacement process, which indicates that a substantial portion of CH 4 <b>hydrate</b> does not dissociate into liquid water or ice and then forms the CH 4 + CO 2 <b>hydrate.</b> This study provides the first experimental evidence using a DSC to reveal that the conversion of the CH 4 <b>hydrate</b> to the CH 4 + CO 2 <b>hydrate</b> occurs without significant <b>hydrate</b> dissociation. close 2...|$|R
