40|$|Abstract The nuclear DNA {{content of}} 50 ovarian tumors {{initially}} diagnosed as <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> {{was measured by}} flow cytometry using paraffin-embedded archival material. The follow-up period of the patients ranged from 4 months to 19 years. Thirty-eight tumors were diploid or near-diploid, while 5 were aneuploid. DNA profiles of 7 tumors could not be evaluated. All 50 tumors were immunohistochemically tested for expression of intermediate filament proteins vimentin and cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. The cells of all but 3 tumors expressed vimentin. These 3 vimentin-negative tumors were positive for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. They were highly aneuploid and though originally diagnosed as <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors,</b> most likely represent undifferentiated carcinomas. Hence, only 2 typical <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> were aneuploid. In addition, frozen tissue samples from 9 of 10 <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> showed a DNA diploid content. Our results indicate that <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> tend to be diploid or have only minor ploidy abnormalities which {{is in line with}} their relatively benign character.

We found high ZP 3 expression in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> of the transgenic mice, in human surface ovarian cancer and <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> lines, and in human <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> and their metastases. Early preventive immunization (between 2 and 5. 5 mo of age) of transgenic mice with recombinant human (rh) ZP 3 prevented ovarian tumorigenesis, and delayed therapeutic immunization (between 4. 5 and 7 mo) reduced weights of existing tumors by 86 and 75 %, respectively (P< 0. 001), compared to vehicle-treated control mice. No objective side effects of the immunizations were observed.

40|$|Granulosa cell {{tumors of the}} ovary {{are rare}} hormonally active {{neoplasms}} characterized by endocrine manifestations, an indolent course, and late relapse. These tumors have preponderance for local spread and extremely late recurrence and high survival rates. Late recurrence can be extensive with initial, clinically undetectable, microscopic <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumor</b> of the ovary. Only {{a small percentage of}} such tumors metastasize. We report a case of a 71 -year-old woman with extensive recurrent <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumor</b> of the ovary 21 years after undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for atypical endometrial hyperplasia. 20 years after the initial treatment, she was well without evidence of the disease. 21 years after the initial treatment, abdominal pain was abrupt followed by unstable vital signs. Under the impression of internal bleeding, immediate laparotomy was performed. Macroscopic examination revealed predominantly cystic mass filled with clotted blood and separated by solid tissue. Biopsy showed <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumor</b> of the ovary. A thorough staging surgery included lymph node sampling, partial omentectomy and excision of any suspicion lesions within the abdominal cavity. The final pathologic expertise confirmed malignant <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumor</b> of the ovary. At the pathohystological re-expertise of the first operation material, the diagnosis of the initial, microscopic <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumor</b> of the ovary was confirmed. By pathological analysis of the second operation material, the diagnosis of malignant <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumor</b> of the ovary was confirmed.

40|$|Despite the {{well-established}} tumor suppressive role of TGFβ proteins, {{depletion of}} key TGFβ signaling {{components in the}} mouse ovary does not induce a growth advantage. To define the role of TGFβ signaling in ovarian tumorigenesis, we created a mouse model expressing a constitutively active TGFβ receptor 1 (TGFBR 1) in ovarian somatic cells using conditional gain-of-function approach. Remarkably, these mice developed ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors with complete penetrance, leading to reproductive failure and mortality. The <b>tumors</b> expressed multiple <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> markers and caused elevated serum inhibin and estradiol levels, reminiscent of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors.</b> Consistent with the tumorigenic effect, overactivation of TGFBR 1 altered tumor microenvironment by promoting angiogenesis and enhanced ovarian cell proliferation, accompanied by impaired cell differentiation and dysregulated expression of critical genes in ovarian function. By further exploiting complementary genetic models, we substantiated our finding that constitutively active TGFBR 1 is a potent oncogenic switch in mouse <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells.</b> In summary, overactivation of TGFBR 1 drives gonadal tumor development. The TGFBR 1 constitutively active mouse model phenocopies a number of morphological, hormonal, and molecular features of human <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> and are potentially valuable for preclinical testing of targeted therapies to treat <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors,</b> a class of poorly defined ovarian malignancies...|$|R

40|$|Proteins of intermediate-sized {{filaments}} and desmosomal plaques (desmoplakins) of four human ovarian <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> {{were studied}} by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy and by {{two-dimensional gel electrophoresis}} of microdissected tissue samples. All <b>tumor</b> <b>cells,</b> irrespective of their specific histologic patterns, contained both vimentin and desmoplakins. Cytokeratin-positive structures were absent or very scant in most tumor regions, but more common in trabecular, insular, macro- and microfollicular structures. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Cytokeratin Polypeptides 8 and 18. Desmin filaments, neurofilaments, and glial filaments were not detected. Immunoelectron microscopy showed vimentin filaments attached to desmoplakin-positive plaques of desmosomes. These results indicate that <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> contain true desmosomes, which are associated primarily with vimentin filaments. This phenomenon has so far only been described in meningiomas and in blastema cells of nephroblastomas. Our observations suggest that in most neoplastic <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> one epithelial feature, ie, cytokeratin expression, is greatly reduced, whereas desmosomes are still formed in appreciable frequencies. This unusual constellation of cytoskeletal elements in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> {{may be useful in}} the differential diagnosis from other ovarian neoplasms, especially undifferentiated carcinomas.

40|$|Objective: Ovarian <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> {{are rare}} {{malignancies}} {{with a relatively}} favorable prognosis.

Clinical and pathological characteristics were analyzed. Results: <b>Granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> ovarian <b>tumors</b> accounted for 4. 3 % of malignant ovarian neoplasms. Mean age was 47. 6 years. The most common presenting symptom was abnormal uterine bleeding (53. 7 %). Endometrial pathology was detected in 51. 2 % of patients preoperatively. Seventy percent of patients were diagnosed at stage I, and 53. 8 % of patients received adjuvant treatment. Mean follow-up was 67. 5 months. Overall 5 -year and 10 -year survival was 91 % and 86 %, respectively. Mean survival was 147. 1 months. Recurrence rate was 11. 2 %.

40|$|<b>Granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> (GCTs) of the ovary {{are rare}} sex cord stromal tumors. Although {{generally}} indolent, GCTs recur, {{and if not}} diagnosed and treated in early stages, survival rates are significantly shortened. Very little is known regarding GCT etiology. Because of the low incidence of cases and lack of standard diagnostics, mouse models for <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> are a valuable tool for studying GCTs and provide models for developing diagnostic and treatment strategies. We recently developed a novel mouse model of metastatic <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> <b>tumors</b> by genetic deletion of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling transcription factors (SMADs) in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> of the ovary. Histological and serum hormone analyses reveal that this mouse model most closely resembles the juvenile form of GCT. We further analyzed samples of human juvenile GCT (JGCT) for expression of anti-Müllerian hormone and activation of two major signaling pathways: TGFβ/SMAD 2 / 3 and wingless-related mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt) /β-catenin. The TGFβ family is active in mouse Smad 1 -Smad 5 double knockout tumors, and here we show that this pathway, but not the β-catenin pathway, is activated in samples of human JGCT.
