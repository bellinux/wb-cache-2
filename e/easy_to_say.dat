500|$|The name Aspirin {{was derived}} from the name of the {{chemical}} ASA—Acetylspirsäure in German. Spirsäure (salicylic acid) was named for the meadowsweet plant, Spirea ulmaria, from which it could be derived. Aspirin took a- for the acetylation, -spir- from Spirsäure, and added -in as a typical drug name ending to make it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In the final round of naming proposals that circulated through Bayer, it came down to Aspirin and Euspirin; Aspirin, they feared, might remind customers of aspiration, but Arthur Eichengrün argued that Eu- (meaning [...] "good") was inappropriate because it usually indicated an improvement over an earlier version of a similar drug. Since the substance itself was already known, Bayer intended to use the new name to establish their drug as something new; in January 1899 they settled on Aspirin.|$|E

Two smaller tumors in her uterus appeared to be benign and were not removed, to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a circulatory collapse on the fourth. On 14 April she fell unconscious, her temperature soared to , and she died. [...] "t is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what had occurred in Dr. Noether", one of the physicians wrote.

The same year she received two Grammy Award nominations—Best R Vocal Performance, Female and Best R Song for [...] "That's The Way Love Goes"—winning Best R Song. Several critics asserted she was unjustly {{overlooked in the}} Grammy's three major categories: Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune stated, [...] "Jackson again was denied a nomination for album of the year, even though 'janet' (Virgin) has remained in the Top 10 since its release last summer and has been critically acclaimed." [...] He adds that [...] "the oversight is doubly vexing, because —in a songwriting and production partnership with Jimmy Jam (aka James Harris III) and Terry Lewis—is not just a multiplatinum pop act but an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues over the last decade." [...] Kot laid blame to the oversight {{on the fact that}} many believed her to be a producer-dependent artist—an opinion he found to be in error. Similarly, producer Jimmy Jam stated: [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the two albums she did before she met us weren't successful and when she got with us she became successful... 'Control' was the first album she actually had input. I think that's just as significant as the fact we (Jam and Lewis) did the record." ...|$|E

500|$|Becky's storyline was {{acclaimed}} by most reviewers. Canning {{called it}} [...] "exceptional" [...] and [...] "the most emotional and satisfying of the episode". Poniewozik also praised it, and wrote, [...] "Artie and Becky's arc, {{on the other}} hand, really worked: it was sweet, uncomfortable and messy {{in the way that}} Glee does well." [...] He continued, [...] "it played out as it did not just because of Artie and Becky's condition but because of what they’re like as people". VanDerWerff said the story was [...] "handled with just the right level of pathos", and Slezak praised the writers for turning Becky [...] "into a fully realized character, while confronting head-on the dashed hopes and disappointments that can be a reality for a person with Down Syndrome". Sullivan wrote, [...] "The plot touched on a universal experience, unrequited love, from a very Glee perspective, the treatment of handicapped people as people. It ended on an appropriate down note and reaffirmed Sue and Becky's touching dynamic." [...] Bell liked Sue in this episode, as she was helping the plot, which in turn made her one-liners [...] "added treats rather than overdone cliches". The use of Helen Mirren to voice Becky's thoughts was highly praised. Poniewozik called it [...] "the kind of ridiculous-but-weirdly-logical move I love from Glee", and Lynch said it [...] "was one of the most charming treats this show has offered in a while". Sullivan wrote that [...] "both actresses turned in great performances that elevated the episode significantly". Not all reviewers agreed, however: Futterman called Mirren's vocal cameo [...] "bizarre", and although Kubicek thought Mirren was [...] "pretty darn hilarious", he said the [...] "Becky having a crush on Artie" [...] story arc made him feel [...] "as uncomfortable" [...] as the members of New Directions, and stated, [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that everyone should just treat her like they treat everyone else, but actually doing it is somewhat problematic." ...|$|E

[...] She also writes that when she complained about men and boys trying {{to take a look at}} her when she had to change during performances, this director chased them all away, but guarded her from them by observing her himself—though, she adds, he was really quite harmless.

2500|$|The {{explosion}} and resulting fire caused a full plant shutdown, reducing Western Australia's {{supply of energy}} by up to 35%.

[...] He estimated it would be at least three months until the plant was at least partially operational, when the less-damaged processing plants for John Brookes and East Spar are brought back online. The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational. [...] Approximately 80-90% of the island's gas is used by industrial customers, with small amounts provided to Synergy, the state's largest electricity retailer.|$|E
2500|$|The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn't be used, {{as there}} would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the {{designers}} used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said [...] "people ask {{me all the time}} [...] "Why didn't you just use 3D?" [...] Well, that's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> now we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, but back then you just didn't. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn't accurate on a lot of the cards. Nowadays I'd do it all in 3D." [...] Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time.|$|E

While {{it is now}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Nixon in Chinas influential score spawned a new interest in opera, {{it was not always}} met with such laudatory and generous reviews. At first release, Nixon in China received mostly mixed if not negative press feedback.

[...] James Wierzbicki for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch described Adams's score as the weak point in an otherwise well-staged performance, noting the music as [...] "inappropriately placid," [...] "cliché-ridden in the abstract" [...] and [...] " [...] heavily in Adams's worn-out Minimalist clichés." [...] With time, however, the opera has come to be revered as a great and influential production.

2500|$|With six laps {{remaining}} in the Bojangles' Southern 500, Busch cut a tire and subsequently caused a wreck that involved not only his car but also Ryan Newman. When leaving his pit (directly in front of Newman), Busch did a burnout and sped next to where crew members and NASCAR officials where standing. Following {{the conclusion of the}} race, while entering pit road, Busch bumped Newman's car. Busch explained the incident as an accident and unrelated, caused by taking his helmet off and not seeing where he was going. Andrew Rueger, Newman's gas man, went after Busch following the race.

Newman, giving an interview to Sports Illustrated, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Kurt blew a fuse again, I'm not sure why he did it and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. And nobody is. I think the chemical imbalance speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going. I'm pretty sure there were 42 other guys that are taking their helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me."

2500|$|According to a 1942 Japanese after action report, [...] "In {{order to}} keep strict radio silence, steps such as taking off fuses in the circuit, and holding and sealing the keys were taken. During the operation, the strict radio silence was {{perfectly}} carried out... The Kido Butai used the radio instruments {{for the first time}} on the day of the attack since they had been fixed at the base approximately twenty days before and proved they worked well. Paper flaps had been inserted between key points of some transmitters on board [...] to keep the strictest radio silence..." [...] Commander Genda, who helped plan the attack, stated, [...] "We kept absolute Radio Silence." [...] For two weeks before the attack, the ships of Kido Butai used flag and light signals (semaphore and blinker), which were sufficient since task force members remained in line of sight for the entire transit time. Kazuiyoshi Koichi, the Communications Officer for , dismantled vital transmitter parts and kept them in a box that he used as a pillow to prevent Hiei from making any radio transmissions until the attack commenced. Lieutenant Commander Chuichi Yoshoka, communications officer of the flagship, Akagi, said he did not recall any ship sending a radio message before the attack. Furthermore, Captain Kijiro, in charge of the Kido Butais three screening submarines, stated nothing of interest happened on the way to Hawaii, presumably including signals received from the supposedly radio silent Kido Butai. Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka stated, [...] "It is needless to say that the strictest radio silence was ordered to be maintained in every ship of the Task Force. To keep radio silence was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> but not so easy to maintain." [...] There is nothing in the Japanese logs or after action report indicating that radio silence was broken until after the attack.
