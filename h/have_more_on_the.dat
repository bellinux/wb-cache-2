5000|$|When the Federal League folded, Plank {{applied for}} free agency but was {{declared}} {{to belong to}} the St. Louis Browns for 1916. In September of that year, Plank predicted that {{he might be able to}} pitch ten more seasons, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it is that I <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball this season than I had in other years, but at any rate I feel that I have just as much stuff as I ever did." [...] However, by June 1917 newspapers reported that Plank's career was nearly over; he had struggled with arm problems and had left the team at one point due to a nervous breakdown. [...] He retired in October 1917, citing stomach difficulties brought on by the stress of baseball. His final game was a 1-0 11-inning complete game loss to Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators on August 6, 1917. Despite his announcement, the New York Yankees traded pitchers Urban Shocker and Nick Cullop, infielders Fritz Maisel and Joe Gedeon, catcher Les Nunamaker, and cash to the Browns for Plank and Del Pratt. Plank refused to report to New York, insisting he was retired.|$|E
