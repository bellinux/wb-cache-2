The uncertain status of the converted moors (in theory equal, but loocked down upon by the old Christians; named Christians but holding on to their cultural islamic principals) favoured the existance of protection payments through which the steps of represi??n were paralized. Through these, the old Christian society, particularly the elite, took part of the income of the converted moors; in exchange for this, we could say, that the minority not only managed to keep their cultural characteristics but also traces of their political organization...|$|R

Pero <b>la</b> monarqu??a <b>de</b> Felipe II considera que s??lo es poder si los s??bditos son leales a <b>la</b> fe cat??lica. <b>De</b> ah?? que se planifique, primero, <b>la</b> aculturaci??n <b>de</b> los moriscos y, luego, su expulsi??n. El problema que se plantea, tras su repartici??n por <b>la</b> Corona <b>de</b> Castilla, es el vac??o poblacional ???<b>la</b> corona trata <b>de</b> cubrirlo con <b>la</b> repoblaci??n??? y el descenso <b>de</b> <b>las</b> <b>rentas</b> reales, asunto especialmente grave. Pues todos sab??an que Granada en buena parte es territorio de frontera y que no podr?? autofinanciar su defensa, simplemente {{porque no}} ten??a recursos. One {{of the most}} important axioms of mercantilism is that population is power. But the monarchy of Philip II considers that it is only power when the subjects are loyal to the catholic faith. From that we can deduce the planning of the integration of the moorish population and their expulsion afterwards. After their distribution among the territories of the crown of Castile arosed the question of the population void ???the crown tries to cover it up throught the repopulation??? and the descent of the royal revenue, an extremely serious matter. Everyone knew that Granada was mainly a border territory and {{that it would not be}} able to self-financing its defence, simply because it did not have the necessary resources...|$|R
