40|$|Doença de Flegel ou hiperqueratose {{lenticular}} persistente é uma doença rara, caracterizada por pequenas pápulas hiperceratóticas, assintomáticas, localizadas preferencialmente nos membros inferiores. Histologicamente, há hiperortoceratose, atrofia epidérmica e infiltrado inflamatório em banda. Os tratamentos, em geral, são ineficazes. Relatamos um caso em que as lesões biopsiadas não recidivaram após dois anos de seguimento Flegel's disease, {{also known}} as hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, is a rare skin disease characterized by small reddish-brown asymptomatic hyperkeratotic papules usually located on the lower extremities. The histopathological features are <b>hyperorthokeratosis,</b> epidermal atrophy and band-like inflammatory infiltrate in the superficial dermis. Treatment is generally ineffective. We report a case of hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans that improved following excisional biopsy of the lesion...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-one year old, {{white female}} {{presented}} multiple round, brilliant, asymptomatic nor-mochromic, hyperkeratotic papules, measuring approximately 1 - 2 mm in diameter, on the transition {{area between the}} ventral and dorsal surfaces of the hands (Figure 1). She reported the appearance of lesions during adolescence, not associated with trau-ma, and with progressive increase in number. She cited similar cases in her family (cousin and sister). An excisional biopsy was performed for diagnostic con-firmation on a papule on the right hand. Histological exam, stained with hematoxylin eosin showed marked compact <b>hyperorthokeratosis,</b> over an inden-tation of the epidermal border, which appeared thick-ened (Figure 2). Verhoeff staining (for elastic fibers) did not show any alterations on the dermis fiber struc-ture (Figure 3). DOI...|$|E
40|$|Oral leucoplakia was {{predominantly}} seen in elderly age group. Addiction {{to tobacco}} {{was observed in}} majority of patients (80. 8 &#x 0025;). Clinically commonest site of involvement was buccal mucosa (67. 33 &#x 0025;), followed by labial mucosa (13. 86 &#x 0025;). Majority of patients (57. 35 &#x 0025;) were having homogenous type of leucoplakia, followed by verrucous variety (25 &#x 0025;). 26 - 48 &#x 0025; cases were also having oral submucous fibrosis.

40|$|In the {{district}} of Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh in South India the habit of reverse smoking is widespread. In a house to house survey of oral cancer and precancerous conditions, comprising 10, 169 villagers, 43 · 8 % were reverse smokers; the female: male ratio being 1 · 7 : 1. Ten previously undiagnosed cases of oral cancer, 9 located to palate, were found. The prevalences for leukoplakia, preleukoplakia and leukokeratosis nicotina palati were 4 · 9 %, 2 · 9 % and 9 · 5 %. Of 497 leukoplakias, 422 were located to the palate and 413 of these patients had the habit of reverse smoking. Histologically, 80 % of 381 palatal biopsies had a <b>hyperorthokeratosis.</b> Epithelial atypia was found in 15 · 3 % of leukoplakias, in 3 · 6 % of the preleukoplakias, and in 9 · 1 % of leukokeratosis nicotina palati.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionHarlequin {{ichthyosis}} (HI) is {{a severe}} and rare hereditary congenital skin disorder characterized by excessive dryness, ectropion and eclabion. The association of ichthyosis with systemic sclerosis {{has been described}} in only three children. No patient with generalized morphea (GM) associated with harlequin ichthyosis was described. Case reportA 4 -years and 6 -months girl, diagnosed with harlequin ichthyosis based on diffuse cutaneous thickening, scaling, erythema, ectropion and eclabium since the first hours of birth was described. She was treated with acitretin (1. 0 mg/kg/day) and emollient cream. At 3 years and 9 months, she developed muscle contractures with pain on motion and limitation in elbows and knees, and diffuse sclerodermic plaques on the abdomen, back, suprapubic area and lower limbs. Skin biopsy showed rectified epidermis and mild <b>hyperorthokeratosis,</b> reticular dermis with perivascular and periadnexal infiltrates of lymphocytes and mononuclear cells, and reticular dermis and sweat gland sclerosis surrounded by a dense collagen tissue, compatible with scleroderma. The patient fulfilled the GM subtype criteria. Methotrexate and prednisone were introduced. At 4 years and 3 months, new scleroderma lesions occurred and azathioprine was associated with previous therapy, with no apparent changes after two months. DiscussionA case of harlequin ichthyosis associated with a GM was reported. The treatment of these two conditions is a challenge and requires a multidisciplinary team...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. -One {{hundred and}} {{thirteen}} biopsies of the palate in people accustomed to smoking cigars, {{most of them}} with the burning end of the cigar inside the mouth, have been studied. Thirty-el'ght of these showed mild to severe atypical changes in the epithelium. There were 19 lesions showing orthokeratosis and 53 showing <b>hyperorthokeratosis.</b> The earliest atypical change {{is seen in the}} mouths of the ducts of the glands. There were 3 cases showing microinvasive carcinomas. Pigmentation is a proml'nent feature in these cases. The papules with umbilication could be due to hyperplasia of the mucous glands. It is suggested that stomatitis nicotina occurring in men and women with the habit of reverse smoking is probably precancerous {{because of the presence of}} atypical changes in the epithelium and also the finding of 3 microinvasive carcinomas without any macroscopic evidence. There is no acceptable explanation why the soft palate escapes getting either stomatitis nicotina lesion or carcinoma in reverse smokers. THE effect of smoking on the oral cavity has been well studied for quite a number of years in the West. A peculiar method of smoking home made cigars (smoking with the burning end inside the mouth) is common in Visakhapatnam district in the east coast of India and carcinoma of the hard palate is associated with it, especially in women (Kini and Rao, 1937; Khanolkar and Suryabai, 1945; Reddy and Rao, 1957). But so far no particular effort has been made to study the changes in the palate due to this method of smoking and the histological changes produced in the palate as a result of this type of smoking. Stomatitis nicotina, described by Thoma in 1941, is the name given to the changes in the hard palate in cigar smokers. This lesion has been studied by other...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. -In the {{district}} of Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh in South India the habit of reverse smoking is widespread. In a house to house survey of oral cancer and precancerous conditions, comprising 10, 169 villagers, 43 - 8 % were reverse smokers; the female: male ratio being 1 - 7 : 1. Ten previously undiagnosed cotses of oral cancer, 9 located to palate, were found. The prevalences for leukoplakia, preleukoplakia and leukokeratosis nicotina palati were 4 - 9 %, 2 - 9 %and 9 - 5 %. Of 497 leukoplakias, 422 werelocatedtothepalate and 413 of these patients had the habit of reverse smoking. Histologically, 80 % of 381 palatal biopsies had a <b>hyperorthokeratosis.</b> Epithelial atypia was found in 15 - 3 % of leukoplakias, in 3. 6 % of the preleukoplakias, and in 9 - 1 % of leukokeratosis nicotina palati. Various explanations for the habit of reverse smoking are suggested and discussed. In addition to reverse smoking, other tobacco habits were also recorded; all habits and oral lesions were compared and have been discussed according to their apparent interrelationships and distribution by sex and age. THE habit of reverse smoking has been reported from America (the Caribbean area, Columbia, Panama, and Venezuela), Asia (South India), and Europe (Sardinia). Quigley et al. (1966) have reviewed the literature. A number of cases have been described from clinical and histological aspects, and the increased tendency to palatal cancer {{in most of these}} areas has been emphasized. However, prevalence studies of reverse smoking and of oral mucosal lesions caused by the habit are lacking from all three continents. It was decided, therefore, to undertake a study of the prevalence of reverse smoking and its influence upon the oral mucosa in the state of Andhra Pradesh in South India, where the habit is widespread in rural coastal areas, and where palatal cancer is known to be frequent (Kini and Rao, 1937; Khanolkar an...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Toki's criteria in identifying the HPV L 1 protein in oral lesions with the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to determine which criteria optimize such identification. Study Design: Retrospective study of 277 cases diagnosed as HPV lesions at 22 years. Tests of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), kappa coefficients, and chi 2 values, as well as two logistic regression analyses ((p≤ 0. 05), were conducted. Results: Of the lesions studied, 96. 4 % (267 of 277) were positive for HPV using Toki's criteria and 28. 5 % (79 of 277) were positive for L 1 by IHC. Toki's criteria showed sensitivity= 93. 67 %, specificity= 2. 53 %, PPV= 6. 99 %, and NPV= 46. 55 %. Neither concordance nor statistically significant associations were observed between both tests. The logistic regression of Toki's criteria was useful in the diagnosis of L 1, correctly classified 71. 8 % of the lesions positive for L 1, and showed a Hosmer-Lemeshow adjustment of p = 0. 614 and a Nagelkerke's coefficient of determination of 6. 8 %. The explanatory variables statistically significant at p≤ 0. 05 were dyskeratosis (p = 0. 01) and papillomatosis (p = 0. 04). Forty-nine independent variables (clinical and histopathologic) were involved in the second regression analysis. The model correctly classified 85. 2 % of the lesions and showed a Hosmer-Lemeshow adjustment of p = 0. 696 and a Nagelkerke's coefficient of determination of 60. 2 %. The explanatory variables statistically significant at p≤ 0. 05 were: age younger than 35 years (p = 0. 001), multiple lesions (p = 0. 031), <b>hyperorthokeratosis</b> (p = 0. 019), focal intra - cellular edema (p = 0. 002), and the presence of 1 to more than 5 cells with degenerative changes in their nucleus (p = 0. 048). Conclusions: Toki's criteria are not adequate to make a diagnosis of lesions by HPV in the mouth, but the logistic regression analysis showed clinical and histopathologic variables which optimize the identification of lesions through the L 1 protein. However, a PCR study is advisable when the presence of high-risk HPV is suspected...|$|E
