25|$|Kung Lao {{returns in}} Mortal Kombat X. In story mode, he serves the Netherrealm {{as one of}} Quan Chi's revenants and is angered at Raiden for not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> Shao Kahn murdering him. His younger cousin, Kung Jin, makes his debut as a playable {{character}} {{and is one of}} the story's main heroes. It is mentioned that Kung Jin became a thief because his family fell on hard times after Kung Lao's death, and held hard feelings toward Raiden as a result.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1791 the other monarchies of Europe watched with alarm the {{developments}} in France, and considered {{whether they should}} intervene, either in support of Louis XVI or {{to take advantage of}} the chaos in France. The key figure, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, brother to the French Queen Marie Antoinette, had initially looked on the Revolution calmly. He became more and more disturbed as the Revolution became more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war. On 27 August 1791, Leopold and King Frederick William II of Prussia, in consultation with emigrant French nobles, issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, which declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe in the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a way of taking action that would enable him to avoid actually <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> France, at least for the moment, Paris saw the Declaration as a serious threat, and the revolutionary leaders denounced it.|$|E

500|$|Lonnie Thompson, Earth Science {{professor}} at Ohio State University, whose work on retreating glaciers {{was featured in}} the film, was pleased with how his research was presented. [...] "It's so hard given the breadth of this topic to be factually correct, {{and make sure you}} don't lose your audience," [...] Thompson said. [...] "As scientists, we publish our papers in Science and Nature, but very few people read those. Here's another way to get this message out. To me, it's an excellent overview for an introductory class at a university. What are the issues and what are the possible consequences of not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> those changes? To me, it has tremendous value. It will reach people that scientists will never reach." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Jackson was {{finishing}} The Frighteners and considered The Lord of the Rings {{as a new}} project, wondering [...] "why nobody else seemed to be <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it". With the new developments in computer-generated imagery following Jurassic Park, Jackson set about planning a fantasy film that would be relatively serious and feel real. By October, {{he and his partner}} Fran Walsh teamed up with Miramax Films boss Harvey Weinstein to negotiate with Saul Zaentz who had held the rights to the book since the early 1970s, pitching an adaptation of The Hobbit and two films based on The Lord of the Rings. Negotiations then stalled when Universal Studios offered Jackson a remake of King Kong. Weinstein was furious, and further problems arose when it turned out Zaentz did not have distribution rights to The Hobbit; United Artists, which was in the market, did. By April 1996, the rights question was still not resolved.|$|E
500|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects {{all aspects of}} public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid—but never mind, since what matters is not actually <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'". [...] The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, [...] "Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence is tucked away in an endnote about tattoos: 'I wish I had the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'. If only someone had awarded him that space". The book was also {{the subject of a}} spoof review by John Crace in The Guardian, which satirised the book and its author.|$|E

[...] The website Ace of Spades HQ disputed any connection to the movement and additionally stated Stack was not [...] "right wing", citing Stack's criticism of politicians for not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> health care reform.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{briefing}} on September 27, 2013, Hale warned that lapse in funding {{caused by the}} federal government shutdown of 2013 would cause a delay in military death-benefit payments for the families of U.S. troops killed in action (such as the $100,000 [...] "death gratuity," [...] the burial benefit, and the survivors' housing allowance). Hale called the situation a [...] "ghoulish" [...] legal consequence of the shutdown. Despite Hale's warnings, [...] "it took until the second week of the crisis for members of Congress to propose <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] On October 10, 2013, Congress eventually passed a bill authorizing emergency payments to the families of deceased soldiers during the government shutdown, which President Obama signed into law the same day.|$|E
