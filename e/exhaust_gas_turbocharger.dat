40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with predicting the transient response performance of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbocharger</b> under pulsating and non-pulsating flow conditions. Using the measured steady state characteristics of the turbocharger compressor and turbine, theoretical procedures are developed to predict its transient response during rapid variations in the turbine inlet conditions. A computer program has been written for non-pulsating and two other programs for pulsating flow conditions. Each of these programs used a different method of predicting the response. The programs, with their subroutines {{and the organization of}} the calculations, and experimental data are presented. To enable the computer predicted results to be compared with experimental results, an experimental program was carried out on a Holset 3 LD turbocharger. The layout and the principal features of the experimental test rig, which is designed to operate the turbocharger from a compressed air supply, are described. The rig may be used to simulate engine exhaust conditions. The computer predicted results are compared with the experimental ones obtained from tests, during pulsating and non-pulsating operation of the turbocharger. The experimental results and theoretical predictions are found to compare favourably, and the possible causes of discrepancies are suggested. Suggestions are made for further work...|$|E

40|$|The {{diesel engine}} {{is used for}} power {{generation}} in stationary applications especially in isolated areas not connected to the main distribution network due to its relatively high efficiency, durability, and flexibility compared to alternative power sources. The diesel engine can easily follow power fluctuations. For this reason it is widely used for power generation in Islands in Greece. The diesel engine is a complex machine and requires intensive maintenance to insure proper and efficient operation. This is amplified by {{the interaction between the}} engine and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbocharger.</b> The present work describes an advanced troubleshooting method, based mainly on thermodynamics, for stationary engine monitoring and fault detection. The method is based on the processing of measured engine data using a simulation model and provides the current engine condition and its tuning. An application of the method on a slow speed diesel engine used for power generation is presented. The method is applied in the field and the results reveal the condition of the engine and its subsystems. Furthermore, proposals are made to improve engine performance.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbocharger</b> on nano-scale Particulate Matter (PM) number emissions from a Gasoline Direct Injected (GDI) engine is investigated at fixed exhaust gas dilution ratio for a matrix of three engine speeds and four engine load operating points. Experimental repeatability is assessed {{by means of the}} Coefficient of Variation (CoV) from three independent measurements for every test point. A hypothesis test on the difference between total number count before and after the turbine shows that there are statistically relevant variations for most operating points. A reduction in PM total number count at low load is observed, and an increment at high load. It is conjectured that as fuel injection pressure and duration increase with load, a larger share of volatile particulate matter is produced, which then undergoes nucleation as the exhaust gas expands through the turbine. At the same time, the centrifugal action within the turbocharger is believed to promote particle agglomeration and growth, and fragmentation of micro-scale particles. Experiments with variable dilution ratio at a fixed engine test point show that changes in dilution ratio affect repeatability of the emissions measurements only marginally. Yet, a hypothesis test on the variation of total number count with dilution shows that PM number counts are systematically affected by changes in dilution ratio. Furthermore, a hypothesis test also shows that the impact of the turbocharger on total number emissions is statistically relevant regardless of the dilution ratio adopted...|$|E
40|$|The {{diesel engine}} {{is the main}} {{propulsion}} system for marine vessels except for a small category using gas or steam turbines. This {{is the result of}} its high efficiency, power concentration and reliability that have been improved considerably during the current decade. Despite these advantages, the engineer usually has to overcome great difficulties and mainly operational problems arising during the engine's lifetime. In the case of large marine engines {{it is almost impossible to}} apply trial and error methods to solve engine operating problems. This is amplified by the fact that almost all large marine diesel engines are turbocharged ones making the problem even more severe because of the interaction between the engine and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> <b>turbocharger.</b> For this reason various diagnosis methods have been proposed for diesel engine condition monitoring that are mainly statistical based on known engine operating curves. These systems provide general information only and do not reveal the actual cause for an engine fault or low performance. In the current work an advanced automatic troubleshooting method based mainly on thermodynamics is presented to monitor the engine condition and to detect the actual cause for an engine fault. The method is based on the processing of measured engine data using a simulation model and provides the current engine condition and its tuning. An application of the method on a marine vessel powered by a slow speed two stroke marine diesel engine suffering from high cylinder exhaust gas temperatures and low power output is given in the present work. The method is applied at sea under actual engine operating conditions. From the processing of measured data the diagnosis method provides the current engine condition and the cause for the low power output from which the engine suffered. After conducting the major repair/adjustments proposed by the diagnosis method a substantial improvement in engine behavior was observed providing a validation for the proposed method.

5000|$|To detect knock, a {{piezoelectric}} {{knock sensor}} (basically a microphone) {{bolted to the}} engine block responds to unique frequencies caused by engine knock. The sensor generates a small voltage that {{is sent to the}} electronic control unit, which processes the signal to determine if, in fact, knock is occurring.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{digital computer}} program {{is used to}} simulate the unsteady gas flow in the exhaust and inlet systems of a multi-cylinder, turbocharged, medium-high speed, four-stroke diesel engine installed at the authors' laboratory. The simulation assumes one-dimensional, time-varying gas flow in the engine pipes and incorporates numerous realistic fluid dynamic, thermodynamic and heat-transfer features. The characteristic mathematical transformation solution of the gas-flow dynamics partial differential equations is interfaced with First-Law analysis models of the cylinders main chambers and prechambers. The simulation results are compared most favourably against the engine's experimental performance results, which include mean air consumption rate, pressure histories at various locations on the exhaust system, and energy-mean temperature values at the exit of the exhaust system. The simulation results are also utilized for {{the determination of the}} various cylinders' exhaust waves intensity, as they are imposed by the design characteristics of the exhaust manifold. The plotting of relevant charts, showing the contour variation of gas pressure, temperature and Mach index against engine crank angle and pipe length, aids the correct interpretation of the observed behaviour. The detailed simulation of the fluid dynamic and heat-transfer fields in the engine exhaust system, permits an interesting parametric study of the influence of the degree of insulation of the exhaust system on the energy and exergy (availability) content of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> before the <b>turbocharger</b> turbine, by coupling the above First-Law with Second-Law analysis concepts.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{the focus of}} {{internal}} combustion engine development has moved towards more efficient and less pollutant engines. In a Diesel engine, approximately 30 - 40 % of the energy provided by combustion is lost through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> are hot and therefore rich of energy. Some of this energy can be recovered by recycling the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> into <b>turbocharger.</b> However, the energy losses in the exhaust port are highly undesired and the mechanisms driving the total pressure losses in the exhaust manifold not fully understood. Moreover, {{the efficiency of the}} turbine is highly dependent on the upstream flow conditions. Thus, a numerical study of the flow in the exhaust port geometry of a Scania heavy-duty Diesel engine is carried out mainly by using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach. The purpose is to characterize the flow in the exhaust port, analyze and identify the sources of the total pressure losses. Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulation results are included for comparison purposes. The calculations are performed with fixed valve and stationary boundary conditions for which experimental data are available. The simulations include a verification study of the solver using different grid resolutions and different valve lift states. The calculated numerical data are compared to existent measured pressure loss data. The results show that even global parameters like total pressure losses are predicted better by LES than by URANS. The complex three-dimensional flow structures generated in the flow field are qualitatively assessed through visualization and analyzed by statistical means. The near valve region is a major source of losses. Due to the presence of the valve, an annular, jet-like flow structure is formed where the high-velocity flow follows the valve stem into the port. Flow separation occurs immediately downstream of the valve seat {{on the walls of the}} port and also on the surface of the valve body. Strong longitudinal, non-stationary secondary flow structures (i. e. in the plane normal to the main flow direction) are observed in the exhaust manifold. Such structures can degrade the efficiency of a possible turbine of a turbocharger located downstream on the exhaust manifold. The effect of the valve and piston motion has also been studied by the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach. Within the exhaust process, the valves open while the piston continues moving in the combustion chamber. This process is often analyzed modeling the piston and valves at fixed locations, but conserving the total mass flow. Using advanced methods, this process can be simulated numerically in a more accurate manner. Based on LES data, the discharge coefficients are calculated following the strict definition. The results show that the discharge coefficient can be overestimated (about 20 %) when using simplified experiments, e. g. flow bench. Simple cases using fixed positions for valve and piston are contrasted with cases which consider the motion of piston and/or valves. The overall flow characteristics are compared within the cases. The comparison shows it is impossible to rebuild the dynamic flow field with the simplification with fixed valves. It is better to employ LES to simulate the dynamic flow and associated losses with valve and piston motion. QC 20131204 </p...|$|R
40|$|Vehicles with {{internal}} combustion (IC) engines fueled by hydrocarbon compounds {{have been used}} for more than 100 years for ground transportation. During the years and in particular in the last decade, the environmental aspects of IC engines have become a major political and research topic. Following this interest, the emissions of pollutants such as NOx, CO 2 and unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) from IC engines have been reduced considerably. Â Yet, there is still a clear need and possibility to improve engine efficiency while further reducing emissions of pollutants. The maximum efficiency of IC engines used in passenger cars is no more than 40 % and considerably less than that under part load conditions. One way to improve engine efficiency is to utilize the energy of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> to <b>turbocharge</b> the engine. While turbocharging {{is by no means a}} new concept, its design and integration into the gas exchange system has been of low priority in the power train design process. One expects that the rapidly increasing interest in efficient passenger car engines would mean that the use of turbo technology will become more widespread. The flow in the IC-engine intake manifold determines the flow in the cylinder prior and during the combustion. Similarly, the flow in the exhaust manifold determines the flow into the turbine, and thereby the efficiency of the turbocharging system. In order to reduce NOx emissions, <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> recirculation (EGR) is used. As this process transport <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> into the cylinder, its efficiency is dependent on the gas exchange system in general. The losses in the gas exchange system are also an issue related to engine efficiency. These aspects have been addressed up to now rather superficially. One has been interested in global aspects (e. g. pressure drop, turbine efficiency) under steady state conditions. In this thesis, we focus on the flow in the exhaust port and close to the valve. Since the flow in the port can be transonic, we study first the numerical modeling of such a flow in a more simple geometry, namely a bump placed in a wind tunnel. Large-Eddy Simulations of internal transonic flow have been carried out. The results show that transonic flow in general is very sensitive to small disturbances in the boundary conditions. Flow in the wind tunnel case is always highly unsteady in the transonic flow regime with self excited shock oscillations and associated with that also unsteady boundary-layer separation. To investigate sensitivity to periodic disturbances the outlet pressure in the wind tunnel caseÂ  was varied periodically at rather low amplitude. These low amplitude oscillations caused hysteretic behavior in the mean shock position and appearance of shocks of widely different patterns. The study of a model exhaust port shows that at realistic pressure ratios, the flow is transonic in the exhaust port. Furthermore, two pairs of vortex structures are created downstream of the valve plate by the wake behind the valve stem and by inertial forces and the pressure gradient in the port. These structures dissipate rather quickly. The impact of these structures and the choking effect caused by the shock on realistic IC engine performance remains to be studied in the future.
