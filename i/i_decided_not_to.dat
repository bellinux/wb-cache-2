500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fulci's {{version is}} as follows: [...] "One day I told Dardano {{the plot of}} my Evil Comes Back (later retitled Per Sempre/Until Death), a sequel on a fantastic note to The Postman Always Rings Twice, and he {{proposed}} it to several producers with {{my name on it}} as the director. Then, one day, he registered the screenplay with his name on it! (laughs) I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer (Sergio Martino), but, in view of our past friendship, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{came to the}} {{realisation}} that as she and {{her fans}} were growing up, {{it was time for}} her {{to move away from the}} teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Feeling the need to attempt something different, Madonna wanted the sound of her new album to indicate what could be popular in the music world. For lyrical ideas of the title track, she chose topics that until then had been personal meditations never to be shared with the general public; she told SongTalk magazine [...] "In the past I wrote a lot of songs that , but I felt they were too honest or too frightening or too scary and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> record them". She decided to take a more adult, sophisticated approach; thoughtfully, she sifted through her personal journals and diaries, and began considering her options. She recalled, [...] "What was it I wanted to say? I wanted the album and the song to speak to things on my mind. It was a complex time in my life." [...] She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her husband, actor Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God.|$|E
3000|$|... {{percentile}} {{for this}} sub-sample in those periods. Hence, <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> discuss this counter-intuitive sign of coefficients in this paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Possibly. I {{shall have}} to go down for a day at least, to get my luggage, in case <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> renew my {{engagement}} with Lord Jasper." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....I used {{to think}} the murderer was the creepiest guy imaginable. Now, {{with a couple of}} trips to the Hunger Games under my belt, <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> judge him without knowing more details. Maybe his lover was already sentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier. To let her know he'd be waiting. Or maybe he thought the place he was leaving her was really worse than death..." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{struck me}} there was sense in what he said. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mention my idea of carving 1553 above the front-door.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding this warning, Euphemia and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take in our sign. We {{were not}} to be frightened by a stage-driver. The next day our own driver passed us on the road as he was going down.|$|E
60|$|There was {{reason in}} what he was saying. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mention my idea of {{altering}} the chimneys and fixing up imitation gables, especially as young Bute seemed pleased with the house, which by this time we had reached.|$|E
30|$|Neran: I was {{thinking}} {{to visit the}} academics in Arabic Literature department in regarding the question but [in a weak voice] <b>I</b> eventually <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I {{answered}} with emphasis. [...] "Of the greatest service! Perhaps it saved us from ruin, {{but at first}} <b>I</b> almost <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> touch it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, curse you {{and your}} oats!" [...] growled Jo, with {{simulated}} anger. [...] "You make such a fuss about a bargain, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> trade. Take your old donkeys, and call it square!" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{thought we}} would give up {{gambling}} then. As Harris said, it breeds an unhealthy excitement when carried too far. George offered {{to go on and}} give us our revenge; but Harris and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> battle any further against Fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go and see {{my little}} {{daughter}} before you leave Florence. She's alone at the villa; <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> send her to my sister, who hasn't at all my ideas. Tell her she must love her poor father very much," [...] said Gilbert Osmond gently.|$|E
60|$|I should, in the {{ordinary}} course of business, have addressed Mr. Parable by name, such being our instructions {{in the case of}} customers known to us. But, putting the hat and the girl together, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to.</b> Mr. Parable was all for our three-and-six-penny table d'hote; he evidently not wanting to think. But the lady wouldn't hear of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--that {{was what}} I was afraid of! But <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> write to you any more. They won't have me {{back at the}} school--that's why I couldn't write. Not the fact, but the reason!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, owner Dumitru Bucşaru did not file for a licence for the club {{to play in the}} Liga <b>I</b> and <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> enroll the team in any championship. Unirea Urziceni was {{subsequently}} dissolved.|$|R
6000|$|... "The first I {{knew that}} babies were disgraceful. Why, Sarah, you, with your five, how disgraceful you have been. Billy and <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be half as disgraceful. We're {{only going to}} have two--a boy and a girl." ...|$|R
60|$|We washed {{ourselves}} in the Rhine at Cologne (we {{had not had a}} wash since we had left our happy home in England). We started with the idea of washing ourselves at the hotel; but on seeing the basin and water and towel provided, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> waste my time playing with them. As well might Hercules have attempted to tidy up the Augean stables with a squirt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I came second-cabin," [...] said Jeff. [...] "I {{worked my}} way over on a cattle-ship to London, and, when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> work my way back, I found I hadn't enough money for a first-cabin passage. I {{was in a hurry}} to get back in time to get settled at Harvard, and so I came second-cabin. It wasn't bad. I used to see you across the rail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have an {{engagement}} {{in a few}} minutes," [...] he explained. [...] "My car is waiting now. I looked in at the club to dine, found my favourite table taken and nearly every man I ever disliked sidling up {{to tell me that}} he hears I am giving a wonderful party on Thursday. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> dine there, after all, and Charles found me a corner here. I am going in five minutes." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1948, she {{approached}} Mary Gilmore {{to write a}} forward to Travels in North Queensland, but Gilmore declined {{on the basis that}} Devanny should write it herself, as 'I have written so many that <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> write any more for a time, as they will have no value by now'.|$|R
2500|$|Later than month, the Collingdale GOP {{followed}} {{the lead of}} Glenolden, Darby, Prospect Park and Tinicum, in dumping Milliken as its representative on the War Board. There was some measure of suspense as Milliken pondered another race, this time as an independent, but on February 18, he issued a terse statement: [...] "After consideration, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{be a candidate for}} reelection to the U.S. Congress." ...|$|R
50|$|On 5 September 2012, Gilroy {{stepped down}} as manager of the Dublin footballers after four years in charge. Gilroy said: “It has been a {{challenging}} four years for me balancing my role with Dublin along with family and work commitments and <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> continue for a further term". In November 2012, he went to New York to manage the 2011 All Stars in their game against the 2012 All Stars.|$|R
60|$|I {{offered to}} go with him, and that offer he accepted, whereafter I lounged in his {{antechamber}} waiting until he should be dressed, and considering whether to impart to him the further information I had that morning gleaned. In the end <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do so, unable to bring myself {{to tell him that}} so much turpitude might possibly be plotting against Bianca. It was a statement that soiled her, so it seemed to me. Indeed I could scarcely bear to think of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three francs--two kilometers--and {{three pieces}} of luggage! No signore. No! Five francs. Cinque franchi!" [...] And averting his pallid, old mudlarking face, and flinging his hand out at me, he stood the image of indignant repudiation. And truly, he was no taller than my upper {{waistcoat}} pocket. The brat! The brat! He was such an actor, and so impudent, that I wavered between wonder and amusement and a great inclination to kick him up the steps. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> waste my energy being angry.|$|E
60|$|Curiously enough I have {{completely}} forgotten my mood after {{that for a}} little while, but I know that later, for a minute perhaps, I hung for a time out of the carriage with the door open, contemplating a leap from the train. It {{was to be a}} dramatic leap, and then I would go storming back to her, denounce her, overwhelm her; and I hung, urging myself to do it. I don't remember how it was <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do this, at last, but in the end I didn't.|$|E
500|$|Martin is firm about {{ending the}} {{series with the}} seventh novel [...] "until <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be firm". With his stated goal of telling the story from {{beginning}} to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes {{as well as the}} future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing A Dream of Spring together with The Winds of Winter, and in early 2016, {{he said he did not}} believe A Dream of Spring would be published before the last season of the HBO show.|$|R
2500|$|Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced, {{two days}} before polling day and after weeks of speculation, {{that he and his}} ministers would not vote in the {{by-election}}s. He said: [...] "In view of the unique nature of this by-election and after careful consideration, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> vote in this by-election. All members of my political team share this view and, of their own accord, have also <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> vote." [...] He also said the government would seek to amend the election law to prevent such abuse in future.|$|R
50|$|In March 2012, Rednic {{came back}} to Romania where he signed a {{contract}} with Astra Ploieşti {{until the end of the}} season. The team finished 12th in Liga <b>I</b> and Rednic <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> continue with Astra. Instead, he moved to their biggest rivals, Petrolul Ploieşti.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never {{published}} it," [...] {{explained the}} Minor Poet. [...] "Within {{the same week}} two friends of mine, one of whom {{had just returned from}} Norway and the other from Switzerland, confided to me their intention of writing stories about girls who had fallen into glaciers, and who had been found by their friends long afterwards, looking as good as new; and a few days later I chanced upon a book, the heroine of which had been dug out of a glacier alive three hundred years after she had fallen in. There seemed to be a run on ice maidens, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> add to their number." ...|$|E
60|$|Her eyes quite {{shone with}} pleasure. I turned away, finding the {{conversation}} silly. I thought I would {{do without the}} pleasant looks of Madonna Giulia, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come to her again. Meanwhile, I began talking {{to one of the}} other ladies in the room and passed the time agreeably enough.... In a little while Giulia passed me, leaning on the arm of one of her admirers. I saw her glance at me, but I took no notice. Immediately afterwards she came again, hesitating a moment, as if she wished to say something, but passed on without speaking. I thought she was piqued at my inattention to her, and, with a smile, redoubled my attentions to the lady with whom I was talking.|$|E
60|$|The girl started, blushed, {{compressed}} her lips, {{and continued}} silent {{for half a}} minute. I could see that her hand trembled, {{but she was too}} much accustomed to extraordinary situations easily to lose her self-command. It was nearly dusk, too, and the obscurity in which she sat within the hut, which was itself beneath the shade of tall trees, most probably aided her efforts to seem unconscious. Yet, I had spoken warmly, and as I soon saw, in a manner that demanded explanation, though at the moment quite without plan, and scarcely with the consciousness of what I was doing. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> retreat, but to go on, in doing which I should merely obey an impulse that was getting to be too strong for much further restraint; that was not the precise moment, nevertheless, in which I was resolved to speak, but I waited rather for the natural course of things. In the mean time, after the short silence mentioned, the discourse continued.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile <b>I</b> had {{definitely}} <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a lawyer, and {{it happened}} in this way. One Sunday morning as I was walking toward school, I met {{a young man named}} Lohr, a law student several years older than myself, who turned and walked with me for a few blocks.|$|R
50|$|The {{crime of}} which the accused have been convicted, that is the main crime, the crime of conspiracy, is in essence one of high treason. The state has <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> charge the crime in this form. Bearing this in mind and giving the matter very serious {{consideration}} <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> impose the supreme penalty which {{in a case like}} this would usually be the proper penalty for the crime, but consistent with my duty that is the only leniency which I can show. The sentence in the case of all the accused will be one of life imprisonment.|$|R
60|$|The Cunard steamers being now {{removed from}} Halifax, <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go there, or to St. John's, New Brunswick. And as {{there would be}} a perfect uproar if I picked out such a place in Canada as Quebec or Montreal, and {{excluded}} those two places (which would guarantee three hundred pounds a night), and further, as I don't want places, having more than enough for my list of eighty-four, I have finally resolved <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go to Canada either. This will enable me to embark for home in April instead of May.|$|R
