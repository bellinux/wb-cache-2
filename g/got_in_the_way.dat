In addition, there were {{conflicts}} within the group. After the 1988 tour, Donnette Thayer left the group to form Hex with Steve Kilbey of The Church. LaFreniere and Gassuan left the group at that time as well, and Ray sustained a disabling back injury that rendered him temporarily unable to play drums.|$|E

One had been completely buried and another partially sunken when the proprietor, Lord Mansfield, arrived at the scene and stopped further operations. The stone was still used as a gathering place for the locality into comparatively recent times.|$|E

Upon investigation, he {{concluded}} that because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space, it was difficult or even impossible for a startup retailer to negotiate successfully for the use of that space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the effective use of space.|$|E

25|$|Hitler's {{interest}} in this strategy forced Göring and Jeschonnek to review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to Göring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, Directions for operations against the British War Economy, which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top priority. This strategy had been recognised before the war, but Operation Eagle Attack and the following Battle of Britain had <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting structures. The OKL had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft industries.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} Block B competing, Rush stated {{that he was willing}} to put his {{differences}} with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. The second block matches started with a battle royal to determine the order of matches. The match included Ángel de Oro, Marco Corleone, Delta, El Felino, El Hijo del Fantasma, Pólvora, Rey Escorpión and Rush with El Felino and Ángel de Oro being the last two men in the ring. In the first round the team of Stuka, Jr. and Pólvora did not get along, playing off the two of them being disqualified from the 2012 Reyes del Aire ("Kings of the Air") tournament on the February 3, 2012 Super Viernes show. The dissension made it easy for Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión to win the first match of the tournament. In other first round matches Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero defeating El Hijo del Fantasma and Misterioso, Jr. Rush and El Terrible proved that they could indeed put their differences aside for at least one night as they worked well together to defeat Delta and Ephesto. While the final first round match featured the only all-rudo team in the tournament it did not mean that El Felino and Rey Bucanero got along at all, during the match Rey Bucanero left his former La Peste Negra partner alone in the ring as he walked out of the arena. The odds were too hard to overcome for Felino and he fell to Ángel de Oro and Psicosis. The first match in the second round saw two members of Los Guerreros del Infierno on opposite sides as Guerreros leader Último Guerrero teamed up with Marco Corleone and Guerrero team member Rey Escorpión teamed with Black Warrior. Initially the two Guerreros members avoided each other, but when they were finally in the ring with each other the fought like they had no allegiance with each other. The closing moments of the match saw Marco Corleone pin not just Black Warrior and Rey Escorpión but also his own teammate Último Guerrero when he <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of Corleone's move off the top rope. Guerrero expressed his displeasure at being pinned by his own team mate after the match. If the first second round match saw allegiances put aside for the tournament, the second match saw rivalry put aside for the tournament as Rush and El Terrible once again worked better together than expected as they defeated Ángel de Oro and Psicosis to become the second team in the semifinal match. In the third and final round of the evening Rush's promise to put differences aside and win the tournament turned out to be true as the two defeated Marco Corleone and Último Guerrero to earn the second spot in the tournament finals.|$|E

500|$|Pratchett had a {{tendency}} to avoid using chapters, arguing in a Book Sense interview that [...] "life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and Homer did not write in chapters", adding [...] "I'm blessed if I know what function they serve in books for adults." [...] However, there have been exceptions; Going Postal and Making Money and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters. Pratchett offered explanations for his sporadic use of chapters; in the young adult titles, he said that he must use chapters because ' editor screams until [...] does', but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary 'stopping point' that <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the narrative.|$|E
500|$|On the February 15, 1993 {{airing of}} Monday Night Raw, Ted DiBiase {{wrestled}} against Brutus [...] "The Barber" [...] Beefcake.

DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to hit him in the face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart repeatedly <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> before Schyster shoved him out of the ring.

500|$|Michigan fullback Bo Molenda {{was also}} {{credited}} with stopping Grange. [...] Grange played at {{quarterback for the}} first time in his career and was held to 56 net rushing yards on 25 carries.

[...] Time after time he <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to make the pass incomplete or to gather it in his arms." [...] Molenda intercepted a pass thrown by Grange on the opening drive of the game and made a second interception of a pass thrown by Earl Britton later in the first quarter. [...] He had two more interceptions in the fourth quarter, both on passes thrown by Daugherty. Multiple sources indicate that Molenda intercepted a total of five passes in the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{style of}} Love in Several Masques, along with The Temple Beau (1730), {{exemplified}} Fielding's understanding of traditional Post-Restoration comedic form. Albert Rivero, a critic specialising in early 18th-century literature, believes that Fielding, in the play, [...] "recognizes {{that to have}} his plays acted at Drury Lane, he must have the approval of his famous contemporary [...] To gain that approval, Fielding must follow Cibber—if not write like him, certainly write plays that he will like." [...] However, Fielding did not respect Cibber's abilities, nor did he believe that the control Cibber took over the plays performed at the Theatre Royal were improved by Cibber's required changes. Instead, Fielding believed that Cibber <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of comedy. Regardless, there are similarities between the characters in Love in Several Masques and Cibber and Vanbrugh's The Provok'd Husband. In particular, Fielding's Lady Matchless resembles the character Lady Townly.|$|E
500|$|The Ehoie of Mestra closes {{with her}} {{returning}} to Athens {{to care for}} her father, but the poet's attention stays with Sisyphus, as he and his son are the male subjects of the Ehoie of Eurynome which immediately follows. She was wise and beautiful, having been taught womanly arts by Athena. Sisyphus attempted to cheat her of her cattle, but Zeus intervened. Although he did not get what he was after, Sisyphus did accomplish with Eurynome what he could not with Mestra: a marriage for Glaucus. The gods again <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> though, and she bore Bellerophontes to Poseidon, who gave his son the winged horse Pegasus with which Bellerophontes slew the Chimera. [...] In the Iliad this task was presented as the order of Proetus' father-in-law Iobates, and in the Catalogue it appears to be followed immediately by the marriage of Bellerophontes and a daughter of the Lycian king.|$|E

A New York Times editorial suggested that Maloney {{might have been}} involved by withholding emails during the investigation, and the Times endorsed Maloney's 2012 election opponent because of its concerns about Maloney's handling of the investigation.

500|$|The feud between The Mega-Maniacs (Brutus Beefcake and Hulk Hogan) and WWF Tag Team Champions Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R.

He was unable to wrestle again until the February 15, 1993, episode of Raw. He faced DiBiase in his return match, after which DiBiase and Schyster attacked him. DiBiase held Beefcake for Schyster to {{hit him in the}} face with a briefcase, but Jimmy Hart, who managed Money Inc., repeatedly <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> before Schyster shoved him out of the ring. Schyster then hit Beefcake in the face with the briefcase.

60|$|There {{was perhaps}} {{a grain of}} truth mixed up with this last report.
