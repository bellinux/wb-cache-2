A central question in gustatory research is how information about taste quality is extracted by taste receptor cells.

A recent study showed that taste cells expressing bitter-responsive taste receptors do not also express sweet-responsive taste receptors and vice versa.

Results from electrophysiological studies, however, reveal that individual taste receptor cells respond to stimuli representing multiple taste qualities.

We recorded calcium transients elicited by chemical stimuli representing different taste qualities (sweet, salty, sour and bitter). Many receptor cells (38 %) responded to multiple taste qualities, with some taste cells responding to both appetitive (‘sweet’) and aversive (‘bitter’) stimuli. Thus, there appears to be no strict and separate detection of taste qualities by distinct subpopulations of taste cells in peripheral gustatory sensory organs in mice...|$|R

Centre for Traditional Medicine and Research (CTMR) documented these practices in the erstwhile Salem dis-trict. The objective {{of the study was to}} explore the ethnobotanical knowledge of the traditional healers in the treatment of animal poisons. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out over a period of two years 2009 - 2011 by way of structured inter-views, photo documentation of plants used and process adopted {{for the treatment}} including chanting of mantras among the folk healers of the hilly regions of Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri Districts of Tamil Nadu. Out of 180 healers interviewed, twenty eight healers who treated poison bites took part in the study voluntarily and shared their practices. This paper enumerates the plants used either individually or as part of a polyherbal formulation. Results: The healers treat unknown insect bites, scorpion stings, wasp, wild spider, bee stings, snake bites and aller-gy caused by centipedes. Many times allergic skin diseases- urticarial rashes are also classified as poison bites by these healers.

Eight salts with equal intensity were selected for study (NaBr, KBr, CaBr 2, MgBr 2, Na 2 SO 4, K 2 SO 4, CaCl 2, and MgSO 4), sucrose and water. Ten subjects participated in the taste confusion matrix (TCM) experiment. Whole mouth 2 ̆ 2 sip and spit 2 ̆ 2 methodology was adopted.

Attempts to decentralize the core with finite price systems such as Lindahl prices suggest that this is possible only under fairly restrictive conditions. In this paper, we introduce a new type of price system called finite cost shares.

In rat epiglottis, taste buds and isolated bipolar cells were keratin- 20 -positive.

At first sight, this seems inconsistent with standard notions of rational choice, where increasing the set of available choices cannot make anyone strictly worse off. Robert H. Strotz (1955, 168), who discusses intertemporal choice, calls this constraining of one’s future choices the “strategy of precommitment ” and suggests that it results from the agent today being a “different person with a different discount function from the agent of the past. ” Thomas C.

That is, MSG, L-AP 4 and aspartate have similar tastes to rats. However, conditioned taste aversion methods are unable to show to what extent the tastes of two substances are different. If two substances activate the same afferent processes (e. g. taste receptors), they are likely to produce the same tastes, but if they activate different afferent processes, the subject may detect differences between the tastes of the substances. In this study, rats were tested to determine if they could discriminate between the tastes of these agonists and MSG. We also established the detection thresh-olds for NMDA, aspartic acid and L-AP 4, with and without amiloride (a sodium channel antagonist).
