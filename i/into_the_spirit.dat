5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5|$|The {{dead man}} is autopsied; his corpse had been dismembered and reconstructed. Michaels notes {{that this is}} a Seneca ritual aimed at {{reviving}} the dead to learn of spiritual matters. Later, Black and Michaels are called the construction site, where Powell is attempting to package and remove the ancient remains. Reynard and Powell begin fighting; the latter soon dies of a heart attack. When Black returns to his car, he finds a native face mask placed inside; Michaels explains that it represents the ability to cross from the material world <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> world. Black believes a secret native tribe is awaiting the downfall and apocalypse of the society of the white settlers; he theorizes that they believe his abilities are key to their prophecies {{of the end of the}} world.|$|E

The post-war years also saw him attempt to launch the comic-strip/comic-book series Baseball, John Law, Kewpies, and Nubbin the Shoeshine Boy; none succeeded, but some material was recycled <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spirit.</b>|$|E

Tim Fulford assents to Hazlitt's observation that Crabbe viewed his poor villagers from a distance ("as an overseer of the poor"; the words are from his lectures on poetry but the idea was brought forward <b>into</b> <b>The</b> <b>Spirit</b> of the Age), rather than showing the reader what they feel about their situation.|$|E
25|$|Clapp's {{decision}} to invest considerable funds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of Progress {{was based on}} entirely pragmatic considerations. In an age before interstate air travel was common, politicians and heads of industry rode between Australia's two largest capital cities and the national capital Canberra by train. The upgrade of the service was then a smart investment in promoting the Victorian Railways brand and its reputation to the nation's most powerful and influential people.|$|E
25|$|Modernism and {{liberalism}} do {{not constitute}} rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian thought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the Age of Enlightenment. New understandings {{of history and the}} natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in the 1920s.|$|E

She lands on Krazoa Palace, after receiving a distress call from the planet and discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by a wounded EarthWalker in the Palace to help by collecting all of <b>the</b> Krazoa <b>Spirits</b> and returning them to the palace, which would supposedly tilt the war in the dinosaurs' favour and stop Scales. However, after releasing the first one, a mysterious being sends Krystal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit's</b> path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the Krazoa Palace until all <b>the</b> <b>spirits</b> can be returned.|$|R

500|$|On other occasions, though, Phineas's adventures have upset others, {{intentionally}} or otherwise. Most notably Candace {{is constantly}} frustrated in {{her efforts to}} [...] "bust" [...] her brothers throughout the series, and in rare cases Phineas has unwittingly caused misfortune to others. For example, in the episode [...] "Get That Bigfoot Outta My Face," [...] Phineas intentionally gives all the kids at camp a fright when he tricks them into thinking Bigfoot is attacking, though this is mostly getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of spooky story telling.|$|E
500|$|... "Séance Time" [...] draws {{inspiration}} from horror films and [...] "the pretensions of actors"—two themes favoured by the writers. Horror tropes noted by journalists include the Insidious-inspired arrival of [...] "Blue Demon Dwarf" [...] and Madam Talbot's demonic voice, {{reminiscent of a}} similar voice in The Exorcist. For one critic, Pete's initial failure to believe the prank results in a memorable sequence that [...] "was a lovely statement about how old-fashioned horror imagery and well-worn tropes can be terrifying in the right hands, and plain ludicrous if you refuse to enter <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of things".|$|E

50|$|The {{group had}} been, {{throughout}} their career thus far, making multiples and editions, {{each of which}} was a further elaboration of, or in some way tied to an existing General Idea work. For instance, the products discussed in the Test Tube video “commercials” were turned into actual multiples (and by extension, the text of the commercials became <b>the</b> Getting <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirits</b> Cocktail Book, an ersatz cocktail recipe book). In 1980, the group created the Boutique of the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavillion. It functioned as both a display strategy and potential point of sale for General Idea's multiples.|$|R

500|$|In 1929, Wood {{played a}} celebrated {{practical}} joke on musicologists and critics. [...] "I got very {{fed up with}} them, always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.", and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood's later account, {{the press and the}} BBC [...] "fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare [...] for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and asked for." [...] Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. [...] The press treated the deception as a great joke; The Times entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.|$|E

The story ends with Hotaru accepting her pain and moving on with her life.

500|$|Theatre {{historian}} John Bush Jones {{wrote that}} Pinafore has [...] "everything a musical theatregoer could ask for. An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [...] has a score that... {{has plenty of}} tunes for the audience to go away humming". Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that {{the secret of the}} success of the Savoy operas is the way in which [...] "Sullivan entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment." [...] Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on [...] "mirth and silliness". Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl's garment, a pinafore, to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually bore names like Victory, Goliath, Audacious and Minotaur.|$|E

After a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, but at the last Leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. To allay his fears, Ayesha steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> of Life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and Ayesha begins to revert to her true age. Holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the Spirit of Life spews death on occasion. Before their eyes, Ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. The sight is so shocking that Job dies in fright. Before dying, She tells Leo, [...] "Forget me not.

500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. [...] "Probably {{the story of}} Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving {{will always be a}} delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story over again {{in much the same way}} that Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption is very clear to the spectator." ...|$|E

500|$|In fact, the British fleet {{was unable}} to pursue Villaret, having only 11ships still capable of battle to the French 12, and having {{numerous}} dismasted ships and prizes to protect. Retiring and regrouping, the British crews set about making hasty repairs and securing their prizes; seven in total, including the badly damaged Vengeur du Peuple. Vengeur had been holed by cannon firing from Brunswick directly through the ship's bottom, and after her surrender no British ship {{had managed to get}} men aboard. This left Vengeurs few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could—a task made harder when some of her sailors broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> room and became drunk. Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged Alfred and HMS Culloden, as well as the services of the cutter HMS Rattler, saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of Rattler was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded, the dead, and the drunk remained aboard. Several sailors are said to have waved the tricolor from the bow of the ship and cried [...] "Vive la Nation, vive la République!" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I think they just never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E
