25|$|In {{differential}} topology, the jet bundle is {{a certain}} construction that makes a new smooth fiber bundle out of a given smooth fiber bundle. It makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> differential equations on sections of a fiber bundle in an invariant form. Jets may {{also be seen as}} the coordinate free versions of Taylor expansions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} some {{differences}} in programming and MC. It can be costly and difficult to write programs that can run in the environment of a supercomputer, which may have a custom operating system, or require the program to address concurrency issues. If a problem can be adequately parallelized, a “thin” layer of “grid” infrastructure can allow conventional, standalone programs, given {{a different part of}} the same problem, to run on multiple machines. This makes <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> and debug on a single conventional machine and eliminates complications due to multiple instances of the same program running in the same shared memory and storage space at the same time.|$|E

An instance of selenium RC server is needed to launch html test case - which means that the port should be different for each parallel run. However, for Java/PHP test case only one Selenium RC instance needs to be running continuously.|$|E

She has been brought up as an angel, with pure thoughts, with holy hopes, with a belief in all that is good, and high, and noble. I have been surrounded through my whole life by things low, and mean, and ignoble. How could I live with her, or she with me?
