This analysis indicates why discrete kinetic versions of the BGK equation, and notably the lattice Boltzmann method, can provide semi-quantitative results also in the non-hydrodynamic, finite-Knudsen regime, up to Kn (1). This challenges the pessimistic stance, according to which the lattice Boltzmann method should only be used for strictly hydrodynamic purposes. It may also <b>help</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of recent simulations of microflows, which show satisfactory agreement with continuum kinetic theory in the moderate-Knudsen regime. ...|$|R
