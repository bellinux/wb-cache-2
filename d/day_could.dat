5|$|On 22 April 1945, at his {{afternoon}} situation conference, Hitler {{fell into}} a tearful rage (famously dramatized in the 2004 German film Downfall) when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous <b>day,</b> <b>could</b> not be achieved. He declared {{that the war was}} lost, blaming the generals for the defeat and that he would remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the commune of Florence spent more than 60,000 gold florins to {{mitigate}} this effects of this disaster. In order to save their own funds and calm the rage of the riotous poor, all the baker's ovens in the city were requisitioned by the commune and {{a loaf of bread}} weighing 170 g (6oz) was then sold at a meager four pennies. This price was fixed in consideration that poor workers who made only eight to twelve pennies a <b>day</b> <b>could</b> now buy enough bread to survive.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 2011 (76 FR 81133), FMCSA {{published}} a final rule amending its hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The final rule adopted several {{changes to the}} HOS regulations, including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the work day under certain circumstances. Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed {{since the end of}} the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of at least 30 minutes. FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30-minute break, but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of that length or longer to take the break. Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the work <b>day</b> <b>could</b> comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes. The new requirement took effect on July 1, 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the <b>day</b> <b>could</b> accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E
5|$|Bunning's {{perfect game}} {{occurred}} in the 1964 season, during which the Phillies finished {{at the top and}} the Mets finished bottom. Pitcher Jim Bunning, in his first season with the Phillies, entered play on June 21 with a 6–2 record on the season. He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader. Through the first four innings, Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters. In the fifth inning, Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play. A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse Gonder off of the bases. Bunning also made plays at the plate, hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning. By the end of the game, even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning's effort; he had only reached a three-ball count on two batters, and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop-out, and pinch-hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts, to complete the perfect game. Bunning, who at the time had seven children, said that his game, pitched on Father's <b>Day,</b> <b>could</b> not have come at a more appropriate time. He remarked that his slider was his best pitch, just like the no-hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago. Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no-hitter in both leagues, and posted the first regular-season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 (Don Larsen's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series). The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader, 8–2, behind Rick Wise.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (ore dressing by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working <b>day</b> <b>could</b> finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E

25|$|A judge, {{convinced}} by Eaton's attorney, eventually ruled that {{information that was}} obtained through interrogation of Eaton after his arrest, including his reaction to Amber's photographs, {{could not be used}} in court, as police had continued to interrogate him after he requested getting a lawyer, which they did not acknowledge until his third request, on April 5, 2014. However, it was ruled that information obtained by police the next <b>day</b> <b>could</b> still be used.|$|E
25|$|The eight-hour day {{movement}} or 40-hour week movement, {{also known as}} the short-time movement, was a social movement to regulate the length of a working day, preventing excesses and abuses. It was started by James Deb and had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. The use of child labour was common. The working <b>day</b> <b>could</b> range from 10 to 16 hours, and the work week was typically six days a week.|$|E
50|$|Rafts were {{powered by}} oars, or {{occasionally}} sails. Rafts {{had to be}} dismantled and reassembled to get past rapids and obstructions. At Chaudière Falls 20 <b>days</b> <b>could</b> be lost in hauling the timber overland. Timber slides were an idea to solve that problem.|$|R

25|$|The Law on Presidential Elections {{accepted}} {{and put into}} effect on 20 January 2012 decided that presidential elections {{will be held in}} 2014 instead of 2012; within 60 days {{before the end of the}} seven-year term of incumbent President of Turkey Abdullah Gül, who will be the last indirectly elected President of Turkey. As Gül took office on 28 August 2007, the first possible <b>day</b> <b>could</b> be 29 June, but a date between 10 and 17 August is considered more reasonable.|$|E

While mothers in famine conditions can produce milk with highly nutritional content, a malnourished mother may produce milk with decreased levels of several micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. She may also have a lower supply than well-fed mothers.|$|E

Adolf Galland, Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26 or Fighter Wing 26), went through every report, even those of German pilots killed in the action, to {{determine}} Bader's victor. Each case was dismissed. Kosse's claim only matches the victory against No. 452 Squadron RAF's Sergeant Haydon.|$|E
25|$|But, on 18 October, Berlusconi {{announced}} that the election would be held on 9 April 2006, eventually following the suggestions from President Ciampi. Berlusconi also {{announced that}} the next administrative elections (which include the mayoral elections of Rome, Milan and Naples) {{will be held in}} May, the day after Romano Prodi had asked to vote for all elections the same day, in April. Berlusconi stated this was due to his fear that good government by centre-left mayors could favour the centre-left in the general election. Critics say holding all elections in the same <b>day</b> <b>could</b> save millions of euros in public expenditure.|$|E
25|$|All matches {{prior to}} 1988 were {{scheduled}} for three days, normally of a nominal six hours each plus intervals, but {{often with the}} first two days lengthened by up to an hour and the final day shortened, so that teams with fixtures elsewhere on the following <b>day</b> <b>could</b> travel at sensible hours. The exception to this was the 1919 season, when there was an experiment with two-day matches played over longer hours, up to nine o'clock in the evening in mid-summer. This experiment was not repeated. From 1988 to 1992 some matches were played over four days. From 1993 onward, all matches have been scheduled for four days.|$|E
