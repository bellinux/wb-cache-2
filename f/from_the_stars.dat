5|$|Three stars make up {{the long}} narrow {{triangle}} that gives the constellation its name. The brightest member is the white giant star Beta Trianguli of apparent magnitude 3.00, lying 127 light-years distant from Earth. It is actually a spectroscopic binary system; the primary is a white star of spectral type A5IV with 3.5 times the mass of our sun that is beginning to expand and evolve off the main sequence. The secondary is poorly known, but calculated to be a yellow-white F-type main-sequence star around 1.4 solar masses. The two orbit around a common centre of gravity every 31 days, and are surrounded by a ring of dust that extends from 50 to 400AU away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E

25|$|In late 1974 Keays {{embarked}} on his ambitious concept LP, Boy <b>From</b> <b>The</b> <b>Stars,</b> which was premiered {{at the final}} Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1975, where his all-star backing group was joined by Wheatley, recently returned from the UK, in their last performance together for over ten years.

25|$|Several former constellations {{were formed}} from stars now {{included}} in Boötes. Quadrans Muralis, the Quadrant, was a constellation created near Beta Boötis from faint stars. It {{was invented in}} 1795 by Jérôme Lalande, an astronomer who used a quadrant to perform detailed astronometric measurements. Lalande worked with Nicole-Reine Lepaute and others to predict the 1758 return of Halley's Comet. Quadrans Muralis was formed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of eastern Boötes, western Hercules, and Draco. It was originally called Le Mural by Jean Fortin in his 1795 Atlas Céleste; it was not given the name Quadrans Muralis until Johann Bode's 1801 Uranographia. The constellation was quite faint, with its brightest stars reaching the 5th magnitude. Mons Maenalus, representing the Maenalus mountains, was created by Johannes Hevelius in 1687 {{at the foot of}} the constellation's figure. The mountain was named for the son of Lycaon, Maenalus. The mountain, one of Diana's hunting grounds, was also holy to Pan.|$|E
25|$|Walther Ritz's {{emission}} theory (or ballistic theory), {{was also}} consistent {{with the results of}} the experiment, not requiring aether. The theory postulates that light has always the same velocity in respect to the source. However de Sitter noted that emitter theory predicted several optical effects that were not seen in observations of binary stars in which the light from the two stars could be measured in a spectrometer. If emission theory were correct, the light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> should experience unusual fringe shifting due to the velocity of the stars being added to the speed of the light, but no such effect could be seen. It was later shown by J. G. Fox that the original de Sitter experiments were flawed due to extinction, but in 1977 Brecher observed X-rays from binary star systems with similar null results. Also terrestrial tests using particle accelerators have been made that were inconsistent with source dependence of the speed of light. In addition, Emission theory might fail the Ives–Stilwell experiment, but Fox questioned that as well.|$|E
50|$|The planet search {{would have}} used a nulling {{interferometer}} configuration. In this system, phase shifts would be introduced into the three beams, so that light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central <b>star</b> would suffer destructive interference and cancel itself out. However, light from any orbiting planets would not cancel out, as the planets are offset slightly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> position. This would allow planets to be detected, despite the much brighter signal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|R

40|$|Following the {{suggestion}} by Jura and Jacoby (1976), linearly polarized blue continuum starlight scattered by the dust shell around the M 2 Iab star Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse) has been discovered. The polarization has been traced in the NE, NW, SE, and SW directions and has positive (tangential) orientation. Some asymmetry of the optical depth {{in the shell}} exists 15 and 30 arcsec <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> In <b>the</b> NE direction the polarization was measured as far as 90 arcsec (17, 000 AU) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> <b>The</b> dependence of the average intensity of <b>the</b> scattered light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nebula on angular distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is more consistent with an inverse-square density law than with inverse 1. 5 or inverse-cube laws.

500|$|The {{obsolete}} constellations {{introduced in}} Aries (Musca Borealis, Lilium, Vespa, and Apes) {{have all been}} composed of the northern stars. Musca Borealis was created <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> 33 Arietis, 35 Arietis, 39 Arietis, and 41 Arietis. In 1612, Petrus Plancius introduced Apes, a constellation representing a bee. In 1624, the same stars were used by Jakob Bartsch to create a constellation called Vespa, representing a wasp. In 1679 Augustin Royer used these stars for his constellation Lilium, representing the fleur-de-lis. None of these constellation became widely accepted. Johann Hevelius renamed the constellation [...] "Musca" [...] in 1690 in his Firmamentum Sobiescianum.

In the middle of July, he sat down in his attic for multiple nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> shining in the night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb [...] "longing for the stars, longing for the moon", ( [...] , pàn xīngxīng pàn yuèliàng) which shows yearning. He viewed the CPC as the great saviour ( [...] , dà jiùxīng [...] "great saving star") of the Chinese people, being represented by a larger star. The idea for four small stars came from On the People's Democratic Dictatorship a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes, also referred to in Asian cultures as the four occupations (...) shi, nong, gong, shang ("the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie").

500|$|The {{characters}} and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail rated their performances highly: [...] "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges {{are those of}} an odd assortment of grumpy, middle-aged men bickering about office politics. They are a relief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> and a delight." [...] Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; [...] "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. [...] "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors {{did not have much}} to do in the effects-driven film, and were [...] "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. Gene Siskel felt the film [...] "teeter towards being a crashing bore" [...] whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film. [...] " [...] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.|$|E
500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's {{about as good as}} could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is going to react — <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E
