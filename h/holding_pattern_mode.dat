For inclusion of <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> we change the header information for MB type, pattern identification code, and shape of patterns. Inclusion of <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> also demands modification of the Lagrangian multiplier as the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> is biased to bits rather than distortion.|$|R

30|$|Obviously, {{making the}} MSE ratio towards 1 (i.e., the MSE for the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> {{is the same}} as that of other modes) by finer {{quantization}} and keeping the bit requirement at its lowest level by multiplying with β for the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> would be the desirable case to improve overall rate-distortion performance. Figure  4 shows (solid lines) bits and MSE ratios between different conventional modes (i.e., 16 [*]×[*] 16, 16 [*]×[*] 8, 8 [*]×[*] 16, and 8 [*]×[*] 8) and the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> against different QPs after adjustment (QPpvcmode[*]=[*]QPothermode[*]−[*] 2 and β[*]=[*] 1.5) of the bits and MSE. It shows that, on average, 2.37 (instead of 2.76 before adjustment) times of bits is required by the conventional modes and, on average, 0.95 (instead of 0.89 before adjustment) for the MSE ratio is generated by the other modes compared to the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode.</b> Note that this adjustment makes sure that for a given QP, the PSNR of the PVC is comparable with the H. 264, although the corresponding bit rate of the PVC is much lower compared to that of the H. 264, so that the PVC exhibits better overall rate-distortion performance compared to the H. 264. To make the coding performance uniform for a wide range of bit rates and low to high motion video sequences, we have adjusted the bits and distortion for the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> based on the experimental results.|$|R

30|$|We also {{investigate}} into Lagrangian multiplier after embedding new <b>pattern</b> <b>modes</b> in the H. 264 coder. It {{is already}} mentioned earlier {{that a new}} <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> yields less bits and sometimes higher distortion compared to the standard H. 264 modes. To be fair with the other modes, the value of multiplier is reduced to λ = 0.4 × 2 (QP- 12)/ 3. The experimental results of Lagrangian multiplier and rate-distortion performance have justified the new valuation. As the <b>pattern</b> <b>modes</b> require fewer bits compared to the 16 × 16 mode, the reduced λ signifies less importance in bits {{as compared to the}} distortion in the minimization of Lagrangian cost function. We have also observed that for a given λ, the generated QP is slightly large for relatively high motion compared to the smooth motion video sequences.|$|R
5000|$|Hold {{in lieu of}} {{procedure}} turn: It is established over a final or intermediate fix when an approach {{can be made from}} a properly aligned <b>holding</b> <b>pattern.</b> It is a required maneuver, as is a PT, unless the aircraft is being radar vectored to the final approach course, when 'NoPT' is shown on the approach chart, or when the pilot requests or the controller advises the pilot to make a 'straight-in' approach. This maneuver is commonly referred to as the racetrack pattern. It is another method of course reversal, {{but it can also be}} used for losing altitude within protected airspace. A <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> used for this purpose is depicted in U.S. government publications as the [...] "hold-in-lieu-of-PT" [...] <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> symbol.

40|$|Conflict Alerts for {{aircraft}} in <b>holding</b> <b>patterns</b> are often missed or in error due to fact that holding trajectories are not modeled in Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe logic. In addition, a controller in one sector {{may not know}} when aircraft are holding in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in <b>holding</b> <b>patterns.</b> A <b>holding</b> function for conflict probe applications has been developed and tested with air traffic data from Fort Worth Center. The holding function automatically determines when an aircraft enters a <b>holding</b> <b>pattern,</b> builds a <b>holding</b> region around the pattern and then probes the region for conflict with other traffic. The operational concept of use assumes that air traffic controllers are very busy during periods when aircraft are in holding and therefore don't have time to manually enter information which defines a <b>holding</b> <b>pattern</b> and activates conflict probing. For this reason, it is important the holding function automatically detect aircraft in holding and compute a holding region for conflict analysis. The controller is then alerted if other aircraft are predicted to fly through the holding region at the holding altitude...|$|R

30|$|In the {{proposed}} method, we have added a <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> and kept all other H. 264 modes including 4 [*]×[*] 4, 4 [*]×[*] 8, and 8 [*]×[*] 4. Thus, if the 8 [*]×[*] 8 block mode is selected, then 8 [*]×[*] 8 blocks are further decomposed into smaller modes, {{but we do}} not use any smaller size <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> (e.g., 16 -pixel patterns) in the decomposition for {{the proposed}} scheme. The pattern size is 64; thus, if we let parts (i.e., 64 pixels) of the 16 [*]×[*] 16 block to be inter-predicted and the others are skipped, the setting can be used to approximate any of the patterns. The main difference is that in the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode,</b> a 16 [*]×[*] 16  MB (i.e., 256 -pixel block) is represented by a smaller block, i.e., one of the 64 -pixel patterns; on the other hand, H. 264 treats the MB as a 256 -pixel block by signaling zero motion vector and zero residual errors for the skipped areas. In the PVC scheme, we need to send some bits for the pattern index; on the other hand, the H. 264 needs to send some bits to signal the zero motion vectors and zero residual errors for the skipped areas. The experimental results reveal that ultimately the <b>pattern</b> <b>mode</b> is the winner for significant times through Lagrangian optimization.|$|R
