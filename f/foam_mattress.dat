5000|$|Memory foam is {{affected}} by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a memory <b>foam</b> <b>mattress</b> will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom.

Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using [...] "faster response" [...] memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally [...] "sleep warmer" [...] than innerspring mattresses.

5000|$|In Australia, {{the term}} swag is still widely {{used to refer}} to a tent or other {{portable}} shelter used for camping or outdoor sleeping. [...] A modern swag is a waterproof canvas sleeping compartment that is sometimes insect-proof.

When rolled up the swag is relatively lightweight and compact, making it ideal for storage and transport. It is typically easy to erect, and roll up can be done quickly. Swags are still heavily used in Australia, by overlanders. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design swags. The modern swag is designed for robustness and is marketed towards those travelling by vehicle [...] - [...] they are too heavy and bulky to be transported long distances on foot. Bushwalkers and hikers would use conventional lightweight tents and sleeping bags. More recently, several camping supply firms have produced readymade bedrolls along the pattern of the original swag, and refer to these as [...] "swags".|$|E
5000|$|On 6 March 1975, police {{started a}} second {{thorough}} search of Bathpool Park, {{starting with the}} glory-hole, within which a detective constable found a Dymotape machine and a roll of Dymotape. An inspection of the second shaft revealed nothing. The third shaft, the deepest of the three and once an air ventilation shaft for Nelson's Coal Mine, was then uncapped. As it was subject to HM Inspectorate of Mines regulations {{it had to be}} checked for gas, and so late in the day the investigation was suspended. On Friday, 7 March 1975, after gas tests had been passed, police officers and mine rescue staff entered the third shaft. Accessed by a vertical ladder, 22 ft down on the first landing, a broken police torch was found from the previous day's work. A further 45 ft down on a second landing, a cassette tape recorder was found. A further 54 ft down on a third landing, the team found a rolled up sleeping bag that was acting as a pillow, a yellow <b>foam</b> <b>mattress</b> and a survival blanket.

5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the bedroll consisted of a thoroughly waterproofed white canvas tarpaulin made of Number Eight ducking weighing, most often, 18 oz. per square yard (i.e., 9 sq. ft.), and measuring either 6x14ft. or 7x18. (The reprinted 1897 Sears Roebuck Catalog lists [...] "stockmen’s bed sheets" [...] of [...] "heavy white duck," [...] with snap rings or eyelets, as 13-18 oz. for either size, but Fay Ward states that of the various weights of tarp (16-, 18-, 20-, and 22-ounce), the preferable one was [...] "the 18-ounce type… a good water excluder, is not too heavy to manage and will stand a lot of rough handling.") The tarpaulin cover was made {{with a series of}} snaps and rings down either side so it could be folded over and snapped shut. Inside were two to four almost-square heavy quilts called [...] "sougans," [...] folded double, made of heavy wool or cotton batting quilted between patches of pants, coats, and overcoats, or sometimes of patches alone, weighing about 4 lb. each, and generally used as a pad. The sougans in turn enwrapped a blanket or two (woolen ones weighed 4-6 lb. per; Navajo and Mexican Chimayo ones, which were both warm and waterproof, were highly desirable), a lightweight double blanket sheet 35" [...] wide (about 1 lb. for 3.75 yd.), and sometimes, sandwiched between them as a mattress, a thin, feather-filled comfort (probable weight about 5 lb.) known in cowboy vernacular as a [...] "henskin." [...] (The modern cowboy uses a 4"-thick twin-size <b>foam</b> <b>mattress,</b> but this is the only significant change that has taken place in over a century.) The tarpaulin cost roughly $7.70-$11.60, depending on its weight; the sougans, about 28-30c. for two 3x7' rolls of cotton batting (the patches being more or less free); the blankets $1.10-$9.96 each; the sheeting 34-53c., and the henskin, if applicable, 96c.-$2.25, so the entire roll could be assembled for anywhere between $9.42 and $34.60. At the very core was the [...] "war bag," [...] generally an old gunny sack that had at one time held grain, feed, or even sugar, though some were of canvas, cotton, or oilskin. Earlier rolls (and those of riders traveling light, such as outlaws on the run) were wrapped in a canvas groundcloth, an oilskin cover, cowhide blanket, rubber blanket, or India-rubber [...] "sleeping spread," [...] and consisted of a blanket or two and perhaps a quilt, or even a couple of buffalo robes.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a new chest compression depth (CCD) measuring technology using radar and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) sensor. This study was performed to determine its accuracy on a soft surface. Four trials, trial 1 : chest compressions on the floor using an accelerometer device; trial 2 : chest compressions on the floor using an IR-UWB sensor; trial 3 : chest compressions on a <b>foam</b> <b>mattress</b> using an accelerometer device; trial 4 : chest compressions on a <b>foam</b> <b>mattress</b> using an IR-UWB sensor, were performed in a random order. In all the trials, a cardiopulmonary resuscitation provider delivered 50 uninterrupted chest compressions to a manikin. The CCD measured by the manikin and the device were as follows: 57. 42 ± 2. 23 and 53. 92 ± 2. 92 mm, respectively in trial 1 (p < 0. 001); 56. 29 ± 1. 96 and 54. 16 ± 3. 90 mm, respectively in trial 2 (p < 0. 001); 55. 61 ± 1. 57 and 103. 48 ± 10. 48 mm, respectively in trial 3 (p < 0. 001); 57. 14 ± 3. 99 and 55. 51 ± 3. 39 mm, respectively in trial 4 (p = 0. 012). The gaps between the CCD measured by the manikin and the devices (accelerometer device vs. IR-UWB sensor) on the floor were not different (3. 50 ± 2. 08 mm vs. 3. 15 ± 2. 27 mm, respectively, p = 0. 136). However, the gaps were significantly different on the <b>foam</b> <b>mattress</b> (48. 53 ± 5. 65 mm vs. 4. 10 ± 2. 47 mm, p < 0. 001).

30|$|There {{are very}} few data on the {{relationship}} between IAP and PDRICG. So far, Michelet et al. studied this subject prospectively in detail [13]. In 20 ARDS patients, they looked at the influence of prone positioning on IAP, PDRICG, and extravascular lung water compared to the supine position, lying on a conventional <b>foam</b> <b>mattress</b> vs. an air-cushioned mattress. They observed an increase in IAP and a decrease in PDRICG in the prone compared with the supine position on a conventional <b>foam</b> <b>mattress.</b> The effect of proning on IAP was the topic of a recent review [19]. The use of an air-cushioned mattress had beneficial effects on IAP and PDRICG during the prone position. Analyzing our data, we found that PDRICG correlated significantly with IAP and even more so with APP. Similar to the data of Michelet et al. [13], changes in IAP were associated with significant concomitant but opposite changes in PDRICG, suggesting that an increase in IAP may compromise hepatosplanchnic perfusion. Hering et al., however, did not observe a decrease in PDRICG when patients were proned despite the small increase in IAP from 10 to 13 mmHg [15].|$|E
