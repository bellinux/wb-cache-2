The band's first full-length album was Confusion <b>is</b> <b>Sex,</b> released in 1983. Kill Yr Idols was released the same year, under the German label Zensor Records. Bad Moon Rising was released {{two years later}} on Blast First, a label created specifically for Sonic Youth releases. In 1986 Sonic Youth signed to SST Records and released EVOL later the same year. The album gained the band increasing critical acclaim and exposure, and the group released Sister and the double LP Daydream Nation in 1987 and 1988 respectively, the latter on Enigma Records.|$|E
5|$|The {{month of}} August (Latin: Augustus) {{is named after}} Augustus; until his time it was called Sextilis (named so {{because it had been}} the sixth month of the {{original}} Roman calendar and the Latin word for six <b>is</b> <b>sex).</b> Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see Julian calendar). According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the EEOC and some federal courts began holding that sexual {{harassment}} is also prohibited under the Act. In 1986, the Supreme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, , that sexual harassment <b>is</b> <b>sex</b> discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII. Same-sex sexual harassment has also been held in a unanimous decision written by Justice Scalia to be prohibited by Title VII (Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., , 118 S.Ct. 998).|$|E

25|$|In {{a similar}} way to Buddhism, Taoist schools sought {{throughout}} history to define what would be sexual misconduct. The precept against Sexual Misconduct <b>is</b> <b>sex</b> outside your marriage. The married spouses (夫婦) usually in Chinese suggest male with female, though the scripture itself does not explicitly say anything against same-gender relations. Many sorts of precepts mentioned in the Seven Slips of Cloudy Satchel (雲笈七籤), The Mini Daoist Canon, does not explicitly say anything against same-gender relations as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{his third}} book, Why <b>is</b> <b>Sex</b> Fun?, also {{published}} in 1997, Diamond discusses evolutionary factors underlying features {{of human sexuality}} that are generally taken for granted but that are highly unusual among our animal relatives. Those features include a long-term pair relationship (marriage), coexistence of economically cooperating pairs within a shared communal territory, provision of parental care by fathers {{as well as by}} mothers, having sex in private rather than in public, concealed ovulation, female sexual receptivity encompassing most of the menstrual cycle (including days of infertility), female but not male menopause, and distinctive secondary sexual characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about <b>is</b> <b>sex...</b> I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am going to put in every image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth. The thing lays its eggs down your throat, the whole number.|$|E

500|$|In the album's liner notes, Gaye {{explained}} {{his views on}} the themes of sex and love, stating [...] "I can't {{see anything wrong with}} sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX <b>IS</b> <b>SEX</b> and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially {{in the area of the}} psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky." ...|$|E
500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where we were at the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel like what we needed to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion <b>Is</b> <b>Sex</b> producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E
500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{was written}} as a {{critique}} of mainstream societal treatment of romantic love and heartbreak society. [...] "A wife’s just a whore with a diamond ring", Ndegéocello's sang. She drew inspiration from matchmaking reality television shows that presented love as a [...] "really clear exchange". [...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can you buy me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can really talk about <b>is</b> <b>sex</b> and if the woman can cook. And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame. That's why the lyric is 'you do anything.' Some people do anything for their big dreams of sunshine." ...|$|E

The Daily Beast said that [...] "the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] Sex is convincing only when it's playful, as when she appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she's simply undressed {{with no place to}} go". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post gave the book a mixed review by saying: [...] "Is Sex shocking? not really. Mostly because it's Madonna, and somehow we've come to expect this from her. <b>Is</b> <b>Sex</b> boring? surprisingly, yes". During her review of the book, British author Zoë Heller from The Independent wrote that it was [...] "the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation" [...] and that [...] "previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, 'empowering' way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she has gone too far." [...] Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for The New Yorker, wrote that [...] "unfortunately, the book is going to be mistaken for pornography". Vanity Fair deemed it [...] "the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published". Caryn James from The New York Times was negative in her review stating that [...] "There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)". Vicki Goldberg from the same newspaper was also dismissive of the photography of the book saying that [...] "Unfortunately, not many of the images are very good photographically. Many are just pictures, or just porn". Writing for Spin magazine, Bob Guccione, Jr. gave the book a particularly unfavorable review: ...|$|E
