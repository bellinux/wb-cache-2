Therefore, this research {{was carried out in}} order to analyze and determine the most optimum condition for water in oil emulsion stability. In liquid membrane technology, the stable emulsion must be <b>demulsified</b> to separate the receiving phase in the final process. Several parameters for emulsion stability were studied such as emulsification speed, emulsification time, concentration of surfactant and viscosity and type of diluents. The demulsification process of W/O emulsion using electrical field also investigated. The emulsion consists of kerosene as organic phase, sulphuric acid as internal phase and sorbitan monoolete (SPAN 80) as a surfactant. Effects of various parameters such as concentration of surfactant and stripping phase, voltage and frequency of electrical field and homogeniser speed on demulsification process of W/O emulsion were studied. The demulsification of emulsion were measured based on percentage of emulsion breakage. The results showed that increasing surfactant concentration will produce a stable emulsion that hard to be <b>demulsified.</b> Meanwhile, increasing stripping phase concentration and homogeniser speed, it will tend to destabilise the emulsion.

Furthermore, surfactants need to be added to help the dispersion of wax into the water phase. To be effective, the surfactant needs to be in contact with melted paraffin, otherwise the mixture of water and surfactant will produce very large water-wet particles of wax.

40|$|This Article {{reports on}} the {{influence}} of light irradiation on the stability of emulsions prepared using a photoresponsive gemini surfactant (C 7 -azo-C 7) having an azobenzene skeleton as a spacer. When mixtures of trans C 7 -azo-C 7 aqueous solution and n-octane are homogenized, stable emulsions are obtained in a specific region of weight fraction and surfactant concentration. Fluorescence microscopy observations using a small amount of fluorescent probes show that the stable emulsions are oil-in-water (O/W) -type. UV irradiation of stable O/W emulsions promotes the cis isomerization of trans C 7 -azo-C 7 and leads to the coalescence of the oil (octane) droplets in the emulsions, that is, demulsification. While the equilibrated interfacial tension (IFT) between aqueous trans C 7 -azo-C 7 solution and octane is almost the same as that between aqueous cis C 7 -azo-C 7 and octane, the occupied area per molecule for C 7 -azo-C 7 at octane/water interface decreases with the cis photoisomerization of trans isomer. Dynamic IFT measurement shows that UV irradiation to the interface between aqueous trans C 7 -azo-C 7 solution and octane brings about an increase in the interfacial tension, indicating that the Gibbs free energy at the interface increases. From these results, the cis isomerization of trans C 7 -azo-C 7 molecules at the O/W interface due to UV irradiation leads to direct contact between the water and octane phases, because of the reduction of molecular area at the interface, and subsequently makes the emulsions <b>demulsified.</b> © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Water in oil {{emulsion}} {{occurs at}} many {{stages in the}} production and treatment of crude oil. About two third of petroleum production of every oil field exists {{in the form of}} water in oil emulsion. The emulsion stability results from the presence of interfacial barrier preventing coalescence of the dispersed water droplets. This is due to the present of polar components such as asphaltenes, resins, wax and naphtenic acids in the crude oil. Therefore before transporting or refining the oil, it is essential to separate the water for economic and operational reasons. Minimizing the water level in the oil reduces pipeline corrosion and maximizes pipeline usage. The most effective method to overcome the problem is to <b>demulsify</b> the crude by using demulsifiers. The demulsifiers will destabilize the interfacial film between the droplets. It has been reported that the combination of oil-soluble demulsifiers and water-soluble demulsifiers produced great result in water separation. From the screening process of single oil-soluble demulsifiers, the most effective chemicals as demulsifier are TOMAC, hexylamine and dioctylamine while methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid are the most effective chemicals in water-soluble group. The new formulation of demulsifier was formulated by using Statistical Analysis System software. From this analysis, the optimum concentration needed for TOMAC, hexylamine, dioctylamine, methyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate and acrylic acid are 48. 7 ppm, 0 ppm, 8 ppm, 48. 2 ppm, 26. 5 ppm and 29. 9 ppm, respectively. The combination of these chemicals resulted 53. 7 % to 60. 4 % water separation from the emulsion system. It was found that this formulation is better than other commercial demulsifier formulation. This new formulation was found to be effective for demulsification of water-in-oil emulsion of Tabu, Seligi, Guntong, Semangkok, Irong Barat and Tapis fields and single emulsion system.

30|$|It {{is known}} that {{interfacial}} tension is decreased due to the adsorption of surfactants at the interface of liquids with the polar end in water and the hydrocarbon chain in the oil. Thus, the lower the interfacial tension, the better the oil mobility and, consequently, the better its efficiency in the destabilization process of oily emulsions (Santos et al. 2016). All biosurfactants presented similar interfacial tensions from a statistical point of view, with a slight highlight for the biosurfactants from C. sphaerica, C. lipolytica (a) and P. aeruginosa, which presented values below 13  mN/m. Since the demulsification percentages varied between the biosurfactants, the interfacial tension values {{do not appear to}} contribute to the <b>demulsifying</b> capability and therefore may not be a key factor for the ability of the biosurfactants to act as demulsifiers.|$|E

40|$|Emulsions are {{commonly}} used in metal processing productions as emulsified coolant and lubricating oil. These emulsions will be discharged off as emulsion waste after losing their efficiency. These wastes have to be treated to satisfy the standard limits before being discharged to waterways to prevent pollutions. This work targets to develop an emulsified wastewater treatment system using effective bio-coagulant and low cost agricultural waste as bio-adsorbent. Chitosan and rubber seed shell activated carbon (RSSAC) as bio-coagulant and bio-adsorbent respectively will be employed in this work. Samples of emulsified wastewater were collected and analysis was done. Activation of chitosan powder was prepared by diluting it with acetic acid and distilled water. The fresh rubber seed was cracked to get the shell which was then washed, sun-dried, pulverised and sieved and impregnated with NaOH before carbonization to produce RSSAC. Carbonization was able to increase the SBET up to 20 folds. Results show the highest reading of SBET (19. 2403 m 2 /g) at 650 oC compared to SBET (0. 9482 m 2 /g) before carbonization. Carbonization is able to remove volatile compounds and promotes formation of new pores. However, the SBET dropped at high temperature 850 oC because of surface erosion and rupture of some porous wall which causes lower porosity formation. Jar test method was used with chitosan as coagulant at primary treatment followed by RSSAC as adsorbent at secondary treatment. Effects on removal of oil & grease (O&G), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and pH value were studied in this paper by varying the contact time and dosage. The combined system able to reduce 90 % of O&G compared to chitosan alone which only able to reduce up to 76 %.

The exfoliation process is attributed to the conformational stretching of the intercalants in the silicate layers. (2) 	Random silicate platelets in the water phase from the extraction process: By adding aqueous NaOH to emulsion (toluene/water mixing), leading to pH increase. Simultaneously, the original emulsion of the POP/silicate hybrid in toluene/water was <b>demulsified</b> in two separate phases. The toluene organic phase dissolved the polyamine exfoliating agents and the silicates in the water phase. The random silicate platelets in water phase had 95 wt % purity. (3) 	Self-assembly of silicate platelets piling into fibrous arrays: Individual platelets possessing high-aspect-ratio dimension and ionic character enable to self-assemble into micro-scale fiber bundles after water evaporation. The self-stacking mechanism indicated strong face-to-face ionic charge stacking propensity in triggering a vertical growth, in an average 5 μm length. Under a TEM electron beam bombardment, the fibrous materials of stacked platelets were further transformed into a tube-like arrangement. (4) 	Manipulating the assemblages of silicate platelets and fatty amine salts to form a Lotus effect surface: Superhydrophobic surface, exhibiting a high water-droplet contact angle of 157 o and a rough surface by SEM, has been generated from a self-assembly of high-aspect-ratio silicate platelets associated with detergent-ranged alkyl amine salts. Anionic silicate platelets in an averaged dimension of 100 × 100 × 1 nm 3 enable to self-align into a rough plateau surface. The alkyl amine salts tethered to the platelet surface provide a flexible hydrophobic surface exhibiting the Lotus effect.

The simple, low-cost, and material-unrestricted method provides an efficient way to separate oil/water mixtures of various kinds and has great potential in energy conservation and environmental protection...|$|E
30|$|The biosurfactants {{tested in}} this work were also able to act as demulsifiers of model emulsions. Coutinho et al. (2013) found that the cells and {{metabolites}} produced by P. aeruginosa have <b>demulsifying</b> characteristics for W/O and O/W emulsions, with a demulsification rate higher than 78 %, showing {{the potential of the}} bacteria to be applied in the treatment of effluents and in industrial applications such as oil processing and tank cleaning. Studies conducted by Wen et al. (2010) using biomass from some microorganisms showed that {{the increase in the number}} of cells in the emulsions also increased the demulsification activities. Another way of improving the efficiency of emulsion destabilization is described by Long et al. (2013), who found that the increase in pH positively influenced the demulsification of W/O emulsions, a result similar to that obtained in crude oil emulsions. In contrast, pH reduction showed positive results for O/W type emulsions. The rhamnolipid showed over 90 % of demulsification efficiency on refractory waste crude oil which was confirmed on model emulsions.|$|E
30|$|ILs {{were used}} in {{petroleum}} industry to upgrade heavy and extra heavy crude oil by cracking asphaltene chains (Fan et al. 2007, 2009. They are also used to inhibit paraffin and asphaltene aggregation and precipitations in addition to desalting and <b>demulsifying</b> of water in oil emulsions in refining process (Lemos et al. 2010). The role of ILs in inhibiting asphaltene precipitation in simulated CO 2 flooding was investigated (Hu et al. 2004). Minor asphaltene precipitation and deposition were reported {{in the presence of}} IL preventing pore plugging problems during flooding process. ILs can replace organic surfactant in breaking water/oil emulsions in oil refining process (Lucero et al. 2010). The self-organization, micelle formation and surface properties of ILs (Hernández et al. 2011, 2009) as well as their ability to dehydrate crude oil have been recently reported (Painter et al. 2010). Lately, the efficiency of ILs in extracting heavy oil from tar sands was evaluated (Painter et al. 2009; Hezave et al. 2013 a). Recovery efficiency of 90  % was reported with five times ILs recyclability with no efficiency loss.|$|E
40|$|Oil {{produced}} in most oil fields {{is accompanied by}} water {{in the form of}} an emulsion that must be treated. In addition, this water normally contains dissolved salts, principally chlorides of sodium, calcium, and magnesium. If crude oil is left untreated, when it is processed in a refinery the salt can cause various operating problems. This paper investigates experimentally the effect of five factors (gravity settling, chemical treatment, freshwater injection, heating, and mixing) on the efficiency of the dehydration=desalting process for a Kuwaiti crude oil and a commercial demulsifier (Servo CC 3408). These factors are systematically varied and efficiency is analyzed. Two efficiencies are defined: a Salt Removal (S=R) efficiency and a Water Cut (W=C) dehydration efficiency. The investigation was carried out through changes made to a single factor at a time as well as multiple variations of factors. Plots, based on experimental data, showing the variation of the two efficiencies as a function of the various factors are given. Two main conclusions are drawn for the system studied. First, excessive amounts of a <b>demulsifying</b> agent ha...|$|E
