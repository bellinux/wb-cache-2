25|$|In 1914 Karalli also {{embarked}} on a successful acting career, {{and became one of}} Russia's first celebrated film actresses. Her first role was in the 1914 Pyotr Chardynin directed drama Ty pomnish' li? (English title: <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Remember?)</b> opposite the successful actor Ivan Mozzhukhin. From 1914 to 1919, Vera Karalli would appear in approximately sixteen Russian silent films, including the 1915 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace titled Voyna i mir. Her last film appearance was in a German dramatic release entitled Die Reiche einer Frau in 1921. Often chosen as a leading lady by the notable director Yevgeni Bauer, Karalli is possibly best recalled for her performances in the Bauer directed adaptations of novelist Ivan Turgenev's Posle smerti (English: After Death) in 1915 and her role as Gizella in the 1917 melodrama Umirayushchii Lebed (The Dying Swan).|$|E

500|$|In 1992, Yamada Kazuhiro {{published}} {{the first full}} biography about Abebe, written in Japanese and published in Tokyo; it was entitled <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> Abebe? (...) [...] Since then, there {{have been at least}} three biographical works based on his life. Among these is Triumph and Tragedy, written in English by his daughter Tsige Abebe and published in Addis Ababa in 1996. The other two, also written in English, are Paul Rambali's 2007 fictional biographical novel Barefoot Runner and Tim Judah's 2009 Bikila: Ethiopia's Barefoot Olympian. According to the journalist Tim Lewis's comparative review of the two books, Judah's is a more journalistic, less-forgiving biography of Abebe. It refutes the mythical aspects of his life but recognises Abebe's athletic accomplishments. Judah's account of Abebe's life differs significantly from Rambali's, but confirms (and frequently cites) Tsige's biography. For example, Lewis cites the discrepancy in the circumstances surrounding Abebe's car accident: ...|$|E

Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> what you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

500|$|Robey {{took part}} in the Festival of Variety for the BBC in 1951, which paid tribute to the British music hall. For his performance, he adopted an ad-lib style rather than use a script. His wife sat {{at the side of the}} stage, ready to provide support should he need it. According to Wilson, Robey's turn earned the loudest applause of the evening. The {{following}} month Robey undertook a long provincial tour in the variety show <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Remember?</b> under the management of Bernard Delfont. After an evening's performance in Sheffield, he was asked by a local newspaper reporter if he considered retiring. The comedian quipped: [...] "Me retire? Good gracious, I'm too old for that.

In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'. It's got one of my favourite lines that I've ever written in a song." [...] On 15 October 2012, Louis Tomlinson confirmed via social networking website Twitter that [...] "Little Things" [...] would serve as the second single of their second studio album Take Me Home.|$|E

500|$|... "Peterotica" [...] {{was written}} by Patrick Meighan and {{directed}} by Kurt Dumas. The episode ran into multiple objections from broadcasting standards and the show's producers. For instance, the original title of the episode was [...] "A Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Butt", but broadcasting standards objected. A sequence showing all of the different erotic novels written by Peter was edited for the television version; one entitled Catcher in the Eye {{was removed from the}} television version as broadcasting standards disliked the cover, which implied her eye was a target for semen during ejaculation. The scene of Peter reading his new erotic novel to Lois was never cut from airing, although the producers of Family Guy had some trouble with it, as it is the second semen joke of the episode. When Lois' father, Carter, sits down at the breakfast table, Lois states: [...] "Daddy, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> to clean up?" [...] Originally, she was meant to say, [...] "Daddy, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> to wipe yourself?", but broadcasting standards objected, so it was modified to [...] "Daddy, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> to clean yourself?"

The BBC Television Service officially began regular broadcasts on 2 November 1936 from a converted wing of the Alexandra Palace in London. [...] On 1 September 1939, two days before Britain declared war on Germany, the station was taken off air with little warning, {{with one of the}} last programmes to be shown before the suspension of the service being a Mickey Mouse cartoon; the government was concerned that the VHF transmissions would act as a beacon to enemy aircraft homing in on London. [...] BBC Television returned on 7 June 1946 at 15:00. Jasmine Bligh, one of the original announcers, made the first announcement, saying, [...] "Good afternoon everybody. How are you? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> me, Jasmine Bligh?". The Mickey Mouse cartoon of 1939 was repeated twenty minutes later.|$|E

2500|$|The first British {{television}} broadcast {{was made by}} Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided {{a limited amount of}} programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from Buffalo, New York. On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935. On November 2, 1936 the BBC began broadcasting a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's 405-line standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from Alexandra Palace in London, making the BBC Television Service (now BBC One) the UK's first regular high-definition television service. The government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and test signals were broadcast, so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London. It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 {{after the end of the}} war, began with a live programme that opened with the line [...] "Good afternoon everybody. How are you? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> me, Jasmine Bligh?" [...] and was followed by the same Mickey Mouse cartoon broadcast on the last day before the war. At the end of 1947 there were 54,000 licensed television receivers, compared with 44,000 television sets in the United States at that time.|$|E
