It is difficult <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> any <b>programme</b> when walking through the Vosges, the temptation {{on a hot day}} to stop and eat fruit generally being too strong for resistance. Raspberries, the most delicious I have ever tasted, wild strawberries, currants, and gooseberries, grow upon the hill-sides as black-berries by English lanes. The Vosges small boy is not called upon to rob an orchard; he can make himself ill without sin. Orchards exist in the Vosges mountains in plenty; but to trespass into one for the purpose of stealing fruit would be as foolish as for a fish to try and get into a swimming bath without paying. Still, of course, mistakes do occur.|$|R

And when a new hospital is briefed, everyone tries to do their best, but the process is mired by the impossibility of the task. Stakeholders rarely understand the architectural process, nobody can predict the future, and the only thing for certain is that everything will change as the project unfolds, revealing errors in initial assumptions and calculations, shifts in needs, new technologies etc. Yet there’s always pressure <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>to</b> the <b>programme</b> and <b>to</b> press on regardless. This chaos leads eventually to suboptimal results: hospitals the world over are riddled with inefficiencies, idiosyncrasies, incredible wastage and features that lead to poor clinical outcomes.

It will discuss what healthcare designers can learn from the geeks in Silicon Valley reduce risk, meet deadlines and deliver the highest possible value for the budget despite the uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|How to make {{innovations}} in education at an Institute of Higher Education with a target audience from 60 different countries {{and as many}} different educational backgrounds? This paper discusses the educational innovations at UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education in Delft, The Netherlands. This UN institute, located in The Netherlands, offers Master and PhD <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> mainly people from developing countries and countries in transition. Because of its UN-status and its special target group it is different from regular universities. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> abreast of new technologies and educational developments, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its <b>programmes</b> attractive for prospective students, the institute has initiated a complex process of educational innovations. More flexible learning routes for the students, more joint programmes with other universities in the world, a more learner centred approach and more elearning are key elements of these innovations. The reasons why and the methods of, are discussed and described {{from the point of}} view of the students, the lecturing staff, and from an institutional perspective...|$|R

25|$|By 1986, the {{programme}}'s cost {{had reached}} £180million. When the EAP programme had started, {{the cost was}} supposed to be equally shared by government and industry, but the West German and Italian governments wavered on the agreement and the three main industrial partners had to provide £100million <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the <b>programme</b> from ending. In April 1986, the BAe EAP was rolled out at BAe Warton, by this time also partially funded by MBB, BAe and Aeritalia. The EAP first flew on 6 August 1986. The Eurofighter bears a strong resemblance to the EAP. Design work continued {{over the next five years}} using data from the EAP. Initial requirements were: UK: 250 aircraft, Germany: 250, Italy: 165 and Spain: 100. The share of the production work was divided among the countries in proportion to their projected procurement – DASA (33%), British Aerospace (33%), Aeritalia (21%), and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) (13%).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In today's rapidly {{evolving}} society, {{the range}} and depth of information available to us is quickly growing which affects educational institutions, who find it difficult <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their <b>programmes</b> up <b>to</b> date, whilst students struggle {{to find the right}} information. The paradigm of learning objects is an emerging technology aimed towards facilitating the managements of the massive amount of (educational) resources available. Enabling users relying on this paradigm to use concise and high quality pieces of knowledge within different contexts represents a key challenge. Therefore, when designing learning objects, reusability must be a key consideration. Bearing this in mind, the current lack of metrics to help measure quality and reusability represents a major issue. Specific metrics for learning objects will eventually appear, probably based on extended and improved metadata. In the meantime, there remains the need to measure the potential reusability of the existing base of learning objects. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by analysing and developing adapted metrics for learning objects, based on existing metrics used in other disciplines such as software engineering. ...|$|R
