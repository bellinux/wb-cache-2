25|$|Transmutation {{was banned}} in the US in April 1977 by President Carter due to the danger of {{plutonium}} proliferation, but President Reagan rescinded the ban in 1981. Due to the economic losses and risks, construction of reprocessing plants during this time did not resume. Due to high energy demand, work on the method has continued in the EU. This {{has resulted in a}} practical nuclear research reactor called Myrrha in which transmutation is possible. Additionally, a new research program called ACTINET has been started in the EU to make transmutation possible on a large, industrial scale. According to President Bush's Global Nuclear <b>Energy</b> <b>Partnership</b> (GNEP) of 2007, the US is now actively promoting research on transmutation technologies needed to markedly reduce the problem of nuclear waste treatment.|$|E
500|$|Although he had {{initially}} {{stated that he}} would not do so, Livingstone's administration sought to phase out use of the Routemaster buses, the design for which dated to the 1950s. Although iconic, they were deemed hazardous and responsible for a high number of deaths and serious injuries as passengers climbed onto them, also being non-wheelchair accessible and thus not meeting the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The process was gradual, with the last Routemaster being decommissioned in December 2005. The Routemasters were replaced by a new fleet of 103 articulated buses, known colloquially as [...] "bendy buses", which were launched in June 2002. While the Routemasters fitted 80 people on at one time, the articulated buses fitted up to 140 passengers, however they were deemed dangerous for cyclists. Attempting to reduce London's environmental impact, Livingstone created the [...] London Hydrogen Partnership and the London <b>Energy</b> <b>Partnership</b> in his first term as Mayor of London. The Mayor's Energy Strategy, [...] "green light to clean power," [...] committed London to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide by 20%, relative to the 1990 level, by 2010.|$|E

2500|$|A {{fundamental}} {{goal for}} American and global security is {{to minimize the}} nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power. If this development is [...] "poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful, the nuclear future will be dangerous". The Global Nuclear <b>Energy</b> <b>Partnership</b> is one such international {{effort to create a}} distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy, would receive nuclear fuel at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program. The France-based Eurodif/European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium Enrichment Consortium was/is one such program that successfully implemented this concept, with Spain and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of the fuel produced at the French controlled enrichment facility, but without a transfer of technology. Iran was an early participant from 1974, and remains a shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif.|$|E

2500|$|The Global Nuclear <b>Energy</b> <b>Partnership,</b> was a U.S. {{proposal}} in the George W. Bush Administration {{to form an}} international partnership to see spent nuclear fuel reprocessed {{in a way that}} renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for nuclear weapons. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel has not been permitted in the United States due to nonproliferation considerations. All of the other reprocessing nations have long had nuclear weapons from military-focused [...] "research"-reactor fuels except for Japan.Normally, with the fuel being changed every three years or so, about half of the Pu-239 is 'burned' in the reactor, providing about one third of the total energy. It behaves like U-235 and its fission releases a similar amount of energy. The higher the burn-up, the more plutonium in the spent fuel, but the lower the fraction of fissile plutonium. Typically about one percent of the used fuel discharged from a reactor is plutonium, and some two thirds of this is fissile (c. 50% Pu-239, 15% Pu-241). Worldwide, some 70 tonnes of plutonium contained in used fuel is removed when refueling reactors each year.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} {{a surge in}} international programmes established to assist the adoption of renewable energy technologies (RETs) in low and lower-middle income countries. So far, such programmes have yielded mixed success. While partnerships between international, national and local organisations have become the pre-eminent model for RET programmes, we know relatively little about their contribution. This article traces the role of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>partnerships</b> in development cooperation, shifting the analytical emphasis from barriers and drivers to key actors and their relationships. It presents a relational approach {{for the analysis of}} development assistance for renewable energy, drawing on theories concerning the role of strong and weak ties in inter-organisational networks. Through an analysis of seven empirical cases from Central America, the article provides insights into how different forms of inter-organisational relationships can facilitate implementation of RET programmes but do not necessarily enhance the capacities of local organisations in a way to support a more sustainable adoption of RETs. On the basis of this analysis, theoretical and policy implications are given concerning the potential of relational approaches for researching technology diffusion processes, and the role of strong and weak ties for the success - or failure - of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>partnerships...</b>|$|R
