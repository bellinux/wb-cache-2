5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence from the community, while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the <b>full</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the <b>full</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{works to}} come to terms with the {{diversity}} of expressive meanings, both across languages and constructions (section 2) and within the range of readings for specific items (section 3).

Section begins to 4 extend van Rooy’s (2003) game-theoretic analysis of politeness to a <b>fuller</b> <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> expressive meanings. The approach provides a method for studying the pragmatics of expressives even as we remain unsure of their precise conventionalized meanings, and it captures the particular sense in which expressives are performative...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} microscopes, fluorescence emission {{is separated}} from the backscattered illumination using the Stokes shift, whereby the emission occurs at a longer wavelength to the excitation. Such separation is usually achieved {{through a combination of}} wavelength filters that divide the spectrum into mutually exclusive excitation and emission bands. It is therefore impossible in these microscopes to access the <b>full</b> excitation/emission <b>spectrum</b> <b>of</b> the specimen in a single image. We report on a microscope that acquired fluorescence images using illumination across the spectral range 450 - 680 nm; the <b>full</b> emission <b>spectrum</b> was detected simultaneously across the same range. The microscope was also combined with structured illumination optical sectioning to give three-dimensionally resolved images with improved background rejection. <b>Full</b> <b>spectrum</b> fluorescence images <b>of</b> biological specimens are demonstrated.
