This EU directive is spreading to countries in the world including California, China and Korea and its effect is rapidly growing. But the RoHS-like regulations of singular countries are very different in their details and manufacturers as well as traders have to fulfill the special requirements related to the product scope, the entry dates and the special implementation procedures.

ICAO SARPs are only applicable to countries signatory to the 1944 Chicago Convention and only to civil aircraft operations. There is no complimentary international organization providing the same standardization of military aviation regulations. NATO provide international standards for interoperability, and the EDA now provide a militarized European regulatory set aimed at <b>harmonizing</b> <b>requirements</b> for European militaries, however {{there is no}} political platform to extend this beyond a voluntary adoption, particularly beyond the European Union. Each military aviation regulator has developed a unique airworthiness regulatory system. There is no recognized method for unbiased assessment and comparison of the disparate regulatory frameworks.

40|$|International audienceOn May 23, 2007 the European Parliament and the Council {{adopted the}} Directive 2007 / 23 /EC [1] on the placing {{on the market}} of {{pyrotechnic}} articles. Following the "new approach" this Directive aims at ensuring the f ree movement of such products within the European Union (EU), improving safety of both consumers and professionals and implementing <b>harmonized</b> safety <b>requirements</b> for these articles in all Member States. Therefore a European frame for the approval of pyrotechnic articles for vehicles is now set up by introducing <b>harmonized</b> Essential Safety <b>Requirements</b> (ESR), CE marking and certification procedures. For manufacturers and importers that had to comply with a different regulation in each country to get technical approvals of their products the principle "tested once, accepted everywhere" is a great achievement. Although this EU directive will reduce the administrative burden for everybody, its substitution and application instead of the current national regulations may create difficulties at the beginning.

40|$|Zero-energy {{performance}} {{buildings have}} gained significant attention since the publication in 2010 of the recast of the EPBD recast which requires all new buildings to become nearly zero-energy by 2020. Buildings are requested to meet {{higher levels of}} energy performance and to explore more the alternative energy supply systems available locally on a cost-efficiency basis. Since the directive does not specify minimum or maximum <b>harmonized</b> <b>requirements</b> as well as details of energy performance calculation framework, {{it is up to}} the member states to define the exact meaning of “high energy performance” and “amount of energy from renewable sources” according to their own local conditions and strategic interests. Nearly zero-energy building (nZEB) performance derives from net zero-energy concept (Net ZEB) which in case of buildings is usually defined as a high energy performance building that over a year is energy neutral. The successful implementation of such an ambitious target, however, needs to be planned out diligently. The critical steps are a) a correct picture about the existing state and trends, b) clear definitions and targets, c) dynamic building codes and energy efficient technologies and d) rules for testing and verification. The nZEBs or NetZEBs built in the near future therefore may play a critical role in implementing any ambitious plan as its success on long-term relies on setting best practice examples, in addition of the supporting policies and initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to review existing definitions, terms and policies on strategic planning of nZEBs at national and international level...|$|R
