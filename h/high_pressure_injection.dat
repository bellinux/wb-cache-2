5000|$|Oil {{fracking}} is {{a process}} that involves a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>injection</b> of fluid into the ground to extract oil. The adverse environmental effects of this natural gas extraction are the subject of much controversy, the primary concerns of which surround the contamination of surrounding water and air sources. These risks result when underground drinking water and surface water are exposed to discharges of the chemically-infused fracking fluid due to faulty construction or operation, disposal leaks, or other unintended byproducts like the release of hazardous volatile compounds into the air. In terms of air pollution, [...] "hydrofracking" [...] causes detriment to both the environment and human health. Enormous quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas, escape into the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere during the extraction process, where they accelerate the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, air contaminants like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, formaldehydes, and hydrogen sulfide that are released during drilling have been shown to cause harmful effects ranging from cancer, organ failure, neurological issues, to birth defects.|$|E
5000|$|In 1892, Akroyd Stuart {{patented}} a water-jacketed vaporizer {{to allow}} compression ratios {{to be increased}} but primarily to reduce auto-ignition problems at higher loads and compression ratios.

It ran for six hours—the first time automatic ignition was produced by compression alone, however such a claim is not substantiated by any source and since until 1907 hotbulb engines {{were supposed to be}} charged with fuel at the intake stroke, although separately from air, such an engine would have been prone to failure, poor performance or extreme malfunctioning due to pre-ignition.

To validate the presented simulations, current numerical results are compared against existing experimental data and good compliance is achieved. Based on the numerical findings, addition of n-butanol to HFO increases the particles volume in parcels at 600 [*]bar.

Moreover, under <b>injection</b> <b>pressure</b> of 1000 bar, HFO/n-butanol blends compared to pure HFO fuel decrease particles volume in parcels of spray.

Up to 100 MPa of the fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pressure,</b> the <b>higher</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> create faster combustion rates that result in the higher in-cylinder gas temperatures as compared to conventional low-pressure fuel injection systems. When applying high-pressure injections, particulate emission reductions of up to 50 % were observed with no change in hydrocarbon emissions, reductions of CO emissions and only slightly higher NOx emissions. Over 100 MPa, on the other hand, the <b>higher</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pressures</b> still reduced up to almost zero-level of particulate emission, {{at the same time that}} the NO emission is reduced greatly. Under these high-pressure injection conditions, strong correlations between soot and CO emissions were observed, which compete for the oxidizing OH species.

As a result, a four-split injection strategy resulted in a 55 % reduction in particulates and with little or no penalty on NOx emissions.

40|$|To {{comply with}} Stage IV {{emission}} standard for off-road engines, Kohler Engines has developed the 100 kW rated KDI 3. 4 liters diesel engine, equipped with DOC and SCR. Based on this engine, {{a research project}} in collaboration between Kohler Engines, Ricardo, Denso and Politecnico di Torino was carried out to exploit the potential of new technologies to meet the Stage IV and beyond emission standards. The prototype engine was equipped with a low pressure cooled EGR system, two stage turbocharger, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system capable of very <b>high</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pressure</b> and DOC+DPF aftertreatment system. Since the Stage IV emission standard sets a 0. 4 g/kWh NOx limit for the steady state test cycle (NRSC), that includes full load operating conditions, the engine must be operated with very high EGR rates (above 30 %) at very high load. As a consequence, the low {{air to fuel ratio}} and the risk of high soot emissions must be handled by means of <b>high</b> fuel <b>injection</b> <b>pressure</b> and proper <b>injection</b> patterns.
