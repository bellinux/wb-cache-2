60|$|Mr. Glegg and Tom {{had also}} entered, {{treading}} softly, and were busy selecting {{the key of}} the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had brought from his father's bureau. They succeeded in opening the chest,--which stood opposite the foot of Mr. Tulliver's bed,--and propping the lid with the <b>iron</b> <b>holder,</b> without much noise.|$|E

[...] But before he had the time to finish the sentence the flare blazed up violently between them and he saw her throw herself back with an arm across her face. [...] "Hallo," [...] he exclaimed; only he could not stop a moment to ask if she was hurt. He bolted out of the companion straight into his captain who took the flare from him and held it high above his head.|$|E

They descended the stairs and passed other passages which ran underground, till a sudden turn to the right brought them to a little walled-in place with a vaulted roof. Two torches flared in <b>iron</b> <b>holders</b> in the masonry, and {{by the light of}} them they saw a strange and fearful sight.|$|R

Zeitschrift fuer Physikalische Chemie, Stoechiometrie und Verwandtschaftslehre (1894), 15, 65 - 78; SciFinder (Chemical Abstracts Service: Columbus, OH); [URL] (accessed July 8, 2010). Many metals, when {{heated to}} {{temperatures}} considerably below their melting points, exhibit properties {{characteristic of the}} liquid state. For examination in this respect, the metals were turned into cylinders with ends as perfectly plane as possible, and placed end to end in an <b>iron</b> <b>holder,</b> pressure being applied by a screw. They were heated in this condition in a hot air bath, filled, if necessary, with an indifferent gas. Cylinders of aluminium, bismuth, cadmium, copper, tin, gold, lead, zinc, antimony, and platinum were employed, {{and in the first}} experiment two cylinders of the same metal were used. The temperature was kept for from 4 to 8 hours at from 200 ° to 400 °, and it was found that, except in the case of antimony and platinum, the cylinders had alloyed so perfectly that they could be turned with one end fixed in a lathe, whilst if broken in a vice the fracture did not take place along the original surface of separation. Pairs of different metals were next employed, usually copper or lead with some of the other metals, with the result that, at the junction, an alloy of considerable thickness was formed, 18 mm. in the case of zinc and copper, and 15 mm. in the case of cadmium and copper. In the case of lead and tin, a cavity in the end of one metal was filled with mica, so that contact only took place at the edge. An alloy was formed to the thickness of 15 mm., of which 9 mm. were in the tin and 6 mm. in the lead. By the use of cylinders of copper and zinc, in which, owing to a central cavity, contact only took place at the edges, {{it was found that the}} surface of the copper above the cavity was coloured by a yellow alloy resembling that formed when copper is subjected to the action of zinc vapour, and which was not due to diffusion from the edges (see also Abstracts, 1893, ii, 168). For the explanation of these results, which are most marked with soft and non-crystalline metals, the author points out the assumption suffices, that the molecules of solids, like those of fluids, do not all move with the same velocity.

50|$|Other notable {{buildings}} in Digbeth, include the now-defunct The Clothing Mart operated by George Makepeace at 135-6 Digbeth {{which was designed}} by James Patchett of Ombersley. Built in 1913, it is a steel framed structure {{with a mixture of}} façade materials. The façade consists of bright red brick and orange terracotta. The building is no longer used by George Makepeace and has changed hands, undergoing a variety of uses. Several aspects of its original architecture have been lost including a first floor iron balcony, above which electric lanterns with hooded lenses from two <b>iron</b> <b>holders</b> that remain. Either side of these were iron and glass lamps resembling Medici goblets. The orange pilasters sit on a key stone and pedimented blocks set with round pink granite stones and the parapet is of green glazed terracotta. And Birmingham's only Rowton Houses, now known as the Paragon Hotel.Digbeth was also of importance in 19th century transport with many coaches and carriers terminating at inns there. Inns that were particularly popular as such locations were The White Hart, the Red Lion, and The Bull's Head. This transport history is reflected in the creation of Digbeth Coach Station (now Birmingham Coach Station), which was built in 1929 by Midland Red.|$|R

50|$|The {{popularity}} of napkin holders corresponded with the invention (and popularization) {{of the paper}} napkin by the Scott Paper Company in 1930, although cloth napkins had existed - often as handkerchiefs - since Greek and Roman times. Wrought <b>iron</b> napkin <b>holders</b> and rings were a common part of a blacksmith's repertoire during the 19th century {{as well as other}} holders and household items. Mechanically made napkin holders have replaced many of those made by hand, as blacksmithing is now primarily an art form, as opposed to a means of creation of household utility items.|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} in the 19th century the design was altered, {{probably}} by John Pinch. The pediment was moved to be above the attic storey, so that the attics of the central houses were not deprived of light. Palmer's plan had a carved tympanum in the pediment, but this was never made, probably {{due to a lack of}} funds. Pinch also added balconies with wrought iron railings on the piano nobile (first floor) of all the houses. The <b>iron</b> lamp <b>holders</b> over the entrances to Nos. 7 and 14 are also likely to be Pinch's work.|$|R

5000|$|Gasholders were {{constructed}} {{of a variety}} of materials, brick, stone, concrete, steel, or wrought <b>iron.</b> The <b>holder</b> or floating vessel is the storage reservoir for the gas, and it serves the purpose of equalizing the distribution of the gas under pressure, and ensures a continuity of supply, while gas remains in the holder. They are cylindrical like an inverted beaker and work {{up and down in the}} tank. In order to maintain a true vertical position, the vessel has rollers which work on guide-rails attached to the tank sides and to the columns surrounding the holder. Gasholders may be either single or telescopic in two or more lifts. When it is made in the telescopic form, its capacity could be increased to as much as four times the capacity of the single-lift holder for equal dimensions of tank. The telescopic versions were found to be useful as they conserved ground space and capital.|$|R

5|$|The Stuka {{was also}} heavily {{involved}} in Operation Citadel, the Battle of Kursk. The Luftwaffe committed I, II, III./St.G 1 and III./StG 3 {{under the command of}} Luftflotte 6. I., II, III. of StGs 2 and 3 were committed under the command of Hans Seidemann's Fliegerkorps VIII. Hauptmann Rudel's cannon-equipped Ju 87 Gs had a devastating effect on Soviet armour at Orel and Belgorod. The Ju 87s participated in a huge aerial counter-offensive lasting from 16–31 July against a Soviet offensive at Khotynets and saved two German armies from encirclement, reducing the attacking Soviet 11th Guards Army to just 33 tanks by 20 July. The Soviet offensive had been completely halted from the air although losses were considerable. Fliegerkorps VIII lost eight Ju 87s on 8 July, six on 9 July, six on 10 July and another eight on 11 July. The Stuka arm also lost eight of their Knight's Cross of the <b>Iron</b> Cross <b>holders.</b> StG 77 lost 24 Ju 87s in the period 5–31 July (StG had lost 23 in July–December 1942), while StG 2 lost another 30 aircraft in the same period. In September 1943, three of the Stuka units were re-equipped with the Fw 190F and G (ground attack versions) and began to be renamed Schlachtgeschwader (attack wings). In the face of overwhelming air opposition, the dive-bomber required heavy protection from German fighters to counter Soviet fighters. Some units like SG 2 Immelmann continued to operate with great success throughout 1943-45, operating the Ju 87 G variants equipped with 37mm cannons, which became tank killers, although in increasingly small numbers.|$|R
