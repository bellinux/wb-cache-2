Using a revised cost allocation – referred to in this paper as <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> allocation – the paper contrasts overhead allocation between traditional <b>cost</b> allocation and <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> allocation. In addition, production cost derived from the traditional allocation of waste cost is compared with the revised <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> allocation. Findings indicate that a revised <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> allocation discloses more accurate overhead cost and hence production cost; and that management is motivated to make informed environmental management decisions if a product related <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> is made to reflect in the production cost of the polluting product. The paper highlights the practical significance of objective <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> allocation on corporate waste management, which thus creates a valuable awareness {{on the part of}} the management and accountants of firms in developing countries for the need to fine-tune the dominant traditional costing system.

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the <b>environmental</b> <b>costs</b> it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} case for research in environmental management accounting and/or <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> accounting. The paper provides an analysis of the current status of environmental management and/or <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> accounting at the industry level. The author explores the extent of management research in the field of corporate sustainability management and environmental management accounting. The study employs a survey method for identifying factors to adopt <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> accounting and its guidelines within organizations in Korean manufacturing industry contexts. The paper uncovers those manufacturing industries' views on motivations and obstacles to adopt <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> accounting and its guidelines, and general perceptions on related issues. It is found that there is a lack of a systematically structured approach to implement <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> accounting internally in practice. The study also finds that some difficulties to adopt <b>environmental</b> <b>cost</b> accounting in practice are caused by the existing accounting and information system.
