30|$|For JP, {{as long as}} the {{aggregated}} channel matrix at the CCN is well conditioned for inversion, linear ZF beamforming (BF) techniques can be used for interference control. It has been shown in [9] that when using techniques that achieve CSI feedback reduction, such as active set thresholding in PJP, this reduction does not translate to an equivalent backhaul load reduction with the linear ZF BF. When calculating the ZF BF based on the sparse aggregated channel matrix, a link that has been defined as an <b>inactive</b> <b>link</b> may be mapped with a non-zero BF weight for that link. This causes unnecessary backhauling, since the UT has reported that link as inactive and that BS is already outside the active set of that UT. Instead, the BS could use this resource to serve another UT. An intuitive approach could be that the CCN resorts to nulling the BF weights where the links are expected to be inactive. This is a suboptimal solution. In [13], a partial ZF precoding design is proposed based on [14] to remove the interference in a PJP scenario. This solution performs better than the linear ZF BF with a weight nulling assumption, and works even for a sparse aggregated channel matrix at the CCN, but it does not achieve an equivalent backhaul load reduction. On the other hand, there is no linear technique in the literature that can invert the sparse aggregated channel matrix and preserve the zeros in the transposed version of the inverse, when {{the aggregated}} channel matrix is not diagonal or block-diagonal.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that vertex {{similarity}} measures are good at predicting link formation over the near term, but are less effective in predicting over the long term. This indicates that, generally, as links age, their degree of influence diminishes. However, few papers have systematically studied this phenomenon. In this paper, we apply a supervised learning approach to study age as a factor for link formation. Experiments on several real-world datasets show that younger links are more informative than older ones in predicting the formation of new links. Since older links become less useful, it might be appropriate to remove them when studying network evolution. Several previously observed network properties and network evolution phenomena, such as “the number of edges grows super-linearly {{in the number of}} nodes ” and “the diameter is decreasing as the network grows”, may need to be reconsidered under a dynamic network model where old, <b>inactive</b> <b>links</b> are removed...|$|R
30|$|In PJP, the CSI of {{the links}} {{reported}} by the UTs to the CCN are marked as active links and those not reported are marked as inactive. Based on these, the CCN forms an aggregated channel matrix for interference control, where the coefficients of the <b>inactive</b> <b>links</b> are set to zero. In this article, the CCN identifies the BSs that fall outside the threshold window for a given UT based on the links for which the UT has not reported CSI. It is assumed that the obtained CSI is error free. Protocol aspects of this communication {{need to be addressed}} in more detail in a real system implementation. As a result, the aggregated channel matrix is now sparse. Linear techniques such as zero forcing (ZF) can invert the aggregated channel matrix to remove interference, but these techniques fail to invert a sparse aggregated channel matrix {{and at the same time}} reduce the backhaul load, such that only the BSs in the active set of a UT receive the precoding weights [9].|$|R

30|$|In this article, the {{following}} ZF scenarios are considered, where the ZF {{is performed using}} the pseudoinverse as in Equation (2) on the aggregated channel matrix at the CCN. The main {{focus is on the}} ZF with limited feedback (LFB) and limited backhauling (LBH), where the gains of feedback load reduction need to be preserved in the backhaul load reduction. This is denoted as ZF:LFB + LBH. The LFB is achieved based on the active set thresholding technique. The LBH with ZF is achieved with an intuitive approach of nulling of the BF coefficients based on the <b>inactive</b> <b>links</b> in the binary matrix. When the UT is allowed to feed back all the CSI (full feedback, FFB) and allowing full backhauling (FBH), it is represented as ZF:FFB + FBH. This scenario is considered to show the upper bound of the ZF technique, {{as in the case of}} CJP. The scenario ZF with FFB and LBH is considered to have a similar configuration as that of the SIN precoding technique [12]. This is denoted as ZF:FFB + LBH. Finally, the scenario ZF with LFB and FBH is considered, similar to that considered in [9], where the ZF is allowed to have the precoded weights at BSs where it is not desired and allowing FBH. This is represented as ZF:LFB + FBH. It should be noted that this approach does achieve some backhaul reduction, but not necessarily equivalent to the feedback load.|$|R

Materials and Methods: The sources of information were obtained the keyword 'laparoscopic cholecystectomy', from internet searches using Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Ask and AOL search engines with default settings. The first 50 web links were evaluated for their accessibility, usability and reliability using the LIDA tool (validation instrument for healthcare websites by Minervation). The readability of the websites was assessed by using the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and the Gunning Fog Index (GFI). Results: Of the 250 links, 90 were new links. Others were repetitions, restricted access sites or <b>inactive</b> <b>links.</b> The websites had an average accessibility score of 52 / 63 (83. 2 %; range 40 - 62), a usability score of 39 / 54 (73. 1 %; range 23 - 49) and a reliability score of 14 / 27 (51. 6 %; range 5 - 24).

This paper analyses the energy saving capability of a Data center network using Segment Routing (SR) based model within a Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture. Energy efficiency is measured in terms of number of links turned off and for how long the links remain in sleep mode. Apart from saving the energy by turning off links, our work further efficiently manages the traffic within the available links by using Per-packet based load balancing approach. Aiming to avoid congestion within DCN’s and increase the sleeping time of <b>inactive</b> <b>links.</b> An algorithm for deciding the particular set of links to be turned off within a network is presented. With the introduction of per-packet approach within SR/SDN model, we have successfully saved 21 % of energy within DCN topology. Results show that the proposed Per-packet SR model using Random Packet Spraying (RPS) saves more energy and provides better performance as compared to Per-flow based SR model, which uses Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP) for load balancing. But, certain problems also come into picture using per-packet approach, like out of order packets and longer end to end delay. To further solidify the effect of SR in saving energy within DCN and avoid previously introduced problems, we have used per-flow based Flow Reservation approach along with a proposed Flow Scheduling Algorithm. Flow rate of all incoming flows can be deduced using Flow reservation approach, which is further used by Flow Scheduling Algorithm to increase Bandwidth utilization Ratio of links. Ultimately, managing the traffic more efficiently and increasing the sleeping time of links, leading to more energy savings. Results show that, the energy savings are almost similar in per-packet based approach and per-flow based approach with bandwidth reservation. Except, the average sleeping time of links in per-flow based approach with bandwidth reservation decreases less severely as compared to per-packet based approach, as overall traffic load increases...|$|R

This paper offers an overview of that network, focusing on the structure of Shi’ite websites that promote not only religious conversion but are also supportive of Iran [...] a designated State-sponsor of terrorism – its nuclear program. Hezbollah, and the “Bolivarian revolution” led by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and his allies in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. There is also a smaller group of Sunni Muslim websites, mostly tied to the legacy organizations of the Muslim Brotherhood. Many of the Shi’ite websites are linked to each other consistently portray Israel as a Nazi State, and the United States as an imperialist war monger. The Palestinian issue is frequently juxtaposed with the anti-imperialist struggle that those states supporting Chávez’ Bolivarian revolution claim to wage against the United States. Some of the Islamist websites claim thousands of new convert, but such claims are difficult to verify. Most of the websites visited touted the conversion of one or two individuals as significant victories and signs of progress, implying that there are few, if any, mass conversions. While conducting this research, no websites directly claiming to be linked to Hezbollah were found, although there numerous sites hosted by that group that were active until around 2006. Several of the <b>inactive</b> <b>links</b> are supportive of Hezbollah as a political party. No websites linked to al Qaeda were found. Yet a substantial Internet network remains operational.

40|$|Abstract — In randomly-deployed {{wireless}} ad hoc networks with reliable {{nodes and}} links, vanishment of isolated nodes asymptotically implies connectivity of networks. However, in a realistic system, nodes may become <b>inactive,</b> and <b>links</b> may become down. The inactive nodes and down links cannot {{take part in}} routing/relaying and thus may affect the connectivity. In this paper, we study the connectivity of a wireless ad hoc network that is composed of unreliable nodes and links by investigating {{the distribution of the}} number of isolated nodes in the network. We assume that the wireless ad hoc network consists of n nodes which are distributed independently and uniformly in a unit-area disk or square. Nodes are active independently with probability 0 <p 1 ≤ 1, and links are up independently with probability 0 <p 2 ≤ 1. A node is said to be isolated if it doesn’t have an up link to an active node. We show that if all nodes have a maximum transmission radius rn = for some constant ξ, then ln n+ξ πp 1 p 2 n the total number of isolated nodes is asymptotically Poisson with mean e −ξ and the total number of isolated active nodes is also asymptotically Poisson with mean p 1 e −ξ. In addition, the work can be extended for secure wireless networks which adopt m-composite key predistribution schemes in which a node is said to be isolated if it doesn’t have a secure link.

Method Thirty three quantitative studies that assessed associations between the physical environment (perceived or objectively measured) and physical activity among children (ages 3 to 18 -years) and fulfilled selection criteria were reviewed. Findings were categorized and discussed according to three dimensions of the physical environment including recreational infrastructure, transport infrastructure, and local conditions. Results Results across the various studies showed that children's participation in physical activity is positively associated with publicly provided recreational infrastructure (access to recreational facilities and schools) and transport infrastructure (presence of sidewalks and controlled intersections, access to destinations and public transportation). At the same time, transport infrastructure (number of roads to cross and traffic density/speed) and local conditions (crime, area deprivation) are negatively associated with children's participation in physical activity.

40|$|Lymphomas {{of certain}} strains of {{chickens}} infected by retroviruses frequently contain recombinant transforming genes {{in which the}} promoter of the cellular proto-myc gene is replaced by that of a defective rather than an intact retrovirus. Here we ask whether the resulting hybrid genes are sufficient for tumorigenic transformation like viral myc genes. Further, we ask whether retroviruses must be defective in order to mutate proto-myc to a transforming gene or whether the defectiveness plays a transformation-independent function in tumorigenesis. For this purpose the defective provirus of proviral-proto-myc recombinants from lymphomas were repaired, or intact proviruses were recombined with proto-myc genes in vitro, and then compared to recombinant proto-myc genes with defective proviruses for transforming function in quail embryo fibroblasts. It was found that a single copy of a provirus-proto-myc recombinant gene with an intact provirus is sufficient to transform a quail embryo cell in vitro. Moreover, our analyses showed that multiple internal retroviral deletions [corrected] eliminate or inhibit provirus expression. The effect of these deletions [corrected] was detectable only because the <b>inactive</b> proviruses were <b>linked</b> to the selectable, transforming proto-myc gene marker. It is consistent with our results that proviral defectiveness of recombinant proto-myc genes is necessary in vivo for the clonal growth of a transformed cell into a tumor to escape antiviral immunity.

In living patients, i(9 p) and idic(9 p) are usually present in a mosaic state.

Tetrasomy 9 p leads to a variable phenotype ranging from multiple congenital anomalies with severe intellectual disability and growth delay to subnormal cognitive and physical developments. Hypertelorism, abnormal ears, microretrognathia and bulbous nose are the most common dysmorphic traits. Microcephaly, growth retardation, joint dislocation, scoliosis, cardiac and renal anomalies were reported in several cases. Those physical anomalies are often, but not universally, accompanied by intellectual disability. The most recurrent breakpoints, defined by conventional cytogenetics, are 9 p 10, 9 q 12 and 9 q 13.

5000|$|A protein {{phosphatase}} is a phosphatase {{enzyme that}} removes a phosphate {{group from the}} phosphorylated amino acid residue of its substrate protein. Protein phosphorylation {{is one of the}} most common forms of reversible protein posttranslational modification (PTM), with up to 30% of all proteins being phosphorylated at any given time. Protein kinases (PKs) are the effectors of phosphorylation and catalyse the transfer of a γ-phosphate from ATP to specific amino acids on proteins. Several hundred PKs exist in mammals and are classified into distinct super-families. Proteins are phosphorylated predominantly on Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, which account for 79.3, 16.9 and 3.8% respectively of the phosphoproteome, at least in mammals. In contrast, protein phosphatases (PPs) are the primary effectors of dephosphorylation and can be grouped into three main classes based on sequence, structure and catalytic function. The largest class of PPs is the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family comprising PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP4, PP5, PP6 and PP7, and the protein phosphatase Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent (PPM) family, composed primarily of PP2C. The protein Tyr phosphatase (PTP) super-family forms the second group, and the aspartate-based protein phosphatases the third. The protein pseudophosphatases form part of the larger phosphatase family, and in most cases are thought to be catalytically inert, instead functioning as phosphate-binding proteins, integrators of signalling or subcellular traps. Examples of membrane-spanning protein phosphatases containing both active (phosphatase) and <b>inactive</b> (pseudophosphatase) domains <b>linked</b> in tandem are known, conceptually similar to the kinase and pseudokinase domain polypeptide structure of the JAK pseudokinases.

Prenyltransferase enzymes serve {{a variety of}} important biological functions from the creation of natural rubber to the modification of signal transduction proteins. The focus of this thesis is twofold; to understand better the isoprenoid chain elongation prenyltransferase enzymes, which catalyze the extension of isoprene units, and the protein prenyltransferases, which catalyze the transfer of an isoprenyl diphosphate to a protein or peptide. Substrate analogues {{have proven to be}} versatile tools for probing the identity, structure, mechanism, and function of various prenyltransferase enzymes. Described here are a variety of analogues of prenyltransferase substrates towards the study of prenyltransferase enzymes. A photoactive phosphonophosphate-containing analogue of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) that can covalently modify proteins it is bound to upon irradiation with light was characterized and applied towards the identification of cis-prenyltransferase protein(s) involved in rubber biosynthesis. Kinetic and structural studies with this analogue and protein farnesyltransferase (PFTase) or protein geranylgeranyltransferase type-I (PGGTase-I) demonstrate that this probe is a good mimic of isoprenoid diphosphates. The phosphonophosphate linkage resulted in enhanced stability of the analogues, allowing it {{to be used as a}} label and identify a specific protein in rubber biosynthesis, rubber elongation factor (REF). The cross-linking of REF with a photoactivatible analogue of FPP suggests that REF can interact with isoprenoid diphosphates during rubber biosynthesis and this interaction may be key for the process. However, results indicated it is unlikely that REF is the sole protein responsible for rubber synthesis, thus prompting further work in the area. A caged compound is a biologically relevant molecule rendered <b>inactive</b> by a <b>link</b> to a chemical group (the "cage") through a photolabile bond. A series of photoactivatable protein prenyltransferase substrate analogues were created to achieve temporal control of prenyltransferase activity. Detailed characterization of these probes was performed to explore their applicability in protein prenylation studies. The first generation of caged PFTase analogues contain a nitrobenzyl-based photolabile group incorporated at the distal phosphate of the isoprenoid diphosphate substrate or the sulfhydryl side-chain of the cysteine residue in a CAAX peptide substrate. Kinetic studies of caged isoprenoid diphosphates demonstrated that they are poor substrates for PFTase but, upon irradiation, can efficiently release FPP upon irradiation which can be utilized for catalysis. The caged CAAX peptide photo releases the parent peptide with similar kinetics to the caged isoprenoid diphosphates. When caged the CAAX peptide does not function as a substrate, but is able to bind with efficient capacity and nearly identical conformation as compared to the photo-released peptide and does not interfere with the binding of the isoprenoid diphosphate substrate. These results lead to a wide variety of experiments where temporal control over protein prenylation is necessary. A second set of isoprenoid diphosphate analogues was created, bearing an azide or alkyne moiety. These analogues were applied as chemical proteomic probes for studying the mammalian protein prenylome. Cells were treated with either the alcohol, which is converted into the diphosphate by cellular kinases or the diphosphate isoprenoid analogue. These analogues were then appended onto prenylated proteins and through Cu(I) -catalyzed cycloaddition with a corresponding azide- or alkyne-modified fluorophore, direct visualization of prenylated proteins was accomplished. Application of this same reaction with a biotinylated capture reagent allowed for enrichment of the modified proteins and subsequent identification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

40|$|Trypanosoma brucei causes African {{sleeping}} sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle. There are no vaccines available against {{the disease and}} the current treatment is also not satisfactory because of inefficacy and numerous side effects of the used drugs. T. brucei lacks de novo synthesis of purine nucleosides; hence {{it depends on the}} host to make its purine nucleotides. T. brucei has a high affinity adenosine kinase (TbAK), which phosphorylates adenosine, deoxyadenosine (dAdo), inosine and their analogs. RNAi experiments confirmed that TbAK is responsible for the salvage of dAdo and the toxicity of its substrate analogs. Cell growth assays with the dAdo analogs, Ara-A and F-Ara-A, suggested that TbAK could be exploited for drug development against the disease. It has previously been shown that when T. brucei cells were cultivated in the presence of 1 mM deoxyadenosine (dAdo), they showed accumulation of dATP and depletion of ATP nucleotides. The altered nucleotide levels were toxic to the trypanosomes. However the salvage of dAdo in trypanosomes was dramatically reduced below 0. 5 mM dAdo. Radiolabeled dAdo experiments showed that it (especially at low concentrations) is cleaved to adenine and converted to ATP. The recombinant methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (TbMTAP) cleaved methylthioadenosine, dAdo and adenosine into adenine and sugar- 1 -P in a phosphate-dependent manner. The trypanosomes became more sensitive to dAdo when TbMTAP was down-regulated in RNAi experiments. The RNAi experiments confirmed that trypanosomes avoid dATP accumulation by cleaving dAdo. The TbMTAP cleavage-resistant nucleoside analogs, FANA-A and Ara-A, successfully cured T. brucei-infected mice. The DNA building block dTTP can be synthesized either via thymidylate synthase in the de novo pathway or via thymidine kinase (TK) by salvage synthesis. We found that T. brucei and three other parasites contain a tandem TK where the gene sequence was repeated twice or four times in a single open reading frame. The recombinant T. brucei TK, which belongs to the TK 1 family, showed broad substrate specificity. The enzyme phosphorylated the pyrimidine nucleosides thymidine and deoxyuridine, as well as the purine nucleosides deoxyinosine and deoxyguanosine. When the repeated sequences of the tandem TbTK were expressed individually as domains, only domain 2 was active. However, the protein could not dimerize and had a 5 -fold reduced affinity to its pyrimidine substrates but a similar turnover number as the full-length enzyme. The expressed domain 1 was inactive and sequence analysis revealed that some active residues, which are needed for substrate binding and catalysis, are absent. Generally, the TK 1 family enzymes form dimers or tetramers and the quaternary structure is linked to the affinity for the substrates. The covalently <b>linked</b> <b>inactive</b> domain- 1 helps domain- 2 to form a pseudodimer for the efficient binding of substrates. In addition, we discovered a repetition of an 89 -bp sequence in both domain 1 and domain 2, which suggests a genetic exchange between the two domains. T. brucei is very dependent on de novo synthesis via ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) for the production of dNTPs. Even though T. brucei RNR belongs to the class Ia RNR family and contains an ATP-binding cone, it lacks inhibition by dATP. The mechanism behind the RNR activation by ATP and inactivation by dATP was a puzzle {{for a long time in}} the ~ 50 years of RNR research. We carried out oligomerization studies on mouse and E. coli RNRs, which belongs to the same family as T. brucei, to get an understanding of the molecular mechanism behind overall activity regulation. We found that the oligomerization status of RNRs and overall activity mechanism are interlinked with each other.  Targeting the nucleotide metabolism of the mammalian pathogen Trypanosoma brucei...|$|R
