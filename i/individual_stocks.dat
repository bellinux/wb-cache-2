40|$|This study uses sample {{companies}} {{listed in}} Taiwan Stock Exchange and GreTai Securities Market during 2000 to 2011 {{to investigate the}} influence of earnings equality and liquidity {{on the cost of}} equity. We define discretionary accruals with three measures and real earnings management with three measures as indicators of earnings quality; trading volume, <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> liquidity and market liquidity as liquidity measures and <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> and market liquidity risk as liquidity risk measures. Panel data is suggested for this analysis. Firms manipulating discretionary accruals increase in the cost of equity, but ones operating real earnings management decrease in it when considering that the earnings quality and liquidity directly impact on it. The cost of equity is indirectly influenced by earnings quality and liquidity through information asymmetry measured by bid-ask spreads. The results show that no matter firms engaging in discretionary accruals or real earnings can decrease the cost of equity under higher levels of information asymmetry. The higher the trading volume or the <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> liquidity risk, the lower the cost of equity when information asymmetry is low...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether investors receive compensation for holding stocks with strong systematic liquidity {{risk in the}} form of extreme downside liquidity (EDL) risk. Following the logic of Acharya and Pedersen (2005), we capture a stock's EDL risk by the lower tail dependence between (i) <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> liquidity and market liquidity, (ii) <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> return and market liquidity, and (iii) <b>individual</b> <b>stock</b> liquidity and the market return. We show that the cross-section of expected stock returns reflects a premium for EDL risk. From 1969 to 2011, the average future return on stocks with strong EDL risk exceeds that of stocks with weak EDL risk by more than 4 % annually, adjusted for the exposures to market return as well as size, value, and momentum. This premium is different from linear liquidity risk and cannot be explained by other firm characteristics and risk factors. Our results show that investors care about extreme joint realizations in liquidity and that asset pricing models that rely on linear sensitivities alone might be misspecified...|$|R
