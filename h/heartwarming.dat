5|$|Paul's second children's {{book was}} {{published}} - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas, the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet <b>heartwarming</b> story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a <b>heartwarming</b> feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive the excitement of their adolescence.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{where the}} film was locally known as Fantasy Forest, {{expectations}} were high, with projections going as high $154–200 million or more. Ultimately, it was unable to hit these marks. Before {{the release of the}} film in the state, Disney had a very successful run at the box office with Zootopia the previous month, in which anthropomorphic animals were the central figure. Forbes noted that The Jungle Book was precisely the sort of film that Chinese audiences love with its 3D visuals, <b>heartwarming</b> story, and talking animal cast. It earned around $12 million on its opening day, including $300,000 worth of previews from 65,000 screenings. Buoyed by good word of mouth and positive reception (albeit mostly from audiences with polarized reception from Chinese critics), it rose 72% on its second day to $20 million. Through its opening weekend it grossed $48.5 million, including $5.1 million from 279 IMAX screens, a new record for April release. Its opening marked the biggest Walt Disney Pictures film opening ever, the second biggest for a family film (behind Kung Fu Panda 3), the second biggest April debut (behind Furious 7), and the fourth biggest Disney opening (behind Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens). It topped the daily box office through the whole opening week and went on to remain {{at the top of the}} box office for a second weekend, after dropping by a mere 20% to $29.8 million, despite facing some competitions. It ended its run there with a total of $150.1 million after thirty days of playing in theaters, adding $1.2 million on its last day. Albeit falling just below expectations, it nevertheless emerged as a huge financial success and becoming the fourth biggest Disney release there.|$|E

Strachan praised Michael Schur's script for being [...] "funny without being hurtful or vicious, <b>heartwarming</b> without being mawkish or sentimental". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said the fact that Will Forte's character segued believably from a loon to a believable and sympathetic father {{was a sign of}} the script's strength. Kandell said, [...] "Could the character have been more over-the-top? Sure. But in the long run, it’s not just funnier, but more dramatic, that he’s not." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "Time Capsule", which she said highlighted how the quirky setting of Pawnee itself contributed a major part to the show's success. Busis said the town's eccentricities were on great display during the public scenes, but did not feel forced or over-the-top. Barry Hertz of the National Post praised both the episode and Forte, whose eccentric performance he said fit in well {{with the rest of the}} show. Hertz said, [...] "Every single element on this show is on fire right now, from Andy’s naive stupidity and infatuation with April to Ben’s continued surprise at what Pawnee has to offer." ...|$|E

[...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B–". Chris Plante from New York wrote a generally positively review, saying [...] "No episode has done the ensemble work better than 'Gettysburg', a kind of sitcom buffet, its many stories giving the audience a small taste of every personality.

She calls the dog characters endearing and writes, [...] "This title will be a hit at storytime or in a one-on-one setting". Connie Fletcher of Booklist also gives the book a positive review, comparing the two eponymous characters to Pyramus and Thisbe, two lovers in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses.

500|$|In a mixed review, Kenneth E. Rathburn of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "Both {{versions}} of 'God Help the Outcasts' offer {{a level of}} mid-road quality {{that came to be}} expected after the Disney Renaissance," [...] writing of Mollenhauer's, [...] "The film version seems to limp around a bit while delivering more of that emotional punch needed as we transition to the second act," [...] while Midler's [...] "has that credits vibe we all know and love from Disney films" [...] which [...] "keeps us sticking around when we'd otherwise abandon the theater." [...] However, Rathburn concluded, [...] "said version is a little detached for the sake of thematic relevance." [...] Jack Smith of BBC Online gave the song a very unfavorable review, writing, [...] "The sentiments of 'God Help The Outcasts' ... are spoiled by syrupy production," [...] describing Midler's rendition as [...] "overwrought." [...] Plugged In observed, [...] "One <b>heartwarming</b> scene finds Esmeralda praying selflessly on behalf of the world's outcasts."

To make Studio Ghibli's hand-drawn cutscenes and the game engine's real-time cutscenes transition seamlessly, Level-5 adjusted the latter's color tones, shadows and character movements. For the backgrounds, the team used deep colors, unifying them so they would not look like [...] "a mass of polygons". The team found particular difficulty in animating the game's cel shaded appearance, and spent time researching Studio Ghibli animation to recreate their traditional animation.|$|E
500|$|Yuri on Ice {{was praised}} for {{including}} a same-sex romantic relationship between Yuri K. and Victor. Among moments highlighted by critics are an apparent kiss {{in the seventh}} episode, an exchange of gold rings (indicating a marriage or engagement) in the tenth episode, and Victor's tears when Yuri suggests ending their partnership in the twelfth episode. The kiss won the 2016 The Anime Awards for Most <b>Heartwarming</b> Scene. The exchange of rings between Yuri K. and Victor in the tenth episode is considered the first time such a relationship has been depicted in anime. Gabriella Ekens wrote for Anime News Network, [...] "Yuri on Ice, in depicting a sincere and uncomplicated engagement between two dudes, is unprecedented in anime. There hasn't even been a for real gay marriage in Japan, so this show is depicting something that isn't legally possible in its country of origin". For Anime UK News, Ian Wolf called the exchange of rings [...] "the best scene in the series". According to Wolf, the anime {{is an example of}} the Odagiri effect.|$|E
500|$|Several of Artie's scenes {{came in for}} criticism. The {{scene where}} he advised Rachel and Blaine to have sex was viewed by Poniewozik as [...] "a forced {{conflict}} designed to drive the plot" [...] and highly implausible {{for a number of}} reasons. Kubicek stated that [...] "acting is about pretending, and if Rachel is really a great actress, she'd be able to play the emotion without needing to have sex". Bell and West made similar points. Rae Votta of Billboard commented on the [...] "weird" [...] plotline that involved Artie and Coach Beiste, for which Kubicek called Artie's actions [...] "inappropriate". While Hyman [...] "liked Artie coming into his own as a director", she called his pre-show jitters [...] "jarring", though she called his final speech [...] "a nice moment", and Benigno characterized it as [...] "a kind of cheesy but actually appropriate speech". Futterman felt it was a [...] "valid and <b>heartwarming</b> point", but [...] "awkwardly slotted in". Poniewozik credited Jones as Coach Beiste with [...] "stunning work", and Kubicek said Beiste's [...] "fragile lack of self-esteem" [...] was [...] "believable and heartfelt" [...] and that Jones was [...] "brilliant".|$|E
500|$|Warren {{noted that}} Washington, D.C. had many memorials, {{but that this}} area, with the forest as a [...] "living memorial," [...] would have [...] "greatly pleased" [...] Kennedy for two reasons.

Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument". [...] Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 {{of the differences between the}} people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that [...] "Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. I found a revival of an ancient spirit". Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used: [...] "Shalom." ...|$|E

Csupó said that he cast her because of [...] "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and [...] "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that [...] "it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." [...] With regard to the character, Robb said [...] "'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down.

'The Simpsons' and warm-and-fuzzy is not a healthy combination". Nate Boss of Project-Blu described the episode as “filler” and praised the episode's concept, but criticized how the episode was executed. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide also gave the episode a mixed response, and wrote that “'Rap' starts with a clever – if absurd – concept”, but “does little to churn good comedy out of its theme”, and concluded by calling the episode “disappointing”. |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2010 |last=Jacobsson|first=Colin|publisher=DVD Movie Guide}} Writing for Obsessed With Film, Adam Rayner described the episode as “woefully weak” and “an example of the farcical that the series would fall deeper and deeper into”. He did, however, praise the episode for being original. Jennifer Malkowski, reviewing the season for DVD Verdict, was more positive towards the episode. Giving the episode a rating of B+, Malkowski listed “The Parent Rap” among episodes in the season where “We see wacky scenarios force Homer to bond with his family, to a rather <b>heartwarming</b> effect”. Ron Martin of 411Mania was also favorable, calling the episode “decent”.|$|E

[...] Brett Harrison Davinger from The California Literary Review wrote moderately positive of the episode, saying, [...] "Tonight's episode worked for the most part thanks to the ever reliable Robert California and the usually reliable Jim and Dwight: Partners." [...] However, he did retroactively criticize season eight for not elaborating on the problems facing Dunder Mifflin until [...] "Turf War". In addition, he called the premise of Andy seeking Wallace's help [...] "iffy ... even if it was predictable". Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave wrote, [...] "The immediate, don't over-analyze opinion here is that 'Turf War' is a top three episode of season 8, with a chance of it being number one." [...] Furthermore, he concluded that the episode [...] "was good, very good, and a nice way to get set for the season/series finale. ... The Office can still bring it when it wants to." ...|$|E

On the other hand, Andy Hanley from UK Anime Network said despite his similar design and actions to his father Naruto, Boruto is not like him and has a different personality. Amy McNulty from Anime News Network and Hanley enjoyed Boruto's relationship with his father Naruto due to the differences in their childhoods and how that becomes {{the focus of the}} film Boruto: Naruto the Movie. McNulty also liked how Boruto develops as he became afraid of his father's fate during an attack from the antagonist. She praised Amanda C. Miller's role as Boruto's English actor, but feeling the voice often sounded more feminine that his Japanese counterpart. Christian Chiok from Japanator enjoyed Boruto's character development, his relationship with his father, and how <b>heartwarming</b> it becomes in the movie. Alexandria Hill from Otaku USA enjoyed Boruto's fight against the film's villain and his team up with Naruto and Sasuke. Chris Zimmerman from DVD Talk noted how the writers fairly conceived Boruto's poor relationship with his father and how it improves during the climax of the film. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised how the writers manage to develop Boruto's angst without coming across as [...] "teen whinning" [...] and how Sasuke Uchiha decides to train him upon seeing his similarities with his father. Leroy Douresseaux liked how Boruto's character has already started development by the second volume of the series.|$|E

This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, [...] "Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and <b>heartwarming</b> story about love against all odds." [...] Reactions to Grant's Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, [...] "Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out." [...] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with, what the New York Times called, [...] "a delightfully funny deadpan." [...] Grant also released his second production output, a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role. Roger Ebert thought, [...] "Hugh Grant is wrong for the role [...] strikes one wrong note and then another," [...] whereas Kenneth Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said, [...] "If he'd been on the Titanic, fewer lives would have been lost.

Puccio|publisher=DVD Town.com}} Desson Howe of The Washington Post gave the film a very positive review, particularly praising Rhys Ifans' performance as Spike. James Sanford gave Notting Hill three and a half stars, saying that [...] "Curtis' dialogue may be much snappier than his sometimes dawdling plot, but the first hour of Notting Hill is so beguiling and consistently funny it seems churlish to complain that the rest is merely good." [...] Sue Pierman of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated that [...] "Notting Hill is clever, funny, romantic– and oh, yes, reminiscent of Four Weddings and a Funeral", but that the film [...] "is so satisfying, it doesn't pay to nitpick." [...] Roger Ebert praised the film, saying [...] "the movie is bright, the dialogue has wit and intelligence, and Roberts and Grant are very easy to like." [...] Kenneth Turan gave a good review, concluding that [...] "the film's romantic core is impervious to problems". CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said that Notting Hill [...] "stands alone as another funny and <b>heartwarming</b> story about love against all odds".|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward <b>heartwarming</b> tale of what really matters during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has been anything but. Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E
