40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the announcement of special dividends for a sample of Australian companies over the period July 1989 to June 2002. The risk-adjusted price reaction to special dividend announcements from the day before the announcement to the day after the announcement (day - 1 to day 1) is positive and statistically significant, averaging 3. 67 per cent. <b>Initial</b> special <b>dividend</b> announcements (4. 68 per cent) led to stronger price reaction than special dividend announcements that follow an earlier special dividend (1. 51 per cent) in the previous year. The magnitude of price reactions to special dividend announcements is statistically related {{to the size of the}} special dividend, the existence of prior special dividend announcements, abnormal cash flow for the year ended after the special dividend announcement, the existence of dividend reinvestment plans (DRP) versus non-DRP, and a preannouncement effect. Finally, we found strong support for the information content/signalling hypothesis for special dividend announcements that do not participate in DRP and limited support for those associated with DRP.

40|$|This study overviews the {{performance}} of the NCREIF Property Index, by property type, over the twenty-year period ended in 1998. More exactly, performance is analyzed {{from the perspective of the}} fundamental sources of return: <b>initial</b> earnings yield, <b>dividend</b> payout ratios, earnings growth, shifts in capitalization rates and other (less significant) effects. (While this approach is here applied to private real estate equities, nothing precludes its application to a variety of other investment classes.) Our results indicate the fundamental sources that have contributed to the Index's considerable cross-sectional variation as well as its time-series variation. Therefore, this study should be viewed as a useful historical account for those interested in understanding the "ex post" return-generating process of the Index and its property-type components as well as those who wish to model the "ex ante" return-generating process for a variety of applications in both the equity and debt markets-regardless of whether the securities are publicly or privately traded.

A sample of 171 firms meeting the selection criteria covering a five-year period from 1999 - 2003 was examined. The regression analysis was used to test the hypothesis that the examined variables affect the level of IOS in each of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s life cycle. The findings indicated that on the <b>initial</b> expansion stage, <b>dividend</b> yield was found to have negative effect on IOS, profitability and systematic risk had positive effect. On the final expansion stage, three variables namely leverage, profitability, and systematic risk all had positive effect on IOS. For mature stage, two variables, leverage and profitability were found to have significant effect. Whilst, for decline stage, only leverage was found to have significant effect. Overall, this study suggested that the life cycle stage affect the decisions of management in their investment strategies...|$|R
40|$|We model an {{investment}} in a foreign subsidiary, the outside finance to which is injected by its parent company from abroad. Sinn’s (1993) initial “underinvestment” problem due to taxes on repatriated dividends is argued to also concern all follow-up investments of the subsidiary financed from its marginal profits that represent the required return on the <b>initial</b> investment. The <b>dividend</b> tax capitalization hypothesis in the international context, or the Sinn-Hartman neutrality theorem, is valid only if the initial investment generates intra-marginal profits and concerns their reinvestment, the returns of which are repatriated dividends. The results reveal that the ownership structure of the parent and the consequent tax preference for dividends affect foreign source intra-marginal profits differently from domestic source ones. In particular, the cost of capital for foreign intra-marginal profits is inversely affected by the home-country dividend tax. We calibrate the cost of capital formulae to the parameter values of the Estonian and Finnish systems of taxing international investment income. The calculations show that the Estonian subsidiaries, paying no tax on undistributed profits but a corporate dividend tax, offer tax benefits to their parent companies only by their intra-marginal profits...|$|R
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the dividend policy of German firms is more flexible than the one of their Anglo-American counterparts. This paper analyses the decision to change the dividend for a panel of 221 German firms from 1984 to 1994. The choice of the period of study is motivated by the fact that at the start of this period there was an economic boom which was followed by a recession. Consistent with the traditional dividend literature, e. g. Lintner (1956), net earnings are key determinants of the decision to change the dividend. However, the study comes up with two findings which are contrary to Lintner (1956) and Miller and Modigliani (1961). First, the level of net earnings is not the only key determinant of the dividend decision, as the occurrence of a loss - whatever its magnitude - has an explanatory power exceeding the one of the level of the loss. Second, dividend cuts or omissions tend to be temporary and the majority of German firms quickly (within two years) revert to their <b>initial</b> <b>dividend</b> level. This stands in marked contrast with DeAngelo et al. (1992) who find that US firms are more likely to reduce their dividend when earnings deteriorate on a permanent basis. Furthermore, the fact that German firms frequently omit and cut their dividend and quickly return to their <b>initial</b> <b>dividend</b> suggests that dividends in Germany have less of a signalling role than dividends in the US and the UK. Our findings also contradict Bhattacharya's (1979) argument that the costs of dividend changes are asymmetric with dividend reductions being more costly to the firm than dividend increases. Finally, we find evidence that firms with banks as their major shareholder are more willing to omit their dividend than firms controlled by other types of shareholder. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of dividend initiations on shareholders’ wealth using a sample of 38 Greek listed firms. Design/methodology/approach – The event study methodology of Brown and Warner was employed to examine the share price reaction to <b>initial</b> <b>dividend</b> announcements across different information environments. Findings – Results show that dividend initiations bring about significant positive abnormal returns in the announcement period. The price response to dividend initiations is inversely associated with the information environment. Finally, the volatility of stock returns is higher in the low information environment group of firms than in the high information environment group of firms. Research limitations/implications – The observations are not many, although the whole population is included, since there are no data available prior to 2000. Practical implications – These findings are useful to researchers, practitioners and investors who have an interest in firms listed on the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) for their proper strategic decision making. Originality/value – For the first time the stock price behaviour of firms listed on the ASE around dividend initiation announcement dates is examined.

40|$|The {{literature}} survey on dividends shows that more explanation is needed though existing theories contribute considerably {{to the understanding}} of dividends including the rationale of paying dividends, smoothing of dividends, and greater frequency of dividend payments compared to stock repurchases. The purpose of this thesis is to explain the dividend phenomena using a reputation model in the world of imperfect information. In a two-period version of the model, the rationale of paying dividends and smoothing is analyzed. However, the reputation effect and the time pattern of dividends cannot be easily accommodated. We extend the model into a three-period model in which the behavior of dividends through time, and the market response on the change in dividends are analyzed. The reputation effect is incorporated such that the reliability of signalling improves with the passage of time. ^ New empirical results which support the reputation model are presented. The market response to the <b>initial</b> <b>dividend</b> announcement is analyzed using all the cases of dividend initiation recorded on the CRSP daily stock files from July 2, 1962, to December 31, 1987. For firms which announce dividends during their first year on a major exchange, the abnormal return on the announcement date of initial dividends is not significant. Also, the change in the magnitude of the market response to the change in dividends through time is analyzed. We group the announcements of dividend increases according to the number of years passed after the initiation of dividends. The market 2 ̆ 7 s response to unexpected dividend increases in earlier periods is smaller than the case of unexpected dividend increases in later periods. ^ The reputation model adds a new perspective to the analysis of dividends: the time aspect of dividends, that is, the effect of a consistent stream of dividend payments on the value of a firm. This model has direct applicability to all areas of dividends to better explain the dividend phenomena. ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aims and}} {{objectives}} of my thesis are to test the various conflicting hypotheses developed in the previous literature to explain firms’ dividend policy, focusing specifically on IPOs and cross-country analysis. In particular, I explore the theoretical links {{in the context of the}} important dividend theories including signalling, agency costs, lifecycle and catering and then empirically test the hypotheses by using a very large dataset of UK IPOs from 1990 to 2010, which is extracted from offering prospectuses. The first empirical study focuses on two aspects of post-IPO decision-making: the decision to initiate dividends and the timing of dividend initiation. I develop the testable hypotheses by linking the dividend decisions of IPOs with a number of firm characteristics and IPO-specific factors in the context of the theories relating to dividends and IPO. I find a strong negative relation between underpricing and the propensity of dividend initiation. This finding is in line with the implications of Dividend Discount Model and Rock’s (1986) “winner’s curse”. My results show that the likelihood of initiating dividends is positively associated with managerial ownership, underwriter reputation, firm size, profitability and long-term debt ratio. In addition, the results show that the initiation propensity is negatively influenced by a serial of factors including the length of lockup period, VC backing, managerial stock option, growth opportunities of IPOs, technology intensity, and selection of growth stock exchange (i. e. AIM). Finally, I find that the IPOs issued in the years when the market put a price premium on dividend paying payers are more likely to pay dividend after IPO and initiate dividends earlier. Overall, my results show that IPO characteristics relate to dividend decisions of IPOs through miscellaneous mechanisms of dividends. The most homogeneous results are associated with the life cycle and catering theories. There is also some empirical evidence in support of signaling and agency theory. The second empirical study examines the determinants on the dividend policies stated in IPO prospectuses. At the stage of preparing for IPO, pre-IPO financial status is very likely to influence the <b>initial</b> <b>dividend</b> policies. My results provide strong evidence that IPOs that experienced superior performance in profitability and cash inflow from operating activities during pre-IPO period tend to make active dividend policies relatively, consistent with the implication of Lintner (1956) and Benartzi, Michaely and Thaler (1997). My results also show that IPOs with higher turnover ratio and lower capital expenditures tend to choose more active dividend policies when going public, consistent with residual theory and free cash flow hypothesis. In addition, the possibility of choosing relatively active dividend strategies at IPO stage is negatively associated with VC backing, length of full lock-up restriction period, stock option, technology focus, and institutional ownership. In contrast, IPOs with more reputable underwriters tend to declare relatively active dividend policy in prospectuses. The evidence relating to long-term debt ratio and managerial ownership is weak. Moreover, IPOs issued in the ‘internet bubble’ period or in 2000 s opt for relatively conservative dividend strategies. The overall results in this empirical chapter support lifecycle theory, substitution assumption-based agency theory and free cash flow hypothesis, while the evidence on signaling and catering theories is mixed. Furthermore, my results support the conjecture that IPOs with active dividend policies release sufficient information through dividend policies declared in offering prospectuses and therefore their formal dividend initiations fail to shock the market. I find that dividend- paying companies outperform non-dividend paying counterparts during three post-IPO years, indicating that non-dividend initiating IPOs rather than dividend-initiating ones account for the decline in long-run underperformance. Additionally, I find evidence in support of the conjecture that the dividend policies stated in prospectuses communicate the information, and thus reduce the possibilities that outside investors are overoptimistic over the prospect of the invested companies and that managers overstate the pre-IPO financial data at IPO stage. The third empirical study examines the trends in dividend policies across seven western countries: U. S., Candada, U. K., Germany, France, Japan and Hong Kong. In general, the proportion of dividend paying firms fell significantly from 1989 through to the early 2000 s, with the exception of Japanese firms. Thereafter, the percentage reverted slightly in the US, Canada, Japan and in Hong Kong, but continued to decrease in UK, France, and Germany. In contrast, the aggregate amount of dividends increased continuously across countries and firms retained stable dividend payout ratios, and total payout ratios relatively. Share repurchases took over from dividends as the dominant payout method in the US and the increasing importance of repurchases is observed in Canada and in the UK as well. A declining propensity to pay dividends is seen in all the sample countries apart from in Japan, controlling for key firm characteristics. I find that the likelihood that firms payout dividends or repurchase shares positively correlates with firm’s size, profitability and the ratio of earned/contributed capital, and negatively related to long-term debt ratio. The impact of growth opportunities on payout decisions is not uniform across countries, in line with Denis and Osobov (2008). There is some evidence that cash holdings have a negative relation with the probability of paying dividends and a positive relation with the probability of buying back shares. There is also some evidence that R&D expenditure and technology intensity have a negative influence on a firm’s tendency to pay dividends, but such influence is country-dependent. The effect of M&A on the incidence of payouts is highly country-dependant. For example, US acquirers are reluctant to pay dividends while UK acquirers are more likely to pay dividends. I also examine the determinants of the amounts of corporate payouts. Profitability, growth rate of total assets, and retained earnings are important positive factors in determining dividend amounts. Market to book ratio have a significantly positive effect on both dividend amounts and the repurchase amounts, consistent with Lee and Suh (2011), Alzahrani and Lasfer (2012). Finally, the empirical tests using Lintner model indicate that the link between cash dividends and earnings has weakened, in support of Choe (1990) and Brav, Graham, Harvey, and Michaely (2005). In line with Eije and Megginson (2008), the data demonstrates that dividends are still responsive to earnings. Overall, the evidence in this empirical chapter supports agency cost-based lifecycle theory. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
