40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates {{utilization}} of silicon carbide (SiC) Schottky power <b>diodes</b> as inverter <b>Free</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Diodes</b> (FWD) in a commercially available standard Econopak module also packaged with latest generation low-loss IGBT silicon. Static and switching characteristics of SiC diodes over standard module operating temperature 25 0 C to 125 0 C (298 0 K- 398 0 K) are measured. Module Turn-on, Turn-off and conduction losses vs. frequency are calculated and measured for three phase motor drive operation. Measurements are compared to standard modules using all Silicon (Si) IGBT- diode. System benefits justifying the increased SiC diode cost, such as EMI reduction, increased efficiency, reduced magnetic filter volume and reduced cooling requirements at higher allowable switching frequencies is investigated...|$|R
40|$|The BTF {{power supply}} {{is used to}} extract from the beam {{transfer}} line the particles pulses coming from the LINAC which normally fill the DAFNE collider at Frascati INFN Lab. This new power converter {{has been designed to}} feed a bending magnet with 447 Â A at nominal conditions and with a total ramp up and down of 20 Â ms. This power converter can run either in pulsed mode or in a conventional DC current mode. In pulsed mode the flat top can be streched from 5 Â  ms up to 960 Â ms allowing a multi-pulse extraction. The heart of the system is based on a static converter with an H bridge topology made of IGBTs with integrated <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>diodes.</b> On one hand this paper presents the analysis of the thermal behaviour, the fatigue estimation and the impact on the power converter life time.

40|$|This {{paper will}} present two newly {{developed}} hybrid power modules designed for low cost, compact, motor drives. The first, is a miniaturized {{version of the}} transfer molded DIP-IPM which has been previously presented [6][7]. It will be shown that this new device offers significant size and manufacturability advantages compared to discrete approaches using TO- 220 copackaged IGBTs. The second, is a module intended to simplify small motor drives employing Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM). It will be shown that increased system efficiency, high input power factor, and reduced harmonics are achieved {{through the use of}} an optimized trench gate IGBT with a custom control IC to provide boost type power factor correction. I. THE DIP-IPM Historically, small motor drives for consumer appliance applications have relied mainly on discrete copackaged (containing both IGBT and <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>diode)</b> devices in TO- 220 or TO- 247 packages. The main drawback of this approach is its cumbersome assembly that requires mounting and isolating multiple packages. Previously, an isolated, transfer molded, hybrid device called DIP-IPM was proposed [11][12] as a new approach for these applications. The DIP-IPM series is designed for basic speed control in consumer applianc...|$|R
40|$|In power electronics, MOSFET {{transistors}} are continuously being important due {{to their}} low switching losses at high frequencies. However, a regular power MOSFET suffers from a relatively low breakdown voltage. In the late 1990 ’s the super junction MOSFET transistor was launched. It combines the low on state losses of an IGBT and the low switching losses of a MOSFET. In this project CoolMOS transistors from Infineon Technologies has been used. These {{are based on the}} super junction topology. The purpose of this project was to design, build and evaluate a two quadrant step down DC/DC converter with CoolMOS transistors and silicon -carbide Schottky <b>diodes</b> as <b>free</b> <b>wheeling</b> <b>diodes.</b> Based on the results, conclusions will be made about the transistor topology’s suitability for a high power application, for instance in a hybrid vehicle. Because {{of the structure of the}} CoolMOS, a diode has been put in series to prevent the current to flow in the negative direction through the transistors during its off state. From the simulation and measurements, the basic function of the two quadrant step down converter circuit is verified. The main problem with the circuit is the stray inductance in the wires and the capacitance in the series diode and transistors. These phenomena result in transients of the current through the transistors and in the voltage across the transistors. To prevent the transients, tighter design to minimize the stray inductance and capacitance must be achieved. An alternative is to construct a snubber to minimize the transients. The features of the CoolMOS are suitable for high power application due to its low losses. In such an application the bridge should be built as a single chip for optimal design and usability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} different current patterns used {{to identify}} the correct fault signatures in Voltage Source Inverters (VSI). At the beginning, the Authors consider the currents patterns from which a simple or a double fault can be encompassed both {{in the case of}} controllable device only or with its <b>free</b> <b>wheeling</b> companion <b>diode.</b> After the discussion of diagnosis algorithm suitable for electrical drives and principally based on a persistent near zero current condition current in the natural phase reference frame, the stationary reference frame is then considered as a tool to identify both the faulted phase as the device or various combination of faulted devices. On the contrary, the Authors finally demonstrate as in a rotating reference frame such informations are irretrievably lost. In the rotating reference frame only the presence of a open circuit fault can be detected without further elements to decide what phase or devices are then involved in. For this reason the stationary system appears the only satisfactory tool to provide all the diagnostic information both in order to schedule a maintenance operation or to hypothesize a reconfiguration of the VSI with the purpose of its possible fault tolerant operation...|$|R

40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} indicates that intrinsic differences and induced changes in aerobic capacity are probably to {{play a critical role}} in the development of chronic diseases like cancer. This study was initiated: (i) to determine how citrate synthase activity, which is routinely used as a marker of aerobic capacity and mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle, was affected by voluntary running on either a motorized activity wheel or a non-motorized <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> and (ii) to investigate the association between aerobic capacity and the carcinogenic response induced in the mammary gland by intraperitoneal injection of 1 -methyl- 1 -nitrosurea. Overall, wheel running reduced cancer incidence (96 versus 72 %, P =[*] 0. 0006) and the number of cancers per animal (2. 84 versus 1. 78, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and induced citrate synthase activity (276 versus 353 U/mg, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001, sedentary control versus wheel running,respectively). Both motorized and <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> running increased citrate synthase activity (373 [*]±[*] 24, 329 [*]±[*] 11 and 276 [*]±[*] 9 U/mg protein, P[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and reduced the average number of cancers per rat (2. 84, 1. 96 and 1. 63, P[*]<[*] 0. 01), sedentary control, <b>free</b> <b>wheel</b> and motorized wheel, respectively. However, regression analyses failed to provide evidence of a significant association between citrate synthase activity and either cancer incidence or cancer multiplicity. Citrate synthase activity is a single measure in a complex pathway that determines aerobic capacity. The multifaceted nature of intrinsic and inducible aerobic capacity limits the usefulness of citrate synthase activity alone in elucidating the relationship between aerobic capacity and the carcinogenic response...|$|R
