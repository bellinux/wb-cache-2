5|$|Kenji {{receives}} an e-mail with a mathematical code and cracks it. Love Machine, an artificial intelligence written by Wabisuke, uses Kenji's account and avatar to hack the infrastructure, causing widespread damage. Kenji, Sakuma, and Natsuki's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa (Mitsuki Tanimura) confront Love Machine. Love Machine defeats Kazuma's avatar King Kazma {{and continues to}} consume accounts in the OZ mainframe, creating catastrophic traffic congestion and disabling <b>electrical</b> <b>devices.</b> Two of Sakae's relatives, Rika (Sakiko Tamagawa) and Shota Jinnouchi (Yutaka Shimizu), discover Kenji's involvement. Shota arrests Kenji, but the congestion causes Natsuki to return them to the estate.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors. Many <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E

5|$|The {{country has}} {{developed}} into a centre of Islamic banking, and is {{the country with the}} highest numbers of female workers in that industry. Knowledge-based services are also expanding. To create a self-reliant defensive ability and support national development, Malaysia privatised some of its military facilities in the 1970s. The privatisation has created defence industry, which in 1999 was brought under the Malaysia Defence Industry Council. The government continues to promote this sector and its competitiveness, actively marketing the defence industry. Science policies in Malaysia are regulated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. The country is one of the world's largest exporters of semiconductor devices, <b>electrical</b> <b>devices,</b> and IT and communication products. Malaysia began developing its own space programme in 2002, and in 2006, Russia agreed to transport one Malaysian to the International Space Station as part of a multibillion-dollar purchase of 18 Russian Sukhoi Su-30MKM fighter jets by the Royal Malaysian Air Force.

25|$|Fuel cells come in many varieties; {{however, they}} all {{work in the}} same general manner. They are made up of three {{adjacent}} segments: the anode, the electrolyte, and the cathode. Two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments. The net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed, water or carbon dioxide is created, and an electric current is created, which can be used to power <b>electrical</b> <b>devices,</b> normally referred to as the load.|$|E

Homeowners have used their own methods to remove mounds by pouring boiling water on them or igniting them with flammable liquids. Although these methods may be effective, they are not recommended because they can be harmful to humans and the environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanism}} of over-voltage is analyzed {{according to the}} problems that insulated equipment is breakdown and threat to traffic safety when locomotive goes through overlapping <b>electrical</b> sectioning <b>device</b> which generate over-voltage. The model of overlapping <b>electrical</b> sectioning <b>device</b> is established by using PSCAD software. By comparing the size of overvoltage when locomotive goes through seven and eight-span overlapping <b>electrical</b> sectioning <b>device,</b> and RC protection devices is installed in seven-span overlapping <b>electrical</b> sectioning <b>device.</b> It can be introduced: inhibitory effect is significant by installing RC protection devices in the neutral line for over-voltage. Inhibitory effect will be more obvious by installing RC protection devices in the neutral line for over-voltage compared to seven-span overlapping <b>electrical</b> sectioning <b>device...</b>|$|R
25|$|Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti {{went into}} this {{business}} in 1882 when {{he set up a}} shop in London designing various <b>electrical</b> <b>devices.</b> Ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on, {{and was one of the}} few experts in this system in the UK. With the help of Lord Kelvin, Ferranti pioneered the first AC power generator and transformer in 1882. John Hopkinson, a British physicist, invented the three-wire (three-phase) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a patent in 1882.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} wet cells, Gassner's {{dry cell}} was more solid, {{did not require}} maintenance, did not spill, and {{could be used in}} any orientation. It provided a potential of 1.5 volts. The first mass-produced model was the Columbia dry cell, first marketed by the National Carbon Company in 1896. The NCC improved Gassner's model by replacing the plaster of Paris with coiled cardboard, an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble. It was the first convenient battery for the masses and made portable <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> practical, and led directly to the invention of the flashlight.|$|E
