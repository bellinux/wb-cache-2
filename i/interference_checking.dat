50|$|Starting {{around the}} mid 1970s, as {{computer}} aided design systems began to provide more capability than just an ability to reproduce manual drafting with electronic drafting, the cost benefit for companies to switch to CAD became apparent. The benefits of CAD systems over manual drafting are the capabilities one often takes for granted from computer systems today; automated generation of Bill of Material, auto layout in integrated circuits, <b>interference</b> <b>checking,</b> and many others. Eventually CAD provided the designer {{with the ability to}} perform engineering calculations. During this transition, calculations were still performed either by hand or by those individuals who could run computer programs. CAD was a revolutionary change in the engineering industry, where draftsmen, designers and engineering roles begin to merge. It did not eliminate departments, as much as it merged departments and empowered draftsman, designers and engineers. CAD is just another example of the pervasive effect computers were beginning to have on industry.Current computer-aided design software packages range from 2D vector-based drafting systems to 3D solid and surface modelers. Modern CAD packages can also frequently allow rotations in three dimensions, allowing viewing of a designed object from any desired angle, even from the inside looking out. Some CAD software is capable of dynamic mathematical modeling, in which case it may be marketed as CAD.|$|E

40|$|The most {{intuitive}} memory consistency {{model for}} shared-memory multi-threaded programming is sequential consistency (SC). However, current concurrent programming languages support a relaxed model, as such relaxations are deemed necessary for enabling important optimizations. This paper demonstrates that an SC-preserving compiler, one that ensures that every SC {{behavior of a}} compiler-generated binary is an SC behavior of the source program, retains most of the performance benefits of an optimizing compiler. The key observation is that a large class of optimizations crucial for performance are either already SC-preserving or can be modified to preserve SC while retaining much of their effectiveness. An SC-preserving compiler, obtained by restricting the optimization phases in LLVM, a state-of-the-art C/C++ compiler, incurs an average slowdown of 3. 8 % and a maximum slowdown of 34 % {{on a set of}} 30 programs from the SPLASH- 2, PARSEC, and SPEC CINT 2006 benchmark suites. While the performance overhead of preserving SC in the compiler is much less than previously assumed, it might still be unacceptable for certain applications. We believe there are several avenues for improving performance without giving up SC-preservation. In this vein, we observe that the overhead of our SC-preserving compiler arises mainly from its inability to aggressively perform a class of optimizations we identify as eager-load optimizations. This class includes common-subexpression elimination, constant propagation, global value numbering, and common cases of loop-invariant code motion. We propose a notion of <b>interference</b> <b>checks</b> in order to enable eager-load optimizations while preserving SC. <b>Interference</b> <b>checks</b> expose to the compiler a commonly used hardware speculation mechanism that can efficiently detect whether a particular variable has changed its value since last read...|$|R

This study aims to propose a set of principles to be followed for the planning of bending sequences and selection of bending tools for 2. 5 D sheet metals. To this end, we first define basic bending patterns by characterizing each pattern with a set of operation rules.

LayTracks combines {{the merits of}} two popular direct techniques for quad mesh generation - Quad meshing by decomposition and Advancing front quad meshing. The algorithm uses the MAT to lay rails across an arbitrary set of connected planar patches. Each rail starts from a node on the boundary and propagates towards the MA and then from the MA towards the boundary. Quadrilateral elements are then obtained by placing nodes on these rails and connecting them inside each track formed by adjacent rails. Spacing between the rails and between the nodes on the rails are xed at the boundary of the region.

Using BIM technology, an accurate building model with precise geometry and other AEC-relevant data can be constructed in a virtual environment throughout the lifecycle of the building. BIM models are thus referred to as computer-generated models that utilize parameters of model elements to support the construction, fabrication and procurement activities required to realize the building (Eastman et al., 2011 : 1 – 2). The 3 D modeling and visualization provided by the BIM software can effectively discover and solve hidden problems that previously could not be detected until construction was completed. By using different viewpoints, reviewers are able to conduct <b>interference</b> <b>checking</b> between systems and thus reduce unnecessary design conflicts. Also, the computational representation of a BIM model can offer a simultaneous visual representation, which allows discussion of design ideas and analytical tests during the BIM-based design process (Wang et al., 2010).|$|E
