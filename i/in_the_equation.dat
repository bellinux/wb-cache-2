25|$|If {{the desired}} glass {{property}} {{is not related}} to crystallization (e.g., liquidus temperature) or phase separation, linear regression can be applied using common polynomial functions up to the third degree. Below is an example equation of the second degree.

The glass main component silica (SiO2) is excluded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> below because of over-parametrization due to the constraint that all components sum up to 100%.

25|$|For this equation, the {{differences}} between all pairs must be calculated. The pairs are either one person's pre-test and post-test scores or between pairs of persons matched into meaningful groups (for instance drawn from the same family or age group: see table). The average (XD) and standard deviation (sD) of those differences are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation.</b> The constant μ0 is non-zero {{if you want to}} test whether the average of the difference is significantly different from μ0.

True time deviates from the mechanical average of a clock by as much as +/-16 minutes throughout the year. These variations are codified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> of time.

25|$|A {{chemical}} reaction is {{a transformation of}} some substances into one or more different substances. The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms {{on the left and}} the right <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of {{chemical reaction}}s a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.|$|E
25|$|Seniors’ {{subjective}} health remains {{relatively stable}} while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, {{it seems that}} the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation.</b> This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance their perception of their own health through social comparison; for instance, the older people get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.|$|E
25|$|We may {{calculate}} {{the ratio of}} the populations of the two states at room temperature (T≈300K) for an energy difference ΔE that corresponds to light of a frequency corresponding to visible light (ν≈5×1014Hz). In this case ΔE = E2 - E1 ≈ 2.07eV, and kT ≈ 0.026eV. Since E2 - E1 ≫ kT, it follows that the argument of the exponential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> above is a large negative number, and as such N2/N1 is vanishingly small; i.e., there are almost no atoms in the excited state. When in thermal equilibrium, then, it is seen that the lower energy state is more populated than the higher energy state, and this is the normal state of the system. As T increases, the number of electrons in the high-energy state (N2) increases, but N2 never exceeds N1 for a system at thermal equilibrium; rather, at infinite temperature, the populations N2 and N1 become equal. In other words, a population inversion (N2/N1 > 1) can never exist for a system at thermal equilibrium. To achieve population inversion therefore requires pushing the system into a non-equilibrated state.|$|E

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to admit that he seems an insignificant third factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
25|$|Plans for the JJB Stadium {{were first}} {{published}} in 1997. Contracts for the new stadium were signed in late 1997 and work began immediately.

Wigan Warriors did not figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> until Dave Whelan bought the rugby league club some 12 months later after protracted negotiations with {{the directors of the}} rugby league club. The modern all-seater stadium was officially opened on 4 August 1999. Its inauguration was marked with a friendly between Wigan and neighbours Manchester United, who were then reigning European Champions, with Alex Ferguson officially opening the stadium. However, Wigan Athletic hosted Morecambe three days earlier on 1 August as a dress rehearsal for the official opening against Manchester United. The game was played during a violent electrical storm and torrential rain, even so, 4,020 supporters attended and the game ended in a goalless draw. The first competitive football match took place on 7 August 1999, with Wigan Athletic facing Scunthorpe United in a Division 2 match. Simon Haworth scored twice, including the first competitive goal at the new stadium, as Athletic won 3–0.|$|E
