And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have – sort of give people a little break {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this <b>information,</b> <b>you</b> can just sort of – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film.

If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". [...] Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied [...] "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece".

500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger.

[...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the <b>information</b> <b>you</b> need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business.

2500|$|Continuous {{conveyor}} belt fragmentation measurements in the comminution plant {{can provide an}} instantaneous tool for process control.

[...] For example, the primary crusher product is a good location to measure, since {{you are able to}} control the size that the crusher is producing with slight adjustments to the crusher ensuring that the downstream comminution circuit is receiving a consistent product to help reduce variability in the process. [...] In addition to the continuous particle size analysis, the database of belt material size can be used for simulations and for further process analysis to help increase process efficiency and throughput.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people may}} be better [...] "lie detectors" [...] than others, better able to {{distinguish}} a lie by facial expression, cadence of speech, certain movements, consistency, and other methods. According to David J. Lieberman, PhD, in Never Be Lied to Again: How to Get the Truth in Five Minutes or Less in Any Conversation or Situation, these methods can be learned. Some methods of questioning {{may be more likely}} to elicit the truth, for instance: [...] "When was the last time you smoked marijuana?" [...] (a leading question) is more likely to get a truthful answer than [...] "Do you smoke pot?" [...] Asking the question most likely to get the <b>information</b> <b>you</b> want is a skill and can be learned. Avoiding vague questioning will help avoid lies of omission or vagueness.|$|E
