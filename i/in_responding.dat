The chapter will review research findings that indicate correlations between speed <b>in</b> flexible relational <b>responding</b> and higher scores on IQ tests. Relevant to flexibility <b>in</b> relational <b>responding,</b> research has demonstrated that children with autism showed poorer flexibility <b>in</b> relational <b>responding</b> than typically-developing peers, and procedures to remediate this type of “rigid” responding are described. Research on derived manding also has practical implications for incorporating derived relational responding into a mand training program to facilitate a “generative” or flexible component...|$|R

While waiting for a response, {{the question of how}} to use any compensation was debated in provincial newspapers and pamphlets. Some, such as Samuel Adams (father of the famous American Revolution leader), advocated placing the money in London banks to serve as backing for the paper currency issued by the colonies. Others, including William Douglass and Thomas Hutchinson, speaker of the General Court, favoured using the compensation to redeem the paper currency and give Massachusetts a hard currency. In 1748 the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle returned Louibourg to France, with Massachusetts still awaiting compensation for its seizure.|$|E
5|$|The 19th Air Brigade's {{primary mission}} was to defend the {{industrial}} facilities in northern Kyūshū, and particularly the iron works at Yawata. The brigade's plans {{for the defense of}} the Western District called for its interceptor aircraft to be concentrated over Yawata and not move far from the area. While this inflexible deployment was considered unsatisfactory by the 19th Air Brigade, it was deemed necessary as few aircraft were available, the only searchlight units needed to facilitate night operations were stationed near Yawata and northern Kyūshū was regarded by the Army as being the most important region in the Western District. Prior to the raid on Yawata the 19th Air Brigade undertook joint planning with anti-aircraft units and implemented a training program which included practice <b>in</b> <b>responding</b> to alerts and night flying.|$|E

Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains, but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light. Social media {{plays a role in}} Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging. Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order <b>in</b> <b>responding</b> to a pandemic.

5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. <b>In</b> <b>responding</b> to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} self-construal on extreme <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> six studies. The results show that people with an independent self-construal generally answer more extremely to survey items than those with an interdependent self-construal, especially when the items are self-relevant (Studies 1 a and 1 b) and when these items are fluently processed (Study 3). Using an experimental causal chain design, this research also demonstrates that self-concept clarity drives the effect of self-construal on extreme <b>responding.</b> <b>In</b> particular, people with an independent self-construal have {{a higher level of}} self-concept clarity (Study 2 a), and self-clarity leads to an extreme response style (Study 2 b). In Study 4, we demonstrate that the difference <b>in</b> extreme <b>responding</b> can partly explain a well-established self-construal effect, and we offer a solution to control for the bias <b>in</b> extreme <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> self-construal research...|$|R
