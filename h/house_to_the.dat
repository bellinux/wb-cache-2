5|$|By 1914 Crowley {{was living}} a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on {{donations}} from A∴A∴ members and dues payments made to O.T.O. In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MMM for financial reasons, and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps.

5|$|Four two storey residences, Numbers 8, 10, 16 and 18 The Terrace, {{were built}} during the 1850s for officer accommodation. Number 8, {{also known as}} the Chaplain's House, is a two storey house with {{rendered}} and painted limestone walls. The plan is roughly square with verandahs and balconies along the west and south sides. A single storey building connects the south-east side of the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main prison wall.|$|E

5|$|In 1880 the Burne-Joneses bought Prospect House in Rottingdean, near Brighton in Sussex, {{as their}} holiday home, {{and soon after}} the next door Aubrey Cottage to create North End House, {{reflecting}} {{the fact that their}} Fulham home was in North End Road. (Years later, in 1923, Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters, and his wife, playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold, were to add the adjacent Gothic <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> property, which became the inspiration and setting for her play The Chalk Garden).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{a decade before}} the tunnel was {{actually}} constructed, a rumor circulated that such a passageway already existed connecting the White <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Treasury Building. According to one account, the rumor started as a joke among journalists covering the White House, but gained serious traction, with some accounts even suggesting that Ogden L. Mills was secretly accessing the White House via the purported passage to meet with President Herbert Hoover.|$|E

5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E
5|$|Perry Ellwood {{undertook}} major renovations which {{added and}} changed rooms in 1910. On the home's exterior the porte cochere was {{moved from the}} south facade to its present position on the north facade. On {{the south side of}} the home a large brick terrace was added and the conservatory moved from the southwest side of the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear (west). The full-length tower on the home's southwest corner was entirely removed during this renovation.|$|E
5|$|Sir Ralph died in 1677, and {{his widow}} let the <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Ormonde from 1686 and 1688. John Bankes the Elder regained the {{property}} in 1693, and with his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Henry Parker of Honington Hall, completed most of his father's original development plan. In 1772 the house passed to his second son Henry who remodelled it, built a servants' wing, and enclosed the parkland for better agricultural management.|$|E

5|$|The estate {{had been}} {{occupied}} since the 11th century {{and by the}} 14th century included a substantial <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north east of the present building, where traces of a moat can still be seen.

5|$|Two large stately homes {{also exist}} within the town. To {{the north of}} Kirkcaldy is Dunnikier House, built {{in the late eighteenth}} century as a seat for the Oswald family, {{replacing}} their previous residence at Path <b>House.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> south-west of Kirkcaldy is Raith House, built in the late seventeenth century by Sir Alexander Raith, 4th Earl of Raith and Melville, for his bride, Barbara Dundas. The house remains a private residence of the Munro-Ferguson family.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E

5|$|Although he had {{defeated}} the Neville brothers, Edward {{had little time}} to rest; Margaret landed at Weymouth {{on the day of}} the battle. She feigned a march to London while augmenting her army with recruits from Wales and the Welsh Marches. The Lancastrian queen was disheartened by the news of Warwick's demise, but Somerset suggested that they were better off without the earl. Despite the defeat at Barnet, Lancastrians who fled from the battle looked to the queen to restore their <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throne. Alerted by his spies to the Lancastrians' true route, Edward intercepted and {{defeated the}}m at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May. Gloucester, Clarence and Hastings again fought to defend the Yorkist crown.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the <b>House</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E

5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting Developments on 16 January 2017 {{to convert the}} pub back into a house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A separate part to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced houses to be constructed on the pub garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a charging station. An additional <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear of the pub was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition {{of the building and}} the proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MTA {{listed the}} Mott Avenue station among the 69 most {{deteriorated}} {{stations in the}} subway system, {{despite the fact that}} the station had become part of the subway system just two decades earlier. From 2009 to 2012, a $117 million renovation took place on the station, replacing the 1950s design of the station house with metallic facades and a dome enclosure, and upgrading several features including staircases and employee areas. Elevators from the station <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> platforms were added, as were yellow tactile warning strips on the platform edges, making the station ADA-accessible. A glass artwork titled Respite was installed as part of the MTA's Arts for Transit program. The renovated station was unveiled on May 11, 2012.|$|E
5|$|In August 1906, a {{group of}} Cleveland Baptists {{incorporated}} an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his <b>house</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who was a Baptist. With the aid of local churches, the home was opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, the Baptist Home served fourteen residents {{at the end of}} 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000. The former Southworth residence was not long a retirement home: the Baptist Home moved to a new location in 1919 and sold the Southworth House in the same year. Since that time, the house has been used {{for a wide range of}} purposes.|$|E
