5|$|Although writing first {{appeared}} during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear until about 2600 BC, {{at the beginning of}} the Old Kingdom. This development marked the beginning of the first known phase of the <b>Egyptian</b> language: Old <b>Egyptian.</b> Old <b>Egyptian</b> remained a spoken language until about 2100 BC, when, during the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, it evolved into Middle <b>Egyptian.</b> While Middle <b>Egyptian</b> was closely related to Old <b>Egyptian,</b> Late <b>Egyptian</b> was significantly different in grammatical structure. Late <b>Egyptian</b> possibly appeared as a vernacular language as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a written language until c. 1300 BC during the Amarna Period of the New Kingdom. Late <b>Egyptian</b> evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|Ancient <b>Egyptian</b> {{literature}} {{was written in}} the <b>Egyptian</b> language from ancient Egypt's pharaonic period until the end of Roman domination. It represents the oldest corpus of <b>Egyptian</b> literature. Along with Sumerian literature, it is considered the world's earliest literature.|$|E
5|$|Ancient <b>Egyptian</b> was a {{synthetic}} language, {{but it became}} more analytic later on. Late <b>Egyptian</b> developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object. The <b>Egyptian</b> hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the <b>Egyptian</b> Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern <b>Egyptian</b> Arabic.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} {{in the time of}} Alexander the Great, the <b>Egyptians</b> summoned the Israelites before Alexander, {{demanding}} from them the gold and silver that [...] reported that the Israelites had borrowed from the <b>Egyptians.</b> The sages granted Gebiah ben Pesisa permission to be Israel's advocate. Gebiah asked the <b>Egyptians</b> what the evidence was for their claim, and the <b>Egyptians</b> answered that the Torah provided their evidence. Then Gebiah said that he would also bring evidence from the Torah in Israel's defense. He quoted [...] and demanded back wages from the <b>Egyptians</b> for the labor of 600,000 Israelite men whom the <b>Egyptians</b> had compelled to work for them for 430 years. Alexander turned to the <b>Egyptians</b> for a proper answer. The <b>Egyptians</b> requested three days' time, but could not find a satisfactory answer, and they fled.|$|R
5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle <b>Egyptian,</b> becoming the dominant form of writing in Late <b>Egyptian.</b> By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of ancient <b>Egyptian</b> history, Middle <b>Egyptian</b> became a classical language that was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs. For the rest of ancient <b>Egyptian</b> history, Middle <b>Egyptian</b> remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle <b>Egyptian</b> was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E

Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through <b>Egyptian</b> defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of <b>Egyptian</b> troops from Sinai—causing the majority of <b>Egyptian</b> casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of <b>Egyptian</b> texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient <b>Egyptian</b> myth. Yet no <b>Egyptian</b> source gives a full account {{of the myth}}, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. Greek and Roman writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect <b>Egyptian</b> beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient <b>Egyptian</b> beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Egyptian</b> {{language}} is a northern Afro-Asiatic language {{closely related to the}} Berber and Semitic languages. It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient <b>Egyptian</b> are Old <b>Egyptian,</b> Middle <b>Egyptian</b> (Classical <b>Egyptian),</b> Late <b>Egyptian,</b> Demotic and Coptic. <b>Egyptian</b> writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.|$|E

5|$|Ancient <b>Egyptian</b> {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible <b>Egyptian</b> background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and <b>Egyptian</b> afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the <b>Egyptian</b> underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the sun {{in the middle of the}} night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient <b>Egyptian</b> funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
2500|$|The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael cited four {{reasons for}} why [...] "Israel saw the <b>Egyptians</b> dead upon the sea-shore," [...] as {{reported}} in [...] (1) so that the Israelites should not imagine that the <b>Egyptians</b> escaped the sea on the other side, (2) so that the <b>Egyptians</b> should not imagine that the Israelites {{were lost in the}} sea as the <b>Egyptians</b> had been, (3) so that the Israelites might take the Egyptians' spoils of silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls, and (4) so that the Israelites might recognize the <b>Egyptians</b> and reprove them.|$|R
60|$|When Joseph entertained his brethren in Egypt, {{they did}} eat {{at a table}} by themselves, and he did eat at another table by himself; and the <b>Egyptians</b> who did eat with him were at another table, because the <b>Egyptians</b> might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that was an abomination to the <b>Egyptians,</b> Gen. xliii. 32. These <b>Egyptians</b> who did eat with Joseph were of the Court of Pharaoh; and {{therefore}} Pharaoh and his Court were at this time not Shepherds but genuine Egyptians; and these <b>Egyptians</b> abominated eating bread with the Hebrews, at {{one and the same}} table: and of these <b>Egyptians</b> and their fellow-subjects, it is said a little after, that every Shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians: Egypt at this time was therefore under the government of the genuine <b>Egyptians,</b> and not under that of the Shepherds.|$|R
5000|$|The Gemara {{noted that}} in [...] Pharaoh said, [...] "Come, let us deal wisely with him," [...] when he should have said [...] "with them." [...] Rabbi Hama ben Hanina said that Pharaoh meant by that: [...] "Come, let us outwit the Savior of Israel." [...] Pharaoh then {{considered}} with what to afflict them. Pharaoh reasoned that if the <b>Egyptians</b> afflicted the Israelites with fire, then [...] indicates that God would punish the <b>Egyptians</b> with fire. If the <b>Egyptians</b> afflicted the Israelites with the sword, then [...] indicates that God would punish the <b>Egyptians</b> with the sword. Pharaoh concluded that the <b>Egyptians</b> should afflict the Israelites with water, because as indicated by [...] God had sworn not to bring another flood to punish the world. The <b>Egyptians</b> failed to note that while God had sworn not to bring another flood on the whole world, God could still bring a flood on only one people. Alternatively, the <b>Egyptians</b> failed to note that they could fall into the waters, {{as indicated by the}} words of [...] "the <b>Egyptians</b> fled towards it." [...] This all bore out what Rabbi Eleazar said: In the pot in which they cooked, they were themselves cooked - that is, with the punishment that the <b>Egyptians</b> intended for the Israelites, the <b>Egyptians</b> were themselves punished.|$|R
5|$|Ancient <b>Egyptian</b> deities are {{the gods}} and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals {{surrounding}} these gods formed the core of ancient <b>Egyptian</b> religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to maat, or divine order. After {{the founding of the}} <b>Egyptian</b> state around 3100BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.|$|E
5|$|Ancient <b>Egyptian</b> {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient <b>Egyptian</b> literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of <b>Egyptian</b> civilization.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek and Roman writers, who {{described}} <b>Egyptian</b> religion late in its history, recorded {{much of the}} Osiris myth. Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE, mentioned parts of the myth in his description of Egypt in The Histories, and four centuries later, Diodorus Siculus provided {{a summary of the}} myth in his Bibliotheca historica. In the early 2nd century AD, Plutarch wrote the most complete ancient account of the myth in De Iside et Osiride, an analysis of <b>Egyptian</b> religious beliefs. Plutarch's account of the myth is the version that modern popular writings most frequently retell. The writings of these classical authors may give a distorted view of <b>Egyptian</b> beliefs. For instance, De Iside et Osiride includes many interpretations of <b>Egyptian</b> belief that are influenced by various Greek philosophies, and its account of the myth contains portions with no known parallel in <b>Egyptian</b> tradition. Griffiths concluded that several elements of this account were taken from Greek mythology, and that the work as a whole was not based directly on <b>Egyptian</b> sources. His colleague John Baines, on the other hand, says that temples may have kept written accounts of myths, which later were lost, and that Plutarch could have drawn on such sources to write his narrative.|$|E

On 19 May the <b>Egyptians</b> attacked Yad Mordechai, where an inferior force of 100 Israelis armed {{with nothing more than}} rifles, a medium machinegun and a PIAT anti-tank weapon, held up a column of 2,500 <b>Egyptians,</b> well-supported by armor, artillery and air units, for five days.
