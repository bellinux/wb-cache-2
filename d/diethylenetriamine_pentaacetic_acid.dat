30|$|Perhaps, {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} at the onset was {{the selection of a}} suitable chelate that could hold the Al 18 F complex stably for several hours under physiological and biological conditions. Aluminum forms octahedral complexes; so ideally, a pentadentate ligand would be desired, leaving one binding site open for the fluoride ion. Naturally, the first ligands to examine would be those known to bind Al 3 +, with the caveat that (AlF) 2 + was the actual material bound to the chelate. However, initially, studies began with a <b>diethylenetriamine</b> <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA) peptide, since DTPA was known to form a stable complex with another group III metal (111 In) [16]. The test peptide, IMP 272 (DTPA-QAK(HSG)YdK(HSG)-NH 2), included two hapten moieties (HSG is histamine-succinyl-glycine) on the lysine side chains for binding to the bsMAb used in pretargeting applications [17].|$|E

Technetium (99 mTc) -diethylene triamine <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA) hydrated clearance studies are accurate for determining GFR but require special facilities for handling and measuring samples. We investigated {{the potential of}} a non-radioactive paramagnetic analog, Gadolinium (Gd) -diethylene triamine <b>pentaacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DTPA), an approved NMR contrast agent, as a glomerular filtration marker. Instead of relying on the radioactivity of technetium, this test {{is based on the}} fact that gadolinium induces alterations in the NMR Tl relaxation times in blood and urine samples. Ninety patients underwent simultaneous determinations of GFR using 1 mCi of Tc-DTPA and 0. 05 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA (Berlex Labs) IV. The patients were hydrated with oral and intravenous fluid. Following a one hour equilibrium period, three or four consecutive urine collections were obtained; plasma samples were acquired at the beginning and end of each approximately 20 -minute interval. 99 mTc-DTPA radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. Tl relaxation times were measured on a 10 MHz NMR spectrometer. These were converted to Gd-DTPA concentration by comparison with standard solutions. The Gd-DTPA derived GFR closely approximated the 99 mTc-DTPA derived GFR which ranged from 15 to 147 ml/min. The equation and correlation coefficient of the regression line is y = 1. 04 × - 2. 2, r = 0. 94. Thus, Gd-DTPA is a safe, non-radioactive indicator of GFR that may provide an alternative renal clearance method for clinical studies of progressive renal disease and nephrotoxicity...|$|R
