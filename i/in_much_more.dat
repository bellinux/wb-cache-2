In ninth grade, Allen decided {{that he wanted to}} be great, and put <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> practice time. He became a starter on the varsity team in his sophomore year. As a junior, he averaged 12 points and nine rebounds per game, and was named a Top 150 player in his class by Hoop Scoop.|$|E
5|$|During the War in Defence of the Constitution in 1792, Piattoli {{found himself}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission to Dresden, where he stayed after the Commonwealth's defeat {{at the hands of}} Imperial Russia resulted in the Second Partition of Poland. In Dresden and nearby Leipzig, Piattoli was active in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Kolłątaj. In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service. In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, and in negotiations with the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland into a second republic in Europe. At the same time, he was involved <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> conservative negotiations with Russians.|$|E

The larger cave on the south side of the west shrine is closed, contains ruins and is bigger than the eastern side shrine. Some of the artworks from here were moved to museums and private collections by mid 19th century, including those related Brahma, Vishnu and others. The western face has two panels, one showing another version of Shiva in Yoga (see 14 on plan) and another Nataraja (see 15 on plan). Between these is a sanctum with a Shiva Linga.|$|E

25|$|A {{differential}} equation is linear if the unknown function and its derivatives have degree 1 (products {{of the unknown}} function and its derivatives are not allowed) and nonlinear otherwise. The characteristic property of linear equations is that their solutions form an affine subspace of an appropriate function space, which results <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> developed theory of linear {{differential equation}}s.|$|E
25|$|The {{screenless}} hammer mill, like regular hammer mills, is used {{to pound}} grain. The screenless hammer mill uses air flow to separate small particles from larger ones, rather than a screen, and is thus more reliable which results <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> energy efficiency. The screenless hammer mill was invented in 1995 by MIT professor and engineer Amy B. Smith.|$|E

25|$|The Nockamixon Cliffs are {{situated}} {{along the river}} {{in such a way}} that the north facing cliffs in Pennsylvania receive little to no direct sunlight, causing their temperatures to be cooler than normal. The cool habitat supports an alpine-Arctic plant community that is very unusual for the latitude of Delaware Canal State Park. The south facing cliffs in New Jersey at Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park have a nearly opposite habitat. They receive a high amount of sunshine, which makes the area near the cliffs warmer and drier than usual, creating a habitat for plants that normally thrive <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> arid areas.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Unix {{was rewritten}} in the C {{programming}} language. The migration from assembly to the higher-level language C resulted <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> portable software, requiring only {{a relatively small}} amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms. Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as Research Unix. In 1975, the first source license for UNIX was sold to Donald B. Gillies at the University of Illinois Department of Computer Science. UIUC graduate student Greg Chesson (who had worked on the UNIX kernel at Bell Labs) was instrumental in negotiating the terms of this license.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} gameplay {{is based}} on that of Dead or Alive 3, with several changes. Like in the other games in the series, fights in Dead or Alive 5 are based on an interruption triangle system in which strikes (normal attacks) beat throws, throws beat holds (strike interception attacks), and holds beat strikes, all of such counterattacks causing extra damage. Tag team battles from the previous DOA games have been retained. The fights take place in interactive and now more highly-destructive arenas. The game's characters are rendered <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> realistic visual style {{than in the previous}} titles in the series, including new details such as the fighters getting sweaty and their clothes getting dirty during the fights, costume-specific breast physics and semi-transparent clothing.|$|E
25|$|As {{the years}} passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used {{corridor}} from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots {{of the trail}} continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 {{the population in the}} states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to get to their new residences.|$|E

25|$|In 1958 the New York market ripped apart. The Yankees were {{becoming}} the dominant draw, and {{the cities of}} the West offered generations of new fans <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour {{of the city and}} asked him to pick his spot. The Giants were given the lease to the PCL San Francisco Seals digs while Candlestick Park was built for them.|$|E
25|$|The Matterhorn {{acquired}} its characteristic pyramidal shape <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{recent times}} {{as it was}} caused by natural erosion over the past million years. At the beginning of alpine orogeny, the Matterhorn was only a rounded mountain like a hill. Because its height is above the snowline, its flanks are covered by ice, resulting from the accumulation and compaction of snow. During the warmer period of summer, part of the ice melts and seeps into the bedrock. When it freezes again, it fractures pieces of rock because of its dilatation (freeze-thaw), forming a cirque. Four cirques led {{to the shape of}} the mountain. Because of its recognizable shape, many other similar mountains around the world were named or nicknamed the 'Matterhorn' of their respective countries or mountain ranges.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally {{born out of}} desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the studio, production crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E
