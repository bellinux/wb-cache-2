In August 2004, the Sugababes released [...] "Caught in a Moment", the fourth and final single from Three, and also confirmed that recording for the group's fourth album had commenced. During their break between September 2004 and August 2005, speculation arose about the band's future, which included rumours of a greatest hits album being released and that the group would later split. Band member Heidi Range expressed her distaste with the media speculation, saying: [...] "You know what? At first it would make us angry, then we'd laugh it off and now we don't even pay any attention to it.

2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay and I have a lot of things to be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from <b>four</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path."
