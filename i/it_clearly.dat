5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> distinguishable {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and stick to the entire underside of the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E
5|$|The Arabic {{uses the}} past tense, {{as if that}} Day were already here, to help the reader/listener imagine how it will be. Some {{traditional}} commentators hold the view that this describes an actual event {{at the time of}} the Prophet, but <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> refers to the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, even though <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> {{met the criteria}} for doing so. Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point. The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific, and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane. It was the only tropical cyclone {{to exist in the}} central Pacific this year. No damage or casualties were reported, although it did hassle a few ships.|$|E

5|$|Nero {{opened on}} 25 February 1705, with Mattheson {{in the title}} role. Its staging so closely after Almira's run {{indicates}} that it was probably composed, in part or in whole, during 1704. There are no surviving accounts of its public reception, but <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> proved less successful than its predecessor, running for just three performances before the theatre closed for the Lenten season. When the Gänsemarkt reopened the opera was not revived, and was never performed again.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is widely}} admired by biologists, anthropologists and architects among others, but less often read than cited. Peter Medawar {{explains}} this as being because <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> pioneered {{the use of}} mathematics in biology, and helped to defeat mystical ideas of vitalism; but that the book is weakened by Thompson's failure to understand the role of evolution and evolutionary history in shaping living structures. Philip Ball and Michael Ruse, on the other hand, suspect that while Thompson argued for physical mechanisms, his rejection of natural selection bordered on vitalism.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E

25|$|Various Ahmadis scholars, such as Muhammad Ali, Maulana Sadr-ud-Din and Basharat Ahmad, {{argue that}} when the Quran's verses are read in context, <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows {{fighting}} only in self-defense.|$|E
25|$|On the PBS website {{page for}} this episode, Valdes interprets {{an excerpt of}} a poem {{reproduced}} there as attesting to Charlotte's African features, but <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> refers to her as descended from the Vandals, an East Germanic tribe.|$|E
25|$|Indo-Scythian coinage is {{generally}} {{of a high}} artistic quality, although <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> deteriorates towards the disintegration of Indo-Scythian rule around AD 20 (coins of Rajuvula).

500|$|In contrast, the British Film Institute's Screenonline website {{praises the}} serial for its {{realistic}} and un-clichéd depiction {{of life in}} the North East England, stating that: [...] "Unlike many depictions of the North-East, it has fully rounded characters with authentic regional accents. <b>It's</b> <b>clearly</b> a real place, not a generic 'up North'." ...|$|R

25|$|The first post-Soviet {{copyright}} {{law of the}} Russian Federation became effective on August 3, 1993. It completely replaced the older Soviet legislation {{that had been in}} effect until then.

25|$|From its {{conception}} in 1919, the IEV’s first aim was {{to establish}} unity among all 3 social layers of the Indo-European community, and was founded under the appropriate motto: ‘One for All, All for One’.

25|$|Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei {{believes}} abrogation in Quranic verses is not {{an indication}} of contradiction but an indication of addition and supplementation. As an example he mentions 2:109 where -according to him- <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> states the forgiveness is not permanent and soon {{there will be another}} command (through another verse) on this subject that completes the matter. He also mentions 4:15 where the abrogated verse indicates its temporariness.|$|E

25|$|The Tower of Justice {{is several}} stories {{high and the}} tallest {{structure}} in the palace, making <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> visible from the Bosphorus as a landmark. The tower was probably originally constructed under Mehmed II and then renovated and enlarged by Suleiman I between 1527-1529.Sultan Mahmud II rebuilt the lantern of the tower in 1825 while retaining the Ottoman base. The tall windows with engaged columns and the Renaissance pediments evoke the Palladian style.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who favor}} the non-sexual {{interpretation}} argue against a denotation {{of sexual behavior}} in this context, noting that while the Hebrew word for know appears over 900 times in the Hebrew Scriptures, only approximately 1% (13–14 times) of those references is <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> used as a euphemism for realizing sexual intimacy. Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand to know as demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
25|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall {{wrote for}} the Supreme Court that the village's {{ordinance}} was neither vague nor overbroad since <b>it</b> <b>clearly</b> defined the items affected and only explicitly prohibited marketing that alluded to their use in consuming illegal controlled substances. Byron White wrote a separate concurrence arguing that the Court need only have considered the vagueness issue since the Seventh Circuit had not considered the overbreadth claim. John Paul Stevens took no part in the case.|$|E
