RESEARCH DESIGNANDMETHODS — A male patient was diagnosed with diabetes at age 17; the metabolic control rapidly worsened to insulin requirement. At that time no relatives {{were known to be}} affected by diabetes, which was diagnosed years later in both the parents (father at age 50 years, mother at age 54 years) and the sister (at age 32 years, during pregnancy). RESULTS — The genetic screening showed a double heterozygosity for the mutation p. <b>E</b> <b>508</b> K in theHNF 1 A/MODY 3 gene and the novel variant p. R 80 Q in theHNF 4 A/MODY 1 gene. The genetic testing of the family showed that the father carried the MODY 3 mutation while the mother, the sister, and her two children carried the MODY 1 mutation. CONCLUSIONS — MODY 1 and MODY 3 mutations may interact by chance to give a more severe form of diabetes (younger age at presentation and early need of insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia). Diabetes Care 33 : 2336 – 2338, 2010 M aturity-onset diabetes of theyoung (MODY) (MIM # 606391) is a genetically and clinically het-erogeneous group of disorders character-ized by early onset of noninsulin-dependent diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. At least seven types of MODY have been identified (1). Heterozygous mutations of the gene en-coding the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 - (HNF 1 A/MODY 3) are the most common causes of MODY in northern Europe and a frequent cause of MODY in many other populations. Mutations in the HNF 4 gene (HNF 4 A/MODY 1) are considerably less common (2, 3).

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} (AI) is an avian {{diseases that}} can cause deadly humaninfection. The disease is caused by Orthomyxoviridae virus, genus influenzavirus type A,subtype H 5 N 1. Pathogenicity of AI virus is polygenic, which means AI virus isdetermined by all the genes. Here the role of coding region (CR) and non-coding region(NCR) of polymerase gene complex is critically reviewed. The coding region of thepolymerase genes can be explained as follows. The amino acid position 627 PB 2 gene isa factor adaptation of AI viruses in mammals. Polymerase basic- 1 (PB 1) protein acts as acentral activity of the enzyme catalyzing the viral polymerase. Polymerase Basic- 1 bindsto the terminal end of the vRNA and the cRNA and shows endo-nuclease activity. Theactivity has been identified on the <b>E</b> <b>508,</b> E 519, and D 522. Polymerase Acid (PA) proteinsplay a role in supporting the biological activity of the polymerase gene complex, but itsmechanism of action in transcription, replication has not been disclosed as clear. Anotherrole of the PA protein is forming a complex of RNA polymerase and express anproteolytic role of cell proteins that suppress cell division. Polymerase acid gene has alsoserine protease activity has been identified at position S 624. The non-coding regionmight also play role in the pathogenecity of influenza virus. The results of sequenceanalysis of non-coding region (NCR) at 5 ’-end of polymerase gene complex of AI virussubtype H 5 N 1 from poultry and pigs in Indonesia showed that the NCR genes PB 2, PB 1 and PA are homogeneous, whereas there are variants of the PB 1 gene isolates from ducksA / Duck / Badung, 2006.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of ATP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP-oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase, (transphosphorylating), E. C. 4. 1. 1. 49; PCK) from Escherichia coli K 12 {{has been determined}} {{using a combination of}} multiple isomorphous replacement and density modification, and refined to a R-index of 0. 202 (R-free = 0. 244) at 1. 9 A resolution. PCK catalyses the decarboxylation and ATP-dependent phosphorylation of oxaloacetate to form phosphoenolpyruvate, the first committed step of gluconeogenesis in E. coli. Each PCK molecule consists of a 275 residue N-terminal and 265 residue C-terminal ar mononucleotide-binding domain, with the active site located within a cleft between the two domains. PCK is an open-faced, mixed α/β protein with a unique overall tertiary structure. The putative phosphate-binding region of the ATP-binding site adopts the P-loop motif common to many ATP- and GTP-binding proteins. However, the â-sheet topology of the mononucleotide-binding fold of PCK differs from all other families within the P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily, suggesting PCK represents the first member of a new family of such proteins. The mononucleotide-binding domain also differs in structure from the classical mononucelotide-binding fold (CMBF), common to adenylate kinase, RecA, p 21 Ha-ras, and elongation factor-Tu. Several highly-conserved amino acid residues among the ATP-dependent PCK family, including R 65, Y 207, K 212, K 213, H 232, K 254, T 255, D 269, K 288 and R 333 appear to make up the active site of the enzyme. A cysteine residue, C 233, is located near the active site, and in the E. coli enzyme this residue is buried and is probably not involved in substrate binding or catalysis. Previous chemical modification studies, on several ATP- and GTP-dependent PCKs, have been assessed in view of these structural results. A mechanism of catalysis based on these and additional results is proposed. The structure of E. coli PCK complexed with the calcium-analogue Tb 3 + has been refined to an R-index of 0. 205 (R-free = 0. 259) at 2. 5 A. Two binding sites for Tb 3 + have been determined, one within the active site coordinating to the side chains of K 213, H 232, and D 269, and the other within the C-terminal domain, coordinating to the side chains of <b>E</b> <b>508</b> and E 511.

This distortion necessitates a high surface {{area to volume ratio}} that is maintained by the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, a network of proteins including spectrin and protein 4. 1. The skeleton anchors the lipid bilayer through attachment to integral membrane proteins, notably the anion exchange protein, band 3. Abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane proteins cause loss of cell elasticity and ultimately the erythrocytes become prematurely trapped in the spleen where they are phagocytosed, resulting in haemolytic anaemia. Three mutations causing band 3 -deficient hereditary spherocytosis (HS), a haemolytic anaemia characterised by spherical erythrocytes, were located using restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Proband A (Black) is heterozygous for band 3 Pinhal (R 490 H) and has mild clinical symptoms. Proband B and his mother (Caucasian) are heterozygous for band 3 Bicetre (R 490 C) and have severe anaemia requiring transfusions and splenectomy, respectively. These results confirm codon 490 as a hotspot for mutations and indicate the effect of different amino acid substitutions in the same position on clinical severity. Proband C (Black) is homozygous for a novel mutation (<b>E</b> <b>508</b> K) for which her parents are heterozygous. The proband is severely affected and transfusion- dependent whereas her father has moderate anaemia and her mother is asymptomatic. It is speculated that a secondary factor modulates their clinical symptoms. All of these mutations occur in a CpG dinucleotide, a common source of DNA mutations, and are located within the highly conserved exon 13, which encodes the third to fifth α-helices and the second extracellular loop of the transmembrane region of band 3. The mutations are likely to alter the conformation of band 3, impairing its insertion into the erythrocyte membrane. No causative mutations were located in another 12 band 3 -deficient HS kindred using restriction enzymes and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Ten protein 4. 1 -deficient patients with hereditary elliptocytosis, a haemolytic anaemia characterised by elliptical erythrocytes, were also studied. Immunoblot analyses ruled out abnormally sized protein 4. 1 and three known DNA mutations were excluded using restriction enzyme analysis. Further studies are required to elucidate the cause of the haemolytic anaemia in these kindred. This study advanced our knowledge of the molecular basis of HS in South African kindred and highlighted the susceptibility of CpG dinucleotides to mutations...|$|E

This study determined the healthcare resources used and related medical costs after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) {{in relation to}} time to shock. We assessed the incremental healthcare costs per life gained from reduction in time to shock of 2, 4, and 6 minutes. Methods and Results - Clinical and costs data of patients in witnessed OHCA with ventricular fibrillation as initial rhythm were collected. Each patient's time to shock was estimated and assigned to 1 of 3 categories: {{less than or equal}} to 7 minutes (early), 7 to 12 minutes (intermediate), and > 12 minutes (late). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis and Monte Carlo simulation compared scenarios of reduction in time to shock of 2, 4, and 6 minutes. Six-month survival was 22 %. Mean prehospital, in-hospital, and posthospital costs in the first half-year after OHCA were E 559, E 6869 and E 666. Mean costs were E 28 636 per survivor and E 2384 per nonsurvivor.

(ii) To what extent is N e correctly linked to N? (iii) How readily is uncertainty accounted for in both N e and N when quantifying N e/N ratios? and (iv) how frequently and to what degree might errors in the estimation of N e or N affect inferences of N e/N ratios? We found that only 20 % of available N <b>e</b> estimates (<b>508</b> of 2617; 233 studies) explicitly attempted to link N e and N; of these, only 31 % (160 of 508) correctly linked N e and N.

40|$|AbstractThe sternum {{is one of}} {{the least}} studied bones of human {{thoracic}} skeleton for sex determination both in forensic anthropology as well as in archeology. In the present study, the relationship between various sternal widths and known sex of the deceased was studied in a sample of 343 adult human sternums based on anthropometric measurements. A comparison was also made with different widely used methods of sex determination. The sternubrial width index was found to be the poorest indicator of sex, whereas all the other variables were equally suitable for sex determination. The criteria of demarking points (calculated from mean± 3 SD) failed in sex determination of the studied sternums. The identification points correctly sexed more percentage of bones than the demarking points which are considered more reliable covering more than 99. 67 % of cases. The limiting points proved to be a best method for almost all the variables, sexing about 70 – 80 % of the sternums examined for this purpose. The multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) of various sternal widths correctly sexed 84 % sternums (Males= 82. 1 %, Females= 89 %). The sex of a sternum of Northwest India can be estimated using equation F (D) =− 13. 166 + 0. 087 BB- 1 + 0. 088 BB- 2 + 0. 150 BB- 4 + 0. 040 MBX+ 0174 WS- 1 (group centroids i. <b>e.,</b> 0. <b>508</b> for male and − 1. 408 for female). From the logistic regression analysis, 86. 6 % sternums (93. 3 % males and 68. 1 % females) were assigned the correct sex category, thus giving slightly better results than DFA. Comparatively more males were correctly sexed than females using almost all the criteria except DFA.

METHODS: The study analyzed 167 DNA samples from cystic fibrosis patients. Patients' genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction, and allele and genotype frequencies of &# 916;F 508 mutation were calculated. RESULTS: The genotype frequencies found for -/-, &# 916;F 508 /-, and &# 916;F 508 /&# 916;F 508 genotypes were respectively: 43. 7 % (73 patients), 32. 9 % (55 patients), and 23. 4 % (39 patients). Of the 334 alleles analyzed, we observed a frequency of 201 (60. 18 %) alleles for the absence of &# 916;F 508 mutation and of 133 (39. 82 %) for the presence of &# 916;F 508 mutation. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was calculated, obtaining a chi-square value = 16. 34 (p < 0. 001). The study population was out of equilibrium.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an {{ion channel}} employing the ABC transporter structural motif. Deletion {{of a single}} residue (Phe 508) in the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD 1), which occurs in most patients with cystic fibrosis, impairs both maturation and function of the protein. However, substitution of the Phe 508 with small uncharged amino acids, including cysteine, is permissive for maturation. To explore the possible role of the phenylalanine aromatic side chain in channel gating we introduced a cysteine at this position in cysless CFTR, enabling its selective chemical modification by sulfhydryl reagents. Both cysless and wild-type CFTR ion channels have identical mean open times when activated by different nucleotide ligands. Moreover, both channels could be locked in an open state by introducing an ATPase inhibiting mutation (E 1371 S). However, {{the introduction of a}} single cysteine (F 508 C) prevented the cysless E 1371 S channel from maintaining the permanently open state, allowing closing to occur. Chemical modification of cysless <b>E</b> 1371 S/F <b>508</b> C by sulfhydryl reagents was used to probe the role of the side chain in ion channel function. Specifically, benzyl-methanethiosulphonate modification of this variant restored the gating behaviour to that of cysless E 1371 S containing the wild-type phenylalanine at position 508. This provides the first direct evidence that a specific interaction of the Phe 508 aromatic side chain plays a role in determining the residency time in the closed state. Thus, despite the fact that this aromatic side chain is not essential for CFTR folding, it is important in the ion channel function...|$|R

Investigations at this location were carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4732, under contract Bain Medina Bain Inc. to meet compliance with the City of San Antonio’s Unified Code of Development and {{the requirements of the}} Texas Antiquities Code. CAR personnel monitored backhoe excavations {{on the banks of the}} Old San Antonio river channel, south of Pyron Avenue, to examine the nature of deposits within the area targeted for sewer line replacement. Backhoe Trench 1, on the west bank, yielded historic cultural materials that were designated as site 41 BX 1757. The depositional integrity of the deposits was previously compromised during the placement of the SAWS lift/pump station, or wet-well, that skirts the south line of <b>508</b> <b>E.</b> Pyron Avenue.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe best {{investigational drug}} to treat cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{patients with the}} most common CF-causing mutation (F 508 del) is VX- 809 (lumacaftor) which recently succeeded in Phase III clinical trial in combination with ivacaftor. This corrector rescues F 508 del-CFTR from its abnormal intracellular localization to the cell surface, a traffic defect shared by all Class II CFTR mutants. Our goal here is to test the efficacy of lumacaftor in other Class II mutants in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from CF patients. MethodsThe effect of lumacaftor was investigated in primary HBE cells from non-CF and CF patients with F 508 del/F 508 del, A 561 E/A 561 E, N 1303 K/G 542 X, F 508 del/G 542 X and F 508 del/Y 1092 X genotypes by measurements of Forskolin plus Genistein-inducible equivalent short-circuit current (Ieq-SC-Fsk+Gen) in perfused open-circuit Ussing chambers. Efficacy of corrector C 18 was also assessed on A 561 E/A 561 <b>E</b> and F <b>508</b> del/F 508 del cells. ResultsOur data indicate that A 561 E (when present in both alleles) responds positively to lumacaftor treatment at equivalent efficacy of F 508 del in primary HBE cells. Similarly, lumacaftor has {{a positive impact on}} Y 1092 X, but not on N 1303 K. Our data also show that cells with only one copy of F 508 del-CFTR respond less to VX- 809. Moreover, there is great variability in lumacaftor responses among F 508 del-homozygous cells from different donors. Compound C 18 failed to rescue A 561 E-CFTR but not in F 508 del-CFTR, thus plausibly it has a different mechanism of action distinct from lumacaftor. ConclusionsCF patients with A 561 E (and likely also those with Y 1029 X) can potentially benefit from lumacaftor.

40|$|Eastern Sicily (southern Italy) is characterised by the {{presence}} of many natural gas emissions (mofettes, mud volcanoes). These gases are mostly carbon dioxide and methane, with minor amounts of helium, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. In this study, the extent and orientation of soil gas anomalies (He and CO 2) were investigated on a wide area (approximately 110 km 2) located just SW of Mt. Etna. From a structural point of view, this area lays on a typical foredeep–foreland system that marks the boundary between {{the southern part of the}} Eurasian plate and the northern part of the African plate in the central Mediterranean. No tectonic structure was revealed in this area by surface geological surveys. Very high soil emissions were found, and their spatial pattern reveals the existence of some active faults all directed about N <b>508</b> <b>E.</b> This direction coincides with that of two major fault systems that cut eastern Sicily and are evident, respectively, NE and SW of the study area. Soil gas data suggest that these fault systems are the expression of a single continuous structural line which is probably responsible for the past and present magma uprise in eastern Sicily. Isotopic values of carbon of CO 2 suggest a minor contribution of organic carbon. Moreover, in the highest degassing sites the isotopic values of He found in association with CO 2 (He abundance¼ 11 – 70 p. p. m.; R/Ra between 6. 0 and 6. 2) suggest that both gases are mantle derived. The extent of the areas affected by high gas emissions and the amounts of deep CO 2 emitted in the investigated area (several hundred tonnes per day) may provide additional supporting evidence of a mantle upwelling taking place beneath this region...|$|R
40|$|The {{revertant}} mutations G 550 E and 4 RK [the simultaneous mutation of four arginine-framed tripeptides (AFTs) : R 29 K, R 516 K, R 555 K, and R 766 K] {{rescue the}} cell surface expression {{and function of}} F 508 del-cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (-CFTR), the most common CF mutation. Here, we investigate their mechanism of action by using biochemical and functional assays to examine their effects on F 508 del and three CF mutations (R 560 T, A 561 E, and V 562 I) located within a conserved region of the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD 1) of CFTR. Like F 508 del, R 560 T and A 561 E disrupt CFTR trafficking. G 550 E rescued the trafficking defect of A 561 E but not that of R 560 T. Of note, the processing and function of V 562 I were equivalent to that of wild-type (wt) -CFTR, suggesting that V 562 I is not a disease-causing mutation. Biochemical studies revealed that 4 RK generates higher steady-state levels of mature CFTR (band C) for wt- and V 562 I-CFTR than does G 550 E. Moreover, functional studies showed that the revertants rescue the gating defect of F 508 del-CFTR with different efficacies. 4 RK modestly increased F 508 del-CFTR activity by prolonging channel openings, whereas G 550 <b>E</b> restored F <b>508</b> del-CFTR activity to wt levels by altering the duration of channel openings and closings. Thus, our {{data suggest that the}} revertants G 550 E and 4 RK might rescue F 508 del-CFTR by distinct mechanisms. G 550 E likely alters the conformation of NBD 1, whereas 4 RK allows F 508 del-CFTR to escape endoplasmic reticulum retention/retrieval mediated by AFTs. We propose that AFTs might constitute a checkpoint for endoplasmic reticulum quality control...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic contribution of molecular {{analysis of the}} cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in patients suspected of having mild or atypical cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving adolescents and adults aged > 14 years. Volunteers underwent clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation, as well as spirometry, sputum microbiology, liver ultrasound, sweat tests, and molecular analysis of the CFTR gene. We then divided the patients into three groups {{by the number of}} mutations identified (none, one, and two or more) and compared those groups in terms of their characteristics.

MÉTODOS: Estudo clínico-laboratorial, de corte transversal, com 105 pacientes fibrocísticos de um {{hospital}} universitário em 2005 - 2006. Foram analisados 202 doadores de sangue saudáveis como controles para a pesquisa dos polimorfismos no gene TGF-&# 946; 1 e CD 14. A análise de polimorfismos nos genes MBL 2 e TGF-&# 946; 1 no códon 10, posição + 869, foi realizada pela técnica da PCR alelo-específica. A genotipagem do polimorfismo C- 159 T no gene CD 14 foi realizada através de PCR e digestão enzimática. RESULTADOS: Dos 105 pacientes com FC avaliados, 67 apresentavam doença pulmonar grave segundo o escore de Shwachman. Os polimorfismos do gene MBL 2 não foram associados com a gravidade da doença nos fibrocísticos. A análise do polimorfismo T 869 C no gene TGF-&# 946; 1 mostrou somente uma associação entre o heterozigoto TC com doença pulmonar leve. Para o polimorfismo C- 159 T no gene CD 14, obtivemos um predomínio de pacientes com o genótipo TT, mas não houve diferença significativa com relação à gravidade do quadro pulmonar. CONCLUSÕES: Houve associação entre o genótipo TC do polimorfismo T 869 C (TGF-&# 946; 1) e o quadro pulmonar leve nos fibrocísticos. No gene CD 14, o genótipo TT parece ser um fator de risco para o quadro pulmonar, mas não um fator modulador da gravidade. Não existiu associação entre pacientes homozigotos para a mutação &# 916;F <b>508</b> <b>e</b> a gravidade do quadro pulmonar. OBJECTIVE: To identify {{associations between}} genetic polymorphisms (in the MBL 2, TGF-&# 946; 1 and CD 14 genes) and {{the severity of}} the lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as between the presence of &# 916;F 508 alleles and lung disease severity in such patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional cohort study, based on clinical and laboratory data, involving 105 patients with CF treated at a university hospital in the 2005 - 2006 period. We included 202 healthy blood donors as controls for the determination of TGF-&# 946; 1 and CD 14 gene polymorphisms. Polymorphisms in the MBL 2 and TGF-&# 946; 1 genes at codon 10, position + 869, were genotyped using the allele-specific PCR technique. The C- 159 T polymorphism in the CD 14 gene was genotyped using PCR and enzymatic digestion. RESULTS: Of the 105 CF patients evaluated, 67 presented with severe lung disease according to the Shwachman score. The MBL 2 gene polymorphisms were not associated with disease severity in the CF patients. Analysis of the T 869 C polymorphism in the TGF-&# 946; 1 gene showed an association only between TC heterozygotes and mild pulmonary disease. Although patients presenting the TT genotype of the C 159 T polymorphism in the CD 14 gene predominated, {{there was no significant difference}} regarding lung disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: There was an association between the TC genotype of the T 869 C polymorphism (TGF-&# 946; 1) and mild pulmonary disease in CF patients. In the CD 14 gene, the TT genotype seems to be a risk factor for pulmonary disease but is not a modulator of severity.

40|$|A Fibrose Cística (FC) é a doença autossômica recessiva mais freqüente em caucasianos e está associada, em seu amplo espectro de apresentação clínica, a mais de 1500 mutações no gene CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane {{conductance}} regulator). O papel de CFTR é especialmente relevante no desenvolvimento da porção reprodutiva dos ductos mesonéfricos. Em 98 % dos pacientes masculinos portadores da FC, mutações em CFTR são responsáveis pela ausência bilateral congênita dos ductos deferentes (CBAVD), associada à anomalias variáveis das vesículas seminais, ductos ejaculatórios e da porção distal dos epidídimos. A ausência uni ou bilateral congênita dos ductos deferentes (CAVD), na ausência de outros sinais clínicos de FC, é conhecida causa de infertilidade masculina, presente em 1 %- 2 % de todos os homens inférteis, e em cerca de 10 % dos azoospérmicos. A reprodução assistida utilizando a injeção intracitoplasmática de espermatozóides (ICSI) obtidos preferencialmente por aspiração microcirurgica de espermatozóides do epidídimo (MESA) permite a paternidade biológica a esses pacientes. Em função da alta morbi-mortalidade da FC e da alta freqüência de portadores assintomáticos, estimada em 1 : 25, é recomendável que seja realizado teste para identificação de mutações em CFTR em todos os pacientes com CAVD antes de serem submetidos à ICSI. Em populações de etnia homogênea, a mutação F <b>508</b> <b>é</b> identificada em 90 % dos pacientes com FC e em 70 % a 85 % dos pacientes com CAVD. No Brasil, onde diferenças étnicas refletem a heterogeneidade genética, a freqüência da mutação F 508 varia entre 23 % e 50 % em paciente com FC indicando que outras mutações devam estar envolvidas. Este dado levou ao estudo completo do gene CFTR de 20 homens inférteis com CAVD visando a identificação das mutações mais prevalentes em nossa população. Foram identificadas mutações em 17 pacientes (85 %) : três DF 508 representando 15 % (3 / 20), uma G 542 X, uma 875 + 1 G>A e 4 mutações ainda não descritas na literatura, a S 753 R, G 149 W identificada em dois irmãos, V 580 F e a 712 - 1 G>T. A variação no trato polipirimidínico em IVS 8 (alelo 5 T), seja como segunda mutação ou presente em homozigose, está diretamente relacionada com a CAVD, com freqüências em população caucasiana masculina infértil variando entre 21 % e 30 %. No presente estudo, 15 (15 / 20 = 75 %) pacientes apresentaram o alelo a variante alélica 5 T sendo que em 8 pacientes essa variante alélica foi identificada em heterozigose composta com outra mutação. Anomalias renais foram identificadas em 6 pacientes, todos com CBAVD. O presente estudo pode correlacionar o fenótipo da CAVD a alterações no genótipo de CFTR em 100 % dos pacientes investigadosCystic Fibrosis (CF) is {{the most}} common autosomal recessive disorder in caucasians and is associated, in an wide variety of different clinical manifestatons. More than 1500 mutations in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis regulator Transmembrane conductance) have been described and an even growing number of mutations are being currently studied worldwide. The role of CFTR gene is especially important in reproductive tissues of the mesonephric tract sensitive to the expression of the CFTR gene. The great majority of infertile males with CF (98 %) have clinical manifestations and mutations in CFTR are responsible for the congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), associated to the abnormalities of the seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts and/or the distal portion of the epididymis. The congenital absence, uni or bilateral, of the vas deferens (CAVD), in the absence of other clinical signals of CF is a known cause of male infertility present in 1 %- 2 % of all men investigated and in about 10 % of men with obstructive azoospermia. Serious considerations should be drawn about the lack of proper diagnosis of infetile males with CFTR that seek reproductive clinics for assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs), as well as the lack of proper consideratins of the existance of this disease as a potential cause of male infetility among male are takers, like urologistas, andrologistas and gynecologists that rush for the misuse of ARTs. The introduction of Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI), has given new reproductive potetntial for these couples, but again as in the majority of cases it is obstructive azoospermia, couples should be advised about proper microsurgical sperm retrieval, preferentialy microsurgical epydidymal sperm aspiration (MESA). As a consequence of the potential high mortality rate of the CF descendents and the high frequency of carriers, estimated in 1 : 25,it is highly recommended that tests for correct identification of mutations in CFTR gene are carried out for all patients with CAVD before considered being submitted to ICSI. In populations of homogeneous ethnic origin, the mutation F 508 is identified in 90 % of the patients with CF and between 70 % and 85 % of the patients with CAVD. In Brazil, where ethnic differences reflect the genetic heterogeneity, the frequency of the mutation in F 508 varies between 23 % and 50 %, indicating that other mutations must have a role. Our data looked carefully in the CFTR gene of 20 infertile men with CAVD aiming at the identification of the most prevalent mutations in our population. Mutations had been identified in 17 patients (85 %) : three DF 508 representing 15 % (3 / 20), one G 542 X, one 875 + 1 G>A and 4 mutations not yet described in literature, S 753 R, G 149 W identified in two brothers, V 580 F and 712 - 1 G>T. In the literature the allelic variant in IVS 8 (allele 5 T), either as a second mutation or in homozygosis, is directly related with the CAVD, with reported frequencies in the infertile caucasian male population varying between 21 % and 30 %. In the present study, 15 (15 / 20 = 75 %) patients presented the CFTR mutation in the IVS 8 / 5 T: eight of them in heterozygosis composed with another mutation. Regarding genitourinary tract malformations, kidney anomalies were identified in 6 patients, all with CBAVD. In the present study we could correlationate the phenotype of the CAVD with the genotype alterations of CFTR gene in 100 % of the investigated patient...|$|R

More than 1900 CF mutations have already been reported on the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, but one single mutation, named F 508 del, is responsible for 70 % of CF chromosomes worldwide. CFTR is expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells to control salt and water transport. Clinically, CF is characterized by multiple manifestations in different organs, but is dominated by the respiratory disease, the main cause of morbidity and mortality. Bacterial infections, especially by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cause inefficient mucociliary clearance, originating thick mucus, and recurrent infections give rise to an exacerbated inflammatory response contributing to impairment of respiratory function and ultimately to death. Other CF classical symptoms include exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (85 %), intestinal obstruction (meconium ileus in 15 - 20 % of CF newborns and/or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome at a later age), elevated sweat electrolytes and male infertility (95 %). Besides this classic picture of the CF disease, there is a minority of patients presenting non-classic phenotypes and being diagnosed from child to adulthood. Moreover the increasing numbers of asymptomatic patients identified in recent newborn CF screens have posed major challenges to clinicians for the establishment of CF diagnoses, prognosis and adequacy of therapeutics. High-throughput screens have identified several novel small molecules with potential to treat the basic defect in CF and some are starting hit the clinical setting. These include correctors (like VX- 661 and VX- 809 -Lumacaftor, both in Phase IIb clinical trial) that partially rescue the trafficking defect of F 508 del-CFTR, and a potentiator (like VX- 770 -, Ivacaftor (FDA-approved drug) that corrects the gating defect of G 551 D-CFTR, which underwent pre-clinical validation in CF airway primary cultures. However, to accelerate the entry of novel compounds into the clinic, the respective mechanism of action should be established, which usually requires studies in cellular systems with heterologous expression. Comparative efficacy assessment between heterologous expression systems and airway primary cutures/native human tissues is thus of the ultimate importance before CFTR modulators reach the clinical setting. In {{the first part of this}} work, we aimed to further establish measurement of CFTR function as a sensitive and robust biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CF. To this end, we assessed cholinergic and cAMP-CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion in 524 freshly excised rectal biopsies from 118 individuals, including patients with confirmed CF clinical diagnosis (n= 51), individuals with clinical CF suspicion (n= 49) and age-matched non-CF controls (n= 18). Conclusive measurements were obtained for 96 % of cases. Patients with "Classic CF", presenting earlier onset of symptoms, pancreatic insufficiency, severe lung disease and were found to lack CFTR-mediated Clsecretion (≤ 5 %). Individuals with milder CF disease presented residual CFTRmediated Cl- secretion (10 - 57 %), and non-CF controls show CFTR-mediated Clsecretion above 30 - 35 %. Moreover, this data was well correlated with various clinical parameters and proved to be the best discriminator among Classic/Non-Classic CF and non-CF groups. Determination of CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion in rectal biopsies is demonstrated here to be a sensitive, reproducible and robust predictive biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of CF. In the second part, our goals were: first, to evaluate technical aspects of this procedure regarding the viability of the rectal specimens for ex vivo bioelectrical and biochemical laboratory analyses; and secondly, to evaluate the overall assessment (comfort, invasiveness, pain, sedation requirement, etc) of the rectal biopsy procedure from the patients perspective, in order to assess its feasibility as an outcome measure for (pre-) clinical trials. Regarding the technical aspects of biopsing, we compared three solutions for bowel preparation (NaCl 0. 9 %, glycerol 12 % and oral mannitol), and two biopsy forceps (standard and jumbo) in 580 rectal specimens. As to the assessment of the overall rectal biopsy procedure, telephone surveys were applied to 75 individuals. Our data shows that disruption and friability of the specimens obtained correlate with their transepithelial resistance and are also influenced by the solution used for bowel preparation and biopsy forceps, with NaCl 0. 9 % proving to be the most compatible with the analysis and jumbo the best forceps. The great majority of the individuals (76 %) did not report high levels of discomfort due to the short time (max 15 min) and relatively painless procedure (79 %). Moreover, this procedure was shown to be well tolerated by patients with or without sedation: most (53 %) accept repeating it four more times, demonstrating the feasibility of the current approach as an outcome measure for (pre-) clinical trials. Finally, in the last chapter of this thesis we proposed to evaluate the impact of different small molecules correctors and potentiators on CFTRprotein maturation and Cl- channel activity in heterologous cellular systems, so as to better understand their mechanism of action; and also to comparatively determine efficacy of those compounds in modulating CFTR activity in those systems and directly in primary cultures of human airway cells/and in native human tissues ex vivo. Functional data for F 508 del-CFTR rescue by iodide efflux on heterologous systems (BHK cells) shows that VRT- 325, C 4 a, VRT- 640 and VRT- 532 are all able to rescue CFTR function to at varying levels (26, 33, 19 and 35 %, respectively of wt-CFTR function), with both VRT- 325 and C 4 a having additive effects to the low temperature. On polarized F 508 del-transduced CFBE cells, VRT- 325 and C 4 a treatment resulted 3. 32 and 8. 5 % in CFTR function, respectively, relative to wt-CFTR monolayer cells. In contrast, preliminary data resulting from the functional analysis conducted in primary airway cells indicates that the efficiency of the correctors VRT- 325 and C 4 a is reduced (4. 18 % and 3. 16 % of wt-CFTR function, respectively). Remarkably, VX- 809 treatment resulted in a ~ 5. 7 -fold increase in CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion, which represents a recovery of ~ 16 % of the CFTR function observed in primary non-CF HBE monolayers cells. Preliminary results in biopsies from F 508 del/F 508 del and F 508 del/G 542 X patients did not provide evidence for a clear effect for VRT- 325 and nor C 4 a correctors, but showed a modest effect for a novel corrector compound (TS- 01 - 02 -D 8) which we recently identified. All together, these results suggest that the effects of a given compound in rescuing F 508 del-CFTR activity in heterologous systems are poorly predictive of its rescuing capacity in native tissues, which indicates that further pre-clinical validation in native tissues ex vivo is highly recommended. A Fibrose Quística (FQ) e a doença autossómica recessiva letal mais comum na população Caucasiana, afectando cerca de 1 em 2500 - 6000 nados vivos, dependendo da região geográfica, e com uma frequência de portadores de 1 em cada 25 indivíduos. Esta doença e causada por mutações no gene CFTR (do inglês Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) localizado no cromossoma 7. Até à data, foram já descritas mais de 1900 mutações neste gene. No entanto, uma única mutação denominada por F 508 del (representando a deleção do aminoácido fenilalanina na posição <b>508</b> da proteína) <b>é</b> responsável por 70 % dos cromossomas FQ mundiais. A proteína CFTR e expressa na membrana apical das células epiteliais onde funciona como um canal de cloreto (Cl-), regulando o transporte de sais e de água. Clinicamente, a FQ é caracterizada por múltiplas manifestações em diferentes órgãos, sendo contudo a doença a nível pulmonar a principal causa de morbilidade e mortalidade. A desidratação das vias respiratórias e a produção de secreções brônquicas extremamente viscosas devido a infecções bacterianas de repetição e persistentes, levam a um transporte/limpeza mucociliar ineficiente o que resulta na obstrução das glândulas exócrinas e, consequentemente, das vias respiratórias. Estas infecçoes bacterianas contribuem ainda para uma resposta inflamatória exacerbada que, por sua vez, origina o agravamento da insuficiência respiratória e, finalmente, a morte. Outros sintomas clássicos da FQ incluem insuficiência pancreática exócrina (85 %), obstrução intestinal (íleo meconial em 15 - 20 % dos recém-nascidos e/ou síndrome de obstrução intestinal distal na idade adulta), infertilidade masculina (95 %) e concentração elevada de electrólitos no suor (característica utilizada no principal teste de diagnóstico). A apresentação dum quadro clínico grave, em conjunto com a demonstração de que a proteína CFTR e disfuncional, no geral, através de dois testes do suor alterados ou da detecção de duas mutações no gene CFTR, permitem o diagnóstico da maioria dos doentes ainda na primeira infância. No entanto, nem todos os doentes apresentam este quadro clássico da doenca, existindo um grupo de doentes que apresenta fenótipos não-clássicos, resultando no seu diagnóstico tardio, o que pode prejudicar o seu tratamento. Mais recentemente, os números crescentes de doentes FQ assintomáticos, identificados através dos programas de rastreio neonatal, têm colocado grandes desafios clínicos no que toca ao estabelecimento do diagnóstico FQ definitivo, prognóstico e adequadas estratégias terapêuticas. E crucial implantar um método que permita discriminar estes dois grupos de doentes através|$|R
