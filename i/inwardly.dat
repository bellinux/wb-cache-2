5|$|The {{proboscis}} (plural – proboscises) {{is formed}} from maxillary galeae and is adapted for sucking nectar. It {{consists of two}} tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is <b>inwardly</b> concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head. The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding. The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial. They are conspicuous and five-segmented {{in some of the}} more basal families and are often folded.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{spiritual journey}} {{is thought to}} have begun at this time. He started to rise early to read the Bible and pray and kept a private journal. He {{underwent}} an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God. His conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith. <b>Inwardly,</b> he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.|$|E
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be <b>inwardly</b> subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular {{men and women who have}} been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she <b>inwardly</b> develops a degree of doubt in herself. All three armies eventual convene at the base of the Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is <b>inwardly</b> resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

25|$|Boat Deck {{started off}} forward with another narrow promenade, opening into wider {{expansion}} beneath {{a canopy of}} lifeboats and davits along either side. <b>Inwardly,</b> this level started off with the first class Belvedere Observation Lounge that was equipped with a panorama of windows overlooking the ship's bow.|$|E
25|$|CB1 receptors are coupled through Gi/o {{proteins}} and inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In addition, CB1 receptors inhibit presynaptic N- and P/Q-type calcium channels and activate <b>inwardly</b> rectifying potassium channels. CB1 antagonists produce inverse cannabimimetic effects that are opposite in direction from those produced by agonists for these receptors.|$|E
25|$|Dogen's {{perspective}} of virtue {{is discussed in}} the Shōbōgenzō text as something to be practiced <b>inwardly</b> {{so that it will}} manifest itself on the outside. In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour and {{markings}} {{much as in}} wet-season specimens, the emargination on {{the inner}} side of the black area and the tornal dilatation on the forewing similar.

25|$|Civil society {{embraces the}} whole {{material}} intercourse of individuals within a definite {{stage of development}} of productive forces. It embraces the whole commercial and industrial life of a given stage, and, insofar, transcends {{the state and the}} nation, though on the other hand, it must assert itself in its foreign relations as nationality and <b>inwardly</b> must organize itself as a state.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis: Body {{measurements}} {{less than}} 3.0 x 2.5mm; lateral grooves completely encircling scutum, no lateral carinae; punctuations fine; basis capituli punctate dorsally, palpi short and very broad; hypostome dentition 2/2, with rounded teeth; anal plate bluntly pointed behind; adanal plate curving <b>inwardly</b> to a point; coxae with well-defined spurs decreasing in size posteriorly; trochanters III and IV frequently with small, ventral spurs.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour darker {{brownish}} black, deep opaque {{black on}} the costa, apex and termen of the forewing; the medial oval white patch on the forewing smaller, the upper discal white band on the hindwing narrower, the short, broad black streak from base terminates {{in a large}} round spot or patch <b>inwardly</b> merged in the ground colour which fills the whole area of the cell.|$|E
25|$|The Salt Lake Campus {{consists}} of an academic block and three residential blocks. The latter comprises two separate, seven-storied halls of residence for girls and boys and a double-storied faculty accommodation house-cum-guest house. The university's academic block, christened after B.R. Ambedkar, is a four-storied octagonal structure that opens <b>inwardly</b> to a lawn. The building houses classrooms, a library and reading room, two conference halls, offices and an auditorium.|$|E
25|$|Air within {{high-pressure}} systems rotates in {{a direction}} such that the Coriolis force is directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient. As a result, air travels clockwise around high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Air around low-pressure rotates in the opposite direction, so that the Coriolis force is directed radially outward and nearly balances an <b>inwardly</b> radial pressure gradient.|$|E
25|$|In the Anglican tradition, {{confession}} and absolution {{is usually a}} component part of corporate worship, particularly at services of the Holy Eucharist. The form involves an exhortation to repentance by the priest, a period of silent prayer during which believers may <b>inwardly</b> confess their sins, a form of general confession said together by all present and the pronouncement of general absolution by the priest, often accompanied by {{the sign of the}} cross.|$|E
25|$|Upperside dark cupreous red, glossy and shining. Forewing: base irrorated with dusky scales; costa {{edged with}} a narrow, <b>inwardly</b> jagged, jet-black band that {{broadens}} to the apex, thence continued along the termen, decreasing in width to the tornus; opposite the apex the inner {{edge of the}} black is acutely angulate. Hindwing: base and dorsum broadly but slightly irrorated (sprinkled) with dusky scales; costa narrowly, dorsal margin more broadly pale; termen very narrowly and evenly margined with black.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the second}} oldest of six children, an elder brother to Jørgen Nash. Both of his parents were teachers. His father, Lars Peter Jørgensen, was a {{fundamentalist}} Christian {{who died in a}} car crash when Asger was 12 years old. His mother, Maren, née Nielsen, was more liberal but nevertheless a deeply committed Christian. This early heavy Christian influence had a negative effect on Asger who began progressively to <b>inwardly</b> rebel against it, and more generally against other forms of authority.|$|E
25|$|Frank Underwood, a power-hungry Democratic {{congressman from}} South Carolina and House {{majority}} whip, celebrates {{the election of}} President Garrett Walker, whose campaign he aided to get himself appointed Secretary of State. However, Underwood learns that the president wants him to promote his agenda in Congress and will not honor their agreement. <b>Inwardly</b> seething, Underwood presents himself as a helpful lieutenant to Walker. In reality, Underwood begins an elaborate plan behind the president's back, with {{the ultimate goal of}} gaining a cabinet position.|$|E
25|$|In most species, a {{wide mouth}} extends {{all around the}} {{anterior}} circumference of the head, and bands of <b>inwardly</b> inclined teeth line both jaws. The teeth can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but prevent its escape from the mouth. The anglerfish is able to distend both its jaw and its stomach, since its bones are thin and flexible, to enormous size, allowing it to swallow prey up to {{twice as large as}} its entire body.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fourth}} week, two {{atrioventricular}} endocardial cushions appear. Initially the atrioventricular canal gives access to the primitive left ventricle, and is separated from arterial bulb by the edge of the ventricular bulb. In the fifth week, the posterior end terminates in the center part of the upper endocardial cushion. Because of this, blood can access both the left primitive ventricle and the right primitive ventricle. As the anterior and posterior pads project <b>inwardly,</b> they merge to form a right and left atrioventricular orifice.|$|E
25|$|Female: Hindwing: {{the black}} on the costal margin as in cerberus, {{but there is}} always a large yellow spot at base of {{interspace}} 7; interspace 1 black, with a pale patch in the middle; the black terminal border broader, the <b>inwardly</b> extended cone-shaped markings prominent, those in interspaces 2 and 3 with pale buff lateral edgings, extended inwards to the postdiscal spots. In both male and female the hindwing on the upperside is clothed with soft, silky, long brownish-black hairs from base along the dorsal area.|$|E
25|$|Doors {{which lead}} from interior, pressurized, {{sections}} of an aircraft to exterior or unpressurized areas can pose extreme risk {{if they are}} inadvertently opened during flight. This can be mitigated by having doors that open <b>inwardly</b> and {{are designed to be}} forced into their door frames by the internal cabin pressure – most cabin doors are of this type. However, an outward opening door is often advantageous for cargo doors to maximise available space, and these need to be secured by hefty locking mechanisms to overcome internal pressure.|$|E
25|$|Promenade Deck started {{forward with}} a first class {{observation}} area, then number three-like encompassing, continuing aft through narrow links to the glass-enveloped first class promenade. <b>Inwardly,</b> it started with the phenomenal social hall with its curved panorama of windows and an aft bulkhead that held sculptures and reliefs in bronze by Mascherini. In this sheered salon, the ceiling accommodated an oval recess in which the lighting was designed in a zodiac fashion. This room was converted into an auditorium in 1964. The only part of this social hall to be carried over into the auditorium was an oval ceiling recess constellation-like lighting arrangement.|$|E
25|$|This species resembles Vanessa cardui but {{the ground}} colour is darker {{both on the}} uppersides and undersides, and the orange {{markings}} are deeper and richer in tint. It also differs as follows: underside forewing: the ochraceous orange-red on disc, and across cell proportionately of less extent, and uniform, not getting paler towards {{the apex of the}} cell; the upper four spots of the preapical transverse series on the black apical area minute. It is about 5inches (13cm) in length. Hindwing: the postdiscal transverse band much narrower and shorter, not extending below vein 1, margined <b>inwardly</b> by a series of broad black subcrescentic marks; the tornal angle with a small patch of violet scales bordered <b>inwardly</b> by a short black transverse line. Underside very much darker than in V. cardui, the orange red on the disc and in the cell on the forewing restricted as on the upperside; three small transversely placed blue spots beyond the cell. Hindwing: the mottling comparatively very dark, purplish blade, with slender white margins, shaded on disc with rich dark olive-brown; the postdiscal series of ocelli dark and somewhat obscure; an inner subterminal transverse series of blue, and an outer very much slenderer transverse series of black lunules. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings white, alternated with brown. Antenna black, tipped with pale ochraceous; head, thorax and abdomen with dark olive-brown pubescence; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen pale ochraceous brown.|$|E
25|$|Underside forewing: basal {{half with}} three black-edged, sinuous, broad, ochraceous-orange {{transverse}} bands, {{followed by the}} pale discal baud; ocelli, preapical short bar, subterminal and terminal markings much as on the upperside; the discal band margined <b>inwardly</b> by a broad black angulated line which follows {{the outline of the}} black area of the upperside. Hindwing irrorated (sprinkled) with dusky scales and transversely crossed by subbasal and discal slender zigzag brown lines and a postdiscal dark shade, on which are placed the two ocelli as on the upperside; subterminal and terminal faint brown lines, and a brownish short streak tipped black at the tornal angle below the lower ocellus.|$|E
25|$|Two English {{works on}} the medical uses of water were {{published}} in the 18th century that inaugurated the new fashion for hydrotherapy. One of these was by Sir John Floyer, a physician of Lichfield, who, struck by the remedial use of certain springs by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the history of cold bathing and published a book on the subject in 1702. The book ran through six editions within a few years and the translation of this book into German was largely drawn upon by Dr J. S. Hahn of Silesia as the basis for his book called On the Healing Virtues of Cold Water, <b>Inwardly</b> and Outwardly Applied, as Proved by Experience, published in 1738.|$|E
25|$|Underside: fuliginous (sooty) {{brown or}} {{brownish}} black, {{more or less}} suffused with pink along the costal margin, on apical area and along the outer margin of the discal markings on the forewing, broadly along the dorsal and terminal margins and at base on interspaces 6 and 7 on the hindwing; markings similar to those on the upperside but less clearly defined and somewhat more grey in tint. Hindwing black, <b>inwardly</b> red-margined spots superposed on the pink area in interspaces 6 and 7. Cilia very narrow, pale pink. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, thorax above and the abdomen on the sides streaked with greenish grey; beneath: ochreous grey touched on the thorax with pink.|$|E
25|$|Some {{orthodox}} Quakers in America {{disliked the}} move towards evangelical Christianity {{and saw it}} as a dilution of Friends' traditional orthodox Christian belief in being <b>inwardly</b> led by the Holy Spirit. These Friends were led by John Wilbur who was expelled from his yearly meeting in 1842. He and his supporters formed their own Conservative Friends Yearly Meeting. In the UK in 1868 some Friends broke away from London Yearly Meeting for the same reason. They formed a separate body of Friends called Fritchley General Meeting, which remained distinct and separate from London Yearly Meeting until 1968. Similar Christian splits took place in Canada. The Yearly Meetings that supported John Wilbur's religious beliefs were known as Conservative Friends.|$|E

Her friends, Ah Kai (Zhang Rui Jia), Xiao Bai (Lai Zhi Wei), Mu Tou (Lin Yi Hong), Xin Lei (Sa Sa), and, Xiao Xiao (Yang Pei Ting) don't know about that part of her past but they are all loyal friends to Xiao Feng; that is, until Xiao Bai and Ah Kai leave the Kendo Club for the Swim Team.|$|E
25|$|Once β-arrestin {{is bound}} to a GPCR, it {{undergoes}} a conformational change allowing it {{to serve as a}} scaffolding protein for an adaptor complex termed AP-2, which in turn recruits another protein called clathrin. If enough receptors in the local area recruit clathrin in this manner, they aggregate and the membrane buds <b>inwardly</b> as a result of interactions between the molecules of clathrin, in a process called opsonization. Once the pit has been pinched off the plasma membrane due to the actions of two other proteins called amphiphysin and dynamin, it is now an endocytic vesicle. At this point, the adapter molecules and clathrin have dissociated, and the receptor is either trafficked back to the plasma membrane or targeted to lysosomes for degradation.|$|E
25|$|While {{objective}} truths are {{final and}} static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective {{experience that is}} always {{in the process of}} becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been <b>inwardly</b> appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the males}} the upperside is creamy white. Forewing: the costa narrowly, the apex and {{terminal}} margin to middle of interspace 1 are black. An irregular, somewhat sinuous, black band extends obliquely {{from beyond the}} middle of the costa across the upper apex of the cell, and meets at interspace 1 the black on the terminal margin. Within the triangle thus formed is enclosed a rich orange-red patch that is traversed by the black veins and bears in interspaces 3 to 6 a postdiscal series of black <b>inwardly</b> elongated spots. Hindwing: nearly uniform, touched with black on the terminal margin anteriorly and with a conspicuous postdiscal black spot in interspace 7. In some specimens there are one or two smaller spots in continuation of the series in the interspaces below.|$|E
25|$|Upperside of {{both sexes}} brown of varying depths of colour. Forewing: cell with one pair of subbasal and one pair of apical {{transverse}} sinuous fasciae, the outermost defining the discocellulars; a short, broad, dark, oblique fascia beyond to vein 4, its inner margin diffuse, its outer sinuous but sharply defined; below vein 4 a sinuous, transverse, more faint fascia, followed by a discal blackish fascia, very broad and diffuse, below costa, bordered by a row of faint ocelli, and a postdiscal and a subterminal similar fascia following {{the outline of the}} termen. Hindwing with a slender blackish loop near apex of cellular area; a broad <b>inwardly</b> diffuse, outwardly well-defined short discal fascia in continuation of the one on the forewing; a series of postdiscal somewhat ochraceous ocelli with black pupils minutely centred with white; postdiscal and subterminal broad lines as on the forewing.|$|E
25|$|Upperside: yellow, {{variable}} in tint from sulphur to rich lemon yellow according to locality {{with a light}} or heavy rainfall. Forewing: apex and termen deep black, this colour continued narrowly along the costal margin to base of wing, near which it often becomes diffuse; the inner margin of the black area from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, between veins 2 and 4 excavate on the inner side, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins and <b>inwardly</b> toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies {{the whole of the}} tornal angle; the inner margin of this dilatation is variable, in the typical form slightly concave. Hindwing: terminal margin with a narrow black band which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; dorsal margin broadly paler than the ground colour.|$|E
