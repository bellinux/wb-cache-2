5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil <b>fuels,</b> <b>and</b> mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E

If it be assumed that the heat-transfer resistance between the <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> cladding remains the same for both steady-state and transient periods, the phase-change problem for <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> cladding melting can be significantly simplified. BY using the predetermined average overall heat-transfer coefficient across a fuel pin in the steady-state period, the average transient <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> cladding temperatures can be formulated analytically.

5|$|As global {{population}} and affluence has increased, {{so has the}} use of various materials increased in volume, diversity and distance transported.

5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>and</b> should not be {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions.

40|$|Purpose of the study. The <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> {{energy complex}} {{is one of}} the {{important}} components of the mechanism of functioning of the national economy in general and municipal economy in particular, since the main tasks of the complex include: provision of hot water supply all year round and heat during the winter period, meeting the needs of the population and municipal economy in gas, supply of gasoline <b>and</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> to satisfy consumers, as well as the supply of coal, peat, <b>fuel</b> oil <b>and</b> other <b>fuels</b> for the urban economy. An important role is played by enterprises of the <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex in terms of providing jobs to the population. The <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex of Moscow {{is one of the}} largest in Russia. A feature of its functioning is the concentrated consumption of gas, fuel, electricity, heat energy and other energy resources. The formation and development of the <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex in Moscow is largely due to the rapidly developing economy of the megapolis – large-scale construction of housing and infrastructure, sustainable population growth entails a constant increase in consumption of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources. Monitoring the efficiency of the use of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources makes it possible to identify ways to reduce the volume of consumption to a level that allows, within the approved limit, to implement the planned rate of social and economic development of the city. Materials and methods. Information base of the research was made by statistical data characterizing the volume of consumption of certain types of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources in the market of the Moscow region. The methodological basis of the study is made up of statistical methods of analysis of structure and structural shifts, dynamics. Their use made it possible to conduct a thorough analysis of the differentiation of consumption of various types of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources, as well as structural changes in the differentiations in question. It made it possible to identify existing trends in the development of the <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex in the capital region Results. The analysis allowed to identify the current trends in consumption of the main types of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources in Moscow, to assess the structure and structural changes in consumption of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources in Moscow, in order to assess the energy efficiency of the <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex of the capital. Conclusion. The main goal of Moscow’s energy policy is to create an economically efficient, dynamically developing <b>and</b> financially sustainable <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex equipped with advanced technologies and highly qualified personnel and meeting the requirements of the time and status of Moscow. Increasing the efficiency of the use of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources, for Moscow as one of the coldest capitals of the world, is becoming one of the priority tasks. Consequently, another task of developing the <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy complex of the city is to expand the scale of the introduction of secondary energy resources and bring the indicator of their use to 50 %. That is why, a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics and structure of consumption of <b>fuel</b> <b>and</b> energy resources will allow not only to assess the existing patterns of distribution and trends, but also as a consequence to form a highly effective energy strategy for the megacity.  </p...|$|R
