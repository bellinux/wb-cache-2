2500|$|The {{relative}} humidity {{in the center}} of origin of cumin is rather low. High {{relative humidity}} (i.e. wet years) favours fungal diseases. Cumin is especially sensitive to Alternaria blight and <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt.</b> Early-sown crops exhibit stronger disease effects than late sown crops. The most important disease is <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt,</b> resulting in yield losses up to 80%. Fusarium is seed- or soil-borne and it requires distinct soil temperatures for development of epidemics. Inadequate fertilization might favour Fusarium epidemics. [...] Cumin blight (Alternaria) appears in the form of dark brown spots on leaves and stems. When the weather is cloudy after flowering, the incidence of the disease is increased. Another, but less important, disease is powdery mildew. Incidence of powdery mildew in early development can cause drastic yield losses because no seeds are formed. Later in development, powdery mildew causes discoloured, small seeds.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural soils suppressive to soilborne plant {{pathogens}} occur worldwide, and {{for several}} of these soils the biological basis of suppressiveness has been described. Two classical types of suppressiveness are known. General suppression owes its activity to the total microbial biomass in soil and is not transferable between soils. Specific suppression owes its activity {{to the effects of}} individual or select groups of microorganisms and is transferable. The microbial basis of specific suppression to four diseases, <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilts,</b> potato scab, apple replant disease, and take-all, is discussed. One of the best-described examples occurs in take-all decline soils. In Washington State, take-all decline results from the buildup of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. that produce the antifungal metabolite 2, 4 -diacetylphloroglucinol. Producers of this metabolite may have a broader role in disease-suppressive soils worldwide. By coupling molecular technologies with traditional approaches used in plant pathology and microbiology, it is possible to dissect the microbial composition and complex interactions in suppressive soils...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which biological control agents suppress disease comprise competition for nutrients, notably iron, production of antibiotics, and secretion of lytic enzymes, as well as inducing resistance in the plant. The former three mechanisms act primarily on the pathogen by decreasing its activity, growth, and/or survival and require the biocontrol agent and the pathogen to be in close proximity. Because microorganisms with biocontrol properties and soilborne pathogens are both attracted to the rhizosphere, where root exudates and lysates provide a nutritious environment, antagonism between biocontrol agents and pathogens occurs locally. Such interactions may be favored by both the biocontrol agent and the pathogen growing preferentially over anticlinal walls of root epidermal cells. However, pathogenic fungi such as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini and f. sp. raphani grow towards root apices and penetrate through the tips that emerge virtually sterile from beneath the root cap. Hence, those <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilts</b> are among the diseases most difficult to control effectively and reliably by antagonistic microorganisms...|$|R

Histochemical and ultrastructural analyses were carried out to assess structural and biochemical changes in date palm roots pretreated with salicylic acid (SA) then inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. albedinis (Foa). Flavonoids, induced proteins, and peroxidase activity were revealed in root tissues of SA-treated plants after challenge by Foa. These reactions were closely associated with plant resistance to Foa. Host reactions induced after inoculation of SA-treated plants with Foa included the plugging of intercellular spaces, the deposition of electron-dense materials at the sites of pathogen penetration, and several damages to fungal cells. On the other hand, untreated inoculated plants showed marked cell wall degradation and total cytoplasm disorganization, indicating the protective effects provided by salicylic acid in treated plants. 1. aIntroduction <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilts</b> are economically important soil-borne dis-eases that result in significant crop losses and damage to natural ecosystems.

A number of procedures {{have been used for}} the initial selection of plant genotypes resistant to various fungal pathogens by means of a fungal culture filtrate or purified toxin. In this study, seeds and in vitro-grown plantlets of passion fruit were screened with different concentrations of either Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. passiflorae (FOP) culture filtrate (0, 20, 30, 40 or 50 %, v/v) or fusaric acid (0. 10, 0. 20, 0. 30 or 0. 40 mM) supplemented in Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal media. Subsequently, selected plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of FOP to assess correlation between in vivo and in vitro responses. In vitro sensitivity to the selective agents and the resistance response to the pathogen were also compared. Root growth was markedly influenced by FA, culture filtrate, and conidial suspension culture treatments. Observations indicated that roots were primary targets for attack by F. oxysporum.
