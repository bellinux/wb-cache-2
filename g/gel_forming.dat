2500|$|Coagulation (also {{known as}} clotting) {{is the process}} by which blood changes from a liquid to a <b>gel,</b> <b>forming</b> a blood clot. It {{potentially}} results in hemostasis, the cessation of blood loss from a damaged vessel, followed by repair. [...] The mechanism of coagulation involves activation, adhesion, and aggregation of platelets along with deposition and maturation of fibrin. Disorders of coagulation are disease states which can result in bleeding (hemorrhage or bruising) or obstructive clotting (thrombosis).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{manuscript}} we report the crosslinking of pre-existing macromolecules in solution {{through the use}} of photoactive benzophenone chromophores. We show that a bifunctional crosslinker composed of two benzophenone chromophores as well as a single benzophenone chromo-phore crosslink poly (butadiene) and poly (ethylene oxide) in solution to <b>form</b> insoluble <b>gels</b> when irradiated with UV light. The molecular weight between crosslinks of the photo-generated gels was compared for the two crosslinkers, for an equivalent amount of benzophenone chromophores in each solution, by measuring the swelling ratio of the <b>gels</b> <b>formed.</b> <b>Gels</b> <b>formed</b> from the bifunctional benzophenone cross-linker were shown to contain {{more than twice as many}} crosslinks compared to <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> from the crosslinker composed of a single benzophenone chromophore.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{gelation}} temperature (20, 30 or 40 °C), assay temperature, concentration of glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) added, and NaCl concentration on the rheological properties of acid casein gels were studied at {{small and large}} deformations. Gels prepared at a high incubation temperature had very low storage moduli (G′), whereas those made at a low incubation temperature had extremely high G′ values. A higher concentration of GDL resulted in faster gelation but slightly lower G′ values of aged gels. Addition of NaCl resulted in longer gelation times and a slower rate of increase of G′. Cooling of gels prepared at 30 or 40 °C resulted {{in an increase in}} G′. However, for <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 20 °C, G′ decreased initially on cooling but returned to its original value on holding at 5 °C. The loss tangent (tan δ) of <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 20 or 30 °C was independent of frequency; however, for <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 40 °C, tan δ was lower at low frequencies. As gels were cooled to 5 °C, tan δ increased. Fracture stress (σfr) of <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 20 °C was much greater than that of the <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at higher temperatures.

40|$|For first time, an {{experimental}} and computational {{study has been}} conducted to define a structural model for the C-A-S-H <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> in alkali-activated slag (AAS) pastes that would account for the mechanical properties of these materials. The study involved a comparison with the C-S-H <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> in a Portland cement paste. The structure of the C-A-S-H gels in AAS pastes depends {{on the nature of}} the alkali activator. When the activator is a NaOH, the structure of the C-S-H gel falls in between tobermorite 1. 4 nm with a mean chain length of five, and tobermorite 1. 1 nm with a mean length of 14. When waterglass is the activator the structure of the C-A-S-H gel is indicative of the co-existence of tobermorite 1. 4 nm with a chain length of 11 and tobermorite 1. 1 nm with a chain length of 14.

40|$|The <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> {{behavior}} of red hake (Urophycis chuss) surimi {{with and without}} starch {{and its relationship to}} the structure of the gel matrix were studied. For surimi gels without starch, a combination of preheat- setting at 40 C and cooking at 90 C resulted in significantly greater gel strength than cooking alone. However, preheat - setting of gels containing wheat or potato starch had no significant effect on gel strength demonstrating an opposite trend in gel strength due to the differences in swelling power, water holding ability and gelatinization temperature between potato and wheat starches. This difference in <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> behavior due to the sources of starch and heat- setting prior to cooking correlated with changes {{in the structure of the}} matrix as evidenced by the results of image analysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to develop novel restructured products from tropical fruits. A model fruit product was developed using fresh tropical fruits puree (avocado, mango, jackfruit, sapodilla, and soursop) and calcium-alginate <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> methods (internal setting). As binding system low viscosity alginate and three different calcium sources (Ca-lactate, Ca-chloride and encapsulated Ca-lactate) were used. <b>Gel</b> <b>forming</b> was conducted by internal setting and calcium was released under controlled conditions simultaneously throughout the system. The products were then stored at 4 oC for 9 days. Sensory evaluation indicated that restructured sapodilla with Calactate or encapsulated Ca-lactate (1 %) had better taste as compared to product were with Ca-chloride. Different calcium sources had no significant effect on flavor as compared to those of fresh fruit. During refrigerated storage, however, products prepared with soursop and avocado suffered discoloration. Calcium, lactate or encapsulated Ca-lactate produced weaker gel than that of calcium chloride.

40|$|Background—It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a pathogenic effect of Helicobacter pylori is a weakening of the protective mucus barrier; however, this remains controversial.  Aims—To clarify the effects of H pylori infection on the mucus gel barrier in vivo.  Methods—Mucus gel polymeric structure and {{the thickness of the}} adherent mucus barrier were measured in endoscopic biopsy samples in subjects with and without H pylori infection.  Results—There was a significant 18 % reduction in the proportion of polymeric <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> mucin in the adherent mucus layer in H pylori positive compared with negative subjects. There was no change in the adherent mucus thickness between H pylori positive and negative subjects without gastric atrophy (mean (SD) : 104 (26) µm, 106 (30) µm respectively). There was however a significant reduction in mucus thickness in those H pylori positive subjects with underlying gastric atrophy (84 (13) µm, p= 0. 03) compared with those without atrophy.  Conclusions—A partial breakdown in <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> structure of the gastric mucus barrier does occur in H pylori infection per se but this is insufficient to cause a collapse of the mucus barrier. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{controlled}} and sustained drug delivery {{has become the}} standard in modern pharmaceutical design and an intensive research have been undertaken in achieving much better drug product effectiveness, reliability and safety. This interest has been sparked by the advantages shown by in situ <b>gel</b> <b>forming</b> drug delivery systems such as ease of administration and reduced frequency of administration, improved patient compliance and comfort. The formation of gels depends on factors like temperature modulation, pH change, presence of ions and ultra violet irradiation, from which the drug gets released in a sustained and controlled manner. Various biodegradable polymers that are used for the formulation of in situ gels include gellan gum, alginic acid, xyloglucan, pectin, chitosan, poly(DL lactic acid), poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) and poly-caprolactone. Mainly in situ gels are administered by oral, ocular, rectal, vaginal, injectable and intraperitoneal routes.
