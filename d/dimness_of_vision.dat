40|$|The term ‘amblyopia’ {{originates}} {{from the}} Greek language and literally means <b>dimness</b> or dullness <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> In time, the condition {{has been defined}} {{in a variety of}} ways, very much depending on the prevailing patho-physiological concept about its etiology. In general, amblyopia can be defined as a unilateral or bilateral decrease in visual acuity for which no organic cause can be found on physical examination of the eye. It is caused by a refractive error (one foveal image is more blurred than the other); strabismus (ocular misalignment causing each eye to have a different image on the fovea) or, more rarely, deprivation of a clear retinal image (physical obstruction, e. g. infantile cataract, ptosis) (von Noorden 1967; 1985; von Noorden and Campos 2002). Amblyopia usually presents itself during the ophthalmological examination by the ophthalmologist or the orthoptist as a reduced visual acuity in one or both eyes, {{in the presence of a}} refractive error and/or strabismus or a deprivation. This reduced visual acuity persists after optimum correction of any refractive error (i. e. a pair of spectacles) and it cannot be explained by another ocular abnormality (e. g. retinopathy) ...|$|R

In the months of October and November febrile attacks are violent; ophthalmia more so.

MRI {{of the brain and}} orbit showed a heterogeneous enhancement of underlying dura and right orbital apex extending into the cavernous sinus. The patient underwent a staged resection in which pathological analysis showed an intraosseous meningioma. When a hyperostotic mass of the skull is encountered, meningioma should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although primary intraosseous meningiomas are rare benign tumors, they can be associated with morbidity secondary to mass effect...|$|E

We report {{a case of}} Axenfeld Rieger syndrome associated with secondary developmental glaucoma who remained undiagnosed since childhood. Twenty-one year old male patient presented with progressive <b>dimness</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and coloured halos. Slit lamp examination showed scleral thinning and megalocornea in both the eyes and iris hypoplasia in the right eye only. Posterior embryotoxon, few tissue bands, high insertion of the iris roots and anterior synechiae were seen on gonioscopy. Intraocular pressure was 32 mmHg in the right eye and 38 mmHg in the left eye. Glaucomatous disc changes were observed in both eyes on fundus examination.

40|$|Long term use of topical &#x 0026;amp; {{systemic}} steroids produce secondary {{open angle}} glaucoma similar to chronic simple glaucoma.

In this study, we analysed 25 patients (44 eyes) with steroid induced glaucoma, who reported to us with <b>dimness</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> haloes and elevated I. O.

P. due to different steroid preparations, the type of lenticular change, and the management of those cases are discussed in this paper. From our study we conclude that dexamethasone and betamethasone both topical as well as systemic are more potent in producing glaucoma and cataract than medrysone and prednisolone. The condition is reversible without permanent damage when the duration of steroid therapy is short and vice versa...|$|E
