40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the work {{undertaken in the}} design and construction of a millimetre wave, quasi-optical <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge.</b> The instrument operates as a nulling complex reflectometer, with nulling being implemented at the signal frequency by interferometric optical techniques. In principle, the quasi-optical components of the reflectometer are operable in the frequency range 80 GHz to 500 GHz, though the range of continuous coverage is determined by the waveguide components and antennas used to couple sources and detectors into the Gaussian beams. Gaussian beam mode theory has been employed {{in the design and}} measurement of the quasi-optical components, which behaved as expected. Phase and polarisation effects within the <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge</b> were modelled and the consequent behaviour of the <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge</b> predicted. A comparison of these predictions with early results led to refinement of the model. This model is based upon a more complete description of the transmissivities and reflectivities of the wire grid polarising beam splitters and accurately predicts the instrument behaviour. A data acquisition and control system has been built to facilitate automated operation of the <b>impedance</b> <b>bridge.</b> This system is interfaced to an Acorn® Archimedes microcomputer and the hardware and software has been developed to enable interrupt driven data acquisition.

50|$|Capacitive {{coupling}} has {{the disadvantage}} of degrading the low frequency performance of a system containing capacitively coupled units. Each coupling capacitor along with the input electrical impedance of the next stage forms a high-pass filter and the sequence of filters results in a cumulative filter with a −3dB frequency that may be {{higher than those of}} each individual filter. So for adequate low frequency response, the capacitors used must have high capacitance ratings. They should be high enough that the reactance of each is at most a tenth of the input impedance of each stage, at the lowest frequency of interest. See <b>Impedance</b> <b>bridging.</b>|$|R
