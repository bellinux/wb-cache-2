5|$|Kohlberg's scale <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages {{are not a}} method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It is not important to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E

With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind blow the door shut, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, which Chas at first thinks <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land. Boris explains that it's actually a story about how an aunt and uncle of his met at Passover Seder back in Russia.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{selection}} in insects <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> sexual selection functions in insects.

25|$|The main {{themes in}} Brennan's short stories are {{feelings}} of loneliness, vulnerability, despair, spite, and fear. She often wrote about unhappy, loveless marriages {{and people with}} claustrophobic, sad and disappointed lives. Her studies of these relationships sometimes have a cruel tone. Another theme <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance {{in a country that}} clung to traditions steeped in the church and strict convention. For example, in The Devil In Us she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 {{the double}} album The Fragile was released. It was {{partially}} successful, but lost money for Reznor's label, so he funded the North American Fragility Tour {{out of his}} own pocket. A further six years followed before the next Nine Inch Nails album, With Teeth was released. During the intermediary period between the two records Reznor went into rehab, and was able to manage his drug addictions. After With Teeth Reznor released the concept album Year Zero, which has an alternate reality game themed after the album (see Year Zero (game)) which <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the current policies of the American government will affect the world in the year 2020. After Year Zero's release in 2007 Reznor broke from large record labels, and released two albums, Ghosts I-IV and The Slip independently on his own label, The Null Corporation. In 2009 Nine Inch Nails went on hiatus, following the Wave Goodbye Tour. In 2013 Nine Inch Nails returned to large record labels, signing with Columbia Records. In September the album Hesitation Marks was released, and earlier, in August, the ongoing Tension 2013 tour began.|$|E
25|$|Drifting {{competitions}} {{are judged}} based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, {{which is usually}} announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such {{as the amount of}} smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd's reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course. The rate-to-angle is how quickly during initiation or Furidashi (振り出し:starting point) and transitions or Furikaeshi (振替し:transfer) a car gets to its sliding angle. Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through the turn(s), and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next. Commitment <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. That is the quicker the driver is able to come to angle, the more speed and angle they can carry through the course, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher the style score.|$|E

25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, we have only travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E
