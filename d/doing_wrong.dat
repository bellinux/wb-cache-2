5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is <b>doing</b> <b>wrong</b> and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that sexual violence is also a learnt behavior in some adults, particularly as regards child sexual abuse. Studies on sexually abused boys have shown that around one in five continue in later life to molest children themselves.

25|$|Finally, in the {{eleventh}} canto, Indra arrives as a sage, praises Arjuna's asceticism, but criticises him for seeking victory and wealth instead of liberation — {{the goddess of}} Fortune is fickle and indscriminate. Arjuna stands his ground, explaining his situation and pointing out that conciliation with evil people would lead one into <b>doing</b> <b>wrong</b> actions oneself. He gives a further long speech that forms {{the heart of the}} epic, on right conduct, self-respect, resoluteness, dignity, and wisdom.

25|$|In boxing, each fighter {{is given}} {{a corner of the}} ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his {{trainers}} stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the cutman. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is <b>doing</b> <b>wrong</b> as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous doctor responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts and blood. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts that threaten the boxer's eyes.|$|E

We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people.

500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress to remind her potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on how to hold a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ Been locked up in the house way too long / It's time to get it, cause once again he's out <b>doing</b> <b>wrong</b> [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing anything to keep her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E
25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least <b>do</b> not <b>do</b> <b>wrong</b> willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one <b>does</b> any <b>wrong</b> willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who <b>do</b> no <b>wrong,</b> not that some <b>do</b> <b>wrong</b> willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly <b>does</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|R

500|$|In 2005, [...] "Girl" [...] {{was part}} of the set list of the group's final tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It. The {{performance}} was preceded by a video interlude, during which Beyoncé, Williams and Rowland appeared on the screen on the stage. The former two started discussing about the latter's relationship who also joined them after hearing their opinions. Their discussions were similar to the lyrical content of the song with the two trying to convince her the relationship is wrong and the latter defending her love interest. After the interlude finished, the group appeared onstage performing [...] "Girl" [...] mixing it with [...] "I'll Take You There". While reviewing a concert in the UK, Adenike Adenitire of MTV News praised the performance, concluding [...] "They borrowed the 'Sex and the City' theme for the 'Girl' video, but they lean more toward 'Girlfriends' when taking it on the road, with a light comedy moment that may see TV execs thinking seriously about a Destiny's Child sitcom." [...] In contrast, Barbara Ellen of The Observer criticized the segment during which [...] "Girl" [...] was performed, writing [...] "... no amount of 'girlpower' rabble-rousing can disguise the fact the songs are wet-paper-bag weak; giving the impression of three bored young women dozing off at a slumber party, whining in their jim-jams about men who 'done them wrong', or men who 'done someone else wrong', or just men <b>doing</b> <b>wrong,</b> period." [...] The song was included on the track listing of the group's live album Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta (2006) chronicling a concert from the tour in that city.|$|E

Why Hashem decided to grant their efforts some degree of success is one of the mysteries of our era.

2500|$|Ibn Qutaybah, a 9th-century Sunni Islamic scholar narrates of Ali:I am {{the servant}} of God and {{the brother of}} the Messenger of God. I am thus more worthy of this office than you.

You have seized this office from the Ansar using your tribal relationship to the Prophet as an argument against them. Would you then seize this office from us, the ahl al-bayt by force? Did you not claim before the Ansar that you were more worthy than they of the caliphate because Muhammad came from among you (but Muhammad was never from AbuBakr family) – and thus they gave you leadership and surrendered command?

This is stated in sahih Sunni Hadith, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim. Fatimah did not at all pledge allegiance or acknowledge or accept the caliphate of Abu Bakr. Almost all of Banu Hashim, Muhammad's clan and many of the sahaba, had supported Ali's cause after the demise of the prophet whilst others supported Abu Bakr.|$|E
