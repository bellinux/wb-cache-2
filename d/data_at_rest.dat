2500|$|Information {{assurance}} (IA) is {{the practice}} of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user data. It uses physical, technical and administrative controls to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, {{the full range of}} IA encompasses not only digital but also analog or physical form.

[...] Early versions of PGP {{have been found to}} have theoretical vulnerabilities and so current versions are recommended.

50|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that archive data (i.e. which never changes), regardless of its storage medium, is <b>data</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and active data subject to constant or frequent change is data in use, “inactive data” could be taken to mean data which may change, but infrequently.

5000|$|File and Directory {{encryption}} are {{two types}} of encryption that help protect the confidentiality of digital information.

30|$|Correspondingly, the {{research}} efforts for protecting data confidentiality {{can be divided}} into two categories: encryption and secure deletion. Encryption can protect confidentiality of the <b>data</b> stored <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> by transforming them into another format using some secrets (e.g., keys), such that the adversary is not able to correlate the transformed format to the original format without obtaining the secrets. All types of existing encryption mechanisms like symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption can achieve the aforementioned security property. Secure deletion is to ensure that once the sensitive data are deleted, the probability of recovering them is negligibly small. This requires special techniques to completely destroy data, eliminating any traces which may lead to a full/partial data recovery.|$|R

50|$|Because of its nature, Data in Use is of {{increasing}} concern to businesses, {{government agencies and}} other institutions. Data in use, or memory, can contain sensitive data including digital certificates, encryption keys, intellectual property (software algorithms, design data), and personally identifiable information.

40|$|Impact of {{variability}} in the measured parameter is rarely considered in designing clinical protocols for optimization of atrioventricular (AV) or interventricular (VV) delay of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In this article, we approach this question quantitatively using mathematical simulation in which the true optimum is known and examine practical implications using some real measurements. We calculated the performance of any optimization process that selects the pacing setting which maximizes an underlying signal, such as flow or pressure, {{in the presence of}} overlying random variability (noise). If signal and noise are of equal size, for a 5 -choice optimization (60, 100, 140, 180, 220  ms), replicate AV delay optima are rarely identical but rather scattered {{with a standard deviation of}} 45  ms. This scatter was overwhelmingly determined (ρ = − 0. 975, P <  0. 001) by Information Content, Signal/Signal + Noise, an expression of signal-to-noise ratio. Averaging multiple replicates improves information content. In real clinical <b>data,</b> <b>at</b> <b>resting,</b> heart rate information content is often only 0. 2 – 0. 3; elevated pacing rates can raise information content above 0. 5. Low information content (e. g. < 0. 5) causes gross overestimation of optimization-induced increment in VTI, high false-positive appearance of change in optimum between visits and very wide confidence intervals of individual patient optimum. AV and VV optimization by selecting the setting showing maximum cardiac function can only be accurate if information content is high. Simple steps to reduce noise such as averaging multiple replicates, or to increase signal such as increasing heart rate, can improve information content, and therefore viability, of any optimization process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Hard {{disk drives}} are {{becoming}} increasingly vulnerable to security attacks {{as they are now}} accessed remotely, attached to mobile devices or used in other previously unanticipated operating environments. Protecting <b>data</b> while <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> has emerged as a chief concern for storage vendors who have introduced secure disks in the market. These devices are capable of encrypting data on the fly before recording on the media. In this work, we show the inadequacies of current single level encryption hard disk drives in exploiting performance vs security trade-offs and propose secure disks with multiple crypto levels. We focus on modeling such devices and propose stochastically optimal policies to dynamically select crypto levels for disk data in order to maximize a notion of security that we call ”goodness of Security ” while adhering to performance bounds. Simulation studies using synthetic and real disk traces show that our proposed policies achieve better levels of security than the best current practices without violating the performance bounds. ...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) might have subclinical myocardial dysfunction identified <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> or unmasked during exercise. We examined the correlates of the myocardial exercise response in patients with T 2 DM. Myocardial dysfunction was sought during <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and exercise echocardiography in 167 healthy patients with T 2 DM (97 men, 55 +/- 10 years). Myocardial ischemia was excluded using stress echocardiography. Standard echocardiography and color tissue Doppler imaging measures (early diastolic tissue velocity [Em], strain, and strain rate) were acquired at baseline and peak stress. The calibrated integrated backscatter was calculated from the <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> parasternal long-axis view.

Experimental results using leave-one-out cross-validation show that features extracted from the default mode network (DMN) lead to a classification accuracy of over 90 % in both data sets. Moreover, using a majority vote method that uses multiple features, we achieve a classification accuracy of 98 % in auditory oddball (AOD) task and 93 % in rest data. Several components, including DMN, temporal, and medial visual regions, are consistently present in the set of features that yield high classification accuracy. The features we have extracted thus show promise to be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia.

40|$|Brain {{regions are}} often topographically connected: nearby {{locations}} within one brain area connect with nearby locations in another area. Mapping these connection topographies, or 'connectopies' in short, {{is crucial for}} understanding how information is processed in the brain. Here, we propose principled, fully data-driven methods for mapping connectopies using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) <b>data</b> acquired <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> by combining spectral embedding of voxel-wise connectivity 'fingerprints' with a novel approach to spatial statistical inference. We applied the approach in human primary motor and visual cortex, and show that it can trace biologically plausible, overlapping connectopies in individual subjects that follow these regions' somatotopic and retinotopic maps. As a generic mechanism to perform inference over connectopies, the new spatial statistics approach enables rigorous statistical testing of hypotheses regarding the fine-grained spatial profile of functional connectivity and whether that profile is different between subjects or between experimental conditions. The combined framework offers a fundamental alternative to existing approaches to investigating functional connectivity in the brain, from voxel- or seed-pair wise characterizations of functional association, towards a full, multivariate characterization of spatial topography...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesContinuous flow left {{ventricular}} assist devices {{are used in}} end-stage systolic heart failure. However, about {{one half of the}} patients with heart failure exhibit diastolic dysfunction with a normal ejection fraction. In the present study, the possible hemodynamic consequences of continuous flow {{left ventricular}} assist devices use for these patients were investigated. MethodsA previously developed cardiovascular model was modified to reproduce the peculiar hemodynamics of heart failure with a normal ejection fraction. The model was based on and validated with patient data derived from the published data. A continuous flow left ventricular assist device model was included and the hemodynamic effects of pump support evaluated <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during exercise. ResultsThe model accurately reproduced the published <b>data</b> both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during exercise, leading to simulated hemodynamic values within the standard deviations of patient variability. <b>At</b> <b>rest,</b> pump support decreased the end-diastolic left ventricular pressure (6 vs 15 mm Hg) and volume (88 vs 135 mL). During exercise, maximal pump support substantially unloaded the left ventricle (end-diastolic pressure, 14 vs 35 mm Hg; volume, 133 vs 158 mL) and the pulmonary venous circulation (left atrial pressure, 12 vs 24 mm Hg) and resulted in a slight increase in cardiac output (11. 7 vs 9. 9 L/min). ConclusionsThe simulation results suggested that continuous flow left ventricular assist devices improve the hemodynamics in patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction. For an optimal use of continuous flow left ventricular assist devices, low speeds should be maintained <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> to avoid suction. However, during physical activity, higher speeds are needed to prevent an abnormal increase in the ventricular filling pressures typical of patients with heart failure and a normal ejection fraction...|$|R
