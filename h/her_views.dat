5|$|Lucinda Lee Dalton (born Lucinda Lee; February 9, 1847 – November 24, 1925) was a Utah teacher, and suffragist. She shared <b>her</b> <b>views</b> through {{essays and}} poems {{published}} in the Women's Exponent, a periodical for Latter-day Saint women.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Ginsburg did answer {{questions}} about some potentially controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her belief in {{a constitutional right to}} privacy and explained at some length her personal judicial philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality. Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing <b>her</b> <b>views</b> on topics about which she had previously written. The U.S. Senate confirmed her by a 96 to 3 vote and she took her judicial oath on August 10, 1993.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery {{with his}} Northern cousin Ophelia who, while {{opposing}} slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, {{believes he is}} not biased, {{even though he is}} a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that <b>her</b> <b>views</b> on blacks are wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.|$|E

5|$|Watts Morgan {{was married}} twice, first to Elizabeth Williams then to Blanche Amy Morgan. Blanche was herself a strong campaigner for miners' rights, and was {{among a group}} of agents' wives who {{promoted}} the provision of pithead baths, bathing areas for the miners at the surface. She was outspoken in <b>her</b> <b>views,</b> and once supported a political rival of her husband's party, forcing Watts Morgan to make a public apology.|$|E
5|$|William {{excluded}} George {{from active}} military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence {{until after the}} deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence {{in support of his}} wife, even when privately disagreeing with <b>her</b> <b>views.</b> He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946– April 9, 2005) was an American radical {{feminist and}} writer {{best known for}} her {{criticism}} of pornography, which she argued was linked to rape and other forms of violence against women. <b>Her</b> <b>views</b> were widely criticized by liberal feminists and others. At the same time, she maintained a dialogue with political conservatives, and wrote a topically-related book, Right-Wing Women. After suffering abuse from her first husband, she was introduced to radical feminist literature, and began writing Woman Hating. Coming to New York, she became an activist on several issues and a writer, eventually publishing 10 books on feminism.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect <b>her</b> <b>views.</b> Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw <b>her</b> <b>views</b> {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
5|$|After serving her sentence, she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in <b>her</b> <b>views,</b> encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E

5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate <b>her</b> <b>views,</b> and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing that they put professional astrologers out of business.|$|E
5|$|Many {{songs on}} Graduation contain {{background}} vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System. The collaboration came about when West met her bandmates Angus McDonald and Daimon Downey at a diner in Sydney while touring {{the country with}} U2 around November 2006. Seeking musical inspiration, West asked McDonald for ideas, who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell. Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour, West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking to her voice. U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell's singing while visiting the studio. Some time later, Mitchell {{received a call from}} West who asked if she could travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album. Mitchell later admitted that while she previously didn't know who Kanye West was and never really cared for hip-hop music, the collaboration has changed <b>her</b> <b>views.</b>|$|E
5|$|Marge asks Belle {{to close}} down the burlesque house, but Belle refuses, saying that {{the house is a}} part of Springfield. At a town meeting, Marge brings up the matter and shows {{pictures}} of several prominent citizens leaving. They form a mob so they can go destroy the burlesque house. The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so by singing a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about <b>her</b> <b>views.</b> During the opening lines, she accidentally puts the bulldozer into drive and destroys a wing of the burlesque house. She apologizes profusely and, to pay for the damage, she starts a ventriloquist act at the house.|$|E

5|$|Matilda {{spent the}} rest of her life in Normandy, often acting as Henry's {{representative}} and presiding over the government of the Duchy. Early on, Matilda and her son issued charters in England and Normandy in their joint names, dealing with the various land claims that had arisen during the wars. Particularly in the initial years of his reign, the King drew on her for advice on policy matters. Matilda was involved in attempts to mediate between Henry and his Chancellor Thomas Becket when the two men fell out in the 1160s. Matilda had originally cautioned against the appointment, but when the Prior of Mont St Jacques asked her for a private interview on Becket's behalf to seek <b>her</b> <b>views,</b> she provided a moderate perspective on the problem. Matilda explained that she disagreed with Henry's attempts to codify English customs, which Becket was opposed to, but also condemned poor administration in the English Church and Becket's own headstrong behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or <b>her</b> <b>views</b> heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been said not to apply in administrative law.|$|E
5|$|Honora Edgeworth (née Sneyd; 1751 – 1 May 1780) was an {{eighteenth-century}} English writer, mainly {{known for}} her associations with literary figures of the day particularly Anna Seward and the Lunar Society, and for her work on children's education. Sneyd was born in Bath in 1751, and {{following the death of}} her mother in 1756 was raised by Canon Thomas Seward and his wife Elizabeth in Lichfield, Staffordshire until she returned to her father's house in 1771. There, she formed a close friendship with their daughter, Anna Seward. Having had a romantic engagement to John André and having declined the hand of Thomas Day, she married Richard Edgeworth as his second wife in 1773, living on the family estate in Ireland till 1776. There she helped raise his children from his first marriage, including Maria Edgeworth, and two children of her own. Returning to England she fell ill with tuberculosis, which was incurable, dying at Weston in Staffordshire in 1780. She {{is the subject of a}} number of Anna Seward's poems, and with her husband developed concepts of childhood education, resulting in a series of books, such as Practical Education, based on her observations of the Edgeworth children. She is {{known for her}} stand on women's rights through her vigorous rejection of the proposal by Day, in which she outlined <b>her</b> <b>views</b> on equality in marriage.|$|E
