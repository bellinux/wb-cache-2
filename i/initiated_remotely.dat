50|$|A {{pyrotechnic}} fastener (also {{called an}} explosive bolt, or pyro, within context) is a fastener, usually a nut or bolt, that incorporates a pyrotechnic charge {{that can be}} <b>initiated</b> <b>remotely.</b> One or more explosive charges embedded within the bolt are typically activated by an electric current, and the charge breaks the bolt into two or more pieces. The bolt is typically scored around its circumference at the point(s) where the severance should occur. Such bolts are often used in space applications to ensure separation between rocket stages, because they are lighter and much more reliable than mechanical latches.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{strategies that}} can be used in commercial buildings to temporarily reduce electric load in response to electric grid emergencies in which supplies are limited or in response to high prices that would be incurred if these strategies were not employed. The demand response strategies discussed herein are based on the results of three years of automated demand response field tests in which 28 commercial facilities with an occupied area totaling over 11 million ft{sup 2 } were tested. Although the demand response events in the field tests were <b>initiated</b> <b>remotely</b> and performed automatically, the strategies used could also be initiated by on-site building operators and performed manually, if desired. While energy efficiency measures can be used during normal building operations, demand response measures are transient; they are employed to produce a temporary reduction in demand. Demand response strategies achieve reductions in electric demand by temporarily reducing the level of service in facilities. Heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting are the systems most commonly adjusted for demand response in commercial buildings. The goal of demand response strategies is to meet the electric shed savings targets while minimizing any negative impacts on the occupants of the buildings or the processes that they perform. Occupant complaints were minimal in the field tests. In some cases, ''reductions'' in service level actually improved occupant comfort or productivity. In other cases, permanent improvements in efficiency were discovered through the planning and implementation of ''temporary'' demand response strategies. The DR strategies that are available to a given facility are based on factors such as the type of HVAC, lighting and energy management and control systems (EMCS) installed at the site...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two ways}} in which the testing may be <b>initiated,</b> <b>remotely</b> or locally. If the remote {{operation}} is desired, an external TTL level signal must be provided to the test jig with the remotellocal switch {{on the side of the}} test jig switched to remote. A logic high will initiate the test. A logic low will terminate the test. In the event that an external signal is connected to the test jig while local operation occurs, the local control takes precedence over remote control. Once a DVT has been locked in the ZIF socket and the DIP switches are selected, the Push-to-Test button may be depressed. Momentarily depressing the button will initiate a test with a minimum 400 ms duration. At the same time a PBCLOCK and PBLATCH pulses will be initiated and the power rails + 12 V, + 8 V, and - 6 V will be ramped to full voltage. The time at which the power rails reach the full voltage is about 13 ms and it is synchronized with bypass capacitors placed on COMP input of U 20 and U 22 and on the output of U 23 voltage regulators. The voltage rails are supplied to a {+-} 10 % window comparator. A red LED indicates the rail is below or above 10 % of the design value. A green LED indicates the rail is within acceptable limits. For DDT with a 5 pF and 10 pF feed back capacitor, the + 12 V and + 8 V rails are current-regulated to 19 rnA and 22 rnA respectively and the - 6 V rail is short-circuit protected within the regulator. For DUT with a 22 pF feed back capacitor the current regulation is the same as above except that the + 8 V rail is current regulated to 43 rnA. The power rails are supplied to the DUT via a 10 {Omega} resistor. The voltage drop across this resistor is sensed by a differential amplifier AD 620 and amplified by a gain of 10. An external BNC connection is provided from this point to allow for current measurements by the vendor. The current value for each rail is calculated by measuring the voltage value at this point and divided by (10 * 10 {Omega}). The next stage inverts and amplifies the voltage signal by a factor of 5 for + 12 V and - 6 V rails and by a factor of 1 for + 8 V rail. For DUT with 22 pF feed back capacitor the amplification factors are same as above except that the amplification factor for + 8 V rail is a gain of 2. An offset null potentiometer is provided between the AD 620 and the inverting stage which eliminates device offset current errors. The inverted and amplified voltage is presented to two window comparators. One of them compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the low threshold point and the other one compares the inverted and amplified voltage to the high threshold point. If the inverted and amplified voltage is within the low and high threshold points, both the low and the high current LEDs illuminate green indicating the current is within acceptable limits. If the inverted and amplified voltage is below the low threshold point or above the high threshold point, the low current LED or the high current LED illuminates red, respectively, indicating the current is outside acceptable limits...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of an in vivo implanted drug delivery system. The delivery device consists of a cooling material coated by a drug-loaded thermoresponsive polymer film. Drug release is <b>initiated</b> by <b>remotely</b> dropping {{the temperature of the}} cooling material sufficiently for the temperature throughout the polymer coating to drop below its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), causing the polymer to swell and release the drug. Drug release switches off again when heat conduction from an external fluid medium raises the polymer temperature to above the LCST causing the polymer to collapse. Candidate cooling mechanisms based on endothermic chemical reactions, the Peltier effect, and the magnetocaloric effect are considered. In the thin polymer film limit, the model provides an upper bound for the temperature the cooling material must be lowered for drug release to be initiated. Significantly, the model predicts that the duration a thin polymer will continue to release drug in a single cycle is proportional to the square of the thickness of the cooling material. It is found that the system may be realised for realistic parameter values and materials. A simple illustrative calculation incorporating the presence of a heat source is presented, and the results suggest that conduction due to the initial temperature difference between the water and the cooling material can make the dominant contribution to heat transfer in the polymer as it reheats to its LCST...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} {{of light to}} produce useful responses holds much potential for changing the world through smart materials and photovoltaic systems. We report the {{utilization of}} a variety of carbon nanotube composites as photovoltaic devices or as optothermal materials for the controlled placement of heat. Toward carbon nanotube - polymer photovoltaics we have successfully shown supramolecular compatibilization and functional bilayer devices. Opothermal processes are shown to manipulate a variety of system variables: surface energy, surface tension, and pressure. By manipulating these variables interesting responses are produced. Optothermal surface energy control produced wettability switches of 70 º on composite surfaces. Optothermally modulated surface tensions of fluids converted light into work in the form of controlled linear motion, rotational motion, and volumetric expansion. Optothermally heated liquids confined within impermeable microcapsules resulted in the phototriggerable release of chemicals on demand. This release allowed small molecule reactions and polymerizations to be <b>remotely</b> <b>initiated</b> in a spatially selective manner. These results lay the framework for the expansion of the field of advanced optothermally responsive materials...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a new {{controlled}} thermoresponsive {{drug delivery}} system based on UV crosslinkable copolymer films was fabricated and characterised. The characterisation of the drug loaded films has shown an even drug distribution inside of the film which has a smooth surface (Ra = 8. 3 nm). The kinetic study {{has shown that the}} release of two model drugs can be controlled by the thickness of the films, the initial drug concentration, and the solubility of the drug molecules. This controlled {{drug delivery system}}, fabricated from a thermoresponsive polymer, was designed to obtain a pulsatile release profile which is triggered by altering the temperature of the dissolution medium. Two stages of release behaviour were observed: fast release for the swollen state and slow (yet significant and non-negligible) release for the collapsed state. A mathematical model was developed to evaluate the feasibility of an in vivo implanted drug delivery system. The delivery device consists of a cooling material coated by a drug-loaded thermoresponsive polymer film. Drug release is <b>initiated</b> by <b>remotely</b> dropping the temperature of the cooling material sufficiently, so that the temperature throughout the polymer coating drops below its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), causing the polymer to swell and release the drug. Drug release switches off again when heat conduction from an external fluid medium raises the polymer temperature to above the LCST causing the polymer to collapse. The model was developed based on Fick 2 ̆ 7 s law which describes pulsatile release mathematically for the first time. Diffusion coefficients at different temperatures (including temperatures corresponding to both the fully swollen and collapsed states) were estimated by fitting the experimental data with the theoretical release profile given by this model. The effect of temperature on the diffusion coefficient was studied. The LCST of a series of poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) (poly(NIPAm)) block copolymers were measured using the cloud point method. This study has found the hydrophobicity of a segment in a copolymer, and the length of the poly(NIPAm) segment affects the LCST. The poly(acrylic acid) (poly(AA)) block supplies the pH sensitivity in the block copolymer. These block copolymers can self assemble into particles which show no cytotoxicity towards 3 T 3 mouse fibroblast cells...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{information}} on crop yield {{is important for}} crop management and food policy making. A data assimilation approach was developed to integrate remotely sensed data with a crop growth model for crop yield estimation. The objective was to model the crop yield when the input data for the crop growth model are inadequate, {{and to make the}} yield forecast {{in the middle of the}} growing season. The Cropping System Model (CSM) -Crop Environment Resource Synthesis (CERES) -Maize and the Markov Chain canopy Reflectance Model (MCRM) were coupled in the data assimilation process. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and vegetation index products were assimilated into the coupled model to estimate corn yield in Indiana, USA. Five different assimilation schemes were tested to study the effect of using different control variables: independent usage of LAI, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and synergic usage of LAI and EVI or NDVI. Parameters of the CSM-CERES-Maize model were <b>initiated</b> with the <b>remotely</b> sensed data to estimate corn yield for each county of Indiana. Our results showed that the estimated corn yield agreed very well with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) data. Among different scenarios, the best results were obtained when both MODIS vegetation index and LAI products were assimilated and the relative deviations from the NASS data were less than 3. 5 %. Including only LAI in the model performed moderately well with a relative difference of 8. 6 %. The results from using only EVI or NDVI were unacceptable, as the deviations were as high as 21 % and - 13 % for the EVI and NDVI schemes, respectively. Our study showed that corn yield at harvest could be successfully predicted using only a partial year of remotely sensed data...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a multi-purpose sensor concept viable for the simultaneous measurement of pressure, temperature and thickness of plate structures. It also establishes {{the knowledge base}} necessary for future sensor design. Thermal-Acousto Photonic Non-Destructive Evaluation (TAP-NDE) is employed to <b>remotely</b> <b>initiate</b> and acquire interrogating ultrasonic waves. Parameters including pressure, temperature and plate thickness are determined through exploring the dispersion features of the interrogating waves. A theoretical study is performed, through which a modified wave propagation theory applicable to homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic materials is formulated along with an associated numerical model. A numerical scheme for solving the model is also developed using FEMLAB, a finite element based PDE solver. Gabor Wavelet Transform (GWT) is employed to map numerical time waveforms into the joint time-frequency domain. Wave time-frequency information enables dispersion curves to be extracted and material pressure, temperature and thickness to be determined. A sensor configuration design integrating the wave generation and sensing components of the proven TAP-NDE technology is also developed. Conclusions of the research are drawn from wave dispersion obtained corresponding to the following ranges of parameters: 300 - 500 kHz for frequency, 25 - 300 oC for temperature, 1 - 3 mm for plate thickness, and 6 10 1 ?? - 7 1 10 ?? N/m for pressure. Each of the three parameters considered in the study has a different level of impact on plate wave dispersion. Plate thickness is found {{to have the most}} impact on wave dispersion, followed by temperature of the plate. The effect attributable to pressure is the least prominent among the three parameters considered. Plate thickness and temperature can be readily measured while simultaneously resolved using dispersion curves. However, pressure variation can only be differentiated when the plate is smaller than 1 mm in thickness. It is observed that the thicker the plate, the faster the frequency group velocity. Also, the group velocities of all frequency components considered are seen to increase with increasing temperature, but decrease with increasing pressure...|$|R
