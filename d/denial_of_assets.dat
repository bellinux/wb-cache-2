40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service problem, {{in the context}} of services provided over a network, and contributes to improved techniques for modelling, detecting, and preventing <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks against these services. While the majority <b>of</b> currently employed <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks aim to pre-emptively consume the network bandwidth of victims, a significant amount of research effort is already being directed at this problem. This research is instead concerned with addressing the inevitable migration <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks up the protocol stack to the application layer. Of particular interest is the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance of key establishment protocols (security protocols that enable an initiator and responder to mutually authenticate and establish cryptographic keys for establishing a secure communications channel), which owing to the computationally intensive activities they perform, are particularly vulnerable to attack. Given the preponderance of wireless networking technologies this research hasalso investigated <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service and its detection in IEEE 802. 11 standards based networks.
