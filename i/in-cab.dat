25|$|Owing to {{the failure}} of the WCML upgrade to provide <b>in-cab</b> signalling, these units are limited in service to 125mph (200km/h) {{operation}} rather than their 140mph (225km/h) design speed. In 2006, Virgin Trains announced that, over the next three years, they will be examining the possibility of running the trains at 135mph (215km/h) through the Trent Valley as part of their new WCML Franchise Proposal.|$|E
25|$|Results {{from the}} anthropometric {{study and the}} <b>in-cab</b> {{measurements}} have been transferred to vehicle manufacturers, who will use them to design {{the next generation of}} truck cabs to better accommodate today’s population of truck drivers. The safety implications of these design changes are many – improved visibility for drivers, better control of the vehicle, improved safety-belt design, and reduced risk of chronic conditions such as low back pain.|$|E
25|$|When the Department for Transport first {{released}} the train specification {{for the new}} trains for the IEP in November 2007, it was stated that the Great Western main line would be upgraded to ETCS level 2 and ERTMS Level 2 <b>in-cab</b> signalling. Some {{or all of the}} resignalling work will be carried out alongside the electrification work. Signalling Solutions is to resignal the 12miles from Paddington to , including the Airport branch, as part of the Crossrail project.|$|E
25|$|Communication between {{train crew}} and Control always occurs using a {{landline}} at stations. There is no <b>in-cab</b> radio system and current regulations forbid {{use of such}} whilst in motion. As a backup system only, the guard carries a company mobile telephone for use in an emergency. This is not a primary system as cellular coverage is intermittent over {{the length of the}} line. Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate, the organisation responsible for safety on British railways, insists on landlines as the main form of safety critical communication.|$|E
25|$|Model Dockyard was {{the first}} to release a brass, ready-to-run model of the {{locomotive}} in 1967. The units were generic, unpainted models and significantly pre-dated the modern preservation era, so none of the more modern features are represented. The engines were packaged in a blue box with foam interiors, and were fitted with Triang-style motor and gearbox which projected into the locomotive cab, and retailed for $78AUD. The units were manufactured by Kumata in Japan. A re-run was produced in Korea in 1982, using a newer, smaller can motor design which allowed for <b>in-cab</b> detailing.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom's first {{dedicated}} high-speed line, High Speed 1 between London and the Channel Tunnel, opened 14 November 2007. A second line, dubbed High Speed 2, is now {{planned by}} the government, to be constructed initially between London and Birmingham with later extensions to Manchester and Leeds. High Speed 2 {{was approved by}} the government in January 2012. Furthermore, future upgrades to the Great Western and East Coast main lines (in combination with the Intercity Express Programme) could increase the lines' operating speed to , which would by definition make them high-speed railways. Such an increase would require the installation of <b>in-cab</b> signalling. Like Finnish and Russian counterparts, the strongest reasons for new high-speed lines are to relieve congestion on the existing network and create extra capacity.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the announced mid-life update of the existing Class 373 fleet, Eurostar in 2009 reportedly entered prequalification bids for eight new trainsets to be purchased. Any new trains would need to meet the same safety rules governing passage through the Channel Tunnel as the existing Class 373 fleet. The replacement to the Class 373 trains has been decided jointly between the French Transport Ministry and the UK Department for Transport. [...] The new trains will be equipped {{to use the new}} ERTMS <b>in-cab</b> signalling system, due to be fitted to High Speed 1 around 2040.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the metro was the Holmenkollen Line, that opened as light rail in 1898. The Røa Line {{followed}} as a branch in 1912. The system became the first Nordic underground railway in 1928, when the underground line to Nationaltheatret was opened. The Østensjø Line opened in 1923, the Kolsås Line in 1924, and the Sognsvann Line in 1934. The Kolsås Line opened {{as an extension of the}} Lilleaker Line, but in 1942 it was connected to the Common Tunnel, while the rest of the Lilleaker Line remains as a light rail connected to the Oslo Tramway. The opening of the upgraded metro system in the eastern boroughs occurred in 1966, after the conversion of the 1957 Lambertseter Line to metro standard. This involves the lines using third rail instead of overhead wires, having [...] long platforms and automatic train protection <b>in-cab</b> signaling. It was followed by the conversion of the Østensjø Line, as well as the new Grorud Line and Furuset Line. In 1993, trains could, for the first time, run through the city between the two networks in the Common Tunnel. The latest extension is the 2006 opening of the Ring Line, that connects the eastern and western network north of the city center.|$|E

2500|$|Network Rail {{plans to}} install European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) <b>in-cab</b> {{signalling}} on the Great Western line; {{this is a}} pre-requisite for the Super Express trains to run at 140mph (225km/h).

2500|$|From {{the early}} 20th century {{operating}} companies in such countries as Germany and Britain began to fit locomotives with <b>in-cab</b> signalling (AWS), which automatically applied the brakes when a signal was passed at [...] "caution".

2500|$|A similar {{near-accident}} {{occurred on}} November 17, 2001 in Bienenbüttel on the Hamburg-Hanover rail line.

2500|$|BR then {{proceeded}} to electrify the ECML and ordered a new fleet of Intercity 225 electric trains in the mid-1980s. These were capable of [...] and although not initially equipped to tilt, were designed to be easily upgraded to tilt mode by having trailer profiles that tapered inwards {{at the top and}} suitable bogies. Speeds of [...] were tested on the southern, straighter sections of the ECML by using a flashing green aspect on the signals. This indicated it was safe to proceed above , but HMRSI eventually ruled that this was dangerous and that speeds above 125mph would require <b>in-cab</b> signalling. The 225s were therefore limited to [...] and have been ever since.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the present}} <b>in-cab</b> {{regulations}} came in, British Rail experimented with 140mph running by introducing a fifth, flashing green signalling aspect on the Down Fast line (signals P487 to P615) and Up Fast line (signals P610 to P494) between New England North and Stoke Tunnel. The fifth aspect is still shown in normal service and appears {{when the next}} signal is showing a green (or another flashing green) aspect and the signal section is clear, which ensures that there is sufficient braking distance to bring a train to a stand from 140mph. Locomotives have operated on the ECML at speeds of up to [...] in test runs. The capability to run special test trains in excess of 125mph is listed as being maintained in the LNE Sectional Appendix ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{remainder}} of Britain's railway network is considerably slower. No trains run faster than [...] using routes largely {{established in the}} middle years of the nineteenth century. A major reason for this limit {{is the lack of}} <b>in-cab</b> signalling, which has been deemed necessary by safety authorities for higher speeds. The speed limit on some sections of the East Coast Main Line was experimentally raised to [...] during the upgrade and electrification of the route during the 1980s (both the Pendolinos used on the West Coast Main Line and the Intercity 225s used on the East Coast Main Line are capable of [...] using flashing green signals to indicate the line ahead was clear for this speed. The line speed was later restored to , and the flashing green system is no longer in use.|$|E
