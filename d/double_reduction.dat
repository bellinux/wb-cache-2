40|$|There {{is a well}} {{established}} connection between one parameter Lie groups of transformations and conservation laws for differential equations. In this thesis, we construct conservation laws via the invariance and multiplier approach based on the wellknown result that the Euler-Lagrange operator annihilates total divergences. This technique will be applied to some plasma physics models. We show that the recently developed notion of the association between Lie point symmetry generators and conservation laws lead to <b>double</b> <b>reductions</b> of the underlying equation and ultimately to exact/invariant solutions for higher-order nonlinear partial di erential equations viz., some classes of Schr odinger and KdV equations...|$|R

40|$|The BLG {{model for}} {{multiple}} M 2 -branes motivates an M 5 -brane theory {{with a novel}} gauge symmetry defined by the Nambu-Poisson structure. This Nambu-Poisson gauge symmetry for an M 5 -brane in large C-field background can be matched, on <b>double</b> dimension <b>reduction,</b> with the Poisson limit of the noncommutative gauge symmetry for a D 4 -brane in B-field background. Naively, one expects that there should exist a certain deformation of the Nambu-Poisson structure to match with the full noncommutative gauge symmetry including higher order terms. However, We prove the no-go theorem {{that there is no}} way to deform the Nambu-Poisson gauge symmetry, even without assuming the existence of a deformation of Nambu-Poisson bracket, to match with the noncommutative gauge symmetry in 4 + 1 dimensions to all order, regardless of how the <b>double</b> dimension <b>reduction</b> is implemented.

500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. <b>Double</b> <b>reduction</b> gearing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with <b>double</b> <b>reduction</b> gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E

500|$|The {{building}} of the first sixteen vessels was all authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933; the last two were authorised under the Vinson-Trammell Act on 27 March 1934 (as part of a batch of 95 destroyers authorised on that date - covering DD-380 to DD-436 and DD-445 to DD-482). Contracts {{for the first six}} Mahans were awarded to three shipbuilders, but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in-house design structure. [...] On the strength of their reputation, the New York firm of Gibbs & Cox was named as the design agent. The firm had no experience in the design of warships, [...] but had successfully designed passenger-cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy. The decision was made to design the Mahan class and future classes around a new generation of machinery, including a cheaper, faster and more efficient propulsion system that combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight, fast-running turbine and <b>double</b> <b>reduction</b> gears.|$|E

500|$|The Navy's General Board {{had been}} wrestling with {{proposed}} design changes, first considering 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer /38 caliber gun, and then proposing to retain all five guns with the twelve torpedo tubes, but configuring those guns only for surface targets, not air targets. The Chief of Naval Operations objected, recommending against [...] "subordinating {{the gun to}} the torpedo", and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the Mahan class and others. In the final design, No. 3 gun {{was moved to the}} aft deckhouse (just ahead of No. 4) {{to make room for the}} third quadruple torpedo tube; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides, releasing the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse. All five 5 in/38s were kept and remained dual purpose guns, able to target aircraft as well as ships, but only No. 1 and No. 2 had gun shields. The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land-based machinery. This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine, which proved simpler and more efficient to operate. <b>Double</b> <b>reduction</b> gearing also reduced the size of the faster-turning turbines and allowed cruising turbines to be added.
