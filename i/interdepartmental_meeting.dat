40|$|Following {{consultations}} with senior officials across federal departments, the PRI's Social Capital Project was formally launched in January 2003 at an <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>meeting</b> of Assistant Deputy Ministers responsible for policy and research. Carried {{out under the}} guidance of the PRI's Executive Director, Jean-Pierre Voyer, the project team at the outset consisted of Jeff Frank, Catherine Demers and Robert Judge. Lori Brooks later joined the team, providing assistance with research activities and event coordination. Sandra Franke, initially on part-time secondment from Statistics Canada, came aboard to work on measurement issues, later joining the PRI full time. Also contributing her expertise on issues of diversity was Jean Lock Kunz. This expertise was applied during the development of the international conference on social capital, immigrant integration and diversity, which was the first investigation of the role of social capital in a particular policy area- Catherine and Jean took the lead on that initiative. Sylvain Côté contributed to this collaborative effort from the OECD. Jeff Frank was project director throughout this phase of activity. When he went on parental leave in Spring 2004, Catherine Demers was project director from April 2004 to March 2005, and oversaw project activities in developing the thematic policy studies. Jeff rejoined the team in the spring of 2005, coordinating the finalization and dissemination of the project products...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{of sociology at}} Kiril and Metodij University in Skopje began {{at the start of}} the 1960 s with the introduction of instruction at all faculties, universities and advanced schools through the subject »Basic Sciences of Society«, and at the Faculties of Law, Economics and Philosophy (group for philosophy) under the title »Sociology«. During the 1973 — 74 academic year, the Faculty Council of the Faculty of Philosophy decided to create a Teaching-Research Study Group for Sociology. After two-year preparations, registration of students iin the first generation of sociologists began Sn the 1975 — 76 academic year. From four years ago when the work of the Study Group for Sociology began, the number of students enrolled has constantly increased (from 82 students in the 1975 — 76 academic year to 316 ful and part time students in 1978 — 79). Thus, among other study groups at the Faculty of Philosophy in Skopje, it has reached first place according to number of students. However, at the same time the success of students is unsatisfactory and the attrition rate is very high. In this report, the curriculum of the Teaching-Study Group for Sociology at the Faculty of Philosophy in Skopje is compared and contrasted with curricula of study groups for sociology at the Faculties of Philosophy in Belgrade and Zagreb. The author arrives at the general conclusion that it is better to organize a single subject course (without specializations) and a uniform profile of graduate sociologists. Furthermore, it is proposed that <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>meetings</b> of students and teachers of existing study groups for sociology in Yugoslavia be convened every second year. The author also considers problems of the basic tendencies in the {{development of}} sociology in the world as well as methodological problems in the crisis of sociology...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} uses conversation {{analysis as}} a theoretical and methodological framework {{to examine the}} organization of in-house business meetings that are conducted in Japanese. In particular, this study focuses on how institutionality becomes apparent within the participants' interactions. The data consists of six videotaped in-house meetings: three departmental staff meetings (bukai) and three <b>interdepartmental</b> <b>meetings</b> (kaigi.) The members' {{distinction between the two}} types of meeting is found to be crucial in this study. Using video-recordings of the business meetings, this study provides {{a detailed description of the}} participants' moment-to-moment interactional practices, even when no verbal interaction is involved. The first objective of this study is twofold: (a) to investigate how participants orient to the boundaries that mark the beginnings and endings of meetings, and (b) to identify what members do (or do not do) during the pre-meeting period. It is common among the meetings in the data for the chairpersons to mark explicitly both a meeting's opening and closing. However, the patterns of premeeting organization differ between the two types of meetings. Meetings in institutional settings tend to have a pre-established turn allocation system. The second objective of the present study is to investigate how precisely a turn-allocation system is operated in Japanese business meetings, and where the institutionality of the interaction emerges in that process. Identifying how reporters acquire their report turns, this study examines turn-allocation patterns specific to the reporting activities at meetings. It is also shown that the patterns of turn-allocation differ between the two types of meetings and that they depend upon the way in which a topic is provided. Through close observation of the participants' interactional practices, including their gaze and bodily movements, this study highlights the interactional patterns that are either common to all the in-house business meetings or particular to a type of meeting in the data. It is hoped that this study will not only yield insights into how meetings are organized in a Japanese business context, but will also promote a multimodal approach (as typified by the use of video-recorded data) to research on business interaction in Japanese...|$|R
40|$|Background: The patient {{transportation}} system within a large hospital {{is a very}} large and complex operation. Although this is an operational issue, there can be a significant impact on public health. In order to ensure patient satisfaction and minimize associated costs, efficiency is key. Public Health Relevance: The impact on public health is significant in two major ways. First, and most importantly, {{the health and well-being of}} the patient should always come first. Waiting for a long period of time can be a major dissatisfier for patients. In addition, delays in transportation not only delay the radiology scan or procedure, but they can also delay other important exams, procedures, or tests. The second major impact on public health is the rising cost of health care. Inefficiency, in any state, drives cost and should be continually improved upon. Methods: A prospective quality improvement initiative was developed to decrease extended patient transport times. Using predefined transportation time goals, outliers were assessed on a monthly basis. Several initiatives were implemented to help reduce the number of transports outside of these goals. Data was analyzed on a monthly basis and discussed at collaborative, <b>interdepartmental</b> work group <b>meetings.</b> Discussion: Approximately two-thirds of patient transports to the radiology department exceeded the goal transport time. These trips were further analyzed. Trips originating from Montefiore Hospital were longer than other trips. There were no specific trends to time of day. Specific, targeted interventions were implemented based on need. Overall, trips within goal have increased over the study period. Conclusion: Data analysis, interdepartmental collaboration, and work process improvement tools can be utilized to decrease the time it takes to transport a patient to the radiology department. Further analysis and continued outlier management will be crucial to continue this trend...|$|R
