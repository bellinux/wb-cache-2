In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. I {{walked out on}} it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E

He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E

So we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> about that balance, because it takes hundreds of hours to render each wolf." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} before the American Enterprise Institute, former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich responded {{directly}} to Obama, who he said [...] "gave us a very courageous speech." [...] Gingrich agreed that [...] "there's an authenticity and legitimacy of anger by many groups in America", and [...] "that anger {{can be a}} source of energy to create a better future, in which case it's a good thing. But if anger is a self-inflicted wound that limits us, it is a very bad and a very dangerous thing. And we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>careful</b> about the role that anger plays in our culture."

500|$|The Hergé Foundation has {{maintained}} {{control of the}} licenses, through Moulinsart, the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> protective of the property.
