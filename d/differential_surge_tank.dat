The numerical model of hydraulic transients is established using the data of a practical hydropower station; and the probable transients are simulated.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to describe the existing <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> solutions and additional improvements, and to simulate the hydraulic behavior of the <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> and how it affects the hydropower plant. The high head hydropower plant Torpa and the low head hydropower plant Åna-Sira are used for the case study, thus the <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> can be simulated under different hydraulic conditions. Turbine pressures and mass oscillations after a complete turbine shutdown, and turbine regulation parameters from operating the hydropower plant, are simulated in the LVTrans software. The result is a <b>Surge</b> <b>Tank</b> Atlas, where the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> solutions are described with conceptual drawings, advantages and disadvantages, and documentation from the simulations. This <b>Surge</b> <b>Tank</b> Atlas provides a useful tool to compare different <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> solutions for both a high head and low head hydropower plant. Some of the conclusions are valid for both hydropower plants and all the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> solutions. Increasing the distance from <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> to turbine, decreasing the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> volume or a strong throttling of the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> will increase the water hammer significantly, {{and to some extent}} reduce the mass oscillations. An optimal throttling of the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> will stabilize the running of the hydropower plant, reduce the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> mass oscillations and hence the necessary height and volume of the <b>surge</b> <b>tank.</b> Other conclusions vary between the open and the closed <b>surge</b> <b>tank,</b> and the high and low head hydropower plant. The closed <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> shows a better dampening of the water hammer than the open <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> for both hydropower plant, the closed <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> can be throttled stronger than the open <b>surge</b> <b>tanks,</b> and the <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> at the low head hydropower plant requires more volume than for the high head plant, even though the hydraulic head is a tenth of the high head hydropower plant.

40|$|This {{work has}} studied the {{hydraulic}} and thermodynamics of closed <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> for hydropower plants. <b>Surge</b> <b>tanks</b> are applied in hydropower plants to control and reduce the acceleration forces of the water during change of turbine flow. <b>Surge</b> <b>tanks</b> reduce the design pressure of the tunnel and pipes that convey water from the reservoir to the turbines, and enable automatic frequency and power control in the hydropower plant. Closed <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> are constructed as underground caverns filled with pressurized air located close to the turbines. The work comprises four different studies.

40|$|<b>Surge</b> <b>tanks</b> are units {{employed}} in chemical processing {{to regulate the}} flow of fluids between reactors. A notable feature of <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> control {{is the need to}} constrain the magnitude of the Maximum Rate of Change (MROC) of the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> outflow, since excessive fluctuations in the rate of change of outflow can adversely affect down-stream processing (through disturbance of sediments, initiation of turbulence, etc.).

40|$|Abstract – {{in nuclear}} power plants using {{pressurized}} water as the main coolant maintaining system pressure within prescribed limits is necessary. The volume of the main coolant expands and contracts with average temperature variations causing insurges and outsurges in the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> volume which is called "pressurizer". The <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> acts {{in a way in}} which coolant pressure is maintained within prescribed limits. The <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> is equipped with a spray and relief system as well as electric heating elements.

40|$|Hydroelectric power plants' open-type <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> may be {{built in}} {{mountains}} subject to the provision of atmospheric air. Hence, a ventilation tunnel is indispensable. The air flow in the ventilation tunnel {{is associated with the}} fluctuation of water-level in the <b>surge</b> <b>tank.</b> There is a great relationship between the wind speed and the safe use and project investment of ventilation tunnels. To obtain the wind speed in a ventilation tunnel for a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> during transient processes, this article adopts the one-dimensional numerical simulation method and establishes a mathematical model of a wind speed by assuming the boundary conditions of air discharge for a <b>surge</b> <b>tank.</b> Thereafter, the simulation of wind speed in a ventilation tunnel, for the case of a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> during transient processes, is successfully realized. Finally, the effective mechanism of water-level fluctuation in a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> and the shape of the ventilation tunnel (including length, sectional area and dip angle) for the wind speed distribution and the change process are discovered. On the basis of comparison between the simulation results of 1 D and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the results indicate that the one-dimensional simulation method as proposed in this article can be used to accurately simulate the wind speed in the ventilation tunnel of a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> during transient processes. The wind speed fluctuations can be superimposed by using the low frequency mass wave (i. e., fundamental wave) and the high frequency elastic wave (i. e., harmonic wave). The water-level fluctuation in a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> and the sectional area of the ventilation tunnel mainly affect the amplitude of fundamental and harmonic waves.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{two different}} {{criteria for the}} stability of <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> in hydropower plants. In 1910, the first stability criterion was derived by Dieter Thoma. This criterion sets a minimum cross-sectional area for a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> to give stable conditions for the power plant. The criterion was put into use, but was found to give inaccurate results, and later modified. In 1970, Hallbjørn Roald Svee derived a second stability criterion, improving on the inaccuracy by including several factors that Thoma had left out. Svee s criterion was written as a reply to bad results in using the Thoma criterion for the stability of a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> in Brazil. However, after its use by Svee himself, the criterion has not been put into widespread use. The derivation of the two criteria are presented side by side, where both criteria have been rewritten to a modern form and non-explained steps from the original sources are derived. To test the criterion, three studies were carried out. A parameter sensitivity analysis, {{a case study of}} Kvinen power plant and a one-dimensional numerical simulation on the same power plant, comparing the Thoma and Svee criteria. For the parameter sensitivity study, most of the results show the Svee criterion giving a smaller <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> area than the Thoma criterion. A smaller <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> is easier and less expensive to construct. The only parameter giving an opposite result is the turbine efficiency. For a system operating on a load higher than the best efficiency point, the Svee criterion gives a larger area. The area of the tunnels in the system is found to be the parameter most influential on the area of a stable <b>surge</b> <b>tank.</b> The case study shows similar results, smaller <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> for Svee except in high load cases. The numerical simulation shows slow dampening of the mass oscillations for a system dimensioned after the Thoma criterion, and unstable oscillations for the Svee criterion. This should imply that the Svee criterion gives a <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> design that is unstable, but the limitations of a numerical simulation suggests a physical model test should be performed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis has been to evaluate the effect of throttling the <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> at Tonstad Hydropower Plant, by the means of one-dimensional numerical modelling in the program LVTrans. The background of the thesis is problems with the amplitude of mass oscillations in the <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> at Tonstad, causing restrictions on operation, due to the fear of drawing the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> water level down to a level where air enters the sand trap and initiates free surface flow. The numerical model of Tonstad hydropower plant, used for simulations, is currently running as a superset regulator at the plant. The calibration and validation shows good representation of steady state operation and period of mass oscillations. The amplitude of mass oscillations, does however show high deviations that are attributed to the inaccurate representation of transient friction in the numerical method. The simulations are interpreted relatively to minimise the error from the numerical model to the prototype, meaning that throttle effect is evaluated {{on the basis of}} improvement of mass oscillation amplitude from the restricted <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> steady state water level. The critical situation for drawdown at this restriction level {{has been found to be}} with an output effect of 660 MW, reservoir levels at 482 m. a. s. l. in Homstøl and Ousdal, 49. 5 m. a. s. l. in Sirdalsvann and with no inflow of water to the creek intakes. An optimization of throttle losses was performed by comparing a simulation of the current situation with simulations with varying throttle losses. The throttles asymmetric geometry was calculated from tabular values. The optimization finds that an asymmetric throttle, with loss ratio 1 : 1. 5 from upwards to downwards flow respectively, may reduce downswing of the water level by 9. 6 meters. A simulation where the restriction level in the <b>surge</b> <b>tanks</b> is reduced by 8 meters, show that the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> water level downswing is further reduced by 5. 3 meters. It is concluded that the optimized throttle allows for a reduction of the restricted water level in the <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> from 470 to 462 m. a. s. l., provided that all reservoir gates are fully open and water level at Ousdal is equal or higher than the water level at Homstøl. Some uncertainties connected with the numerical model are high, but these are outweighed by several conservative assumptions made in the simulations. The annual economic loss due to restricted operation is estimated to 2. 5 million NOK, resulting in an allowed throttle cost of 33. 3 million NOK to ensure profitability. The evaluation of <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> throttling at Tonstad Hydropower Plant exemplifies benefits that may be achieved by detailed <b>surge</b> <b>tank</b> throttle design at other high head hydropower plants...|$|R

The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method has been used to solve the dynamic and continuity equations in the rigid column method, while the characteristics method used to solve these equations in the full elastic method.
