It is held thr fasteners to four lugs which are welded to two <b>horizontal</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the tubular <b>frame.</b> The tubular frame is charged with nitrogen gas under pressure. Development of a crack in the tubular structure results in nitrogen gas leak which can be detect by a telltale indicator. In a few Cheetah helicopters flying at high altitudes, gas leakage at the welded joint of a Lug has been reported. One such joint was examined in detail. Microscopic examination confirmed the presence of a crack on the, tube wall, directly below the lug. Investigation revealed that the tube had cracked by fatigue due to excessive flexural load...|$|R

50|$|In {{the bridge}} {{illustrated}} in the infobox at the top, vertical members are in tension, lower <b>horizontal</b> <b>members</b> in tension, shear, and bending, outer diagonal and top members are in compression, while the inner diagonals are in tension. The central vertical member stabilizes the upper compression member, preventing it from buckling. If the top member is sufficiently stiff then this vertical element may be eliminated. If the lower chord (a <b>horizontal</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> a truss) is sufficiently resistant to bending and shear, the outer vertical elements may be eliminated, but with additional strength added to other members in compensation. The ability to distribute the forces in various ways {{has led to a}} large variety of truss bridge types. Some types may be more advantageous when wood is employed for compression elements while other types may be easier to erect in particular site conditions, or when the balance between labor, machinery and material costs have certain favorable proportions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{this work}} the {{internal}} stress equations for pinned portal frames under {{different kinds of}} loading was formulated using the equilibrium method. Unlike similar equations in structural engineering textbooks these equations considered the effect of deformation due to shearing forces. This effect was captured in a dimensionless constant α, when α is set to zero, the effect of shear deformation is removed and the equations become the same as what can be obtained in any structural engineering textbook. An investigation into the effect of shear deformation on the internal stresses and its variation with the ratios of second moment of areas of the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frame</b> () and the ratio of height to length <b>of</b> the portal <b>frame</b> () showed {{that the effect of}} shear deformation is generally small and can be conveniently neglected in manual calculations except for pinned portal frames under concentrated horizontal forces where the effect was considerable...|$|R

50|$|Wall framing {{in house}} {{construction}} includes the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> exterior walls and interior partitions, both of bearing walls and non-bearing walls. These stick members, {{referred to as}} studs, wall plates and lintels (headers), serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floor platforms, which provide the lateral strength along a wall. The platforms may be the boxed structure of a ceiling and roof, or the ceiling and floor joists of the story above. The technique is variously referred to colloquially in the building trades as stick and frame, stick and platform, or stick and box as the sticks (studs) give the structure its vertical support, and the box-shaped floor sections with joists contained within length-long post and lintels (more commonly called headers), support the weight of whatever is above, including the next wall up and the roof above the top story. The platform also provides the lateral support against wind and holds the stick walls true and square. Any lower platform supports {{the weight of the}} platforms and walls above the level of its component headers and joists.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{increase}} of terrorist blast, {{it is becoming}} more important for buildings to resist the blast load than before. This paper focuses on analysis of loss influence on key <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> structures subjected to blast loading. The performance of a 5 storey frame structure with damage was evaluated {{on the assumption that}} whose key columns and beams had been lost after blast. By comparing the deformation and the internal force <b>of</b> the original <b>frame</b> with the corresponding items of the incomplete one, the impact of the key columns or beams on the performances <b>of</b> the whole <b>frame</b> structure was discussed. Numerical results show that the loss of either the key columns or the key beams will endanger the whole structure. Especially, the deformation and the internal force <b>of</b> the <b>members</b> adjacent to the missing key column have obvious increases. Consequently, the loss of the key column exerts a more serious impact on the building than that of the key beam...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{a double}} layer steel space truss was {{analyzed}} by using Probabilistic Method with ANSYS program and validate by Finite Element Method with manual calculation. This analysis {{is to determine}} the behaviors of the double layer steel space truss. Besides that, it is also to study of the probabilistic response analysis and input sensitivities of the double layer steel space truss. Nowadays space truss is widely used in many types of construction that included stadium, shopping mall, tower, stage, roof structure and also home design. The difference texture of assembly will definitely beautify a building or a place. In this research structure a 4 x 4 x 0. 5 meter for the length, width and height had been used, there have 4 supports {{at the bottom of the}} structure, and resist of a total of 16 point loads on the top of the structure. The circular hollow cross section was used for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>member</b> and diagonal member for the structure. A 275 N/mm 2 of yield strength was choose for the steel space truss. The material and geometry of the space truss was satisfying for this research since it passes all the design criteria in designing for tensile, compression and also buckling. The ANSYS results show very good agreement with manual calculation results. From the results of simulation, we get to know the real behavior of the structure under the applied loads. From probabilistic analysis, we got the results of cumulative distribution function, histogram plot, sensitivity plot and simple history plot by 10000 times of simulation. In the simulation results, 5 inputs were assigned to get the probabilistic maximum deflection, axial stress and axial elastic strain. The 5 inputs are force, outer diameter <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>member,</b> outer diameter <b>of</b> diagonal <b>member,</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>member</b> and thickness <b>of</b> diagonal <b>member.</b> Results from ANSYS program indicated that the maximum deflection is 7. 74 mm, maximum axial stress is 141. 16 MPa, and maximum axial elastic strain is 0. 6722 E- 03...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop new type <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> made <b>of</b> reusable <b>members.</b> The <b>frame</b> consists <b>of</b> three parts: circular CFT (concrete-filled tube) columns, wide flange steel beams and beam-to-column connections that are made of circular tube with wide flange shape brackets. These parts are all prefabricated in the shop. When we reuse the structural <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frame,</b> all <b>members</b> must be taken apart easily. For this reason, beams are connected to beam-to-column connection by high-strength bolts and splicing plates, and columns are just set into the tube of beam-to-column connection. The gap between two tubes (CFT column and beam-to-column connection) is filled by high strength mortar.
