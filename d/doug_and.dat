Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, <b>Doug,</b> <b>and</b> Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University.

At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, <b>Doug,</b> <b>and</b> Gary be reinstated.
