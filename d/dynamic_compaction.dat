40|$|Two fast {{algorithms}} for {{static test}} sequence compaction are proposed for sequential circuits. The algorithms {{are based on}} the observation that test sequences traverse through a small set of states, and some states are frequently re-visited throughout the application of a test set. Subsequences that start and end on the same states may be removed if necessary and su#cient conditions are met for them. The techniques require only two fault simulation passes and are applied to test sequences generated by various test generators, resulting in signi#cant compactions very quickly for circuits that have many revisited states. I Introduction Test sequence compaction produces test sequences of reduced lengths, which can greatly reduce the test application time. Test application time is important because it directly impacts the cost of testing.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We present several {{techniques}} for accelerating <b>dynamic</b> vector <b>compaction</b> for combinational and sequential circuits. A key feature {{of all our}} techniques is that they significantly improve the computation times without adversely affecting the quality of test sets that can be derived using stateof-the-art compaction methods. Our techniques are based on three key ideas: (1) identification of supportsets, (2) target fault switching, and (3) use of dynamic equivalent and untestable fault analysis. All these techniques are useful in significantly {{reducing the number of}} faults that have to be considered by a test generator or a fault simulator in a <b>dynamic</b> vector <b>compaction</b> system. For fault simulation, support sets quickly identify a large subset of faults that are guaranteed to be undetectable by a given input sequence. For test generation, supportsets identify a large subsetof faults that are guaranteed to be undetectable by any extension of a partially specified test sequence. Experimental results on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits and large production VLSI circuits are included. For full scan designs, our accelerationtechniques reducethe overall computation times by a factor of 2 to 3 without adversely affecting the quality (size) of the computed test sets or their fault coverages. The improvement factors obtained are higher for larger circuits. The acceleration techniques enabled the computation of compact test sets for large production circuits that the base test generation system was unable to process in more than 2 CPU days on a Silicon Graphics MIPS 4400 workstation. Results for sequential circuits also show that our acceleration techniques significantly improve the computation times for <b>dynamic</b> vector <b>compaction.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Chiayi County {{is located}} in the largest {{alluvial}} plain of Taiwan with extensive aquaculture and rice farming sustained by water extracted from groundwater wells. Chiayi is a typical aquaculture area affected by land subsidence, yet such lands worldwide combine to provide nearly 90 % of global aquaculture products, greatly reducing oceanic overfishing problems. This study uses precision leveling, multi-layer compaction monitoring well (MLCW) and spaceborne SAR interferometry (InSAR) to examine the cause and effect of land subsidence in Chiayi associated with groundwater extractions and changes. Heights at benchmarks in a leveling network are measured annually and soil compactions at 24 – 26 layers up to 300 -m depths at 7 MLCWs are collected at one-month intervals. Over 2007 – 2011, 15 ALOS/PALSAR images are processed by the method of TCPInSAR to produce subsidence rates. All sensors show that land subsidence occur in most parts of Chiayi, with rates reaching 4. 5 cm/year around its coast, a result of groundwater pumping from shallow to deep aquifers. MLCWs detect mm-accuracy seasonal soil compactions coinciding with groundwater level fluctuations and causing <b>dynamic</b> <b>compactions.</b> Compactions near Taiwan High Speed Rail may reduce the strength of the rail’s supporting columns to degrade its safety. The SAR images yield subsidence rates consistent with those from leveling and compaction wells after corrections for systematic errors by the leveling result. Subsidence in Chiayi’s coastal area leads to relative sea level rises at rates up to 15 times larger than the global eustatic sea level rising rate, a risk typical for world’s aquaculture-rich regions.

Aluminum (Al) alloy scrap was selected to demonstrate the SPS effectiveness in producing fully-dense samples.
