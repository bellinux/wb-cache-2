25|$|This {{subterranean}} {{power station}} uses both pumped-storage and {{the gravity of}} natural stream flow to generate electricity through four reversible <b>Francis</b> <b>turbine</b> generator assemblies. The water is first taken from La Coche Reservoir (Cuvette de la Coche), then passes through the power station, and finally drains into the Aigueblanche Dam on the Isère River.|$|E
25|$|Uriah A. Boyden {{installed}} {{his first}} turbine in the Appleton Mill in 1844, {{which was a}} major efficiency improvement over the old-fashioned waterwheel. The turbine was improved at Lowell again shortly thereafter by Englishman James B. Francis, chief engineer of Proprietors of Locks and Canals. Francis had begun his career with Locks and Canals working under George Washington Whistler, the father of painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and his improved turbine, known as the <b>Francis</b> <b>Turbine,</b> is still used with few changes today.|$|E
25|$|At {{times of}} low {{electrical}} demand, excess generation capacity {{is used to}} pump water into the upper reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit (usually a <b>Francis</b> <b>turbine</b> design). In open-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped-storage {{are referred to as}} conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage by deferring output until needed.|$|E

At the power station, each penstock bifurcates into two penstocks to supply the four <b>Francis</b> <b>turbine</b> pump-generators with water. The pump-generators have a generating capacity of 260 MW and pumping capacity of 235 MW. The generators can each discharge up to [...] of water and the power is converted by transformers to 400 kV. After water is discharged by the generators, it proceeds down one of two tail-race tunnels ( [...] and [...] in length) before being discharged into the lower reservoir. When pumping is required, the pump-generators reverse into pumps and send water back to the upper reservoir through the same water conduits. Each generator can pump up to [...] of water.|$|E

2500|$|Improving {{on earlier}} and less {{efficient}} water turbine designs in one historic mill town, the new <b>Francis</b> <b>turbine</b> {{was created in}} 1848, using scientific principles and testing methods producing a turbine design of 90% efficiency. More importantly, Francis's mathematical and graphical calculation methods advanced turbine design and engineering and allowed confident design of high efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's flow conditions. In the 1870s and deriving from uses in the mining industry, the high efficiency Pelton wheel impulse turbine was developed to use hydropower under very different flow and pressure conditions. [...] Advances in dam design also progressed, with the completion of Old Aswan Dam being considered a milestone of engineering over nature.
