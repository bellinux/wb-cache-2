40|$|Introduction: A {{multitude}} <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> formulations are {{now available}} for HIV-infected adults and children. These formulations include individual and co-formulated drugs, {{many of which are}} also supplied in generic versions. Many <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> have a low aqueous solubility and poor bioavailability. Drug formulation can significantly affect bioavailability, and given the increasing number of new formulations and drug combinations, {{it is important to be}} aware that formulation can influence the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> Areas covered: This review provides an overview of studies assessing the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> different <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> formulations in adults and children, including fixed-dose combinations. For some <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> differences in pharmacokinetics have been described, with largest differences in exposure when a liquid formulation is compared to a tablet or capsule formulation. Biopharmaceutical properties <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> relevant to bioavailability are discussed. Expert opinion: <b>Antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> formulations and their excipients can significantly impact drug exposure. However, this is not yet fully recognized. It is important to realize that children use different formulations than adults. Effort should be made to ensure that adequate drug exposures are achieved to treat HIV-infected children. In addition, manipulation of drug formulations may lead to differences in pharmacokinetics...|$|R

BackgroundAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related kidney disorders concern 30 % {{of those}} patients {{and can lead}} to end-stage renal disease (ESRD; 6 to 10 %). Therefore, the administration <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with nephropathy is not uncommon. MethodsThe influence of ESRD on the different phases of the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs in general is examined in light of bioavailability, distribution, protein binding, metabolism, and elimination. Then, the pharmacokinetics <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in hemodialysis are detailed. ResultsFrom these data, dosing recommendations are given for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs, and protease inhibitors (PIs). ConclusionDosage adjustments are often necessary for patients with renal insufficiency. These adaptations have to be carefully performed to optimize drug exposure and reduce the risk of side effects...|$|R

40|$|Genotyping {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) for <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance is routinely used both in clinical practice, to guide the selection of options for an individual’s antiretroviral therapy, and in epidemiological studies, to estimate levels <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in a patient population. However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV- 1 –infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (genotypicnp 11, 404 tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For <b>example,</b> the prevalence <b>of</b> resistance-associated mutation M 184 V/I was 25. 5 % {{in the most recent}} genotypes and 58. 8 % in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in individual patients and in patient populations.

40|$|In Brazil, {{surveillance}} {{studies on}} <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance among drug-naïve and treatment-experienced patients have {{focused primarily on}} patients living in large urban centers. As the epidemic spreads towards small municipalities and the innermost parts of the country, {{it will be essential}} to monitor the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in these areas. We report the first survey on the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in a small Brazilian municipality. Between July 1999 and March 2005, 72 adult human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) -infected patients received care at the Municipal HIV/AIDS Program of the small, southeastern municipality of Miracema, state of Rio de Janeiro. A genotyping study <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance was performed in 54 patients. Among 27 samples from treatment-experienced patients, 9 (33. 3 %) harbored strains with reduced drug susceptibility. Among these, 6 had reduced susceptibility to reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and 3 to both RT and protease inhibitors. No primary <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drug</b> resistance was recorded among 27 drug-naïve subjects. The relatively low prevalence of resistance mutations in the Miracema cohort argues against the concern that resource-poor settings should not implement widespread accessibility to standard <b>of</b> care <b>antiretroviral</b> combinations due to the possibility of sub-optimal adherence leading to the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains...|$|R

500|$|Due to {{the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>antiretroviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> HIV/AIDS {{has become a}} {{manageable}} disease for people who can access and afford treatment; however, antiretroviral therapy remains largely unaffordable and inaccessible to most people in Malawi.

In addition, donations from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria were used to fund antiretroviral therapy programs that distributed medication on a [...] "first-come, first-served" [...] basis, making the drugs more accessible to the male, urban, educated population.
