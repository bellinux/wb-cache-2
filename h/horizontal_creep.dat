40|$|The {{construction}} of Concrete Block Pavement (CBP) on slopes provides interesting challenges for road engineers. The horizontal (inclined) forces exerted {{on the road}} surface are greatly increased due to traffic accelerating (uphill) and braking (downhill). These forces will cause <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep</b> of the blocks down the slope, resulting in opening of joints {{at the top of}} the road section. The objective of this study was investigate the effect of parameters include degree of slope, laying pattern, joint width, and thickness of paving block on the performance of CBP on slopes. A laboratory-scale test was used to study these parameters based on steel frame horizontal force and push in tests. Three different laying pattern (stretcher bond, herringbone 90 o and herringbone 45 o) and joint width (3 mm, 5 mm and 7 mm) were used in the test program. The pavement responses are characterized in terms of <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep</b> and deflection due to applied load for half of an allowable single axle limit. The results indicate that herringbone 45 o laying pattern and 3 mm joint width performed best on slopes section. The 100 mm paver thickness is found to be more stable than 60 mm thickness from aspect horizontal force resistant. The results also indicate that the increase of the slope increase the <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep,</b> but decrease of the pavement displacement...|$|E
40|$|In {{concrete}} block pavements, the blocks {{make up the}} wearing surface and are a major load-spreading component of the pavement. This research investigate the anchor beam spacing of {{concrete block}} pavement (CBP) on sloping road section based {{on the degree of}} slope, laying pattern, blocks shape, blocks thickness, joint width between blocks and bedding sand thickness. The results of a series of tests conducted in laboratory with horizontal force test and push-in test in several degrees of slopes. The horizontal force testing installation was constructed within the steel frame 2. 00 x 2. 00 metre and forced from the side until CBP failure (maximum <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep).</b> For the applied push-in test in a rigid steel box of 1. 00 x 1. 00 metre square in plan and 0. 20 meter depth, the vertical load was increased from zero to 51 kN on the CBP sample in 0 %, 4 %, 8 % and 12 % degrees of slopes. The herringbone 45 o is the best laying pattern compared to herringbone 90 o and stretcher bond to restraint the horizontal force, which the blocks contribute as a whole to the friction of the pavement, the blocks being successively locked by their rotation following their <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep.</b> The uni-pave block shape has more restraint of <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep</b> than rectangular block shape, because uni-pave block shape has gear (four-dents), while rectangular block shape has no gear (dents). The difference in deflections observed between uni-pave shape and rectangular shape are small. The change in block thickness from 60 to 100 mm significantly reduces the elastic deflection of pavement. The optimum joint width between blocks is 3 mm. For joint widths less than the optimum, the jointing sand was unable to enter between blocks. The relationship between push-in force with block displacement on the varying loose thicknesses of 30, 50, and 70 mm bedding sand, shows that the deflections of pavement increase with increase in loose thickness of bedding sand. The higher the loose bedding sand thickness, the more the deflection will be. The effect of the degree of slope on concrete block pavements on sloping road section area is significant with friction between blocks and thrusting action between adjacent blocks at hinging points is more effective with thicker blocks. Thus, deflections are much less for thicker blocks with increasing degree of the slope. The spacing of anchor beam is increase with decreasing joint width, degree of slope and bedding sand thickness. To compare results between laboratory test with the simulated mechanical behaviour of concrete block pavements, a structural model based on a Three Dimensional Finite Element Model (3 DFEM) for CBP was employed. The concept of HALI development, including design, fabrication, calibration and performance monitoring is presented. Before HALI can be greatly introduced highway research institutions, the equipment was tested with 1 m x 5. 4 m test pavement and subjected to 10, 000 cycles of load repetition.

40|$|International audienceA {{layer of}} a {{saturated}} binary mixture {{of soil and}} water, {{both of which are}} true density preserving, is considered. This layer is subjected from above to normal and shear tractions and an inflow of water, and from below to drainage of water and abrasion of till from the rock bed. Sliding processes along the top and bottom interfaces, as well as deformational creep of the sediment and water constituents within the layer generate heat, but here the purely mechanical problem is analysed. We study the steady-state plane flow with vanishing abrasion and balanced inflow and drainage of water. The differential equations governing the <b>horizontal</b> <b>creep</b> flows of the sediment and water decouple from the equations describing the vertical profiles of the vertical water velocity and the solid volume fraction. A stiffsecond-order ordinary differential equation is shown to describe the distribution of the latter; it genuinely depends on the inflow of water, the fluid viscosity and the thermodynamic pressure, a variable not present in classical formulations and introduced by Svendsen and Hutter in 1995. The singular nature of this equation is resolved by methods of matched asymptotic expansions. It is shown that in conformity with thermodynamics in the sediment layer, two regions of more dense and less dense solid fraction arise, one of which is a boundary layer. This boundary layer is formed where the fluid enters the sediment layer. Moreover, by using the thickness of this boundary layer as the internal length parameter, we find several constitutive equations for the thermodynamic pressure which adequately describe this creeping flow problem. Viewed {{as a model for the}} saturated till layer below ice sheets, the analysis shows that the question of whether soft basal sliding may develop catastrophically is a question of thermodynamics rather than dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Two runways at {{the same}} Australian airport were resurfaced with 50 - 60 mm of asphalt between September 2010 and July 2011. The Marshall-designed 14 mm nominal sized asphalt was typical of airport-quality asphalt in Australia. A premium acid {{modified}} bitumen, locally known as multigrade or M 1000, was used. Approximately six months after construction, <b>horizontal</b> shear <b>creep</b> deformations were observed. The failures were only observed in the braking zone associated with one landing direction. Only {{the second of the}} two resurfaced runways was affected. Around 60 isolated failures presented over two to three years, after which, new failures ceased to appear. During construction, the fine aggregate (dust) source changed from one quarry to another. It followed that one runway received asphalt made with dust from one quarry and the other runway received asphalt made with dust from the other quarry. Both dust sources were olivine basalt with a track record of adequate performance in road asphalt production. Subsequent investigation identified that the second dust contained predominantly Hisingerite clay minerals. Hisingerite is a rarely encountered member of the Smectite-group of clays and possesses physical properties indicative of potentially adverse impacts on asphalt stability and shear stress resistance. The original dust contained Nontronite clay minerals, a more common and less concerning member of the Smectite-group.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In buildings, columns have {{essentially}} the purpose to transmit vertical loads to the foundation. Nevertheless {{it is quite}} impossible to avoid transmission of a moment from slab into columns. The origin of this moment could be asymmetrical loading, unequal span, differential shrinkage between two slabs, <b>creep,</b> <b>horizontal</b> forces like wind or earthquake. Some current codes are taking in account the combination of normal force and moment in the calculation of punching resistance. Those codes are derived from plate theory and based on limited number of tests. Most tests were performed on small scale specimens with thin slabs (thickness h = 0. 07 to 0. 1 m) and using micro concrete (Regan and al, 1979; Moe, 1961). There {{is a lack of}} punching tests of large slabs with an eccentricity.

30|$|In our {{indentation}} experiments, creep {{of approximately}} 0.5 nm {{can also be}} observed. The creep occurs during the 2 -s holding segment of the nanoindentation, {{as shown in the}} inset of Figure 4. Creep is a form of mechanical degradation, and it is best assessed under load-control nanoindentations. The creep mechanism is still unknown, but the elastic deformation {{as a result of the}} diffusion and motion of the atoms or motion of the dislocations seems to play an important role in developing creep during the peak indentation load-holding segment [20]. Generally, for metals, ceramics, and semiconductors, time-dependent deformation occurs at high temperatures, but in our case, by performing indentation testing on a single <b>horizontal</b> ZnO NR, <b>creep</b> occurs even at room temperature. The possible reason can be related to quantum confinement: the surface atoms can move more easily than the bulk where the atoms are fully locked in the lattice [32]. This condition is favorable for the making and motion of dislocations which makes it much easier underneath the indenter, leading to the indentation displacement.|$|R

40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Qualitative and {{quantitative}} {{studies of the}} pattern of invasive plant development is considered a key aspect in understanding invasiveness. An architectural analysis was therefore performed {{in order to understand}} the relationship between shoot architecture and invasiveness in red-osier dogwood, Cornus sericea (Cornaceae). Methods:The structural and ontogenic characteristics of individuals in invading and non-invading populations in the native range of the species were compared to test the implication of developmental plasticity on invasiveness. Key Results and Conclusions: The results show that the shrub has a modular architecture governed by strong developmental rules. Cornus sericea is made up of two levels of organization, each with its own intrinsic sequence of differentiation. These intrinsic mechanisms were used as a framework for comparison and it was found that, in response to the light environment, developmental plasticity was elevated, resulting in two architectural strategies. This developmental plasticity concerns the growth direction and the size of the modules, the speed of their time-course changes, their branching and flowering. Under an open canopy, C. sericea rapidly develops large vertical structures and abundant flowering. This strategy leads the plant to be invasive by excluding competitors and disseminating in the landscape. In the understorey, C. sericea slowly develops long <b>horizontal</b> structures which <b>creep</b> across the soil surface, while assimilating structures are poorly developed. This strategy does not lead to invasiveness but may allow the plant to survive in the understorey and reach sunny patche...|$|R

It can spread quickly to form dense patches, crowding out forage grasses by up to 60 percent. Canada thistle competes with crops, reducing yield by as much as 90 percent. Most grazing animals avoid Canada thistle infested areas due to spiny leaves that can lead to mouth irritations and infections. It also harbors insects and is an alternative host for some disease causing organisms. Control Options: Thurston County’s Integrated Pest Management emphasizes cultural, biological, and manual control methods to keep pests and vegetation problems low enough to prevent damage. The goal of Thurston County’s pesticide use policy is to minimize the use of pesticides by utilizing and providing information about the most effective control options that are available and practical. ► Cultural / Habitat Seedling survival is very poor. Seedlings do not establish in areas with existing groundcover and survive only on disturbed or bare areas in unshaded situations. Replanting with beneficial species is recommended in any area where thistle has been removed or chemically controlled.
