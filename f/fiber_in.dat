They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary <b>fiber</b> <b>in</b> parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.

40|$|Nerve endings in the epidermis, termed nociceptors, conduct {{information}} on noxious stimuli {{to the central}} nervous system. The precise role of epidermal nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> neuropathic pain is however still controversial. Here, we have investigated the re-innervation patterns of epidermal and dermal nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> a rat neuropathic pain model. After applying the spared nerve injury (SNI) model, we determined the mechanical and thermal withdrawal thresholds in the uninjured lateral (sural) and medial (saphenous) areas of the affected hind paw and investigated the innervations patterns of Substance P (SubP), Neurofilament- 200 (NF- 200) and P 2 X 3 -immunoreactive (IR) nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the epidermis and dermis. We found a significant loss in the density of peptidergic (SubP and NF- 200) and non-peptidergic (P 2 X 3) nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the center area of the foot sole at 2 weeks postoperatively (PO). The densities of Sub P-IR <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the epidermis and upper dermis, and the density of P 2 X 3 -IR <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the upper dermis were significantly increased at 10 weeks PO as compared to 2 weeks PO, but were still {{significantly lower than the}} densities in controls. However, the density of NF- 200 -IR <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the center area reached control levels at 10 weeks PO. No changes were found in the densities of any of the <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the medial and lateral parts of the foot sole. The present results suggest that after peripheral nerve injury, specific nerve fibers have different re-innervation patterns in the epidermis and dermis and that they might be involved in the development of neuropathic pain.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a quantitative microscopic method to determine changes in the orientation of collagen <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the dermis resulting from mechanical stress. The method {{is based on the}} use of picrosirius red-stained cryostat sections of piglet skin <b>in</b> which collagen <b>fibers</b> reflect light strongly when epipolarization microscopy is used. Digital images of sections were converted into binary images that were analyzed quantitatively {{on the basis of the}} length of the collagen <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the plane of the section as a measure for the orientation of the fibers. The length of the <b>fibers</b> was expressed <b>in</b> pixels and the mean length of the 10 longest <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the image was taken as the parameter for the orientation of the fibers. To test the procedure in an experimental setting, we used skin after 0 and 30 min of skin stretching. The orientation of the <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> sections of control skin differed sig nificantly from the orientation of <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> sections of skin that was stretched mechanically for 30 min [76 +/- 15 (n= 5) vs 132 +/- 36 (n= 5) ]. The method described here is a relatively simple way to determine (changes in) the orientation of individual collagen <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> connective tissue and can also be applied for analysis of the orientation of any other structural element in tissues so long as a representative binary image can be create...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} and unbiased stereological method {{was applied to}} estimate the white matter volume, the total volume, total length and mean diameter of the myelinated <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the white matter and the total volume of the myelin sheaths in the white matter of rat brain. The white matter volume was obtained with the Cavalieri principle. Four tissue blocks were sampled from the entire white matter in a uniform random fashion. The length density of the myelinated <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the white matter {{was obtained from the}} isotropic, uniform, random sections ensured by the isector. The volume density of the myelinated <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the white matter was estimated by point counting. The total length and the total volume of the myelinated <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the white matter were estimated by multiplying the white matter volume and the length density and the volume density of the myelinated <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the white matter, respectively. The size of nerve fibers was derived by measuring the profile diameter perpendicular to its longest axis. The results were satisfactory {{in the sense that the}} sampling variance introduced by the stereological estimation procedure was a minor fraction of the observed variance. The comparison of the white matter and the myelinated <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> the white matter between rat brain and human brain was also made in the present study...|$|R

25|$|Dried hemp {{has about}} 57% {{cellulose}} (the principal ingredient in paper), compared to about 40-50% in wood. Hemp {{also has the}} advantage of a lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood. This lignin must be removed chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual production of hemp <b>fiber</b> <b>in</b> the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year.

25|$|Fibers {{have many}} uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical <b>fiber.</b> <b>In</b> other cases, fiber {{is used to}} connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a {{measurement}} system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, {{or the fact that}} no electrical power is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be multiplexed along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain reflectometer.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydantoin}} derivative dantrolene is a spasmolytic {{agent with}} a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS. It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle <b>fiber.</b> <b>In</b> normal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel, which causes the tension-generating interaction of actin and myosin. Dantrolene interferes {{with the release of}} calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition. Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to dantrolene than muscle that contracts slowly, although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly, most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process. Major adverse effects of dantrolene include general muscle weakness, sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.|$|E
