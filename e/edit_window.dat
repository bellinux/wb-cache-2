2500|$|In all {{versions}} of Windows, Notepad uses a built-in window class named EDIT and the maximum file size that Notepad can open {{is dependent on}} operating system limitations {{on the size of}} the <b>EDIT</b> <b>window</b> class, with the limit being different for each version of Windows. Due to the operating system limit of the <b>EDIT</b> <b>window</b> class, the Notepad version shipped with Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11 could not open files larger than 54 KB (kilobytes) and Microsoft recommended not to open files larger than 45 KB, with the official workaround advice provided by Microsoft being [...] "Use another text editor", but this limit was extended to 64 KB in Windows 95 (and remained the same in Windows 98 and Windows Me). On the Notepad version shipped with Windows XP the limit was 32 MB (megabytes) with the application displaying the message [...] "The file is too large for Notepad. Use another editor to edit the file" [...] if the user attempted to open a file larger than 32 MB. Newer {{versions of}} Notepad can open files at least up to 58 MB (megabytes) in size, and on Windows 8.1 the Notepad application is able to open files at least as large as 512 MB (megabytes) but fails to open 1 GB (gigabyte) files displaying the same message that Windows XP users would see ("The file is too large for Notepad. Use another editor to edit the file"). [...] However, on all 32-bit versions of Windows, there is a 2 GB (gigabytes) limit imposed on the maximum memory of all single-process 32-bit programs and thus on 32-bit machines no single-process text editor such as Notepad can open files larger than 2 gigabytes.|$|E
50|$|Most of Pro Tools' basic {{functions}} can {{be controlled}} within Edit or Mix windows. The <b>Edit</b> <b>window</b> displays audio and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) tracks, and provides graphical representation of the information recorded or imported. Here, audio can be edited in a non-linear, non-destructive fashion. MIDI information can also be manipulated. The Mix window displays each track's fader channel and allows for the adjustment of a channel's volume and pan, {{as well as being}} the usual place to insert plug-in effects and route audio to and from different outputs and inputs. The release of Pro Tools 8 introduced a MIDI <b>edit</b> <b>window,</b> which enables the user to manipulate MIDI data in either piano-roll or score windows. It also includes MIDI edit lanes so that the user can see note, velocity and other CC data in the same window. These additions took Pro Tools from the long standard 2 <b>edit</b> <b>window</b> approach to having 3 edit windows. Real-time effects processing and virtual instruments in Pro Tools are achieved through the use of plug-ins, which are either processed by the DSP chips as DSP plug-ins, or the host computer as Native plug-ins. Additionally, out-of-time processing is available in the form of AudioSuite plug-ins, which also enables time-domain processing.|$|E

Searches can be case sensitive, and regular expressions can also be used. Double-clicking a search result takes the user directly to that segment in the <b>edit</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the <b>edit</b> <b>window,</b> {{the user}} can jump {{directly}} to the next untranslated segment, or go forward or backwards in history. Users can use undo and redo, copy and paste, and switch between uppercase and lowercase {{in the same way}} as one would in an advanced text editor. The user can choose to see the source text of segments that have already been translated. The edit pane also has inline spell-checking using Hunspell dictionaries, and interactive spell-checking is done using the mouse.|$|E

50|$|The Complexity Profile Graph (CPG) is {{a unique}} statement-level {{complexity}} diagram. Its purpose is to aid in identifying overly complex areas of source code. jGRASP generates CPGs for both Java and Ada. The metric includes common measures, such as reachability and content complexity, which can be displayed individually. The CPG is integrated with the <b>editing</b> <b>window</b> in jGRASP so that highlighting a section of CPG will highlight the corresponding section of source code, and vice versa. They also scroll together, and the current visible portion of the <b>editing</b> <b>window</b> {{is shown in the}} CPG window.|$|R
5000|$|The Control Structure Diagram (CSD) is {{a control}} flow diagram that {{fits into the}} space {{normally}} taken by indentation in source code. Its purpose {{is to improve the}} readability of source code. jGRASP produces CSDs for Java, C, C++, Objective-C, Ada, and VHDL. CSDs in jGRASP are integrated into the source code <b>editing</b> <b>windows,</b> and can be regenerated on demand. They are generated at a speed that makes the process effectively instantaneous (50,000 loc per second or faster on modern hardware). The <b>editing</b> <b>window</b> provides CSD-based folding and a [...] "context hint" [...] feature that displays the first line of a code structure that is off-screen when the mouse is hovered over its CSD structure.|$|R

Clicking the icon opens the <b>edit</b> <b>window.</b> It was invented by a collaborative team of wiki enthusiasts, including Ward Cunningham, Jack Herrick, and many others.|$|E

The <b>Edit</b> <b>window</b> displays audio and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) tracks, and provides graphical representation of the information recorded or imported. Here, audio can be edited in a non-linear, non-destructive fashion. Pro Tools supports 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit float audio at sample rates up to 192 kHz. Pro Tools can handle WAV, AIFF, AIFC, mp3, and SDII audio files. Pro Tools has also most recently incorporated video editing capabilities, so users can import and manipulate high definition video file formats such as XDCAM, MJPG-A, PhotoJPG, DV25, QuickTime, and more. It features time code, tempo maps, elastic audio, automation and surround sound abilities. The Pro Tools mix engine has traditionally employed 48-bit fixed point arithmetic, but floating point is also used in some cases, such as with Pro Tools HD Native. The new HDX hardware uses 64-bit floating point summing.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the implementation of}} gedit, a constraint-based graphics editor for exploring constraint techniques in a graphics system and extending a database system with graphics processing facility. As a graphic operation of the relational database system relix, gedit provides an interactive graphics <b>edit</b> <b>window</b> for the relix user to draw and save graphics as a database relation. A constraint technique is used in gedit {{as a means for}} making precise graphics and constructing new graphics by applying constraints to existing graphics. The abstract graphics description is represented as five kinds of primitive drawings: point, circle, polyline, polygon, and text. A constraint is visualized on the screen as an icon which shows the relationship among the graphics objects constrained. A set of basic commands for graphics and constraints are presented. A constraint satisfaction mechanism for building up simultaneous equations for constraints and solving the system of equations to get the expected result is also provided. The design and implementation of gedit are given in object-oriented programming style...|$|E
