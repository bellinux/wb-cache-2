Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E
5|$|The Free State {{began using}} its new-found {{control of the}} region to levy taxes from the local population, {{gathered}} using similar hostage tactics to the Manyema. The taxes were initially collected {{in the form of}} ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber. The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre. The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market. If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree, tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine, possibly for an entire day. Hence rubber collection was a labour-intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers. Indeed, they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk, high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state, with its steamboat transports, could afford to make the people harvest the low value <b>high</b> <b>bulk</b> rubber. By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base.|$|E

The bulk conductivity was measured using in-situ vertical resistivity probes; the most probable num ber method was used to characterize the spatial distri bution of aerobic heterotrophic and oil-degrading mi crobial populations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if high conductivity observed at aged LNAPL-impacted sites may be related to microbial degradation of LNAPL. The results show <b>higher</b> <b>bulk</b> conductiv ity coincident with LNAPL-impacted zones, in contrast to geoelectrical models that predict lower conductivity in such zones.

The coincidence of a higher percentage of oil-degrading microbial popu lations in zones of <b>higher</b> <b>bulk</b> conductivity suggests that the higher conductivity in these zones may result from increased fluid conductivity related to microbial degra dation of LNAPL, consistent with geochemical studies that suggest that intrinsic biodegradation is occurring at the site.

30|$|The {{reduction}} {{or absence}} of the bristle type trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves and the glumes defines the glabrous phenotype in rice. This trait has been considered as selectively neutral, with neither a known selective advantage nor disadvantage. However, in areas where rice culture remains manual, the glabrous trait is fairly valued since the lack of trichomes reduces skin irritation and itching among workers during harvesting, threshing, drying and milling of rice ([Rutger and Mackill 2001]; Makenzie et al.[1987]). In the U.S., cultivation of glabrous varieties has been an important part of the rice industry. Initially valued for hand harvesting and threshing because they cause less itching, the glabrous varieties became more prized due to their <b>higher</b> <b>bulk</b> density compared with pubescent varieties ([Rutger and Mackill 2001]). The <b>higher</b> <b>bulk</b> density due to the close packing of the glabrous kernels saves valuable space during storage and transportation (Varnamkhasti et al.[2008];[Rutger and Mackill 2001]).
