This study reports the distribution and status of introduced vascular plants in Kipahulu Valley between 610 m and 2020 m (2000 & 6630 ft). Fifty-five exotic weed species and weedy natives were located, including 30 which have not been reported previously in the area. The most serious threat to the Valley ecosystem is the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum). Rose apple (Eugenia jambos), <b>Hilograss</b> (Paspalurn conjugatum), guava (Psidium guajava), and African tulip tree (Spathodea campanulata) also pose a significant threat. Most of the invading exotics are of tropical origin. The main source of potential invading species is the warm lowlands {{at the bottom of the}} Valley, which are rich in exotics. Immediate resource management recommendations are the control of feral pigs (Sus scrofa), the elimination of the strawberry guava, and the establishment of a management buffer zone between the lower and upper Valley.
