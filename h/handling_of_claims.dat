The central idea behind the ALRC’s recommendations {{is the need for}} a single federal statute addressing the application of privilege in all federal investigations. It identified over 40 federal investigatory bodies with coercive information-gathering powers, as well as Royal Commissions. These include: law enforcement agencies, such as the Australian Federal Police; bodies concerned with the collection or administration of public funds—such as the ATO, Medicare and Centrelink; the major corporate regulators, such as ASIC and he ACCC; and a number of smaller, specialised regulators focusing on specific industries, such as the Fisheries Management Authority...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{principles}} {{specified in the}} Swedish Code on health claims and experiences from <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> within the Code, priorities that may be useful when establishing a positive list of generic health claims and for responsible use of claims are suggested. One key factor highlighted is that claims should be relevant and meaningful for the consumer. To be useful in choosing a healthy diet, claims should primarily aim to stimulate an intake in agreement with official nutrition recommendations. Claims may thus be considered as relevant primarily for nutrients of which a considerable {{part of the population}} has an intake deviating from the recommendations. For vitamins and minerals, commonly involved in many functions in the body, {{it would be useful to}} prioritize claims referring to effects considered more important than others. Functions true for all essential nutrients, and/or affected by a large number of dietary factors, would be less relevant to claim for single vitamins and minerals. The relative importance of a specific vitamin or mineral, in relation to other nutrients potentially exerting similar effects, should also be considered. Based on these priorities, and on claims permitted or suggested as examples in the Code, a list of generic claims on vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, carbohydrates, dietary fibre, energy and wholegrain is suggested. Additional issues considered within the Code are also discussed...|$|E

The competitive and fast track nature of the construction industry lends itself to the increased risk of dispute in the development phase of a project life cycle.

The question raised is, are the professionals’ conciliation skills sufficient to address these tasks effectively?The purpose of the paper is to identify the skills required by professionals to effectively apply conciliation in their daily tasks and to determine whether a basic understanding of conciliation would improve the overall application of claims management. MethodologyA literature review was conducted to identify the requirements for effective conciliation practice whereupon a mixed methods approach was used to gather data. A questionnaire based on the literature review was distributed to determine the level of knowledge and skills of the professionals in regard to conciliation. In support of the quantitative data, interviews were conducted with professionals in the industry to gain their opinion regarding the value of conciliation as a claims management tool. ValueA good understanding of the theoretical skills required for effective conciliation may add value to claims management process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Regaining {{good health}} and {{returning}} to work are important for people injured in road traffic crashes and for society. The <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> by insurance companies may {{play an important role}} in the rate at which health recovers and return to work is actually attained. Methods A novel approach towards claims handling for people injured in road traffic accidents was compared to the standard approach. The setting was a large insurance company (NRMA Insurance) in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The new approach involved communicating effectively with injured people, early intervention, screening for adverse prognostic factors and focusing on early return to work and usual activities. Demographic and injury data, health outcomes, return to work and usual activities were collected at baseline and 7 months post-injury. Results Significant differences were found 7 months post-injury on 'caseness' of depression (p = 0. 04), perceived health limitation on activities (p = 0. 03), and self-reported return to usual activities (p = 0. 01) with the intervention group scoring better. Baseline general health was a significant predictor for general health at 7 months (OR 11. 6, 95 % CI 2. 7 - 49. 4) and for return to usual activities (OR 4. 6, 95 % CI 2. 3 - 9. 3). Conclusion We found a few positive effects on health from a new claims handling method by a large insurance company. It may be most effective to target people who report low general health and low expectations for their health recovery when they file their claim. </p...|$|E
40|$|The 2010 and 2011 {{earthquakes}} in {{the region}} of Canterbury, New Zealand caused widespread damage and the deaths of 185 people. Suburbs on the eastern side of Christchurch and in the satellite town of Kaiapoi, 20 kilometres north of Christchurch, were badly damaged by liquefaction. The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA), a government organisation set up {{in the wake of the}} earthquakes, began to systematically zone all residential land in 2011. Based on the possibility for land remediation, 7860 houses in Christchurch and Kaiapoi were zoned red. Those who were in this zone were compensated and had to buy or build elsewhere. The other zone examined within this research – that of TC 3 – lies within the green zone. Residents, in this zone, were able to stay in their houses but land was moderately damaged and required site-specific geotechnical investigations. This research sought to understand how residents’ senses of home were impacted by a disaster and the response efforts. Focusing on the TC 3 and red zone of the eastern suburbs and the satellite town of Kaiapoi, this study interviewed 29 residents within these zones. The concept of home was explored with the respondents at three scales: home as a household; home as a community; and home as a city. There was a large amount of resistance to the zoning process and the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> by insurance companies and the Earthquake Commission (EQC) after the earthquakes. Lack of transparency and communication, as well as extremely slow timelines were all documented as failings of these agencies. This research seeks to understand how participant’s sense of home changed on an individual level and how it was impacted by outside agencies. Homemaking techniques were also focused on showing that a changed sense of home will impact on how a person interacts with a space...|$|E
