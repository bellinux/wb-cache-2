5|$|Meanwhile, the {{different}} factions in Masyumi were in conflict over the path {{the party was}} taking; the NU members thought Masyumi was becoming too political, abandoning its Islamic roots. When the Natsir Cabinet began to collapse, the Masyumi put forth Fakih as a potential Minister for Religious Affairs. This act was controversial because {{four of the five}} allocated slots for the party were already filled by non-NU members, and ultimately the NU pulled out of Masyumi, effective 5April 1952. Fakih <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>chosen</b> with a majority of five votes, while the next leading candidate, Usman Raliby, received four.|$|E

5|$|The Parliamentary Army garrisoned {{the town}} upon the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 and established their headquarters there in June 1647 on a line from Staines to Watford, although the king passed through Uxbridge in April 1646, resting at the Red Lion public house for several hours. Charles I met with representatives of Parliament at the Crown Inn in Uxbridge in 1645, but negotiations for the end of hostilities were unsuccessful {{due in part to the}} king's stubborn attitude. The town <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>chosen</b> as it was located between the Royal headquarters at Oxford and the Parliamentary stronghold of London.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} {{of support from the}} Royal Navy, the New England {{expedition}} set out in March 1745 for Louisbourg.

5|$|Following the {{appointment}} of General Bernard Montgomery to the command of the 21st Army Group and overall command of all ground forces to land in Normandy, the plan underwent a number of further revisions. On 21 January 1944, a revised Overlord plan was presented to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>chosen</b> as the Supreme Allied Commander for the invasion. Montgomery's revised plan widened the landing area to include all of the coastline between the River Orne and the eastern coast of the Cotentin Peninsula; five divisions would land on the beaches, and supported by three airborne divisions to land {{on either side of}} the landing areas to secure their flanks and protect the landing troops from counterattack. The British airborne forces were assigned to the eastern flank, and the American airborne forces the west.|$|E

5|$|For {{purposes}} of geophysical and oceanographic research {{and to determine}} habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the Polaris program – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>chosen</b> for the mission.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Watson {{began her}} {{modeling}} career {{with a photo}} shoot for Teen Vogue and was the youngest star to grace its cover. Three years later, the British press reported that Watson was to replace Keira Knightley as {{the face of the}} fashion house Chanel, but this was denied by both parties. In June 2009, following several months of rumours, Watson confirmed that she would be partnering with Burberry as the face of their Autumn/Winter 2009 campaign, for which she received an estimated six-figure fee. She also appeared in Burberry's 2010 Spring/Summer campaign alongside her brother Alex, musicians George Craig and Matt Gilmour, and model Max Hurd. In February 2011, Watson was awarded the Style Icon award from British Elle by Dame Vivienne Westwood. Watson continued her involvement in fashion advertising when she announced she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>chosen</b> as the face of Lancôme in March 2011.|$|E
5|$|King Manuel I {{authorized}} a {{trade mission}} in 1517 when Andrade set sail with 7 cannon-armed merchant vessels with a Muslim interpreter on June 17, 1517.

Florentine merchant Giovanni da Empoli, who had written a report about trade with China while stationed in India, was also chosen for the mission as the chief commercial agent between the Portuguese and Chinese. However, Giovanni would die in China during the early mission on October 15, 1517 when the ship he was on accidentally caught on fire. Tomé Pires, a royal apothecary who had also traveled to India and written a landmark work in 1515 on Asian trade, was chosen as the chief ambassador for the mission.|$|E
