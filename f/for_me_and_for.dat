500|$|After Neil Young {{played a}} few concerts with Pearl Jam and {{recorded}} the album Mirror Ball with them, {{some members of}} the media gave him the title [...] "Godfather of Grunge". This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps—but also his dress and persona. A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "Neurotica was a life changer <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> {{a lot of people in}} the Seattle music community." ...|$|E
500|$|Peggy {{was written}} out of EastEnders in 2003, sent {{to live in}} Rio de Janeiro with her son Grant for two years, while Windsor took a sabbatical from the show after being {{diagnosed}} with the Epstein-Barr virus. Windsor had previously never taken {{more than two weeks}} leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor's absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: [...] "This has been a very hard decision for me to make because I'm so happy here on EastEnders but it's been a long time without a proper break. I just feel some time off would be good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the character too." [...] Louise Berridge, then EastEnders executive producer, commented: [...] "Barbara has been an absolute trouper for more than eight years on this show. We hope she has a great time and look forward to bringing her back with a big story in 2004." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{speculation}} of rifts between Dempsey and Pompeo, {{and even}} show runner Rhimes, the former maintained his stance of leaving in a [...] "very good" [...] place with his co-star of ten years. On his relationships with Pompeo in particular, he said [...] "it’s beautiful. We’re like a married couple. It’s 10 years, {{and it was}} magic from the beginning. Chemistry right away.” He thanked his fans on Twitter and wrote, [...] "I {{want to thank all}} the fans, what an incredible 11 yrs, I love you all." [...] Rhimes asserted on the importance of Dempsey's character in the statement she released at his departure: “Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character—for Meredith, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the fans. I absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ‘McDreamy.’ As Ellis Grey would say: the carousel never stops turning.” Pompeo too took to Twitter to react to the death of Shepherd and wrote, [...] "I am honored and excited {{to tell the story of}} how Meredith goes on in the face of what feels like the impossible. I hope you will all join me on her journey.” It was the first time she spoke out publicly about Dempsey's publicised exit.|$|E

500|$|The {{pre-season}} {{began on}} 3 July with medical exams {{during the morning}} and an afternoon visit to Nyon, where Benfica were camped during their pre-season tour of Switzerland. Santos implemented a new tactical formation based on the 4–4–2 diamond. Benfica played their first game against Swiss second-tier side Stade Nyonnais, beating them by a comfortable margin. They followed this with a win against Shakhtar Donetsk in Yverdon-les-Bains, and a loss against FC Sion at the Stade Tourbillon on 15 July. Benfica returned to Portugal on 16 July; they played a presentation match against Bordeaux on 22 July. They then competed in the 2006 Guadiana Trophy alongside their arch-rivals Sporting CP and Deportivo La Coruña, losing both matches. On 28 July, Benfica {{took part in the}} draw for the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League; they were paired with Austria Wien. Santos dismissed accusations of favouritism with the Austrians, saying, [...] "It is a question of honour to be present in the Champions League, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> Benfica." [...] Benfica's next preparation match was at AEK Athens on 1 August, where they lost {{for the third time in}} a row. The result caused concern to Santos because Benfica [...] "showed a lot of tactical problems, both offensively and defensively." [...] Benfica played their final preparation match on 15 August, where they defeated Estrela da Amadora 2–1.|$|E

He {{was a good friend}} {{and one of the most}} supportive people I know. He was always ready to lend a helping and guiding hand, whatever the situation may be."

It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours. I mean African-Americans and white Americans and Asians, Spanish-speaking — she belonged to us and that's a great thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hōnen {{was born}} to a {{prominent}} family {{in the city of}} Kume in Mimasaka Province. His father was Uruma no Tokikuni, a province official who headed up policing in the area. His mother was of the Hada clan, whose ancestry could {{be traced back to the}} silk merchants of China. Hōnen was originally named Seishimaru after the bodhisattva Seishi (Sanskrit Mahāsthāmaprāpta). In 1141 Hōnen's father was assassinated by Sada-akira, an official sent by Emperor Horikawa to govern the province.

"Having labored now twenty years, {{the best}} ones of my life, in {{dispensing}} at retail, as the saying goes, at the demand of everyone, that little talent in my profession that God and my own efforts have given me, my desires would truly be to obtain enough leisure and quiet as would enable me before I die to complete three great works that I have in hand {{in order to be}} able to publish them, perhaps with some praise <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> whoever has helped me in the business. ... It is not possible to receive a salary from a Republic, however splendid and generous, without serving the public, because to get something from the public one must satisfy it and not just one particular person; and while I remain able to teach and to serve, no one can exempt me from the burden while leaving me the income; and in sum I cannot hope for such a benefit from anyone but an absolute prince." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Portugal, {{children}} go {{from house to}} house in All Saints day and All Souls Day, carrying pumpkin carved lanterns called coca, asking every one they see for Pão-por-Deus singing rhymes where they remind people why they are begging, saying [...] "...It is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> you, and to give to the deceased who are dead and buried" [...] or [...] "It is to share with your deceased [...] " [...] If a door is not open or the children don't get anything, they end their singing saying [...] "In this house smells like lard, here must live someone deceased". In the Azores the bread given to the children takes the shape of the top of a skull. The tradition of pão-por-Deus was already recorded in the 15th century. After this ritual begging, takes place the Magusto and big bonfires are lit with the [...] "firewood of the souls". The young people play around smothering their faces with the ashes. The ritual begging for the deceased used to take place all over the year as in several regions the dead, those who were dear, were expected to arrive and take part in the major celebrations like Christmas and a plate with food or {{a seat at the table}} was always left for them.|$|E
