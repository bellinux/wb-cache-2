5|$|In {{many forms}} of poetry, stanzas are <b>interlocking,</b> so that the rhyming scheme or other {{structural}} elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such <b>interlocking</b> stanzas include, for example, the ghazal and the villanelle, where a refrain (or, {{in the case of}} the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of <b>interlocking</b> stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the strophe, antistrophe and epode of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{progress}} of the first court-ordered trial of alcohol ignition <b>interlocks</b> in Queensland.

Characteristics of the <b>Interlock</b> Program A trial of alcohol ignition <b>interlocks</b> is currently being implemented in Queensland, with the aim being to determine whether the device in combination with a drink driving rehabilitation program is more effective than the rehabilitation program alone in reducing drink driving recidivism. This approach is based on recent research that is demonstrating <b>interlocks</b> in combination with rehabilitation programs and intensive supervision increases the possibility of long-term behavioural change (Marques, Voas et al., 2000).

50|$|A typical trapped-key <b>interlock</b> device {{consists}} of a lock cylinder which operates a sliding bolt through a cam. The assembly is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of <b>interlock</b> bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an <b>interlock.</b> A significant feature of the <b>interlock</b> is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the <b>interlocked</b> device has been made safe; the <b>interlocked</b> device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of process and outcome evaluations of California’s ignition <b>interlock</b> programs. The process evaluation shows that California’s judicial <b>interlock</b> program has been poorly implemented by the courts, and that relatively few offenders opt to install an <b>interlock</b> to reduce their suspension {{as a part of the}} state’s administrative program. The outcome evaluation demonstrates that <b>interlocks</b> are effective in reducing DUI recidivism when installed, although they are associated with increased crash rates. In contrast, judicial orders to install an <b>interlock</b> have mixed results, working best with repeat DUI offenders. The paper concludes with a discussion of how <b>interlocks</b> are best used within the context of other, proven-effective DUI countermeasures...|$|R

30|$|Focusing on tie {{content as}} a driver of network formation, we add a {{relational}} dimension to the typically purely structural analysis of board <b>interlocks.</b> Following Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), we propose that not only the configuration of a focal firm’s network—as reflected by partner choice—counts. Rather, firms strategize on the quality or content of ties they create leading to specific tie choices. In this connection, our paper highlights that the directionality of an <b>interlock</b> significantly influences tie content. Creating a directed (sent or received) as compared to an undirected <b>interlock</b> makes a crucial difference for the benefits that can be realized by the focal firm and thus for tie choice. For early research treating <b>interlocks</b> primarily as instruments for corporate control, the direction of an <b>interlock</b> was a logical result {{of the issue of}} who controls whom. Undirected <b>interlocks</b> were seen merely as a byproduct of outside directors’ multiple engagements (Mintz and Schwartz 1985). Since <b>interlocks</b> have become an instrument used for a larger variety of purposes such as inter-organizational coordination and communication, companies can be supposed to consider carefully whether to create a directed <b>interlock</b> and reap strong tie benefits or instead rely on an undirected <b>interlock</b> that brings about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} weak ties.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on three {{empirical}} studies of the director <b>interlock</b> network among Swedish firms listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, focusing on its consequences for firm behavior and its association with ownership structures. Director <b>interlocks</b> are created when directors serve on, and hence <b>interlock,</b> several boards. Director <b>interlocks</b> aggregate to a social network that not only connects most firms into a single component, but are, more essentially, also shown to affect firm behavior. The introductory chapter contains {{a review of the}} director <b>interlock</b> research as well as some suggestions for future research directions. Study I is an examination of the importance of director <b>interlock</b> relations for stock repurchases. Using parametric survival analysis, it is demonstrated that the decision to repurchase stocks is dependent on both the firms’ economic settings and their director <b>interlocks.</b> Study II examines the network impact on recruitment of new board members in the network of firms, directors, and owners. Using simulations, it is shown that directors with personal contact with a director and/or owner of the recruiting firm have a substantially increased probability of being recruited to the focal board. Study III examines the association between ownership and director <b>interlocks.</b> Re-analyses of the same network examined in Study II show that multiple director assignments are highly dependent on ownership <b>interlocks.</b> The three studies exemplify the real-world consequences of board <b>interlocks</b> and field a new understanding of the mechanisms behind their formation. Furthermore, the association between the director and ownership <b>interlocks</b> suggests that the ownership network (co-) produces some of the phenomena that have been attributed to the director network. These results underscore the need for further examination of director <b>interlocks</b> to bring the owners back into the analysis.
