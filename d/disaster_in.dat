5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of <b>disaster</b> <b>in</b> the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department.

Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead {{to determine the extent of}} damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the <b>disaster.</b> <b>In</b> response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth of food and medicine. After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries sent additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.|$|E

Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency.

The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.|$|E
