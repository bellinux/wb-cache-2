[...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their <b>individual</b> <b>method</b> of expression.

5000|$|The {{following}} pages {{are taken from}} Book 4, Chapter 1 of the “Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts” published in 1795. It is possible to identify similar method titles and illustrations between this material {{and that of the}} Muye Jebo and General Qi's Boxing Canon. However, there are also a number of methods which do not bear the same name and may be methods introduced by the Korean administration of the time. In similar fashion one cannot be sure that a method bearing the same title as that designated by General Qi was executed in the same fashion or was even the same method. This manual retained use of the same images, making it reasonable {{that at least some of}} the methods were identified and functioned in the original manner identified by General Qi. However, once again, the Korean listing provides only the title and does not characterize the nature of the method. Since this list includes the total number of methods mentioned in the Muyedobotongji, each <b>individual</b> <b>method</b> is noted in bold representing 32 unique methods with repetition not found in General Qi's catalog. In addition the methods have been rearranged, to include a number of engagements between two individuals. In deference to the Neo-Confucian beliefs of the Korean nation at the time, these encounters between two individuals were intended to produce a kind of stalemate rather than the victory of one individual over another.

Normally, group meetings are required, which may be a problem for busy medical educators. Here, we compared a modified Angoff <b>individual</b> <b>method</b> to the conventional group method. Methods: Six clinical instructors were divided into two groups matched by teaching experience: modified Angoff <b>individual</b> <b>method</b> (three persons) and conventional group method (three persons). The passing scores were set by using the Angoff theory. The groups set the scores individually and then met to determine the passing score. In the modified Angoff <b>individual</b> <b>method,</b> passing scores were judged by each instructor and the final passing score was adjusted by the concordance method and reliability index. Results: There were 94 fourth-year medical students who took the test. The mean (standard deviation) test score was 65. 35 (8. 38), with a median of 64 (range 46 – 82). The three individual instructors took 45, 60, and 60 minutes to finish the task, while the group spent 90 minutes in discussion. The final passing score in the modified Angoff <b>individual</b> <b>method</b> was 52. 18 (56. 75 minus 4. 57) or 52 versus 51 from the standard group method. There was not much difference in numbers of failed students by either method (four versus three).
