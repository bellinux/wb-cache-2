40|$|We utilize a new micro {{data set}} of prices of <b>funeral</b> goods and {{services}} at individual <b>funeral</b> homes, plus data from the Economic Census, {{to examine the effects}} of state regulations that restrict entry into the <b>funeral</b> goods market. In particular, some states have regulations that allow only licensed <b>funeral</b> homes to sell caskets, while others allow unlicensed retailers, such as Costco, to sell them. However, as caskets and <b>funeral</b> services are complements, generally purchased in one-to-one proportions, it is not a priori clear that casket sales restrictions can expand the rent extraction capabilities of licensed <b>funeral</b> homes. Our results suggest that when courts lift <b>funeral</b> goods sales restrictions, the prices of <b>funeral</b> goods fall but the prices of <b>funeral</b> services rise by nearly as much. Overall, our results support the one-monopoly-rent hypothesis; we do not find that, overall, <b>funeral</b> home revenues decline when restrictions on <b>funeral</b> goods sales are lifted.

5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange <b>funerals,</b> {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC <b>funerals</b> were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting room to be used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E

5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare {{structure}} untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional <b>funerals</b> conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending <b>funerals</b> to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E
