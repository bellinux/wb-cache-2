5|$|Iori is {{a violent}} and sadistic person {{who suffers from}} trauma because of his clan's past. In ancient times, the Yagami clan {{was known as the}} Yasakani. With the help of the Yata and Kusanagi clans, they sealed the demon Orochi. As time passed, the Yasakani, tired of living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> of the Kusanagi, made a blood pact with Orochi. This gave them greater powers, but in return, they and their {{descendants}} were forever cursed. They renamed their clan the Yagami and set out to destroy the Kusanagi with their new powers. In response, the Kusanagi declared war on the Yagami, which led to many clan members on both sides being killed.|$|E

He also starred with Cushing in Hammer's Cash on Demand, playing the same role he had played opposite Richard Vernon in the original TV play, The Gold Inside. He turned down the opportunity of reprising the title role in Hammer's feature film adaptation of Quatermass and the Pit (1967). He {{did not wish to}} repeat himself.|$|E

5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E
