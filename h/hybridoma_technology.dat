As in this system antibody genes are cloned simultaneously with selection they can be easily further engineered for example by increasing their affinity (to levels unobtainable in the immune system), modulating their specificity or their effector function (by recloning into a full-length immunoglobulin scaffold).

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the most}} common form of primary liver cancer, yet no effective therapeutics exist. This review provides an overview of the recent development of recombinant immunotoxins for the treatment of glypican- 3 (GPC 3) expressing HCC. GPC 3 is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is overexpressed in HCC, but is absent from normal adult human tissues. Treatment of HCC with anti-GPC 3 immunotoxins represents a new therapeutic option. Using phage display and <b>hybridoma</b> <b>technologies,</b> three high affinity antibodies (HN 3, HS 20 and YP 7) have been generated against GPC 3. Two of these antibodies (HN 3 and HS 20) have demonstrated the ability to inhibit Wnt/Yap signaling, leading to a reduction in liver cancer cell proliferation. By combining the HN 3 antibody capable of inhibiting Wnt/Yap signaling with the protein synthesis inhibitory domain of the Pseudomonas exotoxin, a recombinant immunotoxin that exhibits a dual inhibitory mechanism was generated. This immunotoxin was found to be highly effective in the treatment of human HCCs in mouse xenograft models.

40|$|In this study, single chains (scFvs) against key {{proteins}} of the Tomato leaf curl virus-India {{were generated}} using phage display and/or <b>hybridoma</b> <b>technologies.</b> Purified AV 1 (coat protein) and AC 1 (replicase enhancer) viral proteins {{were used for}} mice immunization and screening of phage display libraries and hybridoma clones. The binding properties of the isolated scFvs were determined by western blot, ELISA and BIACORE. The missing nucleotide found in the hybridoma derived scFv-SAV against AV 1 was restored and the resulting scFv (scFv-RW-AV) showed better binding properties than scFv-SAV. Four scFvs against AV 1 were derived from the naïve Tomlinson I library. Two of these scFvs carried a stop codon. The stop codon was mutated in vitro to either code for glutamine (Q) or glutamic acid (E). The Q-mutated scFvs showed higher expression level but less binding activity than the E-mutated scFvs. Additionally, two scFvs against AC 1 were selected. All scFvs were cloned and expressed in tobacco leaves as N-terminal fusion with the GFP for cytosolic expression in tobacco leaves. Additionally, two scFv-GFP fusions were targeted to the nucleus by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) introduced at the N-terminus of the scFvs. Both scFv-GFP fusion proteins were exclusively localized in the nucleus. The AV 1 proteinwas also expressed in tobacco leaves as N-terminal fusion with DsRed. The AV 1 -DsRed fusion was completely localized in the nucleus. The binding activity of the AV 1 -specific scFvs was tested by the co-expression of the scFv- GFP fusion and AV 1 -DsRed. Only the hybridoma derived scFv showed clear binding and the protein complex was targeted to the nucleus by the AV 1 NLS. The data presented in this study demonstrate the successful expression of specific and functional scFvs against the viral proteins in the reducing environment of the plant cytosol.

40|$|AbstractMonoclonal {{antibodies}} {{are valuable}} laboratory reagents and {{are increasingly being}} exploited as therapeutics to treat a range of diseases. Selecting new monoclonal antibodies that are validated to work in particular applications, despite the availability of several different techniques, can be resource intensive with uncertain outcomes. To address this, we have developed an approach that enables early screening of hybridoma supernatants generated from an animal immunised with up to five different antigens followed by cloning of the antibody into a single expression plasmid. While this approach relieved the cellular cloning bottleneck and had the desirable ability to screen antibody function prior to cloning, the small volume of hybridoma supernatant available for screening limited the number of antigens for pooled immunisation. Here, we report {{the development of an}} antigen microarray that significantly reduces the volume of supernatant required for functional screening. This approach permits {{a significant increase in the}} number of antigens for parallel monoclonal antibody selection from a single animal. Finally, we show the successful use of a convenient small-scale transfection method to rapidly identify plasmids that encode functional cloned antibodies, addressing another bottleneck in this approach. In summary, we show that a hybrid approach of combining established <b>hybridoma</b> antibody <b>technology</b> with refined screening and antibody cloning methods can be used to select monoclonal antibodies of desired functional properties against many different antigens from a single immunised host...|$|R
40|$|Current {{strategies}} {{for the production of}} therapeutic mAbs include the use of mammalian cell systems to recombinantly produce Abs derived from mice bearing human Ig transgenes, humanization of rodent Abs, or phage libraries. Generation of hybridomas secreting human mAbs has been previously reported; however, this approach has not been fully exploited for immunotherapy development. We previously reported the use of transient regulation of cellular DNA mismatch repair processes to enhance traits (e. g., affinity and titers) of mAb-producing cell lines, including hybridomas. We reasoned that this process, named morphogenics, could be used to improve suboptimal hybridoma cells generated by means of ex vivo immunization and immortalization of antigenspecific human B cells for therapeutic Ab development. Here we present a platform process that combines <b>hybridoma</b> and morphogenics <b>technologies</b> for the generation of fully human mAbs specific for disease-associated human antigens. We were able to generate hybridoma lines secreting mAbs with high binding specificity and biological activity. One mAb with strong neutralizing activity against human granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor was identified that is now considered for preclinical development for autoimmune disease indications. Moreover, these hybridoma cells have proven suitable for genetic optimization using the morphogenics process and have shown potential for large-scale manufacturing.

40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an organ-specific autoimmune disease, harbor autoantibodies that attack the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR-Abs) at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles, resulting in muscle weakness. Single cell manipulation technologies coupled with genetic engineering are very powerful tools to examine T cell and B cell repertoires and the dynamics of adaptive immunity. These tools have been utilized to develop mAbs in parallel with <b>hybridomas,</b> phage display <b>technologies</b> and B-cell immortalization. By applying a single cell technology and novel high-throughput cell-based binding assays, we identified peripheral B cells that produce pathogenic nAChR-Abs in patients with MG. Although anti-nAChR antibodies produced by individual peripheral B cells generally exhibited low binding affinity for the α-subunit of the nAChR and great sequence diversity, {{a small fraction of}} these antibodies bound with high affinity to native-structured nAChRs on cell surfaces. B 12 L, one such Ab isolated here, competed with a rat Ab (mAb 35) for binding to the human nAChR and thus considered to recognize the main immunogenic region (MIR). By evaluating the Ab in in vitro cell-based assays and an in vivo rat passive transfer model, B 12 L was found to act as a pathogenic Ab in rodents and presumably in humans. These findings suggest that B cells in peripheral blood may impact MG pathogenicity. Our methodology can be applied not only to validate pathogenic Abs as molecular target of MG treatment, but also to discover and analyze Ab production systems in other human diseases...|$|R

40|$|Background: The use of {{a natural}} sweet protein is {{important}} as an attractive alternative to sucrose in the human diet. Rigorous research has identified {{the use of the}} artificial sweetener that leads to various diseases, cancer and heart disease. Many functional studies are necessary for examining the structure and biological activity of natural sweeteners such as Brazzein and its receptor targeting. In this report, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies against the recombinant brazzein which can be used for functional studies. Methods: <b>Hybridomas</b> cell fusion <b>technology</b> was used for the production of monoclonal antibody. BALB/c mice were immunized twice with purified fusion proteins with Freund adjuvant. Next, 14 days after the last injection, blood sample was collected from the eye and serum was separated and the antibody titer was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mouse with the highest antibody titers was selected. Seven days before fusion, the selected mouse was boosted with 50 µg antigen into the peritoneum to develop a robust immune response and then spleen cells were isolated from the same animal for fusion to myeloma SP 2 / 0 to generate hybridoma cells. Results: Hybridoma clones were screened by ELISA and their monoclonal antibodies were purified. Specificity and reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies were determined by western blot analysis. We produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies that were highly specific and reacted with Brazzein protein that was detected by western blot analysis.

40|$|The {{interest}} in diagnostic biochips is growing. However, most biochips {{are designed for}} ex vivo applications. Beyond, an elevated serum human cystatin C (hCC) concentration correlates with various diseases. Thus, hCC was suggested as biomarker. To {{meet the requirements of}} an implantable biochip system it is essential to develop an hCC-specific bioassay enabling repetitive measurements. Within this PhD thesis an hCC-specific bioassay was developed which is based on the concentration-dependant replacement between hCC and an hCC-fusion protein on an hCCspecific antibody layer thus enabling the repetitive determination of the hCC concentration. Therefore hCC, hCC-fusion proteins and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were successfully cloned, produced and purified. The fusion protein stGST-hCC was further used for the immunization of mice. Thereby an hCCspecific immune response could be induced. With the use of the <b>hybridoma</b> generation <b>technology</b> monoclonal <b>hybridoma</b> cell lines were established, which enabled the selection and production of hCC-specific mAbs. The selection of monoclonal hybridoma cell lines which produced hCC-specific antibodies was successful due to analysis by indirect ELISA, sandwich ELISA and surface plasmon spectroscopy (SPR) -spectroscopy. Selected hybridoma cell lines were used for small scale production of hCC-specific mAbs which without purification were analysed for their hCC association and dissociation characteristics by SPR spectroscopy. From 12 initially potential antibodies, 5 were identified to display specific yet distinct association and dissociation characteristics towards hCC. For the replacement assay the dissociation characteristics were of special interest, thus they were used to rank the antibodies. Whereas mAb CyDI- 1 showed no and CyDI- 12 showed barely any dissociation, it was clearly seen for mAb CyDI- 2, CyDI- 4 and to the highest degree for mAb CyDI- 3. The five corresponding hybridoma cell lines were used for the large scale production of mAbs, all producing mAbs of the IgG 1 :κ isotype. All mAbs were purified by Protein G-affinity chromatography, yielding pure protein. Due to their accessibility mAb CyDI- 1, CyDI- 2 and CyDI- 4 were further analysed by SPR spectroscopy. This time hCC-fusion proteins were used beside hCC for the identification of suitable hCC and hCC-fusion protein combinations for the replacement assay. The mAb CyDI- 4 was identified as the antibody with the highest potential for enabling replacement. Except for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) -hCC, all fusion proteins and hCC showed exactly identical association and dissociation behaviour towards hCC. The combination of hCC and stGST-hCC was identified to be best by SPR spectroscopy, especially in respect to the end application. However, the evaluation of the hCC-specific bioassay in the predicted chip-based detection system was not possible until the end of this study. In parallel to the chip evolution, a fluorescence-based replacement assay was established for the evaluation of the replacement ability on mAb CyDI- 4. Thus, the discrimination between hCC and the hCC-fusion protein was possible without the modification of antigens and the use of secondary antibodies, respectively, which was essential as the former may alter the affinity and the latter is not involved in the final bioassay. Using the mAb CyDI- 4 and the antigen combination composed of hCC and GFP-hCC a fluorescence-based replacement assay was developed, which meets the implant requirements regarding the assay duration, the compatibility with human serum and the required sensitivity for physiological and most of the pathological conditions. Additionally, the assay standard deviation decreased upon use of reference material (hCC spiced human serum) while maintaining the sensitivity. However, the repetitive replacement assays revealed the replacement to slightly favour one replacement direction, as was predicted by SPR analysis for hCC and GFP-hCC. Although the combination of GFP-hCC and hCC was not ideal, and was only used to fulfil the detection requirements in plate-based format, the results indicate that mAb CyDI- 4 is an excellent antibody for the hCC-specific replacement assay...|$|R

50|$|HAT {{medium is}} often used for {{preparation}} of monoclonal antibodies.

Fused cells are incubated in the HAT medium. Aminopterin in the medium blocks the de novo pathway. Hence, unfused myeloma cells die, as they cannot produce nucleotides by the de novo or salvage pathway. Unfused B cells die as they have a short lifespan.

The hybridomas can be grown in culture, each culture starting with one viable hybridoma cell, producing cultures each of which consists of genetically identical hybridomas which produce one antibody per culture (monoclonal) rather than mixtures of different antibodies (polyclonal).
