2500|$|The KR200 ran on a [...] Fichtel & Sachs forced-air (<b>fan)</b> <b>cooled</b> single {{cylinder}} two-stroke engine positioned {{in front of}} the rear wheel, just behind the passenger's seat. The engine had two sets of contact breaker points and, to reverse, the engine was stopped and then restarted, going backwards. This was effected by pushing the key further in the ignition switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|E
2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a <b>fan</b> <b>cooled</b> [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers. The control column alters cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and pedals make torque corrections and control yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors. A mechanical inertial governor limited rotor accelerations; the pilot could increase the collective pitch over that set by the governor but not below it, emergencies apart.|$|E

40|$|Article history: Because {{of their}} longer {{operating}} times and larger size relative to conventional <b>fans,</b> the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted in buses consume larger amounts of energy. Most of the <b>cooling</b> <b>fans</b> mounted {{in a bus}} {{are connected to the}} engine by a viscous clutch. A viscous cooling fan’s speed is determined by its fluid temperature, which is affected by the air flow through the radiator. The fan does not react immediately to the coolant temperature and in doing so causes unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, the fuel economy of buses using viscous fans can be improved by changing to an electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> design, which can be actively controlled. In addition, electric power consumption is increased by using electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans.</b> Thus, when electric fans are applied in conjunction with the alternator management system (AMS), the fuel economy is further enhanced. In this study, simulations were performed to predict coolant temperature and <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> speeds. Simulations were performed for both viscous and electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> and power consumption was calculated. Additionally, fuel economy was calculated applying both the alternator management system and the electric <b>cooling</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|R

50|$|Attaching an {{internal}} fan to a motor {{is a fairly}} simple way to cool it. Since a <b>fan</b> <b>cooled</b> motor always provides airflow over itself {{regardless of whether it}} is stationary or partially enclosed, it is more effective than using a heat sink in applications with poor airflow because heat sinks usually require air to be flowing over them for maximum effectiveness. Internal fan cooling also takes up far less space than external fan cooling or water cooling.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, Tempo did {{not sell}} to well, {{due to the}} {{invasion}} of Japanese mopeds and motorcycles. Production of the Tempo Corvette and Panter in Norway ceased in 1983, but the Corvette was produced in Portugal until 1994, still sporting the <b>fan</b> <b>cooled</b> Sachs MLKAX engine.

50|$|Another {{negative}} {{aspect is}} that these motors may only be used where mostly-clean air is present at all times.

The impracticality comes from the resulting size, weight, and thermal management issues which open motors have none of.|$|E
