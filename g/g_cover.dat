A goal of the remote sensing community is to infer the physical and biological properties of vegetation cover (e. <b>g.</b> <b>cover</b> type, hemispherical reflectance, ground cover, leaf area index, biomass, and photosynthetic capacity) using directional spectral data. VEG collects together, in a common format, techniques previously available from many different sources {{in a variety of}} formats.

VEG has codified this expert knowledge into a rule-based decision component for determining which technique to use. VEG provides a comprehensive interface that makes applying the techniques simple and aids a researcher in developing and testing new techniques. VEG also provides a classification algorithm that can learn new classes of surface features.

40|$|Service-oriented {{computing}} is {{a paradigm}} for effectively delivering software {{services in a}} dynamic environment. Accordingly, many service-oriented software engineering (SOSE) methodologies have been proposed and practiced in both academia and industry. Some of these methodologies share common features (e. <b>g.</b> <b>cover</b> similar life-cycle phases) but are presented for different purposes, ranging from project management to system modernization, and from business analysis to technical solutions development. Given this diversity in the methodologies available in the literature, {{it is very hard}} for a company to decide which methodology would fit best for its specific needs. With this aim, we took a feature analysis approach and devised a framework for comparing the existing SOA methodologies. Different from existing comparison frameworks, ours specifically highlights aspects that are specific to SOA and aims to differentiate the methodologies that are truly service-oriented from those that deal little with service aspects. As such, the criteria defined in the framework {{can be used as a}} checklist for selecting a SOSE methodology. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{management}} of wildlife at airports has seen great progress in recent decades, wildlife col~ lisians with aircraft continue to pose risks to human safety and economic losses to the aviation industry and military (Allan 2002, Dolbeer 2009). Our understanding of physiological and behavioral responses of wildlife to various types of repellents and harassment techniques has grown tremendously. Substantial in· roads {{have been made in}} developing and optimizing exclusion devices, particularly for mammals. Research and management have increased considerably in recent years, allowing us to better understand aspects of re· source use (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>cover,</b> food) by wildlife and the spatial scales at which they operate (Martin et al. 2011), as well as to improve current management strategies. We suggest that these two forms of management- repellents and harassment (e. g., Chapters 2 - 4) and habitat management (e. g., Chapters 8 -H) -should be integrated to reduce hazardous wildlife use of airports. Direct control methods (e. g., hazing) typically work only in the short term; reducing habitat suitability for wildlife at airports will likely enhance long-term efficacy of these techniques...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present the}} first {{comparison}} between new fAPAR and LAI products {{derived from the}} GlobAlbedo dataset and the widely-used MODIS fAPAR and LAI products. The GlobAlbedo-derived products are produced using a 1 D two-stream radiative transfer (RT) scheme designed explicitly for global parameter retrieval from albedo, with consistency between RT model assumptions and observations, {{as well as with}} typical large-scale land surface model RT schemes. The approach does not require biome-specific structural assumptions (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>cover,</b> clumping, understory), unlike more detailed 3 D RT model approaches. GlobAlbedo-derived values of fAPAR and LAI are compared with MODIS values over 2002 – 2011 at multiple flux tower sites within selected biomes, over 1200 ˆ 1200 km regions and globally. GlobAlbedo-derived fAPAR and LAI values are temporally more stable than the MODIS values due to the smoothness of the underlying albedo, derived via optimal estimation (assimilation) using an a priori estimate of albedo derived from an albedo “climatology ” (composited multi-year albedo observations). Parameters agree closely in timing but with GlobAlbedo values consistently lower than MODIS, particularly for LAI. Large...|$|E

40|$|Online Social Networks (OSNs) allow {{users to}} create and share content (e. g., posts, status updates, comments) in real-time. These {{activities}} are collected in an activity log, (e. g. Facebook Wall, Google+ Stream, etc.) on the user’s social network profile. With time, the activity logs of users, which record the sequences of social activities, become too long and consequently hard to view and navigate. To alleviate this cluttering, {{it is useful to}} select a small subset of the social activities within the specified timeperiod as representative, i. e., as summary, for this time-period. In this paper, we study the novel problem of social activity log summarization. We propose LogRank, a novel and principled algorithm to select activities that satisfy three desirable criteria: First, activities must be important for the user. Second, they must be diverse in terms of topic, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>cover</b> several of the major topics in the activity log. Third, they should be time-dispersed, that is, be spread across the specified time range of the activity log. LogRank operates on an appropriately augmented social interaction graph and employs random-walk techniques to holistically balance all three criteria. We evaluate LogRank and its variants on a real dataset from the Google+ social network and show that they outperform baseline approaches. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{laid down}} the {{foundations}} for what {{is now known as}} information theory in a mathematical framework that is probabilistic (see e. <b>g.</b> <b>Cover</b> and Thomas 1991, Verd'u 1998). That is, Shannon modeled the signal or message process by a random process and a communication channel by a random transition matrix that may distort the message. In the five decades that followed, information theory provided fundamental limits for communication in general and coding and compression in particular. These limits, predicted by information theory under probabilistic models, are now being approached in real products such as computer modems. Since these limits or fundamental communication quantities such as entropy and channel capacity vary from signal process to signal process or from channel to channel, they have to be estimated for each communication set-up. In this sense, information theory is intrinsically statistical. Moreover, the algorithmic theory of information has inspired an extension of Shannon's ideas that provides a formal measure of information of the kind long sought for in statistical inference and modeling. This measure has led to the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for modeling in general and model selection in particular (see Rissanen 1978, Rissanen 1989, Barron, Rissanen and Yu 1998, Hansen and Yu 1998) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} eBook market has created both chances and {{challenges}} for authors. As {{a number of}} self-publishing providers allow simple and cheap self-publication, millions of eBooks have flooded the market, many {{with little or no}} professional input (e. g. editing, a cover, layout). As the current literature offers close to no information on the experiences, perceptions and preferences of self-publishing eBook authors, field research was aimed at establishing first insights. It was found that the quick, simple approach to publishing, the wide distribution and maintaining full control over the product are rated as the most important characteristics of eBooks. On the other hand, the problem of standing out and the cost/time involved with obtaining so-called eBook building blocks (e. <b>g.</b> <b>cover,</b> editing, layout) are rated as the main problems of self-publishing eBooks. Concurrently, risk sharing business models, where services like providing a cover or editing are paid through a royalty model based on sales numbers are of interest to almost half of the respondents.

40|$|While grain {{crops are}} meeting {{much of the}} initial need for {{biofuels}} in the US, cellulosic or second generation (2 G) materials are mandated to provide a growing portion of biofuel feedstocks. We sought to inform development of a 2 G crop portfolio by assessing the profitability of novel cropping systems that potentially mitigate {{the negative effects of}} grain-based biofuel crops on food supply and environmental quality. We analyzed farm-gate costs and returns of five systems from an ongoing experiment in central Iowa, USA. The continuous corn cropping system was most profitable under current market conditions, followed by a corn–soybean rotation that incorporated triticale as a 2 <b>G</b> <b>cover</b> crop every third year, and a corn–switchgrass system. A novel triticale–hybrid aspen intercropping system had the highest yields over the long term, but could only surpass the profitability of the continuous corn system when biomass prices exceeded foreseeable market values. A triticale/sorghum double cropping system was deemed unviable. We perceive three ways 2 G crops could become more cost competitive with grain crops: by (1) boosting yields through substantially greater investment in research and development, (2) increasing demand through substantially greater and sustained investment in new markets, and (3) developing new schemes to compensate farmers for environmental benefits associated with 2 G crops...|$|E

40|$|Application of over-winter {{green cover}} (e. <b>g.</b> <b>cover</b> crops) {{as a measure}} for {{reducing}} nitrate losses from tillage land has been frequently investigated, especially in the unsaturated zone. Monitoring of groundwater is less common in these studies. Studies on groundwater responses to different land treatments can be challenging {{because they can be}} influenced by various conditions, such as recharge, seasonal variations, and aquifer properties, often occurring at different time scales than surface water processes. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate groundwater nitrate (NO 3 [...] N) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration responses to different over-winter green covers: mustard, natural regeneration and no cover. A field experiment was designed and run for three years on tillage land underlain by a vulnerable sand and gravel aquifer in the south-east of Ireland. Results showed that over-winter green cover growth on tillage land can be an effective measure to reduce groundwater NO 3 [...] N concentrations. A significant decrease in groundwater NO 3 [...] N concentrations was observed under the mustard cover compared to no cover. All treatments, including no cover, showed a decline in groundwater NO 3 [...] N concentrations over time. A significant increase in groundwater DOC was also observed under the mustard cover. Although the overall groundwater DOC concentrations were low, the increased DOC occurrence in groundwater should be accounted for in carbon balances and could potentially enhance groundwater denitrification in cases where aquifer conditions may favour it...|$|E
40|$|Several {{factors have}} been taken into account to explain the {{distribution}} of orchid species. We explored {{the extent to which}} plant community attributes affect the abundance and reproductive fitness of three orchid species (Anacamptis morio, Himantoglossum adriaticum and Ophrys sphegodes), native to dry grasslands. Structural attributes of plant community (e. <b>g.</b> <b>cover</b> and height) were assessed in ninety 4 m 2 plots scattered on three hill massifs of the Veneto Region (NE Italy). For the three target orchid species, the height of the flowering stalk, the relative ramet height and the number of flowers and fruits were recorded in 203 tagged ramets. Generalized Linear Model revealed that plant community attributes such as cover and height of the herb layer exert a negative effect on the abundance of orchid populations. Furthermore, regression models indicated that O. sphegodes and H. adriaticum reproductive fitness, determined as fruit/flower ratio, was positively affected by relative ramet height. Our results revealed that local herbaceous vegetation structure influences the cover and fruit set of target orchid species. However, there can be substantial variation in the response of different species and variation in the structural attributes of surrounding vegetation may be associated with differences in the strength of selection. In order to achieve effective results in orchid species conservation, protocols for the in situ conservation must detail the range of vegetation covers and heights at which orchid species are favoured and can produce the most effective inflorescences...|$|E
40|$|We assess neutron starquake {{models for}} γ-ray bursts. The elastic energy the crust can store is {{sufficient}} to account for that radiated in a single burst, but it is insufficient to supply the ≳ 10 ^ 6 bursts each star produces over its lifetime, and {{so it must be}} replenished. Seismic waves are radiated if shear stress is relieved by brittle fracture. However they cannot propagate directly to the surface but are temporarily trapped below a reflecting layer. Between the reflecting layer and the surface the displacement amplitude of the wave is nearly constant and the strain is very small. At low frequencies, ≾ 10 ^ 4 Hz, the reflection is associated with an evanescent zone. At high frequencies, ≳ 10 ^ 4 Hz, the reflection occurs where the magnetic field stress starts to dominate the crustal rigidity. The shaking of the stellar surface couples the seismic waves to Alfén waves which propagate out into the magnetosphere. At low frequencies, the coupling coefficient, T, is proportional to the square of the magnetic field, B, and increases with the seventh power of the wave frequency, v. At high frequencies, T is proportional to B^(4 / 7) v^(3 / 7). Alfvén wave luminosities sufficient to power Galactic γ-ray bursts are possible if magnetic fields ≳ 10 ^(11) <b>G</b> <b>cover</b> {{at least part of the}} stellar surface.
