60|$|MRS WARREN. Well, I never! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> George? He says I look {{well in a}} quiet old rectory garden.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] he said, after {{a cursory}} examination. [...] "I thought {{so at the}} time. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> sort of {{crunching}} snap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{remember}} the adventure," [...] the prince said courteously, [...] "and right gallant action it was; but how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> I was here, sir?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> They want to {{have one}} another killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> There's {{my voice}} over there, and here I am here! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> make of it?" [...] whispered Sticky-toes.|$|R
60|$|THE FEMALE FIGURE. Ozymandias: <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> [She rises on {{her knees}} and looks raptly into space] Queen of queens! [She dies].|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> Half {{a million}} {{sterling}} {{and he takes}} it just as quietly as that. And it isn't really in the play either. Sao Paolo and Rio Tinto just come in {{to let you know}} the sort of man you're dealing with.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{hope they}} will," [...] she replied, [...] "because {{when we leave}} here dad and I {{are going to stay}} for a week or so with some friends quite near. There! <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> noise? That's daddy {{stamping}} because he is getting impatient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{worst of}} last night's {{performance}} was the face Faith made made at {{somebody in the}} congregation before she started in," [...] said Miss Cornelia. [...] "Elder Clow declares she made it at him. And <b>DID</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> she was seen riding on a pig to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Taxicab!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Taxicab, indeed! Look at it again. That's a motor-car--my own motor-car. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> Bought {{and paid}} for!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Humour!' cried Tim Linkinwater, {{suddenly}} growing very {{red in the}} face. 'He'll humour us! He'll humour Cheeryble Brothers! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> him? <b>DO</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> him say he'll humour Cheeryble Brothers?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am not!" [...] Dredlinton shouted, {{straining}} at his cords. [...] "I resign! I {{resign from}} the Board! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> Wingate? I chuck it! Set me free!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Allardyce, [...] "not only in footer but in everything. The place seems {{absolutely}} rotten. It's {{bad enough}} losing all our matches, or nearly all. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Ripton took thirty-seven points off us last term? And we only just managed to beat Greenburgh by a try to nil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will try}} to help you," [...] said Mrs Langley, seating herself by the window. [...] "By the way, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Mr Wright has been offered a lucrative {{appointment}} in the Telegraph Department of India, and is going off at once;--has not time even {{to say good-bye to}} his old friend Sam Shipton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems like an hour," [...] snapped Short. [...] "What's that? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> He's firing! It's the machine-gun! Oh, Lord; {{and here}} we are as {{helpless}} as a lot of old ladies ten thousand miles away! We can't do a thing. We don't know what's happening. Why didn't he let one of us go with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You don’t mean it, lad!” the old {{man said}} with a gasp of astonishment; “a guinea a week! may the Lord be praised! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> missis? a guinea a week!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pig-nuts!" [...] {{repeated}} Merry, in a scream. [...] "Mates, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> I tell <b>you</b> now, {{that man}} there knew it all along. Look {{in the face}} of him and you'll see it wrote there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> Colonel Quaritch?" [...] went on Ida. [...] "I have bet Mr. Cossey a pair {{of gloves}} that you will kill more {{partridges}} this afternoon than he will, so I hope you won't make me lose them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Savine smiled good-humoredly. [...] "I {{guess you}} think that's due to your dignity, but you don't fool me. Look into your mirror, Helen, {{if you really}} want to know. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> he put every dollar he'd made in Canada into the scheme? Of course you didn't; he made Tom promise he would never tell you. Besides--but I forgot, I must not mention that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like it," [...] he answered. [...] "Nature is an {{exquisite}} musician. I never yet heard the sea {{speak in a}} tone which I did not love to hear. Listen to that slow mournful rise of sound, reaching almost to intensity, and then dying away so sadly--with the sadness that thrills. Ah! <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> The shrieking of those pebbles dragged down to the sea, and crying out in almost human agony. I love the sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|I agree quite {{with you}} that she was {{stronger}} and wider in her conversation and letters than in her books. Oh, I have said so a hundred times. The heat of human sympathy seemed to bring out her powerful vitality, rustling all over with laces and flowers. She seemed to think and speak stronger holding a hand--not that she required help or borrowed a word, but that the human magnetism acted on her nature, as it does upon men born to speak. Perhaps {{if she had been}} a man with a man's opportunities, she would have spoken rather than written a reputation. Who can say? She hated the act of composition. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> from her ever? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see, {{they are}} waiting for the corporation, that's the mayor and town council of Montacute; they are coming up with an address. There! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> That's the signal gun. They are leaving the town-hall at this same moment. Now, in three-quarters of an hour's time or so, the duke and duchess, and the young markiss, and all of them, will come on the terrace. So you be alive, and draw near, and get a good place. I must look after these people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> here?" [...] it asked. [...] "Can't you talk? Well, it doesn't matter. If I get hungry I'll eat <b>you!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> I'll eat <b>you,</b> as I <b>did</b> all the others," [...] and {{it showed}} its big yellow teeth and hopped back into the hutch.|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} was so directly {{at variance with}} Bella's views in life, as set forth to her father, that she said internally, 'There, you little mercenary wretch! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> Ain't <b>you</b> ashamed of your self?' and unclasped the girdle of her arms, expressly to give herself a penitential poke in the side.|$|R
60|$|B. B. [suddenly {{rising to}} the new idea with immense {{interest}} and excitement] What! Ridgeon: <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> Sir Patrick: I am more struck by what you have just told me than I can well express. Your father, sir, anticipated a discovery of my own. Listen, Walpole. Blenkinsop: attend one moment. You will all be intensely interested in this. I {{was put on the}} track by accident. I had a typhoid case and a tetanus case {{side by side in the}} hospital: a beadle and a city missionary. Think of what that meant for them, poor fellows! Can a beadle be dignified with typhoid? Can a missionary be eloquent with lockjaw? No. NO. Well, I got some typhoid anti-toxin from Ridgeon and a tube of Muldooley's anti-tetanus serum. But the missionary jerked all my things off the table in one of his paroxysms; and in replacing them I put Ridgeon's tube where Muldooley's ought to have been. The consequence was that I inoculated the typhoid case for tetanus and the tetanus case for typhoid. [The doctors look greatly concerned. B. B., undamped, smiles triumphantly]. Well, they recovered. THEY RECOVERED. Except for a touch of St Vitus's dance the missionary's as well to-day as ever; and the beadle's ten times the man he was.|$|E
6000|$|Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> it {{was easy}} to be honest? Do you find that in your Bible? Easy! It is easy to be an ass and follow the {{multitude}} like a blind, besotted bull in a stampede; and that, I am well aware, is what you and Mrs. Grundy mean by being honest. But it will not bear the stress of time nor the scrutiny of conscience. Even before the lowest of all tribunals,—before a court of law, whose business it is, not to keep men right, or within a thousand miles of right, but to withhold them from going so tragically wrong that they will pull down the whole jointed fabric of society by their misdeeds—even before a court of law, as we begin to see in these last days, our easy view of following at each other’s tails, alike to good and evil, is beginning to be reproved and punished, and declared no honesty at all, but open theft and swindling; and simpletons who have gone on through life with a quiet conscience may learn suddenly, from the lips of a judge, that the custom of the trade may be a custom of the devil. You thought {{it was easy}} to be honest. Did you think {{it was easy to}} be just and kind and truthful? Did you think the whole duty of aspiring man was as simple as a horn-pipe? and you could walk through life like a gentleman and a hero, with no more concern than it takes to go to church or to address a circular? And yet all this time you had the eighth commandment! and, what makes it richer, you would not have broken it for the world! ...|$|E
5000|$|Rolo - a short look-alike of Shorty's friend, Cuban singer Rolando Laserie, who {{is always}} {{watching}} TV. After each news or ad he listens to, he asks his wife in a loud voice: [...] "¿Oíste eso, Tita?" [...] (<b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> Tita?), as the real Rolando always did.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> he has {{defied the}} bishop? I do so like him for that. Not but what poor Mrs. Proudie is the dearest friend I {{have in the}} world, and I'm always {{fighting}} a battle with old Lady Lufton on her behalf. But one likes to see one's friends worsted sometimes, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cock {{you up with}} kisses, indeed! how bad you are for dainties! There; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> That's the old gentleman;" [...] and then, as {{the voice}} of Mr. Mollett senior was heard abusing the car-driver, Miss O'Dwyer {{smoothed}} her apron, put her hands to her side hair, and removed the debris of the broken bottle.|$|R
6000|$|First Spirit. [...] I wail, I wail! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> I wail? [...] I had {{no part in}} your transgression--none. [...] My roses on the bough did bud not pale, [...] My rivers did not loiter in the sun; [...] I was obedient. Wherefore in my centre [...] Do I thrill at this {{curse of}} death and winter?-- [...] Do I wail? ...|$|R
5000|$|A day after Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose removed Senator Lynn Beyak from the Senate's Aboriginal Peoples committee for {{defending}} the residential school system, Senator Kelvin Ogilvie was heard calling CBC reporters parasites. The remark was captured on CBC News cameras, and when questioned about his comment moments later he stated: [...] "I don't recall that. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> What kind of silliness is this? Why don't you folks {{go away and}} find somebody else to bother?".|$|E
5000|$|Created by Severs Ramsey as {{a vehicle}} to release Prime Movers' material, Indi label Birdcage Records' first release was a 7 inch vinyl 45 by The Prime Movers: [...] "Chances" [...] b/w [...] "In Touch With You" [...] in 1983. A {{full-length}} album, [...] "Museum" [...] followed in 1984. Produced by Wall Of Voodoo's Jim Hill, the album received glowing notices leading Cashbox Magazine to gush," [...] “Gary Putman weaves an ethereal tapestry which blends technical wizardry with pure emotion to create one of the most stylistically unique guitar sounds ever (<b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> Les Paul?).”.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{was happy}} about it,” Havoc told Jack Thriller. “The n—- saying our names. I didn’t {{know what the}} f— the beef was about. I didn’t even care. I was like damn, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> 2Pac dissing us. We about to sell some records.” Havoc also {{revealed}} that Mobb Deep had never even “crossed paths” with Pac {{before his death in}} September 1996. He added, “And we {{never got a chance to}} cross paths with him because he passed away,” he said. “I saw him from a long distance but I never met him. was a fan. But didn’t even know him.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Mrs. Wix is magnificent, but she's rather too grand about it. I {{mean the}} {{situation}} isn't after all quite so desperate or quite so simple. But I {{give you my}} word before her, and I {{give it to her}} before you, that I'll never, never, forsake <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that,</b> old fellow, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take it in? I'll stick to you through everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come and see us in two years' time," [...] {{she burst}} out--"and {{discover}} the orphan of the gallows {{in our house}} if you can! If your Asylum won't take her, some other Charity will. Ha, Mr. Governor, I deserve my disappointment! I ought to have remembered that you are only a jailer after all. And what is a jailer? Proverbially a brute. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> A brute!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that a fact! Georgie, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> They {{get their}} fresh garden peas {{out of the}} garden, in Italy! By golly, you live and learn, don't you, Antonio, <b>you</b> {{certainly}} <b>do</b> live and learn, if you live long enough and keep your strength. All right, Garibaldi, just shoot me in that steak, with about two printers'-reams of French fried spuds on the promenade deck, comprehenez-vous, Michelovitch Angeloni?" ...|$|R
