25|$|An Apostolic Visit {{is a rare}} {{event and}} it is also rare for a bishop to call for such an investigation. The Holy See sent Bishop Emeritus John Mortimer Smith, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey, to visit the Diocese.

500|$|On April 20 Hanover {{announced}} that she would soon be taking over the lead role in Eve Ensler's controversial play The Vagina Monologues.

[...] Giuliani <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether he would attend one of her performances. [...] On April 22, the New York Post obtained photographs of Giuliani openly strolling on a Manhattan street with the other woman after they left a restaurant, but did not {{have more than a}} first name for her; the Post sat on the story, but it was clear the relationship was a personal one.|$|E

500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show. Executive producer Al Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop. According to Jean, [...] "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for pretty much what you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent of it is just the way he [...] wanted," [...] but <b>declined</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E

[...] He considered voting for the Libertarian ticket of former Republican Governors Gary Johnson and William Weld, saying that he would [...] "get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he's someone who I could end up voting for", adding that [...] "if Bill Weld were {{at the top of the}} ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president." [...] In September he called for Johnson to be included in the presidential debates and in October it emerged that Independent candidate Evan McMullin was using an email list of 2.5 million Romney supporters to raise money. McMullin's chief strategist said that it was purchased from Romney for President and that [...] "we'll let other folks discuss what that may mean and certainly never speak for [...] ".
