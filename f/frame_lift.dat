50|$|Acting as gantry, the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} {{a number of}} work platforms from which crewmen serviced the rocket. Three (later two) platforms folded flat against the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and could be folded out from the elevated <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{with the use of}} a hand winch. Each folding platform {{included a}} safety rail of folding posts and chains.|$|R
50|$|A-Stoff: Liquid oxygen {{equipment}} {{consists of a}} pipe, which follows a circuitous route along the centreline of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame’s</b> lower half. The pipe is fixed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> by brackets, and closed at each end by cast ramp-and-claw seals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its launch table. The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts {{running up the}} port <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> beam. The drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were operated by a crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> one running half {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> while the other ran the full length.|$|R
50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or lowering the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> One hand tap selected direction to either raise or lower the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from its vertical position.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with tubular and box transverse braces. The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was fitted with plumbing for fuelling the rocket; wiring for powering and monitoring the rocket and for field telephones; accommodations for carrying and dismounting the rocket; and folding platforms {{to service the}} rocket with rungs to access them.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{was fitted}} with outlet sockets and wiring for field telephones. A main {{connection}} from the armoured launch vehicle switchboard to inlet sockets on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> provided circuits for four field phone stations at the Meillerwagen - one each {{at the upper}} and lower folding work platforms and two at the launch table.|$|R
50|$|The rocket was {{provided}} with ejecting umbilical connectors, although their precise deployment evolved. Initially these 'Stotz plugs' travelled as Meillerwagen accessories, stowed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{along with their}} cables. Later, the Stotz plugs were stowed in the cable box, and a ten metre cable mast was stowed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> for ultimate erection on the launch table at the launch site.|$|R
50|$|Now rarely used, but {{for many}} years {{the only way to}} move a {{disabled}} vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> and the casualty. This <b>frame</b> was <b>lifted</b> by means of a pulley until the casualty’s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.|$|R

30|$|The {{cause for}} this anomaly {{involves}} several inter-playing physical processes. Among these, the neutral wind {{component in the}} geomagnetic meridian, combined with the later sunset in summer, play dominant roles as comprehensively discussed in He et al. (2009) and Liu et al. (2010). At middle latitudes, this meridional component (in geomagnetic <b>frame)</b> <b>lifts</b> the ionosphere at night and pushes it down during day. Since the chemical recombination decreases with altitude, this vertical movement tends to enhance the nighttime plasma but deplete the day-time plasma. This wind effect varies significantly with longitude, due to the variation of magnetic declination and inclination. It is strongest at three longitudes near 90 °W, 40 °W, and 150 °E. Variation of this wind component has direct effect on the formation and characteristic of MSNA.|$|R

50|$|In Kass’s first {{significant}} body of work, the Art History Paintings, she combined <b>frames</b> <b>lifted</b> from Disney cartoons with slices of painting from Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns, Jackson Pollock, and other contemporary sources. Establishing appropriation as her primary mode of working, these early paintings also introduced {{many of the}} central concerns of her work to the present. Before and Happily Ever After, for example, coupled Andy Warhol’s painting of an advertisement for a nose job with a movie still of Cinderella fitting her foot into her glass slipper, touching on notions of Americanism and identity in popular culture. Before and Happily Ever After series engages critically {{with the history of}} politics and art making, especially exploring the power relationship {{of men and women in}} society. Deborah Kass's work reveals a personal relationship she shares with particular artworks, songs and personalities, many of which are referenced directly in her paintings.|$|R
50|$|An early {{configuration}} of the Meillerwagen included hard-wiring of two electrical power circuits and two FLAK-plug circuits for the power and control needs of the rocket. The system included four sockets at the upper and {{at the lower end}} of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and the connective wiring fixed along the starboard beam. The four circuits were connected to two Stotz ejecting plugs, stowed with their cables along the side of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> All of this wiring had become redundant by the time the rocket attacks began, but was not removed from the Meillerwagen.|$|R
40|$|A test {{space is}} a {{collection}} of non-empty sets, usually construed as the catalogue of (discrete) outcome-sets associated with a family of experi-ments. Subject to a simple combinatorial condition called algebraicity, a test space gives rise to a “quantum logic ” – that is, an orthoalgebra. Conversely, all orthoalgebras arise naturally from algebraic test spaces. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the relevant test space is the set F(H) of frames (unordered orthonormal bases) of a Hilbert space H. The corresponding logic is the usual one, i. e., the projection lattice L(H) of H. The test space F(H) has a strong symmetry property with respect to the unitary group of H, namely, that any bijection between two <b>frames</b> <b>lifts</b> to a unitary operator. In this paper, we consider test spaces enjoying the same symmetry property relative to an action by a compact topological group. We show that such a test space, if algebraic, gives rise to a compact, atomistic topological orthoalgebra. We also present a construction tha...|$|R

50|$|Arriving in {{the same}} strange secretary's room at the {{production}} company, it is also vacant. No signs of life anywhere. Alex {{opens the door to}} the vacuous room and hears typing on the far end. As he walks toward the sound of the typewriter, he sees a projection of himself in that moment repeating into infinity. He turns back and stares directly into the camera - aware {{for the first time that}} the camera is the entity who is watching him. He approaches the typewriter and sees a full script sitting in the paper tray called 'The Frame'. The script describes the exact moment we're seeing, Alex becoming aware of the script and storyteller and writer. He stumbles backward in disbelief and the left side of the camera frame hits him in the back. He moves in the opposite direction and finds the other side of The Frame. After challenging both sides, The <b>Frame</b> <b>lifts</b> him up and tilts him backwards and he mysteriously wakes up at home.|$|R

50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one {{on each side of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R
