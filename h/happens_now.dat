500|$|Originally, {{the mythology}} for season seven was {{supposed}} to continue from and show the ramifications of the [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son" [...] story arc. Frank Spotnitz, in an interview, explained that the mythology episodes for season seven would feature [...] "characters you saw in 'One Son' coming back" [...] and explore [...] "what <b>happens</b> <b>now</b> that the conspiracy has been destroyed, what are {{the politics of the}} new landscape that exists. [...] There are aliens from outer space, two different races that are warring with each other." [...] In addition, he said that the then-planned series finale would feature [...] "the big idea that Chris [...] had in the beginning." [...] However, these ideas never came to pass, and the season finale, [...] "Requiem", segued directly into the eighth season premiere [...] "Within". Duchovny later revealed that, had the show ended, the final three episodes would have been devoted to the myth-arc.|$|E
500|$|Though hip-hop {{dancing is}} {{established}} on film and on television, {{it has not}} gained {{the same level of}} exposure in theater. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the dance is performed more in film and in television than it is in a theatrical setting. B-boy and popper Stefan [...] "Mr. Wiggles" [...] Clemente and hip-hop historian Jorge [...] "Popmaster Fabel" [...] Pabon were involved in hip-hop theater at its inception. Their dance company, GhettOriginal, produced the first hip-hop stage shows: 1991's off Broadway musical So! What <b>Happens</b> <b>Now?</b> and 1995's Jam on the Groove. Both shows were performed by the Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians. Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Rennie Harris' Puremovement hip-hop theater company. Harris founded Puremovement in 1992 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of Puremovement's theater shows Rome & Jewels won two Black Theater Alliance Awards and three Bessie Awards. In 2012, Harris and his company toured Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian territories as part of Dance Motion USA, a program sponsored by the US State Department to showcase American dance to other countries and promote cultural exchange.|$|E
