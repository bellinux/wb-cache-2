Though the general design of the cover <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|Annalee Call was {{originally}} written for Angelina Jolie; although Jolie auditioned, she {{turned down the}} role and Winona Ryder was cast in December 1996. Call had a generally negative critical reception, largely due to a perceived lack of synergy with the film and the franchise. Roger Ebert praised Ryder's acting, but felt {{that she did not}} bring a strong presence or purpose to the film except as a familiar face to younger viewers. Nordling agreed in a 2012 Ain't It Cool News analysis, saying that Call's synthetic origin is unnecessary and her only role <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surrogate audience.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham's {{early history}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> remote and {{marginal}} area. The main centres of population, power and {{wealth in the}} pre-industrial English Midlands lay in the fertile and accessible river valleys of the Trent, the Severn and the Avon. The area of modern Birmingham lay in between, on the upland Birmingham Plateau and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated Forest of Arden.|$|E

5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E
5|$|Commercial artist Russell H. Tandy was {{the first}} artist to {{illustrate}} Nancy Drew. Tandy was a fashion artist and infused Nancy with a contemporary fashion sensibility: her early style <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flatfoot flapper: heeled Mary Janes accompany her blue flapper skirt suit and cloche hat on three of the first four volume dust jackets. As styles changed {{over the next few}} years, Nancy began to appear in glamorous frocks, with immaculately set hair, pearls, matching hats, gloves, and handbags. By the 1940s, Nancy wore simpler, tailored suits and outfits; her hair was often arranged in a pompadour. In the post-war era, Tandy's Nancy is shown hatless, wearing casual skirt and blouse ensembles, and carrying a purse, like most teens of the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{position}} {{in the history of}} architecture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> creative genius who, inspired by nature, developed a style of his own that attained technical perfection as well as aesthetic value, and bore the mark of his character. Gaudí's structural innovations were to an extent the result of his journey through various styles, from Doric to Baroque via Gothic, his main inspiration. It could be said that these styles culminated in his work, which reinterpreted and perfected them. Gaudí passed through the historicism and eclecticism of his generation without connecting with other architectural movements of the 20th century that, with their rationalist postulates, derived from the Bauhaus school, and represented an antithetical evolution to that initiated by Gaudí, given that it later reflected the disdain and the initial lack of comprehension of the work of the modernista architect.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness.

He is also a close friend and classmate of Shiina, who often asks him to try on her cosplay costumes, but as he is quite shy, he generally refuses. He harbors homosexual feelings towards Okabe, who calls him by a nickname , and thinks of Luka as his pupil. He is 16 years old. While he does become a female for part of the story and in most of the time lines throughout the story, canonically he is male by the end, and in only one of multiple time lines Luka was female.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water {{more quickly than}} magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen {{in the air to}} form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The core {{concept of}} general-relativistic {{model-building}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solution of Einstein's equations. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for {{the properties of}} matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.|$|E
