5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among {{the reasons for}} dismissal were: incompetently disposing of {{the tens of thousands}} of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> up the pace of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{the court}} {{sentenced him to}} {{imprisonment}} and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops {{made it difficult for}} the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out.|$|E
25|$|Corrigan had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> out {{the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E

500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both look as though they had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E
500|$|Mader {{subsequently}} {{began to}} watch the first three seasons of Lost on DVD and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news {{that she had been}} chosen for the role. She watched all the previous episodes of Lost in the few weeks before she started working on the show. She found it [...] "a really amazing moment" [...] and felt like she had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> into the show. When she was cast, Mader was unaware of whether she would be a guest star, or would develop into a regular, and was planned to feature in eight episodes of season four. Mader helped develop Charlotte's outfit and was pleased to be wearing comfortable jeans and boots for the role. She only required a small amount of hair and makeup done, and stated [...] "I just wanted to rough it. I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun". This was a welcome change to her usual roles which required [...] "full-on hair, makeup and heels".|$|E
500|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{received}} some praise for graphical improvements over its predecessor. Among {{the aspects of}} the game which received positive reactions were the game's environments. Just Adventure called the game environments [...] "head and shoulders above And Then There Were None," [...] describing the train's carriages on the Orient Express as oozing with elegance, and a faithful and accurate recreation of the 1930s. The site criticized the game for suffering graphically in later stages, but praised it overall for improving on the graphics of And Then There Were None. Game Chronicles was less enthusiastic, calling the graphics above average, but standard fare for a current adventure game. Character models were another aspect of Murder on the Orient Express which received positive attention. Quandary described the character modelling as much improved from And Then There Were None, and while still a tinge woody, [...] "all the characters {{feel as if they}} <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> out of the book." [...] Adventure Gamers called the characters [...] "some of the best seen in recent adventure games," [...] saying that each character has a unique design and costume perfect for the game's setting. The reviewer also pointed out several small touches added to the characters, such as the main character shivering when she is outside the train in the cold weather, and also brushing lint off her clothing while waiting for the player {{to decide what to do}} next. Adventure Gamers also complimented AWE Productions for lighting effects in the game, and for creating a [...] "very soft glow to the scenes, which give a much more lifelike look to the characters." [...] IGN agreed that the interior of the Orient Express is quite sharp, but complained that character models lack detail and are animated awkwardly. Another complaint from IGN was that the compression used for cutscenes causes the animations to look [...] "washed out and blocky," [...] and that this problem continues as the cutscenes are noticeably pixelated throughout Murder on the Orient Express.|$|E

Harrell stated that she aimed to push the album in the direction she envisioned. The producer stated that he attempted to move away from mainstream pop music when producing the album's vocals, [...] "Every record that everybody does is a record that somebody else could've done, if that makes sense.

2500|$|The first {{national}} convention of that new party convened in St. Louis, Missouri in July 1904, {{with plans to}} field candidates in states that had sizeable Black populations. Its platform included planks that dealt with disfranchisement, insufficient career opportunities for Blacks in the United States military, imperialism, public ownership of railroads, “self-government” for the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.), lynching, and pensions for ex-slaves. The convention also selected “Col.” William Thomas Scott of East St. Louis, Illinois as its candidate {{for the office of}} president of the United States for the 1904 election. When convention delegates had left St. Louis and when Scott was arrested and jailed for having failed to pay a fine imposed in 1901, the party’s executive committee turned to Taylor who had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> down as president of the National Negro Democratic League to lead the party’s ticket.|$|E
2500|$|The Lions had a woeful year in 1967, going 3–12–1 and {{finishing}} in {{last in the}} CFL's Western Division. Knap did not return for another season. Instead, he succeeded Lyle Smith as head coach at Boise College in 1968, soon to become [...] "Boise State College" [...] (and BSU in 1974). [...] Smith had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> down as head coach and as the athletic director, hired his former Vandal teammate. It was Boise's first year as an NAIA independent; it had previously competed in the junior college ranks.

2500|$|In 1919 Delilah L. Beasley {{wrote in}} her book The Negro Trail-Blazers of California: [...] "The death of Colonel Allensworth was most tragic, because after passing through three wars, he was finally killed by a {{careless}} motorcyclist {{on the streets of}} Monrovia, California, a few miles out from Los Angeles, the accident occurring on a Sunday morning in September, 1914. The aged Colonel {{was on his way to}} preach in a small church of the village and had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> from a Pacific Electric street car when these men knocked him down and ran over him, killing him through their careless driving, his death, occurring within twenty-four hours afterwards without his regaining [...] consciousness, was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky to the people of the State. He had spent the two years previous in dictating and assisting Professor Charles Alexander to write his autobiography." [...] The book had been sent to the publishers and was ready to come off the press when he was killed.|$|E
2500|$|The Rocky Cut raid set {{the stage}} for the final act of the James–Younger Gang: the famous Northfield, Minnesota raid on September 7, 1876. The target was the First National Bank of Northfield, which was far outside of the gang's usual territory. The idea for the raid came from Jesse and Bob Younger. Cole tried to talk his brother out of the plan, but Bob refused to back down. Reluctantly, Cole agreed to go, writing to his brother Jim in California to come home. Jim Younger had never wanted {{anything}} to do with Cole's outlaw activities, but he agreed to go out of family loyalty. The Northfield bank was not unusually rich. According to public reports, it was a perfectly ordinary rural bank, though rumors persisted that General Adelbert Ames, son of the owner of the Ames Mill in Northfield, had deposited $50,000 there. Shortly after the robbery, Bob Younger declared that they had selected it because of its connection to two Union generals and Radical Republican politicians: Benjamin Butler and his son-in-law Adelbert Ames. General Ames had <b>just</b> <b>stepped</b> down as Governor of Mississippi, where he had been strongly identified with civil rights for freedmen. He had recently moved to Northfield, where his father owned the mill on the Cannon River and had a large amount of stock in the bank. One of the outlaws [...] "had a spite" [...] against Ames, Bob said. Cole Younger said much the same thing years later and recalled greeting [...] "General Ames" [...] on the street in Northfield just before the robbery.|$|E
2500|$|Lynn's next album, Fist City, was {{released}} in 1968. The title track became Lynn's second No.1 hit, as a single earlier that year, and the other single from the album, [...] "What Kind of a Girl (Do You Think I Am)", peaked within the Top 10. In 1968, her next studio album, Your Squaw Is on the Warpath, spawned two Top 5 Country hits: the title track and [...] "You've <b>Just</b> <b>Stepped</b> In (From Stepping Out on Me)". In 1969, her next single, [...] "Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)", was Lynn's third chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, [...] "To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)". She was reportedly once inspired to write a song about a real woman she suspected was flirting with her husband. The song, [...] "You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man)", was an instant hit {{and became one of}} Lynn's all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her hit [...] "Coal Miner's Daughter", which peaked at No.1 on the Billboard Country Chart in 1970, and the album has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. [...] "Coal Miner's Daughter" [...] tells the story of Lynn's life growing up in rural Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. The song became her first single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. The song [...] "Coal Miner's Daughter" [...] later served as the impetus for the best-selling autobiography (1976) and the Oscar-winning biopic, both of which share the song's title.|$|E
