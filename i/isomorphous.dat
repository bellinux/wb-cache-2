5|$|Chemically, the perxenate {{compounds}} {{are used}} as oxidizing agents in analytical chemistry. Xenon difluoride is used as an etchant for silicon, particularly {{in the production of}} microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil can be produced by reacting xenon difluoride with uracil. Xenon is also used in protein crystallography. Applied at pressures from 0.5 to 5MPa (5 to 50atm) to a protein crystal, xenon atoms bind in predominantly hydrophobic cavities, often creating a high-quality, <b>isomorphous,</b> heavy-atom derivative {{that can be used for}} solving the phase problem.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple <b>isomorphous</b> replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can be {{introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can {{be introduced}} either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E
5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is <b>isomorphous</b> to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene. Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is <b>isomorphous</b> with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
25|$|Radium {{chloride}} (RaCl2) is a colorless, luminous compound. It becomes yellow {{after some}} time due to self-damage by the alpha radiation given off by radium when it decays. Small amounts of barium impurities give the compound a rose color. It is soluble in water, though less so than barium chloride, and its solubility decreases with increasing concentration of hydrochloric acid. Crystallization from aqueous solution gives the dihydrate RaCl2·2H2O, <b>isomorphous</b> with its barium analog.|$|E
25|$|Radium bromide (RaBr2) {{is also a}} colorless, {{luminous}} compound. In water, it is more soluble than radium chloride. Like radium chloride, crystallization from {{aqueous solution}} gives the dihydrate RaBr2·2H2O, <b>isomorphous</b> with its barium analog. The ionizing radiation emitted by radium bromide excites nitrogen molecules in the air, making it glow. The alpha particles emitted by radium quickly gain two electrons to become neutral helium, with builds up inside and weakens radium bromide crystals. This effect sometimes causes the crystals to break or even explode.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variety of}} pyrope from Macon County, North Carolina is a violet-red shade {{and has been}} called rhodolite, Greek for [...] "rose". In {{chemical}} composition it may be considered as essentially an <b>isomorphous</b> mixture of pyrope and almandine, {{in the proportion of}} two parts pyrope to one part almandine. Pyrope has tradenames some of which are misnomers; Cape ruby, Arizona ruby, California ruby, Rocky Mountain ruby, and Bohemian garnet from the Czech Republic. Another intriguing find is the blue color-changing garnets from Madagascar, a pyrope-spessartine mix. The color of these blue garnets is not like sapphire blue in subdued daylight but more reminiscent of the grayish blues and greenish blues sometimes seen in spinel. However, in white LED light, the color is equal to the best cornflower blue sapphire, or Dblock tanzanite; {{this is due to the}} blue garnet's ability to absorb the yellow component of the emitted light.|$|E

50|$|Montmorillonite is a {{subclass}} of smectite, a 2:1 {{phyllosilicate mineral}} characterized as having greater than 50% octahedral charge; its {{cation exchange capacity}} is due to <b>isomorphous</b> substitution of Mg for Al in the central alumina plane.
