5|$|The Australian {{national}} {{baseball team}} represents Australia in international baseball tournaments and competitions. They are ranked {{as the top}} team in Oceania, and are the Oceanian Champions, having been awarded the title in 2007 when New Zealand withdrew from the Oceania Baseball Championship.

5|$|Roberts' {{portrayal}} of Joseph earned him several award nominations. In 2006, he was longlisted for the Most Popular Newcomer award at the National Television Awards (NTAs), and named the nineteenth Best Actor at the BBC Drama Awards. He was nominated in the Best Actor category at the 2007 and 2009 TVQuick and TV Choice Awards, {{and received a}} Best Drama Performance nomination at the 2010 NTAs. Bree Treacy's of RTÉ ten's rates Byrne her favorite character in the show, enjoying his love hate relationship with Jac and the intensity he brings to the show. According to her all the other storylines pale in comparison. Anne Robinson mocked Roberts {{portrayal of}} Byrne on The Weakest Link, asking why his character only <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> a sympathy shag, leading to {{a record number of}} complaints.|$|E

5|$|Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilization, all but {{pulling out}} of {{recently}} pacified Spain and Gaul. They even established a major garrison in Sicily in case the Seleucids <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> to Italy. This fear was shared by Rome's Greek allies, who had largely ignored Rome {{in the years after}} the Second Macedonian War, but now followed Rome again {{for the first time since}} that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilized under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman-Syrian War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae (as they believed the 300 Spartans had done centuries earlier). Like the Spartans, the Seleucids lost the battle, and were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, which marked the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in a complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Although they still controlled a great deal of territory, this defeat marked the decline of their empire, as they were to begin facing increasingly aggressive subjects in the east (the Parthians) and the west (the Greeks). Their empire disintegrated into a rump over the course of the next century, when it was eclipsed by Pontus. Following Magnesia, Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.|$|E
25|$|Royalties were {{likewise}} held {{up in the}} United States due to {{the litigation}} between Houghton Mifflin and Stackpole. Because the matter was only settled in September 1941, {{only a few months}} before a state of war existed between Germany and the U.S., all Eher Verlag <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> was a $2,500 advance from Reynal and Hitchcock. It got none from the unauthorised Stackpole edition or the 1943 Manheim edition.|$|E
25|$|This {{is how it}} was for me. This is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people come back with this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, further {{allegations}} {{arose from}} Carlton Dotson's estranged wife, Melissa Kethley, and by Sonya Hart, {{the mother of}} another athlete, Robert Hart. They reported widespread abuse of marijuana and alcohol among players that was subsequently ignored by head coach Dave Bliss and his staff. Sonya Hart revealed that she had raised concerns about the drug use with associate athletic director Paul Bradshaw, but that no one <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> back in contact with her.|$|E
25|$|General George Augustus Eliott {{had offered}} a reward {{to anyone who}} would invent a method to get cannons {{to the other side}} of The Rock. Although it is unknown whether Sergeant Major Ince <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> this reward, he {{received}} a plot of land on the Upper Rock, which is still called Ince's Farm. He was later given a valuable horse. Ince's troops, who were then known as Soldier Artificers, founded the Soldier Artificer Company in Gibraltar in 1772 which later became the Corps of Royal Engineers.|$|E
25|$|Such was his {{impact on}} the Finnish {{political}} scene that Kekkonen's face appeared on the 500 Markka banknote during his term as President. The series of Finnish Markka banknotes used at this time was the second-to-last design series in {{the entire history of}} the currency. Very few Finns have <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> their face on a Markka note during their lifetime, and Kekkonen was the last to do so. This banknote was declared Finland's most beautiful note according to voting organised by the commemorative coins and medal marketer Suomen Moneta on 1 April 2011.|$|E

25|$|Vicky's {{romance with}} {{kindhearted}} police officer, Ryan Harrison (Paul Michael Valley), {{became one of}} the show's most popular love stories of the '90s. However, Vicky (now played by Jensen Buchanan) ruined her relationship with Ryan when she cheated on him with his brother, Grant (Mark Pinter). Vicky would come to regret the day she <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> involved with Grant as he continued to terrorize her for years. Amanda saw her marriage to Sam crash and burn when she had an affair with Janice's son, Evan Frame (Charles Grant). Marley and Jamie's relationship fell apart due to her inability to become pregnant.|$|E
25|$|And, when Andrew Flintoff {{was brought}} {{on as the}} fourth bowler {{to be used in}} six overs, and removed Gilchrist with his second ball of the day, things looked hopeful for England, but that was as good as it <b>ever</b> <b>got.</b> Ricky Ponting smashed 14 fours and a six on his way to 111, making a century off 105 balls, Michael Vaughan was forced to wait with the power play overs, Simon Katich, Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds played well-paced innings, and England found {{themselves}} unable to contain the Australians. The end was always in sight, eventually coming with 34 balls remaining, Darren Gough bowling a no ball – his third of the day – to gift the game to Australia. It was symptomatic of Gough's poor series, and indeed, he had Gilchrist bowled off a no ball in the very first over. His bowling analysis for the game read 6.2–0–43–1.|$|E

500|$|Sir Richard C. Jebb {{concludes that}} [...] "unique as an Athenian statesman, Pericles {{must have been}} in two respects unique also as an Athenian orator; first, because he {{occupied}} such a position of personal ascendancy as no man before or after him attained; secondly, because his thoughts and his moral force won him such renown for eloquence as no one else <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> from Athenians".|$|E
500|$|... "Natural Born Kissers" [...] was {{the first}} episode written by Matt Selman, who partly based it on his parents' marriage.

500|$|During {{the sixth}} season {{there was talk}} of {{spinning}} off the Green Arrow into his own series, but Hartley refused to talk {{about the possibility of a}} spin-off because of his role on Smallville. The actor felt it his duty to respect what the show had accomplished in five seasons, and not [...] "steal the spotlight" [...] because there was [...] "talk" [...] of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley, [...] "talking" [...] was as far as the spin-off idea <b>ever</b> <b>got.</b>|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} humorous {{side of his}} personality, Hassett was also known for his {{diplomatic}} skills as a leader and his affability, particularly his ability to endear himself to hosts and public while representing Australia overseas.

[...] Teammate Keith Miller said that Hassett had [...] "more genuine friends in {{all walks of life}} than any other cricketer".|$|E
500|$|Like many his {{age in the}} Shamokin area, Coveleski {{began work}} as a [...] "breaker boy" [...] at a local {{colliery}} {{at the age of}} 12.

[...] "There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour", he later recalled. [...] "What was strange is that I <b>ever</b> <b>got</b> out of there". Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule.|$|E
