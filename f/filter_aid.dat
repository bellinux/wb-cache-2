Clarification can account for approximate to 40 % of these costs, especially when {{a large amount of}} dispersed particulate material is generated, such as during the extraction of intracellular proteins from plants. Filter capacity can be increased (and DSP costs reduced) by using flocculants. Here we show that cellulose-based <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> can enhance the positive effect of flocculants by improving depth filter capacity even further. A design-of-experiments (DoE) approach was used to identify the optimal size and concentration of <b>filter</b> <b>aids,</b> at different values of pH and conductivity, for the clarification of tobacco leaf extracts during the production of a monoclonal antibody and a fluorescent protein. <b>Filter</b> <b>aids</b> approximate to 28 or approximate to 100 m in length at concentrations of approximate to 10 and approximate to 5 g L- 1 respectively were most efficient in combination with a strong cationic flocculant, but were ineffective without the flocculant.

In this study, the effect of a <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> performance known as PrekotAC on pressure drop and particle penetration in a filtration system with varying filtration velocity of 1 to 3 m/min was evaluated. The PrekotAC is a combination of PrekotTM and activated carbon mixed in different weight compositions. Result showed that the pressure drop across the fabric media decreases with the addition of PrekotTM in the PrekotAC admixture due to its wide range of non-uniform particle size distribution that gives higher porosity of filter cake during filtration process. The study also showed that the total particle penetration through the fabric media was proportionally related to addition of PrekotTM in the PrekotAC admixture under a constant material loading.

40|$|A fabric {{filtration}} system has an {{advantage of a}} very high collection efficiency of more than ninety nine percent. However, the problem associated with fabric filter {{is that it has}} a short life span due to wear and tear connected with the operating conditions of the system. Treatment of fabric filter using pre-coating material is one of the simplest techniques to overcome this problem. The material works as a <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> that will coat a layer of inert material onto the surface of the fabric and simultaneously acts as a filter cake barrier allowing a uniform airflow passing through the filter media. Thus, the study is to investigate and evaluate the characteristics and performance of a newly formulated <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> designated as PrekotAC (a combination of <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> material, PreKot™ and activated carbon) that will work as two in one material i. e. an adsorbent and a pre-coating material for a fabric {{filtration system}}.

50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a <b>filter</b> <b>aid,</b> such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|E

PrekotAC which is a combination of 90 %wt activated carbon and 10 %wt PreKotTM was tested under various material loadings of 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mg/mm 2 at a constant filtration velocity of 5 m/min across its cake and filter media. The results showed that PrekotAC presents a lower pressure drop across the P 84 compared to PTFE filter media under various material loadings. This is because of its different characteristics that effect the porosity of the filter media and allow a higher volumetric airflow passing through, resulting in lower pressure drop compared to PTFE filter media. In addition, the diversity in terms of particle size distribution of the formulated PrekotAC that increase its permeability property helps to reduce the pressure drop across the media and its filter cake. Thus, PrekotAC has a promising characteristic as a two in one <b>filter</b> <b>aids,</b> a pre-coating and adsorbent material for fabric filtration system...|$|R

50|$|These {{filter aids}} {{can be used}} in two {{different}} ways. They {{can be used as a}} precoat before the slurry is filtered.

In a rotary filter, the <b>filter</b> <b>aid</b> may be applied as a precoat; subsequently, thin slices of this layer are sliced off with the cake.|$|E
50|$|Decrease in the vat level {{eventually}} {{leads to}} {{a decrease in the}} portion of the drum being submerge under the slurry, more surface exposure for the cake dying surface hence, larger cake formation to dry time ratio.

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is well suited}} to slurries, and liquids with a high solid content, which could clog other forms of filter. The drum is pre-coated with a <b>filter</b> <b>aid,</b> typically of diatomaceous earth (DE) or Perlite.

When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 <b>Filter</b> <b>Aid.</b> The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a formulated <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> material known as PrekotAC were investigated in this study. PrekotAC does not merely act as a flue gas cleaning agent but also as an efficient dust separation material {{to be used in}} a fabric filter system. PrekotAC was formulated based on the combination of PreKot™ and activated carbon with four different weight ratios of 10 : 90, 20 : 80, 30 : 70 and 40 : 60, respectively. The relationship between pressure drop and the {{characteristics of}} the newly formulated <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> in terms of filtration velocity, permeability and material loading across a filter media was investigated. The results showed that pressure drop across a filter media decreases as the amount of PreKot™ content in the mixture increases. It was observed that the formulation of PrekotAC 40 : 60 gave the lowest pressure drop compared to the other combinations. The characteristics of the PreKot™ itself, which are fluffy and multi-cellular in nature help to form a porous filter cake layer during the filtration process. Furthermore, the particle size distribution of the formulated PrekotAC which is well balance leads to the formation of a porous cake with high permeability even under high filtration velocity or material loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>aids</b> is a {{group of}} inert {{materials}} acting as a ‘barrier’ for protection as well as to allow a uniform air flow passing through a filter cake in a filtration process. In addition, the accumulation of the filter cake deposited {{on the surface of the}} filter media helps to increase the performance of filtration. However, some particles do not participate in the formation of the filter cake during cake filtration process. The particles either penetrating through the filter media or clog and block the pores of the filter medium. A high performance filtration requires low dust penetration without excessive pressure drop builds up across the filter media. This paper evaluates on the filtration performance of a newly formulated <b>filter</b> <b>aids</b> material known as PrekotAC which consists of different combination of pre-coating material PrekotTM and activated carbon at material loadings of 0. 2 mg/mm² under different air flow rates of 4, 5, and 6 L/min. The PrekotAC was evaluated based on the total particle penetration across its filter cake as a mean of measuring its performance. The study showed that the total particle penetration through the filter media is highly influenced by the air flow rates. It was found that the total particle penetration through PrekotAC 10 : 90 (weight basis of PrekotTM:activated carbon) was the lowest while the highest in the case of PrekotAC 40 : 60 of the four PrekotAC admixtures. In addition, the total particles penetrating through the filter media was the highest for the highest tested air flow rates of 6 L/min...|$|R
