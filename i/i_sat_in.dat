The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty.

500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{said that the}} song was [...] "Perfectly acceptable, though {{not in the same}} class as 'Who's That Girl'." [...] Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: [...] "I recall my stunned admiration as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl. If you want to hear the essence of modernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This is the authentic voice of fin de siècle." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] and [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] were not among Madonna's best singles.|$|E

500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> my hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E

Shannon later commented: [...] "I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I {{walked in the door}} and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation—'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player —I didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> that night and it sounded great." [...] Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted.|$|E
2500|$|The chain {{also has}} fans {{in a number}} of renowned chefs {{including}} Gordon Ramsay, Thomas Keller, Julia Child, Anthony Bourdain, and Mario Batali. Famous London chef/restaurateur Ramsay ate In-N-Out for the first time when taping [...] Hell's Kitchen in Los Angeles, and it soon became one of his favorite spots for take-out. Ramsay was quoted, saying about the experience: [...] "In-N-Out burgers were extraordinary. I was so bad, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> the restaurant, had my double cheeseburger then minutes later I drove back round and got the same thing again to take away." [...] Thomas Keller, a fan of In-N-out, celebrated with In-N-Out burgers at the anniversary party of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Keller also plans on opening his own burger restaurant inspired by his Los Angeles experience of In-N-Out. Julia Child, one of the first celebrities to champion the chain, admitted to knowing every location of the restaurant between Santa Barbara and San Francisco. Child also had the burgers delivered to her during a hospital stay. Anthony Bourdain reportedly said that In-N-Out was his favorite fast food meal; later naming the restaurant as [...] "the best restaurant in Los Angeles." [...] In-N-Out was {{one of the very few}} restaurant chains given a positive mention in the book Fast Food Nation. The book commended the chain for using natural and fresh ingredients and for looking after the interests of employees regarding pay and benefits. An In-N-Out food truck catered Vanity Fairs 2012 Academy Awards after party.|$|E
