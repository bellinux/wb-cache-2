25|$|These ants {{are native}} to Argentina, {{and the red}} {{imported}} fire ant most likely came from here when they first invaded the United States; in particular, populations of these ants {{have been found in}} the provinces of Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa, Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, and Tucumán. The northeastern regions of Argentina are the most credible <b>guess</b> <b>where</b> the invading ants originate. In Brazil, they are found in northern Mato Grosso and in Rondônia and in São Paulo state. The red imported fire ant and S. saevissima are parapatric in Brazil, with contact zones known in Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná state and São Paulo. In Paraguay they are found throughout the country, and have been recorded in Boquerón, Caaguazú, Canindeyú, Central, Guairá, Ñeembucú, Paraguarí, and Presidente Hayes departments; Trager claims that the ant is distributed in all regions of the country. They are also found in a large portion of northeastern Bolivia and, to a lesser extent, in northwestern Uruguay.|$|E
25|$|This {{literature}} is remarkable {{for being in}} the vernacular (Old English) in the early medieval period: almost all other written literature was in Latin at this time, but due to Alfred's programme of vernacular literacy, the oral traditions of Anglo-Saxon England ended up being converted into writing and preserved. We owe much of this preservation to the monks of the tenth century, who made – {{at the very least}} – the copies of most of the literary manuscripts that still exist. Manuscripts were not common items. They were expensive and hard to make. First, cows or sheep had to be slaughtered and their skins tanned. Then people had to decide to use this leather for manuscripts rather than for any of the other things leather can be used for. The leather was then scraped, stretched, and cut into sheets, which were sewn into books. Then inks had to be made from oak galls and other ingredients, and the books had to be hand written by monks using quill pens. Every manuscript is slightly different from every other one, even if they are copies of each other, because every scribe had different handwriting and made different errors. We can sometimes identify individual scribes from their handwriting, and we can often <b>guess</b> <b>where</b> manuscripts were written because different scriptoria (centres of manuscript production) wrote in different styles of hand.|$|E

500|$|A five-part web series titled Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Double Agent, also {{sponsored}} by Lexus, {{was released from}} March 4 to May 6, 2015 on ABC.com. The web series follows a newly hired Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. production assistant, who acts as a double agent for the [...] "Mastermind", portrayed by Stan Lee. Cast and crew members from the series, such as Gregg, also appear, with viewers having the ability to vote in an online poll after each episode to <b>guess</b> <b>where</b> the double agent would go in the next episode; votes entered viewers in a drawing to win prizes from the set of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Double Agent was nominated for Outstanding Digital Series at the 27th Producers Guild Awards. Another Lexus-sponsored five-part web series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Academy, released from March 9 to May 4, 2016. In Academy, three Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fans compete to play an agent in that series. Members of the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. cast also appear. All three fans ultimately made cameo appearances in the third-season finale.|$|E

2500|$|A NOP-sled is {{the oldest}} and most widely known {{technique}} for successfully exploiting a stack buffer overflow. It solves the problem of finding the exact address of the buffer by effectively increasing the size of the target area. To do this, much larger sections of the stack are corrupted with the no-op machine instruction. At the end of the attacker-supplied data, after the no-op instructions, the attacker places an instruction to perform a relative jump {{to the top of the}} buffer where the shellcode is located. This collection of no-ops is referred to as the [...] "NOP-sled" [...] because if the return address is overwritten with any address within the no-op region of the buffer, the execution will [...] "slide" [...] down the no-ops until it is redirected to the actual malicious code by the jump at the end. This technique requires the attacker to <b>guess</b> <b>where</b> on the stack the NOP-sled is instead of the comparatively small shellcode.|$|E

2500|$|Back at the Militia Headquarters, whilst Alpha Company were {{crouched}} down behind their vehicles dodging the rocks being thrown at them by an angry crowd, {{they were able}} to distinguish between the sound of rounds being fired from an AK-47 and an SA-80 rifle by their relative pitches. They realized that Bravo were under fire and returning fire themselves. Without communications, Alpha mounted up and drove into the town having to <b>guess</b> <b>where</b> Bravo would be by the sound of the gunfire. Alpha came under sustained and heavy fire at a crossroads [...] from the police station. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) under these conditions is to de-bus. The troops from Alpha spread out with some taking cover under their DAF truck. Despite the short distance and the availability of line of sight, no members of Alpha had seen or recognized the Land Rovers of the RMPs at the police station, though at that point, the Land Rovers may have been moved inside the police station compound. Alpha suppressed the enemy fire, but the DAF truck needed to be jump-started due to mechanical problems. With some troops providing cover, the rest of Alpha pushed the truck until it started. They then mounted up and sped north whilst being targeted by gunmen but managed to reach a point of safety north of the town. They de-bussed and took up defensive positions whilst the sitrep was phoned in to the Ops Room back at Abu Naji.|$|E
2500|$|Other critics {{expressed}} {{more negative}} {{opinions of the}} game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay. Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it. Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes. Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed. Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go {{was not a good}} game, it was [...] "a great experience". The server problems also received negative press. Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game's strong social appeal and visual design, the game's [...] "initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems. Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the [...] "three-step glitch", reviewers also gave this bug negative press. Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, [...] "the three step glitch adds to what has been a terrible launch for Pokémon Go". Paul Tassi (Forbes) said that due to this bug it's [...] "anyone's best <b>guess</b> <b>where</b> Pokémon are 99% of the time" [...] and that it [...] "renders almost all traditional methods of tracking pointless". Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players. Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms. However, the developers {{have come up with a}} solution on solving the problems rural players face daily.|$|E
