5|$|Conall Cernach {{had sworn}} that if Cú Chulainn died before {{him he would}} avenge him before sunset, and when he hears Cú Chulainn is dead he pursues Lugaid. As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with one hand tucked into <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> but he only beats him after his horse takes {{a bite out of}} Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.|$|E

50|$|On December 19, 2014 Stevenson defended <b>his</b> <b>belts</b> against Russian {{contender}} Dmitry Sukhotsky (22-2, 16 KOs) in Quebec City, Quebec. This was {{his fourth}} {{defense of his}} titles. Stevenson retained <b>his</b> <b>belts</b> via a fifth round stoppage following a one punch knockout. Stevenson was in control from the opening bell, throwing minimal punches as the crowd started to boo. In round 2, he managed to floor Sukhotsky with a left hand.|$|R

5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period {{and there are many}} peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils hanging on <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a hanging tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E
5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads hanging from <b>his</b> <b>belt.</b> In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E

50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that Dean Lister received <b>his</b> black <b>belt</b> from Santos, since Santos was Lister's jiu-jitsu instructor up to brown belt. However, it was Santos's student Jeffrey Higgs who actually awarded Lister <b>his</b> black <b>belt.</b>|$|R
5|$|On the 1921 Ashes tour, Macartney—who {{needed a}} special medical {{clearance}} before being selected— {{had a chance}} to rectify his poor batting performances of his pre-war tours of England. In his first match, against Leicestershire, he started strongly with 177. his fast scoring helped Australia complete an innings victory in just over half the allotted playing time. He scored 87 against Surrey, 51 against Combined Services and 77 against Oxford University in the next seven matches leading up {{to the start of the}} Tests, with a total of 539 runs at 53.90 under <b>his</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{central focus}} of this PPV event was the tournament itself. Wrestlers gained entry into the tournament by {{participating}} in qualifying matches on WWF television programs, and the second, third and fourth rounds of the tournament were televised on the King of the Ring PPV broadcast. Bret Hart won the tournament by defeating Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, and Bam Bam Bigelow. He was attacked by Jerry Lawler during a coronation ceremony, {{which led to a}} feud that lasted more than two years. In addition to the tournament, the event featured Yokozuna defeating Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship as well as Shawn Michaels retaining <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> in a match against Crush for the WWF Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Dyer's final {{fight in}} Australia was a {{challenge}} for the Australian Welterweight title, held by Melbourne fighter Fred Kay. Due {{to the fact that}} Dyer had been a resident in Australia for over a year he was now allowed to challenge for the Australian belts. The fight was held on 6 November 1915 and was scheduled for 20 rounds. Initially it appeared that Dyer would win the title comfortably, out-scoring the champion for most of the early rounds. Dyer then connected cleanly with Kay's nose {{at the start of the}} eighth, putting Kay down for a count of eight. When Kay rose he was bloodied and spent much of the round in defence, but by the ninth Kay had recovered and was now the aggressor. In the eleventh round Kay caught Dyer with a powerful body shot that put him down for the count. Dyer's corner called a foul blow, but the ring doctor could find no evidence and Kay retained <b>his</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2006, Helms {{suffered}} a broken nose. After complaining to Long {{about having to}} wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown!, Long told Helms {{that he did not}} have to defend his title, but put Helms in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion, Chris Benoit. During the match, Helms attempted to leave, but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw Helms back into the ring, resulting in Helms losing the match. Helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks. During this time SmackDown! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury. Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy, London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match. Helms continued to defend <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> during pay-per-views, but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown!s sister show, Velocity.|$|E
5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Judgment Day on the Raw brand was between John Cena and The Great Khali, {{with the two}} battling over the WWE Championship. The rivalry started on the April 30, 2007, episode of Raw during a non-title match between John Cena and Shawn Michaels when Michaels was {{attacked}} from behind by The Great Khali. Edge and Randy Orton were also knocked out by Khali. The Great Khali then performed a Khali Bomb on Cena. The next week on Raw, Khali defeated Shawn Michaels in a number one contenders match by knockout after executing the Khali Bomb on Michaels through the announce table. Later that night, Khali stole Cena's WWE title belt. On the May 14 episode of Raw, when Cena attempted to take <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> back, Khali attacked him.|$|E

5|$|Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch {{organized}} {{an ambitious}} assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical {{support from the}} queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached {{the southern end of}} Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into <b>his</b> <b>belt,</b> placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
5|$|In 1603, {{he painted}} a double {{portrait}}, {{now in the}} Metropolitan Museum, New York, of the prince and his boyhood friend John Harington, son of Lord Harington of Exton (see above). The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. The action is natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry draws his sword to deliver the coup de grâce. The prince wears at <b>his</b> <b>belt</b> a jewel of St George slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service.• Strong English Icon, 234. The stag is a fallow deer, a non-native species kept {{at that time in}} royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the Royal Collection, painted c. 1605, features Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.|$|E
