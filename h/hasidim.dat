5|$|In February 2007, {{thirty five}} Knesset members (MKs) {{wrote to the}} army asking them to open Joseph's Tomb to Jewish {{visitors}} for prayer. In May 2007, Breslov <b>hasidim</b> visited {{the site for the}} first time in two years and later on that year, a group of <b>hasidim</b> found that the gravesite had been cleaned up by the Palestinians. In the past few years the site had suffered from neglect and its appearance had deteriorated, with garbage being dumped and tires being burned there.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of <b>Hasidim</b> who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The <b>Hasidim</b> claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, David Sasson {{immigrated to}} Bombay and {{established}} himself as a magistrate of the cotton industry. He built the Magen David Synagogue in Kolkata in 1861; this was in addition to the older Magen <b>Hasidim</b> synagogue. His son, Abdulla Sassoon, transformed the weaving industry in Bombay. To cater to the increasing need of the Baghdadi Jews, Knesset Eliyahoo synagogue was constructed on a premium piece of land in the hub of Bombay's commercial area by Jacob Sassoon, grandson of David Sassoon, commemorating his father, Eliyahoo Sassoon. It was established in 1884.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to the tomb. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov <b>hasidim</b> and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. Eventually Joseph’s tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to the tomb.|$|E
25|$|All Lubavitcher <b>Hasidim</b> {{and some}} Belzer <b>Hasidim</b> (especially outside Israel) do not {{sleep in the}} sukkah due to its {{intrinsic}} holiness. Though the halakha doesn't obligate one to eat or sleep in the sukkah if it is raining, Lubavitcher <b>Hasidim</b> will still eat there.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{tensions}} arose between Chabad and Satmar Chasidim as {{the result}} of several assaults on Chabad <b>hasidim</b> by Satmar <b>hasidim.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most married male Lubavitcher <b>Hasidim</b> also don frock coats on Shabbat. All <b>Hasidim</b> also wear a gartel (belt) {{over their}} outer coats during prayer services.|$|E
25|$|In 1798-1799 he {{traveled}} to Palestine, where he was received with honor by the <b>Hasidim</b> living in Haifa, Tiberias, and Safed. In Tiberias, his influence brought about a reconciliation between the Lithuanian and Volhynian <b>Hasidim.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to those books which are revered by all Hasidic Jews, the Toldos Aharon <b>Hasidim</b> particularly revere the books, Shomer Emunim, Shulchan HaTahor, and Taharas HaKodesh, by Rebbe Aharon Roth, and Divrei Emunoh by Rebbe Avrohom Yitzchok Kahn. The version of the prayer book used by Toldos Aharon <b>Hasidim</b> is called Brucheh i'Tehilleh. The Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok <b>Hasidim</b> have published a weekday prayer book called, Tehillas Avrohom Yitzchok, but also use the Brucheh i'Tehilleh version as well.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other {{distinct}} items of clothing. Such are the Gerrer hoyznzokn—long black socks into which the trousers are tucked. Some <b>Hasidim</b> from Eastern Galicia wear black socks with their breeches on the Sabbath, as opposed to white ones on weekdays, particularly Belzer <b>Hasidim.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hanukkah lights should usually burn for {{at least}} half an hour after it gets dark. The custom of many is to light at sundown, {{although}} most <b>Hasidim</b> light later. Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle {{by the presence of}} their <b>Hasidim</b> when they kindle the lights.|$|E
25|$|This annual pilgrimage, {{called the}} Rosh Hashana kibbutz, drew {{thousands}} of <b>Hasidim</b> {{from all over}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and even Poland until 1917, when the Bolshevik Revolution forced it to continue clandestinely. Only {{a dozen or so}} <b>Hasidim</b> risked making the annual pilgrimage during the Communist era, as the authorities regularly raided the gathering and often arrested and imprisoned worshippers. Beginning in the mid-1960s, <b>Hasidim</b> who lived outside Russia began to sneak into Uman to pray at Rebbe Nachman's grave during the year. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the gates were reopened entirely. In 2008, approximately 25,000 {{people from all over the}} world participated in this annual pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to the untiring {{efforts and}} cash inflow from Belzer <b>Hasidim</b> abroad, the Rebbe and Rabbi Mordechai {{managed to stay}} {{one step ahead of}} the Nazis in one miraculous escape attempt after another. Together with two <b>Hasidim,</b> they were {{spirited}} into Wiśnicz, then the Bochnia Ghetto, then the Kraków Ghetto, and then back into Bochnia, narrowly avoiding Gestapo roundups and deportations.|$|E
25|$|When his grandfather, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir, died in 1866, {{many of the}} Gerrer <b>Hasidim</b> {{sought to}} bestow the mantle of {{leadership}} upon eighteen-year-old Yehudah Aryeh Leib. He refused that position, and leadership went to Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin of Aleksandrów Łódzki. However, {{after the death of}} the latter in 1870, the <b>Hasidim</b> succeeded in gaining Yehudah Aryeh Leib's assent to become their Rebbe.|$|E
25|$|Chanukah – It is {{the custom}} of Chabad <b>Hasidim</b> to place the Chanukah menorah against the room's doorpost (and not on the windowsill).|$|E
25|$|Funds {{for this}} ambitious project were raised among Belzer <b>Hasidim,</b> and were {{supplemented}} by various fund-raising projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Although all Haredim and <b>Hasidim</b> stress fealty to {{established}} traditions, for Skverer Hasidism, it is stressed exceedingly, {{and is a}} cornerstone of their philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Some Chabad <b>Hasidim</b> {{took their}} {{message to the}} streets with billboards declaring {{that it was time}} for the Messiah to come and bring the redemption.|$|E
25|$|Grand Rabbi Duvid Twersky of Skver — present Rebbe of New Square and Grand Rabbi of the Skverer <b>Hasidim</b> worldwide; son of Rebbe Yaakov Yosef.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>Hasidim</b> wear long coats called rekelekh {{during the}} week, {{which are often}} mistaken for frock coats but are really very long suit jackets. On Shabbat, <b>Hasidim</b> wear bekishes, which are usually silk or {{polyester}} {{as opposed to the}} woollen frock coat. The bekishe and the rekel both lack the waist seam construction of the frock coat. Additionally, bekishes can be distinguished from frock coats by the additional two buttons on front and a lack of a slit in the back.|$|E
25|$|Various {{symbolic}} and religious qualities {{are attributed to}} Hasidic dress, though they are mainly apocryphal and the clothes' origin is cultural and historical. For example, the long overcoats are considered modest, the Shtreimel is supposedly related to shaatnez and keeps one warm without using wool, and Sabbath shoes are laceless {{in order not to}} have to tie a knot, a prohibited action. A gartel divides the Hasid's lower parts from his upper parts, implying modesty and chastity, and for kabbalistic reasons, <b>Hasidim</b> button their clothes right over left. <b>Hasidim</b> customarily wear black hats during the weekdays, as do nearly all Haredim today. A variety of hats are worn depending on the group: Chabad often pinch their hats to form a triangle on the top, Satmar wear an open-crown hat with rounded edges, and Samet (velvet) or biber (beaver) hats are worn by many Galician and Hungarian <b>Hasidim.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hasidim</b> use the Ashkenazi {{pronunciation}} of Hebrew and Aramaic for liturgical purposes, reflecting their Eastern European background. Wordless, emotional melodies, nigunim, {{are particularly}} common in their services.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s <b>Hasidim</b> became more vocal about Schneerson being the Moshiach, even {{submitting}} {{a petition to}} him asking that he reveal himself as the long-awaited messiah.|$|E
25|$|Ohr ha-Chaim ("the {{light of}} life"), by Rabbi Haim Ben-Attar. (Traditionally studied on Friday nights (on {{the eve of}} the Sabbath). The book is {{especially}} treasured by Skverer <b>Hasidim.</b>|$|E
25|$|The most {{explosive}} growth was experienced in Chabad-Lubavitch, whose head Menachem Mendel Schneerson adopted a modern (he and his disciples ceased wearing the customary Shtreimel) and outreach-centered orientation. At {{a time when}} most Orthodox and <b>Hasidim</b> in particular rejected proselytization, he turned his sect into a mechanism devoted almost solely to it, blurring the difference between actual <b>Hasidim</b> and loosely affiliated supporters until researchers could scarcely define it as a regular Hasidic group. Another phenomenon was the revival of Breslov, which remained without an acting Tzaddiq since the rebellious Rebbe Nachman's 1810 death. Its complex, existentialist philosophy drew many to it.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>Hasidim</b> {{use some}} {{variation}} of Nusach Sefard, {{a blend of}} Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies, based on the innovations of Rabbi Isaac Luria. Many dynasties have their own specific adaptation of Nusach Sefard; some, such as the versions of the Belzer, Bobover, and Dushinsky <b>Hasidim,</b> are closer to Nusach Ashkenaz, while others, such as the Munkacz version, are closer to the old Lurianic. Many sects believe that their version reflects Luria's mystical devotions best. The Baal Shem Tov added two segments to Friday services {{on the eve of}} Sabbath: Psalm 107 before afternoon prayer, and Psalm 23 at the end of evening service.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{population}} growth in New Square, the Skver <b>Hasidim</b> had plans to expand to a new village named Kiryas Square {{in the town of}} Spring Glen, New York but plans were later canceled.|$|E
25|$|Nusach Ari means, in {{a general}} sense, any prayer rite {{following}} the usages of Rabbi Isaac Luria, the AriZal, in the 16th century, and, more particularly, the derivative version of it used by Chabad <b>Hasidim.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Shomer Emunim {{group is}} more {{moderate}} than the Toldos Aharon - Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok group, and is informally affiliated with Agudath Israel. The Rebbe himself does not vote, but he encourages his <b>Hasidim</b> to vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} weathered {{strong opposition}} from virtually all other Hasidic movements in Ukraine throughout the 19th century, {{yet at the}} same time experienced growth in numbers of followers from Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. By World War I, thousands of Breslov <b>Hasidim</b> were located in those places. After the Bolshevik Revolution, Communist oppression forced the movement underground in Russia. Thousands of <b>Hasidim</b> were imprisoned or murdered during the Great Purge of the 1930s, and killed by Nazis who invaded Ukraine in 1941. The movement was regenerated in the United Kingdom, United States, and Israel by those who escaped, with large numbers of Yemenite Jews and other Mizrahim joining the sect.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} learned {{scholars}} of the generation were <b>Hasidim</b> of Belz, such as Rabbi Sholom Mordechai Schwadron (Maharsham) and Rabbi Chanoch Dov Padwa (Cheishev Ho'ephod), who {{was very close to}} Rebbe Aharon of Belz.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Buber {{became the}} editor of the weekly Die Welt, the central organ of the Zionist movement. However, a year later he became {{involved}} with the Jewish <b>Hasidim</b> movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture. In stark contrast to the busy Zionist organizations, which were always mulling political concerns, the <b>Hasidim</b> were focused on the values which Buber had long advocated for Zionism to adopt. In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work, and devoted himself to study and writing. In that year, he published his thesis, Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems, on Jakob Böhme and Nikolaus Cusanus.|$|E
25|$|Nusach Maharitz, {{referring}} to and originating with Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Dushinsky, is the nusach used by most Dushinsky <b>Hasidim.</b> Their nusach {{is a mixture}} of nusach Ashkenaz and nusach Sefard, incorporating elements from both almost equally.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Rebbe of the {{worldwide}} movement of Lubavticher or Chabad Hasidism, was avidly opposed to evolution, and his following remains largely committed to that position, though individual Chabad <b>Hasidim</b> may hold different views.|$|E
25|$|The main Hasidic texts revered {{and studied}} by Breslover <b>Hasidim</b> are those written by Rebbe Nachman and Reb Noson. All of Rebbe Nachman's teachings were {{transcribed}} by Reb Noson. Additionally, Reb Noson wrote {{some of his}} own works.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, New York City {{required}} those performing metzitzah b'peh, {{a part of}} circumcision {{required by}} some <b>Hasidim,</b> to obey stringent consent requirements, including documentation. Agudath Israel of America and other Jewish groups have planned to sue the city in response.|$|E
