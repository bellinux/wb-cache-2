40|$|The basic {{principle}} of PES {{is to pay}} individuals or groups to protect or enhance natural resources in exchange for financial or in-kind compensation. One striking feature of the PES concept is the diversity of “PES-like” schemes in the real world, which differ greatly from the theoretical conceptualization of PES. We assume that {{the wide range of}} designs and outcomes is due to the use of PES tools in particular environmental, political, and economic contexts. More precisely, existing conservation strategies is a determining factor in shaping the PSE-inspired interventions. Here, we analyze the implementation of an internationally-designed <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> program in Madagascar. We show that the predominance of a coercive logic in the Malagasy conservation strategy determines the conditions under which the <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> is implemented. The <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> is intended to be a complementary device for protected area rather than an instrument for land-use change, thus producing initiatives closer to ICDP than PES.

40|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> lie with the Disabled People’s {{movement}} and the revolutionary idea of providing disabled people with cash to pay directly for their assessed care and support needs. Authorisation was given in 1997 to local authorities in England to offer cash payments to purchase care and support services through the implementation of The Community Care 1996 (<b>Direct</b> <b>Payments)</b> Act. This <b>scheme</b> was initially restricted to those aged {{between the ages of}} 18 - 65 years. However since February 2000 (July 2000 in Scotland) this has been extended to include disabled people aged 65 and over, and further expanded in 2001 to include young disabled people between the ages of 16 and 18 years. Prior to the implementation of the Community Care Act, procedures following a community care assessment placed the local authority in complete control regarding arranging and coordinating an individual’s care package. The local authority arranged when and where services were provided, and who would provide them. The <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> <b>scheme</b> could offer an alternative, more flexible approach, with the potential to empower individuals choosing to opt into this scheme. Individuals in receipt of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> have control in making arrangements for the provision of services that work with their lifestyle as opposed to their lifestyle ‘fitting around’ local authority organised care and support services. <b>Direct</b> <b>payments</b> position the individual at the centre of control for their own service provision. Initially, <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> as a <b>scheme</b> was relaxed and local authorities were not obliged to offer <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> as an alternative to everyone. However, since April 2003 (June 2003 in Scotland), local authorities are now obliged to offer <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> to all those eligible. Key criteria for eligibility to opt into this <b>scheme</b> are that <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in the form of cash can only be offered to those deemed able to consent and manage the <b>direct</b> <b>payment,</b> either alone or with support...|$|R

30|$|The main aim of {{the first}} pillar through the <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> is to {{guarantee}} farmers more stable incomes, by providing remuneration related to the land area managed through farming practices; it is thus an area-based mechanism.

This article analyzes whether {{the reform of}} the SPS will decrease the concentration of direct payments and evaluates {{the effect of the}} new <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> on the redistribution of farm incomes. The decomposition of the Gini coefficient allows analysis of the evolution of farm income and direct payment distributions in Italy from 2014 to 2020, and empirical results based on the Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network show that the CAP 2013 reform is expected to decrease the concentration of direct payments. However, the reform is also expected to limit the reduction in farm income inequality due to the adoption of a partial convergence model (the so-called “tunnel” model) instead of a total convergence model as well as, more generally, the increasing share of farm income that is dependent on increased market exposure, leading to higher risks of price volatility and increasing pressure on income.|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme,</b> accounting for 30 per cent of national ceilings. To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be decoupled income support under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} H 1 (the {{application}} of CAP 2013 reform in Italy causes {{a decrease in}} the unequal concentration of DPs), the decomposition of G shows that the new <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> in Italy decreases the concentration of DPs and leads to a more equal redistribution of DPs in 2019 (although this effect is still not evident in 2015). In particular, this effect is due to the implementation of the tunnel model for internal convergence, which bridges the gap in the value of entitlements across Italian farms and makes them progressively less dependent on the rank of farm income. According to Severini and Tantari (2013 b), any change in the distribution of DPs among farms could bring about a change in farm income concentration. This situation clearly holds for area redistribution and coupled payments generated by shifting from the individual farm-based (i.e., historical) model to the national flat rate model of direct aid implementation. It follows that the flat rate allows a redistribution of DPs that indeed penalizes sectors that have a high farm income but are largely dependent on DPs (a high DP/FI ratio), whereas it increases the share of direct aid for sectors that traditionally do not benefit from such support (vineyards, fruits, and vegetables) and for low-income sectors that are located in disadvantaged areas (livestock and grazing).|$|E

40|$|On the {{background}} of extensive government interventions in grain markets and the <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> of subsidy policies, the subsidy policies may hardly show negative impacts on grain prices through increasing grain supply.

The estimated {{results indicate that the}} subsidy variable is highly significant in the grain price model for each grain type, while the general impacts of subsidies are positive. This suggests that agricultural subsidy policies contribute to increases in market prices for grain. Statistically, the overall elasticities of subsidies to the prices of rice, wheat, and corn are 0. 077, 0. 094, and 0. 180, respectively.

30|$|However, {{the main}} focus of this paper was the redistributive effect of the new <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> {{introduced}} by the CAP 2013 reform that replaced the former SPS in Italy, where approximately 90 % of the national ceiling was devoted to the BPS and the GR. Both static and dynamic analyses highlighted an expected decrease in the concentration of direct payments by 2019 because Italy will progressively shift from the “historical” regional model to a tunnel model for internal convergence during the transitional 2015 – 2020 period. Conversely, the decrease in the DP/FI ratio between 2014 and 2019 due to both policy changes and exogenous factors is expected to negatively affect the ability of these payments to oppose the regressive effect of MIs, particularly for regions and sectors that mainly benefitted from the SPS introduced by CAP 2003 reform. In more detail, the results indirectly highlight that the more farm income is affected by changing market conditions (increasingly influenced by price volatility) related to output composition (consumption, investment, government expenditure, and gross exports and imports), the more unequally it is distributed. This phenomenon is affected by any increase (decrease) in the budget for DPs, which could improve (worsen) the stabilization and redistribution of farm income and reduce (increase) its concentration since such aid tends to equalize farm income.|$|E
40|$|Doutoramento em Gestão Interdisciplinar da Paisagem - Instituto Superior de Agronomia - UL / Instituto de Investigação e Formação Avançada - Universidade de Évora / Universidade dos AçoresIn recent years, High Nature Value (HNV) {{farmland}} {{became a}} priority for biodiversity conservation in Europe. Covering about 1 / 3 of total agricultural area in Europe, HNV farmland is in decline mainly because of agriculture abandonment/intensification driven by markets and public policies. HNV farmland is mostly provided by low-intensity and traditional farming systems, largely on less productive areas. Given the multiple environmental public goods provided by HNV farming systems, agri-environment schemes were set under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to maintain HNV farmland, although with mixed results. Recent policy changes, including the decoupling of direct payments during the 2003 CAP reform, led to changes in farming systems which often further undermined HNV farmland sustainability. This research aims at evaluating the resilience of HNV farmland under policy change based on a farming systems approach, seeking to contribute to improving the design of agri-environment policies. Focusing on HNV farmland in southern Portugal, we used farm level data from the Integrated Administration and Control System and the Land Parcel Identification System provided by the national CAP paying agency for the years 2000 to 2010, complemented with farm survey data, to derive a farming systems typology which was used to 1) assess agricultural changes over this time period, related with changes in the policy framework (e. g. 2003 CAP reform); 2) assess {{the extent to which}} this approach enables the identification of HNV farming systems, based on landscape features and farming practices, and; 3) model the choice of farming system based on farms’ biophysical and structural features and on economic and policy variables, to assess scenarios of market and policy change and derive a supply curve for biodiversity conservation services. The farming systems approach proved to be a relatively simple way to identify HNV farming systems and a promising tool to improve the cost-effectiveness EU agri-environment policy, suggesting the feasibility and benefits of a CAP <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> aimed at HNV farming systems.

Falconer suggests the reduction o f OTDS by 75 or 85 % applicable to the EU. If the parties agree on the lower value o f the reduction, this part o f the deal will not require much effort from the EU to adapt the reformed CAP to the new WTO rules. The <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> introduced by the 2003 reform, classified to the “green box”, will not be concerned by the cuts. Equally, the new de minimis threshold is completely acceptable for the UE. On the contrary, the area o f negotiations concerning market access is much more demanding from the European point o f view. The current proposal on the tariff cuts goes far beyond the last official offer made by the EU in October 2005. At the same time, the future o f the safeguard clause is uncertain and the number o f sensitive products highly unsatisfactory. Provided that the agreement is concluded in its present form, a sharp increase o f import may occur. This in consequence will heavily affect the balance o f the European agricultural markets. As a result, the cuts o f internal prices, especially for sugar and dairy products will be necessary. Similarly, the decision concerning the elimination o f the export subsidies until 2013 will make the European exports hardly profitable, while benefits generated from regulating other export practices do not seem to balance o ff the efforts.

40|$|The {{progressive}} attempt {{and implementation}} of <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> limitations since the 1992 CAP reform has developed a “modulation mechanism” aiming to transfer funds from market support and <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> (CAP first pillar) towards rural development measures (CAP second pillar). Under the 2007 - 2013 European financial perspectives, the annual 5 % rate of modulation is expected to increase. The paper focuses on the financial impacts of four scenarios together with corresponding political and institutional feasibilities. The paper imposes on itself three sound constraints: (i) expanding modulation should not jeopardise the future in-depth reform of the <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> regime, (ii) modulation should be compulsory and consistent with rural development financial needs, and (iii) present <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> per farm should not be capped or subject to complex and differentiated reduction rates. Then, the paper suggests adopting a dynamic and uniform modulation rate to be increased by 1 percent per year from 2009 and then by 2 percent during the final step reaching 10 percent in 2012 (2013 financial year). It would deliver certainty to farmers and contribute to an efficient use in European spending, with {{no need for a}} controversial equity instrument. <b>Direct</b> <b>payment</b> reductions raise subsidiarity and budgetary issues which should be discussed within the European budget review.

There are concerns that a complete conversion into a single decoupled <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> could lead to land abandonment in traditional olive-growing areas, so partial decoupling, with 60 % of payments to be decoupled and incorporated into the single farm <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> is proposed. 40 % of payments are to remain within national envelopes, nominally not linked to production but linked {{to the maintenance of}} olive groves, the soil and the environment. Full details of the reform proposals and their likely impact {{can be found in the}} Commission communication to the Council and European Parliament (COM (2003) 544 final). It is anticipated that adhesion to the single farm <b>payment</b> <b>scheme</b> will result in more stable incomes for olive-oil producers, due to the greater efficiency of <b>direct</b> aid <b>payment</b> <b>schemes</b> in getting money into farmers pockets. A communication containing proposals for reform of the EU olive-oil [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} divided into four parts. The first gives a brief {{description}} of base area and set-aside provisions in the EU’s <b>direct</b> area <b>payments</b> <b>scheme,</b> and examines {{the extent to which they}} are binding. The second part analyses the degree of effective decoupling of the scheme. Particular attention is paid to the impact of base area and set-aside constraints on the degree of decoupling. In the context of total decoupling, the third part looks at the impact of the EU system of <b>direct</b> area <b>payments,</b> in particular base area and set-aside provisions, on the variability of world prices. The final part sets out the conclusions. It endeavours, on the basis of the specific findings reported here, to gain broader insight into the impact of quantitative constraints on the degree of decoupling of support measures to agricultural producers. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} proposes {{to give a}} general view {{on the role of}} <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> from a Romanian perspective. According to the three scaled time {{spectrum}} – “past, present and future” - referred to in the title, the first section contains an overview on <b>direct</b> <b>payment</b> models implemented under the Common Agricultural Policy in a European context, followed by implementation aspects of the Single Area <b>Payment</b> <b>Scheme</b> in Romania, in year 2007. Current situation of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in Romania are depicted in the following section – representing the “present” of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> in the country. The final part of the study outlines some aspects establishing the importance of the “survivorship” of <b>direct</b> <b>payments</b> of the CAP post 2013 debates - from a Romanian point of view. <b>direct</b> <b>payments,</b> farm structure, Single Area <b>Payment</b> <b>Scheme,</b> Romania...|$|R
