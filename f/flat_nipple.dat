40|$|Abstract Background This study aims {{to examine}} whether {{specific}} maternal breast variations (such as <b>flat</b> <b>nipple,</b> inverted nipple, large breast or/and large nipple) are barriers for weight gain in breastfed infants during the first seven days of life. Methods In this prospective cohort study, 100 healthy term neonates were followed from birth to day seven in two groups; Group A: fifty neonates born to mothers with specified breast variations and Group B: fifty neonates born to mothers without such breast variations ("normal breasts"). All neonates were the first child of their families {{and there was no}} sex ratio difference between the two groups. Neonates' weight at birth and day seven were measured and the mean weight differences in the two groups were compared using paired t-test. Results Neonates born to mothers without the specified breast variations had a mean weight gain of (+) 53 ± 154. 4 g at day seven., Not only there was no increase in the mean weight of neonates in the other group, but they had a mean decrease of weight of (-) 162 ± 125. 5 g by the seventh day of their life compared to birth weight. Thus, neonates born to mothers without breast variations had significantly greater weight gain than neonates born to the mothers with the specified variations (p Conclusion Breast variation among first-time mothers acts as an important barrier to weight gain among breastfed neonates {{in the early days of}} life. Health professionals need skills in the management of breastfeeding among mothers with the specified breast variations, so that mothers are given appropriate advice on how to breastfeed and overcome these problems. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} breast and nipple abnormalities among primigravid women and their effects on lactation in Sri Lanka. Design Prospective descriptive survey. Method All primigravid women attending antenatal clinics of the university obstetric unit, giving informed consent, were recruited into the study. Their breasts were examined clinically and breast abnormalities noted. They were followed up until successful lactation was established. Results 956 mothers were examined. 768 had normal breasts and 188 abnormalities were noted. 725 completed the study. 72. 5 % established successful lactation. 80 had <b>flat</b> <b>nipples</b> of whom 52 completed the study. 44 <b>flat</b> <b>nipples</b> were corrected antenatally with exercises. All established lactation successfully. Other abnormalities included breast surgery, hypoplastic breasts or breast asymmetry. 9. 8 % of women with breast/nipple abnormalities failed to establish lactation. Conclusion Large majority (84. 6 %) of <b>flat</b> non protractile <b>nipples</b> are correctable with antenatal exercises...|$|R

50|$|If {{the shell}} {{is used to}} help ready the mother for breastfeeding, this is best done during {{pregnancy}} because the shell can increase leaking of breast milk or colostrum. On the other hand, some wear breast shells to collect leaking milk while nursing the baby on the other breast. If worn to correct inverted or <b>flat</b> <b>nipples,</b> the shells are typically worn during the third trimester for up to 10 hours daily as the mother's comfort dictates.|$|R

40|$|A {{nipple shield}} is a {{breastfeeding}} aid with a nipple-shaped shield that is positioned over the nipple and areola prior to nursing. Nipple shields are usually recommended to mothers with <b>flat</b> <b>nipples</b> or in {{cases in which}} there is a failure of the baby to effectively latch onto the breast within the first two days postpartum. The use of nipple shields is a controversial topic in the field of lactation. Its use has been an issue in the clinical literature since some older studies discovered reduced breast milk transfer when using nipple shields, while more recent studies reported successful breastfeeding outcomes. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence and outcomes with nipple shield use. Methods: A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, OLDMEDLINE, EMBASE Classic, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINAHL. The primary endpoint was any breastfeeding outcome following nipple shield use. Secondary endpoints included the reasons for nipple shield use and the average/median length of use. For the analysis, we examined the effect of nipple shield use on physiological responses, premature infants, mothers’ experiences, and health professionals’ experiences. Results: The literature search yielded 261 articles, 14 of which were included in this review. Of these 14 articles, three reported on physiological responses, two reported on premature infants, eight reported on mothers’ experiences, and one reported on health professionals’ experiences. Conclusion: Through examining the use of nipple shields, further insight is provided on the advantages and disadvantages of this practice, thus allowing clinicians and researchers to address improvements on areas that will benefit mothers and infants the most...|$|R
50|$|The area of {{the nipple}} around which the spoke wrench, or key, is fitted in use is square in cross-section. Spoke keys may be 3- or 4-sided; the latter type has a small cutout to enable it to be fitted over a spoke, after which it may be slid along to engage all four <b>flats</b> of the <b>nipple.</b> It {{is less likely to}} round off the nipple than the 3-sided type, but is slower to use.|$|R
50|$|Breast shells are hollow, {{lightweight}} plastic disks worn {{inside the}} brassiere to help correct <b>flat</b> or inverted <b>nipples</b> either {{in preparation for}} or during breastfeeding. Also known as milk cups, breast cups, breast shields, or Woolwich shields, {{they can also be}} used to ease sensitive nipples or collect milk when the baby has not finished the teat. Breast shells function by applying gentle but firm pressure to the region surrounding the nipple to stretch underlying adhesions and draw out the nipple. Nipple shields may be confused with breast shells, but shields are intended for use during the act of breastfeeding, whereas breast shells are worn in preparation for or after breastfeeding.|$|R
40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine problems in lactation and risk factors affecting breastfeeding. Material and Method: This descriptive {{study was conducted}} with mothers who had children aged 24 - 60 months and who presented for any reason to Family Healthcare Centers of two Public Healthcare Centers in Kayseri province. The study was performed with 500 mothers who gave a verbal consent and a questionnaire was used to collect data. Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine Clinical Research Ethics Committee (2011 / 20) the approval and verbal consent was obtained from the mothers. Results: The mean age of the mothers was 29. 8 ± 5. 3 years, while {{the mean age of the}} children was 35. 7 ± 10. 0 months. 38, 6 % of the children were born by cesarean section, 8. 8 % had low birth weight and their mean breastfeeding period was 17. 7 ± 8. 0 months. The main breastfeeding problems included painful and cracked nipples (46. 0 %), inadequate lactating (34. 2 %), excessive lactating (29. 8 %), <b>flat</b> or inverted <b>nipples</b> (11. 6 %), mastitis (9. 2 %), extreme-fullness of the breast (9. 0 %) and plugged milk ducts (8. 2 %). Being housewife, moderate and low income status, caesarean delivery, low birth weight and less than 8 lactations a day were the risk factors for inadequate lactating. A maternal age younger than 25 years old, caesarean delivery, premature delivery, less than 8 lactations a day were the risk factors for painful or cracked nipples. The median exclusive breastfeeding duration and total lactation time of the mothers who had concerns about inadequate lactating were significantly lower than the others. The total lactation time of the mothers who had <b>flat</b> and inverted <b>nipples</b> was also shorter. Conclusions: Lactation problems are observed with a high rate. Awareness of the healthcare professionals and supports given by them may reduce these problems. (Turk Arch Ped 2013; 48 : 145 - 51...|$|R
40|$|Breastfeeding is irreplaceable mode of child's nutrition. Its {{importance}} is proved {{in general and}} its irreplaceability as well. Profit of breastfeeding goes to {{a mother and a}} child too. During the proces of breastfeeding women may face different breast problems. The task for the competent healthcare staff is to propose suitable solution and enable them to continue breastfeeding in full. The qualified person is midwife and child ward nurse as well. The Thesis deals with a role of the above mentioned staff considering breastfeeding and solving breast problems. The Thesis consist of two parts, a theoretical and a practical ones. The theoretical part is divided into three main chapters. The first one named Breastfeeding focuses on introduction in a set area. Given knowledge is necessary for enhancing breastfeeding and solving its problems. The second chapter deals with single difficulties with breast and their solving. The third one describes midwives' profession and its role in a field of breastfeeding. The practical hal fis devoted to women with breast difficulties during childbed and also to midwives and pediatric nurses, who are in charge during such women hospitalization. For given research we set three aims. The first is to chart the situation, prevaling issues with breast while breastfeeding. The second is to find out the amount of stress put to prevent breast' problems in this period from the childbed women point of view. The last one is to trace the solving of such problems in County Hospital Jindřichův Hradec and Regional Hospital České Budějovice. The quality research was chosen with means of self made partly structured dialogue. People to respond were deliberately chosen. One set consisted of ten nurses from childbed ward, who are responsible of solving breast problems during mothers' hospital stay. There were four pediatric nurses and one midwife from each hospital. České Budějovice hospital's nurses were from Physiological newborn ward and Jindřichův Hradec hospital's nurses were from Childbed ward. The mode of selection was influenced by tradition, that help with breastfeeding is given mainly by pediatric nurses only seldom by midwives. The other set was made of mothers, who experienced problems with breast during breastfeeding period. Five of them delivered their babies in České Budějovice's and five in Jindřichův Hradec's hospitals. Research survey has been taking place since February till April 2015. Data given went through qualitative analysis. On basis of given research guestions we came to conclusion that the main problem which troubles women in childbed were mastitis and wounded and <b>flat</b> <b>nipples.</b> Improvement of breast problem prevention should help in prenatal field. Within hospitalization pediatric nurses and midwives put a stress in prevention concerning only women chosen by them. Negative judgement on prevention of breast problems came from experienced women in childbed. It is important, that person concerned has an equivalent approach to all the women when it comes to prevention. Problems solving was mainly positively evaluated. Although they found very important besides given advices also the higher emphasis for psychice side of mather. The output of the Thesis was creation of a leaflet which deals with prevention and solution of breast problems. The leaflet might be obtained inantenatal care and gidance centers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Persistent nipple pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons given by mothers for ceasing {{exclusive}} breastfeeding. We aimed to determine the frequency of nipple pain as a reason for consultation, the most common attributed aetiologies, and the effectiveness of the advice and treatment given. Methods: All consultations at the Breast Feeding Centre of Western Australia (WA) were audited over two six-month periods in 2011 (n = 469) and 2014 (n = 708). Attributed cause(s) of nipple pain, microbiology results, treatment(s) advised, and resolution of pain were recorded. Results: Nipple pain was one of the reasons for consultation in 36 % of cases. The most common attributed cause of nipple pain was incorrect positioning and attachment, followed by tongue tie, infection, palatal anomaly, <b>flat</b> or inverted <b>nipples,</b> mastitis, and vasospasm. Advice included correction of positioning and attachment, use of a nipple shield, resting the nipples and expressing breastmilk, frenotomy, oral antibiotics, topical treatments, and cold or warm compresses. Pain was resolving or resolved in 57 % of cases after 18 days (range 2 – 110). Conclusion: The multiple attributed causes of nipple pain, possibly as a result of a cascade of events, suggests that effective early lactation management for prevention of nipple pain and early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial to avoid early weaning...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{staff with}} the {{information}} to assist a woman with <b>flat</b> or inverted <b>nipples</b> to breastfeed successfully. POSTNATAL MANAGEMENT OF NIPPLE VARIATION: 1. Keep mother and baby skin-to-skin {{for as long as}} is medically possible after birth. Teach the mother to watch her baby for early feeding cues, e. g., mouthing, hand to mouth, rapid eye movement. 2. If baby is unable to attach effectively, record on variance sheet ‘MR 261. 10 Flat or Inverted Nipples’. 3. Express the colostrum and feed the baby by cup or finger feeding. Regular expression 8 - 10 times (using hands, an electric pump or a combination of both) in 24 hours will be necessary to establish lactation. See Clinical Guidelines, Section B, 8. 3. 1). Ensure only a gentle even pressure is exerted on the breast tissue by the shield of the electric pump and ensure the correct size shield is used. Reassure the mother that with the onset of lactogenesis II she will start to obtain expressed milk. 4. Continue to offer breast regularly before expressing. 5. If the baby cannot attach to the breast and no colostrum can be expressed continue to offer skinto-skin contact. Use the double pump with Symphony and the correct sized shield. Note: Formula feeds may need to be medically ordered until lactation is established if no milk can be expressed. NIPPLE SHIELD USE � Once lactogenesis Stage II has occurred, a nipple shield may be effective in enabling breast attachment 1 - 3 � The Lactation Consultant or an experienced midwife should review feeding prior to using/introducing nipple shield. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} for retrograde transport of urine and thereby {{bacteria in the}} urinary svstem of diverted patients (device and urinary tract) were studied with roentgeno­logical technigue. Back-flow from the urinary collecting device into the conduit occurred in a fifth of those patients who had a <b>flat</b> stoma. A <b>nipple</b> stoma of at least 2 cm height resisted back-flow better than any flat stoma. Ureteral reflux occurred to approximately 30 % of the ureters, both in the supine and erect body positions. The intraluminal pressure in the conduit was "low" (^ 12 cm H 2 O) in approximately 30 % when reflux occurred. The autopsy study showed a higher frequency of renal infections in diverted patients than in non-diverted controls. 5 of 11 patients who died more than 2 months after diversion, and without cancer at autopsy, were attributed to death from renal infection. There was a relationship between urographical abnormalities, recognized as associated with pyelonephritis, and raised serum antibody titers against E. coli and/or P. mirabilis. Most of the ”not normal" renal units deteriorated after the diversion operation. The variable "kidney area" {{was found to be}} "small" in a higher frequency after a long postoperative period than after a short one. Raised -serum antibody titers occurred in 35 % of the patients and were correlated to growth of the corresponding bacteria (E. coli and P. mirabilisrespectively) in the conduit urine. The frequency of raised antibody titers increased with the time after the diversion operation. After treatment with antibiotics of patients with bacteriuria and raised serum antibody titers, the titers were within normal limits («£ 512), or decreased significantly, in 22 of 25 patients. Serum antibody titer determinations against E. coli and P. mirabilisare suggested as complement to urinary cultures in the follow-up of diverted patients. The residual urine volume in the conduit was shown to be of importance for bacteriuria and raised titer against P. mirabilis. Some measures, which possibly may reduce bacteriuria and thereby pyelonephritis, are suggested. A nipple stoma of at least 2 cm height ought to be constructed at the operation. To obtain a low residual urine volume the conduit should be short and unobstructed. The urinary collecting device should be emptied often and connected to a uribag during the night. Diss.
