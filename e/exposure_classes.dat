Investigation revealed that Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 is only suitable for the construction of superstructure members inside low humidity buildings (class XC 1) and is not suitable for the construction of buried building foundations and external building superstructure members.

An algorithm-derived local connected fractal dimension (LCFD) frequency measure {{was used in}} this comparative analysis. Canonical variates (CVA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to evaluate the discrimination power of the method among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> (unexposed, Cd exposed, TBA exposed). Misclassification, sensitivity and specificity, both with original and cross-validated cases, were determined. LCFDs frequencies enhanced the differences among classes which were visually selected after their means, respective variances and the differences between Cd and TBA exposed means, with respect to unexposed mean, were analyzed by scatter plots. Selected frequencies were then scanned by means of LDA, stepwise analysis, and Mahalanobis distance to detect the most discriminative frequencies out of ten originally selected. Discrimination resulted in 91. 7 % of cross-validated cases correctly classified (22 out of 24 total cases), with sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 95. 5 % (1 false negative with respect to 21 really positive cases) and 75 % (1 false positive with respect to 3 really negative cases). CVA with convex hull polygons ensured prompt, visually intuitive discrimination among <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> and graphically supported the false positive case. The combined use of semithin sections, which enhanced the visual evaluation of the overall lamellar structure; of LCFD analysis, which objectively detected local variation in complexity, without the possible bias connected to human personnel; and of CVA/LDA, could be an objective, sensitive and specific approach to study fish gill lamellar pathology.

40|$|The {{reinforced}} steel corrosion {{which is the}} most important problem of reinforced concrete structures durability is generally stipulated for carbonization of concrete surrounding it. Concrete cover calculation at the design stage is predicated one because of the differences in manufacturing conditions and use of constructions. The applying of the probabilistic approaches to the carbonation process modeling allows to get predicated grade of the depth of carbonization of concrete and, thus, to settle minimum concrete cover thickness for a given projected service life of a construction. The procedures for concrete mix design for different strength classes of concrete are described in the article. Current recommendations on assignment of concrete strength class as well as concrete cover are presented. The European Standard EN 206 : 2013 defines the content requirements for the concrete structures operated in the <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 1, including the minimum values of water-cement ratio, minimum cement content, and minimum strength class of concrete. Since the standard does not include any basis or explanations of the requirements, we made an effort to develop a scientific justification for the mentioned requirements. We developed the probabilistic models for the process of carbonation of concrete based on the concrete mix which was designed using the software VTK-Korroziya.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{durability and}} service life models for reinforced concrete structures {{with regard to}} chloride ingress, carbonation and frost attack. In the past years a number of models for durability design of concrete structures have been suggested by relevant organisations or international committees. It is necessary to validate these models against long-term field data for their applicability with respect to exposure climate in order to satisfactorily use the models in the durability design and redesign of concrete structures. In this study, various potential models for concrete resistance to chloride ingress, carbonation and frost attack were briefly reviewed. Three models including the simple ERFC, the DuraCrete and the ClinConc, for prediction of chloride ingress were evaluated using the infield data collected from both the field exposure site after over 20 years exposure and the real road bridges of about 30 years old. A physicochemical model for prediction of carbonation depth was evaluated using the infield data collected from the field exposure site after 11 years exposure and the limited data from the real structures with the age of 7 - 13 years. For the modelling of frost attack, some problems in measurement of critical saturation degree and actual degree of saturation are discussed. According to the comparison results, the simple ERFC overestimates whilst the DuraCrete model underestimate the chloride ingress in most cases. The ClinConc model {{on the other hand}} gives reasonable good prediction for both the short-term (one year) and the long-term (21 years) exposure. The Papadakis model for carbonation also gives fairly good prediction of carbonation depth when compared with the Norwegian infield data classified as <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 3, but underestimates the carbonation depths when compared with the infield data from Norwegian structures in <b>exposure</b> <b>class</b> XC 4.

Conventional steel reinforced concrete (RC) elements were dominating the precast market for concrete building envelopes particularly during the 1960 s– 1980 s.

Aim: To investigate the differences between slope and ridge environments in upper montane forests of southern Ecuador in terms of species diversity (richness, abundance), species composition and life forms of terrestrial bryophytes.

40|$|Chloride induced {{reinforcement}} corrosion is {{the most}} common degradation mechanisms for reinforced concrete structures. The service life of concrete structures is normally predicted by estimating the rate of chloride ingress and the necessary time to initiate reinforcement corrosion. Normally, chloride ingress is modeled as a diffusive process in which concrete is considered as a semi-infinite continuous medium. This modelling approach disregards the influence of cracks on the rate of chloride ingress in concrete. However, experimental {{studies have shown that the}} influence of cracks on chloride ingress is significant and cannot be neglected. In practice, cracks in concrete may originate due to different mechanisms. Recommendations on crack control in flexural members consider cracks in the range between 0. 15 mm (0. 006 in.) and 0. 3 mm (0. 011 in.) to be permissible in deicing and/or seawater exposure; with the same limit for both <b>exposure</b> <b>classes</b> in Europe.

EROD {{can be used to}} detect <b>exposure</b> to <b>classes</b> of organic pollutants such as co-planar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), planar dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF). Metallothioneins, peroxisomal enzymes (e.g. acyl CoA oxidase) and inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity are other more or less specific exposure responses towards trace metals, organic chemicals and organophosphate pesticides, respectively.|$|R
