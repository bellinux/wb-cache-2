40|$|Abstract. Axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> {{structure}} matrix (DSM) are two popular design methods at the moment, {{while most}} related researches only apply the basic ideas of axiomatic design or DSM to some cases. This paper first analyses the disadvantages of both axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. After deep investigations, the paper then puts forward {{that there are}} strong complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. Based on the complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM, it is proposed that axiomatic design’s design matrix (DM) can be transformed into corresponding DSM for structural evaluation. In this way, axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM can benefit from each other. The logic of integration between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM is interpreted in this paper. A computer aided conceptual design system has been developed to enable the integration of axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Anthropology {{challenges}} conventional thinking {{regarding the}} nature of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> creativity, {{in a way that}} acknowledges the improvisatory skills and perceptual acuity of people. Combining theoretical investigations and documentation of practice based experiments, it addresses methodological questions concerning the re-conceptualisation of the relation between <b>design</b> <b>and</b> use from both theoretical and practice-based positions. Concerned with what it means to draw 'users' into processes of <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> producing this book emphasises the creativity of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> the emergence of objects in social situations and collaborative endeavours. Organised around the themes of perception and the user-producer, skilled practices of <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> using, and the relation between people and things, the book contains the latest work of researchers from academia and industry, to enhance our understanding of ethnographic practice and develop a research agenda for the emergent field of design anthropology. Drawing together work from anthropologists, philosophers, designers, engineers, scholars of innovation <b>and</b> theatre practitioners, <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Anthropology will appeal to anthropologists and to those working in the fields of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> innovation, and the philosophy of technology and engineering...|$|R
