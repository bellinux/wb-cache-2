5|$|Wherever Bissell went, he {{attracted}} attention, {{both from}} his fiery dancing and his habit of wearing {{a cowboy hat}} and boots around New York City—his way of distinguishing he was a true-blue native Texan. He also made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> city on a motorcycle.|$|E
5|$|Moreau {{accompanied}} Desaix's Left Wing {{with the}} divisions of Delmas and Sainte-Suzanne (vice Beaupuy), Bourcier's Reserve and Saint-Cyr's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains. Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each {{time by the}} Austrians. Latour tried to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve. Finding his horsemen outnumbered near Ötigheim, Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay. In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM. In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{finally began}} his {{campaign}} against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid. Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly Stageira; otherwise unknown). Philip seems to have methodically worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least some cities submitted to him, including Toroni and Mecyberna—a small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos—having seen {{the fate of the}} cities which resisted Philip. By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory.|$|E

50|$|Doolan gave 'Dove Awards' {{to people}} or {{companies}} {{who have done}} good things. He played the sound of doves cooing. He gave Turkey Awards to people or companies who had done bad things, playing the sound of turkeys gobbling. Doolan has carried a manbag around for 20 years or more. It contains his heart medication.

60|$|Austen, {{from the}} top of the stairway, saw this catastrophe, but did not smile. He turned on his heel, and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of the passage into the other part of the building, and paused at the open doorway of the Honourable Hilary's outer office. By the street windows sat the Honourable Brush Bascom, sphinx-like, {{absorbing}} wisdom and clouds of cigar smoke which emanated from the Honourable Nat Billings.|$|R
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> flank and up to a position directly {{on top of the}} blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E
25|$|When an 1885 French {{expedition}} under Col. A. V. A. Combes {{attempted to}} seize the Buré gold fields, Ture counterattacked.

60|$|He made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} {{inclosure}} and clambered down on the splintered cliff {{at the end of}} the gorge. A wide, well-trodden trail {{extended into}} the forest below. Jonathan gave scarcely a glance to the beaten path before him; but bent keen eyes to the north, and carefully scrutinized the mossy stones along the brook. Upon a little sand bar running out from the bank he found the light imprint of a hand.|$|R

60|$|I {{closed my}} {{readings}} with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once {{had on the}} Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone, five thousand feet above the town of Breil. He was edging <b>his</b> <b>way</b> gingerly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of ice-glazed snow joined it. This declivity swept {{down a couple of}} hundred feet, into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high, overlooking a glacier. His foot slipped, and he fell.|$|R
25|$|Yet {{as he did}} so, the front-running pair of Rubens Barrichello's Jordan and Nigel Mansell's Williams came up to lap him. Noda was a touch {{too slow}} in {{getting out of the}} way, and both Barrichello and Mansell had to guess which side to pass. Rubens pulled to the right and safely {{negotiated}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Larrousse, but all Nigel could do was lock his brakes and ram the back of the Japanese driver.|$|E
25|$|When Datsyuk {{began his}} NHL career for the Red Wings, his mentors– {{including}} Soviet stars Igor Larionov and Sergei Fedorov, {{as well as}} Detroit captain Steve Yzerman– helped him learn <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> NHL. He was put on a line with Brett Hull and Boyd Devereaux and had a moderately productive first year. The length and difficulty of the NHL season got to him eventually, forcing him to sit {{out a number of}} games {{at the end of the}} year in preparation for the Stanley Cup playoffs. He contributed three goals and three assists to the Red Wings' 2002 Stanley Cup run.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{detachment}} {{attempted to}} fight {{its way through}} another eight miles (13km) of enemy-occupied territory to Yong Peng, this proved impossible, and Anderson had to destroy his equipment and attempted to work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> enemy. Anderson then ordered every able man to escape through the jungle to link up with the retreating main force in Yong Peng heading for Singapore. They {{had no choice but}} to leave the wounded to be cared for by the enemy, assuming the Japanese would take care of the wounded. But unfortunately, the Japanese unit at Parit Sulong later executed the approximately 150 wounded Australian soldiers and Indian soldiers next to the bridge of Parit Sulong, in the Parit Sulong Massacre.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1917, the village was {{attacked}} by the 50th and 51st Battalions, with the 49th and 52nd in support. Danish-born Australian Private Jørgen Christian Jensen of the 50th Battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross for the part he played. A Distinguished Service Order (and his first of two) was awarded to then-Major Noel Medway LOUTIT, an original ANZAC, who 'relieved the pressure' during these operations by working <b>his</b> <b>way</b> partly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> enemy flank and inflicting significant effective opposition. He continued in assisting and re-organising the front line under considerable hostile machine gun fire.|$|R
60|$|Holder {{sprang to}} his feet and made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> rapidly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> table, where he stood confronting the woman in the doorway. There she was, perceptibly swaying, as though the floor under her were rocked by an earthquake. Her {{handsome}} face was white as chalk, her pupils widened in terror. It was curious, at such an instant, that he should have taken in her costume,--yet {{it was part of the}} mystery. She wore a new, close-fitting, patently expensive suit of dark blue cloth and a small hat, which were literally transforming in their effect, demanding a palpable initial effort of identification.|$|R
50|$|PC {{versions}} of the game support mouse movement and a new, heavily improved text parser. Mouse movement was still in a primitive state {{at the time of}} the game's release, so Roger is unable to automatically find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> obstacles in <b>the</b> game world, instead stopping if he encounters a barrier. Computer mice were relatively new at the time, and Sierra's mouse movement would greatly improve in subsequent games.|$|R
25|$|The final {{battle for}} The Majestic {{took place on}} 25 August in the {{afternoon}} as Jaques Massu and Colonel Paul de Langlande of the 2nd Armored Division (France) moved their troops from the Champs-Élysées to the heavily fortified and barricaded Avenue Kleber. One of Massu's officers worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> rear of The Majestic on Rue la Perouse, which was protected by a blockhouse {{that could only be}} subdued by a bazooka, but the Germans inside the hotel said {{they would be willing to}} surrender to regular soldiers, rather than men of the Resistance. A German spokesman was brought to Massu under a white flag and with Langland'e approval, Massu went to The Majestic accompanied by Senior Sergeant Dannic. As they approached Dannic was shot dead by a sniper firing from the hotel's rooftop. Despite this, Massu continued up the hotel's steps and entered The Majestic's lobby to find fifty German officers and 300 other ranks. The Germans surrendered to Massu without further resistance, using a bilingual bell-boy from the hotel as their interpreter.|$|E
500|$|After {{his request}} {{to return to}} the fleet was approved, Basilone was {{assigned}} to [...] "C" [...] Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division. On February 19, 1945, the first day of invasion of Iwo Jima, he was serving as a machine gun section leader on Red Beach II. While the Marines landed, the Japanese concentrated their fire at the incoming Marines from heavily fortified blockhouses staged throughout the island. With his unit pinned down, Basilone made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> side of the Japanese positions until he was directly on top of the blockhouse. He then attacked with grenades and demolitions, single-handedly destroying the entire strong point and its defending garrison.|$|E
500|$|Ivan Jones is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Daniel Brocklebank. He {{appeared in the}} series from 5 May 2005 until 2 August 2006. Ivan was originally introduced {{to participate in a}} storyline about the character of Jarvis Skelton (Richard Moore) and only meant to feature in three episodes. The serial's producers were impressed with Brocklebank and made Ivan a regular character. The character is a Geordie, which required the actor to adopt the accent. Ivan is characterised as a “good-humoured" [...] and [...] "charming" [...] dustman, while Brocklebank described him as having [...] "quite a few" [...] love interests and stated that he has [...] "slept <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> village".|$|E
50|$|Three cones {{are placed}} five yards apart {{from each other}} forming a right angle. The athlete starts with one hand {{down on the ground}} and runs to the middle cone and touches it.

The athlete reverses direction again but this time runs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside of the middle cone {{on the way to the}} far cone running around it in figure eight fashion on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside of the middle cornering cone. Athletes are timed for this whole procedure. This drill is primarily used to determine a player's agility.|$|R
50|$|Godwin's {{role was}} {{employed}} in Liverpool to talk <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> Britain explaining <b>the</b> misunderstandings {{that were in}} circulation {{and to try to}} arrange a visit to the splintered missionaries in India. Godwin acted outside his remit and he organised a difficult two-day meeting in November 1836 which agreed a merger between the two splintered groups. With no schism Godwin had no job. With a feeling of great success he was again out of work.|$|R
5|$|Hodgkinson worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> to <b>the</b> left {{towards the}} Indonesian line of approach, {{subsequently}} engaging and killing two more, and wounding a third. Guest gathered {{the right hand}} elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|R
500|$|A {{writer from}} Emmerdale's Finnish {{broadcaster}} MTV3 described Ivan {{as being a}} [...] "good-humoured", [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "charming dustman" [...] Ivan is revealed to be bisexual and admits his attraction to Paul Lambert (Mathew Bose). Brocklebank told a writer from So So Gay that Ivan had [...] "quite a few" [...] love interests and [...] "slept <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> village". When the actor first started the role, Ivan was straight and married. He {{said that it was}} not until eight months after he started that he was informed his character would be bisexual. Brocklebank, who is openly gay, said there was a risk of himself becoming [...] "pigeonholed" [...] playing a bisexual character, but added it was not something that worried him.|$|E
500|$|As {{soon as the}} map of Britain was {{published}} Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and mapping of Lorraine (Lotharingia). This was a new venture {{for him in the}} sense that never before had he collected the raw data for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: [...] "The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement {{as a result of his}} terrifying experiences." [...] Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map {{was published}} at the time but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.|$|E
500|$|The {{second is}} [...] "No Strings (I'm Fancy Free)". [...] On {{retiring}} {{to his hotel}} suite, Horton advises him to get married. Astaire declares his preference for bachelorhood and the song – this number {{was the brainchild of}} scriptwriter Dwight Taylor and is found in his earliest drafts – emerges naturally and in mid-sentence. Astaire sings it through twice and during the last phrase leaps into a ballet jump, accompanied by leg beats, and launches into a short solo dance that builds in intensity and volume progressing from tap shuffles sur place, via traveling patterns, to rapid-fire heel jabs finishing with a carefree tour of the suite during which he beats on the furniture with his hands. On his return {{to the center of the}} room, where he noisily concentrates his tap barrage, the camera cranes down to discover Rogers in bed, awake and irritated. As she makes her way upstairs, Horton fields telephone complaints from hotel management. Astaire incorporates this into his routine, first startling him with a tap burst then escorting him ostentatiously to the telephone. As Horton leaves to investigate, Astaire continues to hammer <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> suite, during which he feigns horror at seeing his image in a mirror – a reference to his belief that the camera was never kind to his face. The routine ends as Astaire, now dancing with a statue, is interrupted by Rogers' entrance, a scene which, as in The Gay Divorcee and Roberta, typifies the way in which Astaire inadvertently incurs the hostility of Rogers, only to find her attractive and wear down her resistance.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the race, several of the 14 {{starters}} were fractious or unruly as it took the starter eleven minutes to get the field settled. Broomspun broke from post position 7 in a forward position and stalked the leaders from fourth passing the stands {{for the first time at}} Pimlico Race Course. He sat just off leader Leonard II's flank going down the backstretch in 47.4 for the first half mile. On the final turn, Broomspun worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> on <b>the</b> outside and burst down the lane to take the lead by just over a length. In the final strides, he was ridden out hard by jockey Frank Coltiletti to hold for the win by three quarters of a length over a hard-charging filly named Polly Ann.|$|R
5000|$|Morgan's {{energy as}} a {{choreographer}} was noticed by New York Times critic Jennifer Dunning at MorganScott's debut, where {{the quality of}} the dancing belied the company's financial situation: [...] "The choreography was attractive and the dancers skillful and persuasive. But what stood out about the new venture was its sheer fun. If Edward Morgan and Daniel Scott could bottle the evening's warmth and bubbling spirits, they would have no trouble raising money to keep their company going." [...] She went on: [...] "It is clear from his choreography that Mr. Morgan knows <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> ballet. <b>The</b> performers were swept gently along in lyrical, ground-hugging waves of dance punctuated by high lifts". Morgan's choreographic skill is praised: [...] "Mr. Morgan knows how to make his dancers look good, giving them plenty of delicate flourishes for their lyrical arms and fleeting emotional details that highlight the performers' engaging way of relating to one another on the stage." ...|$|R
50|$|Pol {{must find}} <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> Castle Rondoval. <b>The</b> strands {{he can use}} to perform magic are {{everywhere}} around him.

Reviving the mightiest one, who recognizes him as his former master's son, he then has to set out on a quest to find the three segments of his father's magical staff, scattered across the world by Mor. On the journey, he is accompanied by Mark's former sweetheart, thus creating a romantic triangle.|$|R
500|$|The {{next season}} Kennedy's {{juvenile}} team {{made it to}} the finals. During the season, Kennedy had scored seven goals in one game and six in another and it was efforts such as those which were attracting the attention of professional hockey people. The first team to approach Kennedy was the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, although for Kennedy [...] "It was a boyhood dream to play for Toronto." [...] Dinty Moore, also of Port Colborne, brought Kennedy to the attention Montreal General Manager Tommy Gorman and Kennedy was put on their negotiation list. In the fall of 1942, Montreal contacted the sixteen-year-old about joining the Canadiens. Kennedy's mother was wary of a career in hockey for her son as he was also headed towards studying business at the University of Western Ontario. She agreed to let her son attend the training camp when Montreal scout Dinty Moore assured her Ted was going to receive a good education at Montreal's prestigious Lower Canada College {{and they were going to}} cover the cost. Upon arriving in Montreal, foreshadowing future troubles, Kennedy discovered there was no one from the Canadiens to greet him at the train. The teenager was left to his own devices to check into a hotel and make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> new city. Then later, as he tried to combine hockey and school, he became concerned his studies were suffering and approached Canadien management to ask if they could find him accommodation closer to the school. He felt they were unresponsive and he soon became disillusioned with the experience in Montreal. After three weeks in Montreal he was feeling homesick and upon completing spring training with the Montreal Royals, he returned to Port Colborne in mid-November.|$|E
2500|$|The events took {{a violent}} turn that afternoon, as {{hostilities}} resumed {{outside of the}} ILA strike kitchen. Eyewitness accounts differ on the exact events that transpired next. According to some witnesses, a group of strikers first surrounded a police car and attempted to tip it over, prompting the police to fire shotguns in the air, and then revolvers at the crowd. [...] Other eyewitness accounts claim that police officers started shooting {{in the direction of}} the strikers, provoking strikers to defend themselves. Policemen fired a shotgun into the crowd, striking three men in intersection of Steuart and Mission streets. One of the men, Howard Sperry, a striking longshoreman, later died of his wounds. Another man, Charles Olsen, was also shot but later recovered from his wounds. A third man, Nick Bordoise - a Greek by birth (originally named Nick Counderakis) who was an out of work [...] member of the cook's union volunteering at the ILA strike kitchen—was shot but managed to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> corner onto Spear Street, where he was found several hours later.

In The Black Mountain, Wolfe and Goodwin stay briefly in an unoccupied house in Italy {{on their way to}} Montenegro; Wolfe prepares a pasta dish using Romano cheese that, from [...] "his memory of local custom," [...] he finds in a hole in the ground. During the short story [...] "Murder Is Corny", he lectures Inspector Cramer on the right and wrong ways to cook corn on the cob, insisting that it must be roasted rather than boiled in order to achieve the best flavor. (The 1940 story [...] "Bitter End" [...] {{suggests}} the contrary view that Wolfe was unable to prepare his own meals; Fritz's illness with the flu causes a household crisis and forces Wolfe to resort to canned liver pâté for his lunch.) ...|$|E
