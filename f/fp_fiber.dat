40|$|This {{research}} project concerns the construction, testing, and remote health {{monitoring of the}} first smart bridge structure in Florida, the East Bay bridge in Gibsonton, Hillsborough County. The East Bay Bridge is a four span, continuous, deck-type structure with a total length of 1202 ̆ 7 and width of 552 ̆ 7. The superstructure consists of an 182 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 cast-in-place reinforced concrete slab, and is supported on pre-stressed pile bents, each consisting of 5 piles. The smart sensors used for remote health monitoring are the newly emerged Fabry [...] Perot (<b>FP)</b> <b>Fiber</b> Optic Sensors, and are both surface-mounted and embedded in the concrete deck. Static and Dynamic testing of the bridge were performed using loaded SU- 4 trucks, and a finite element model for the bridge was developed for the test cases using commercial software packages. In addition, the smart sensors were connected to a data acquisition system permanently installed on-site. This system could be accessed through regular phone lin es, which permits {{the evaluation of the}} bridge behavior under live traffic loads. Currently, these live structural data under traffic loading are transmitted to Hillsborough County 2 ̆ 7 s bridge maintenance office to assist in the health evaluation and maintenance of the bridge. AASHTO LRFD Design Code has been investigated using analytical and laboratory test but no attempt has been made to verify its relative outlook with respect to Allowable Strength Design (ASD) and AASHTO Standard Specifications (LFD) in a real field test. The likely reason for could have been the lack of accurate and reliable sensing systems. The data collected as well as the analytical studies through out this research, suggest that current LRFD design specifications for deck-type bridges are conservative. The technology developed under this work will enable practical, cost-effective, and reliable systematic maintenance of bridge structures, and the study will provide a unique opportunity for future growth of this tech nology in the state of Florida and in other states and finally, long term collected data can be used to keep the design codes in check...|$|E

Fiber properties are dependent on deposition of cellulose in the fiber cell wall, but information about the enzymatic differences in sucrose metabolism between these fruiting positions is lacking. Therefore, two cotton cultivars with different sensitivities to low temperature were tested in 2010 and 2011 to quantify the effect of fruit positions (<b>FPs)</b> on <b>fiber</b> quality in relation to sucrose content, enzymatic activities and sucrose metabolism. The indices including sucrose content, sucrose transformation rate, cellulose content, and {{the activities of the}} key enzymes, sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), acid invertase (AI) and sucrose synthase (SuSy) which inhibit cellulose synthesis and eventually affect fiber quality traits in cotton fiber, were determined. Results showed that as compared with those of FP 1, cellulose content, sucrose content, and sucrose transformation rate of FP 3 were all decreased, and the variations of cellulose content and sucrose transformation rate caused by FPs in Sumian 15 were larger than those in Kemian 1. Under FP effect, activities of SPS and AI in sucrose regulation were decreased, while SuSy activity in sucrose degradation was increased. The changes in activities of SuSy and SPS in response to FP effect displayed different and large change ranges between the two cultivars. These results indicate that restrained cellulose synthesis and sucrose metabolism in distal FPs are mainly attributed to the changes in the activities of these enzymes.

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are optical <b>fiber</b> Fabry-Perot (<b>FP)</b> sensors and side-polished fibers. By vacuum deposition, {{aluminum}} films are formed directly onto the single mode fibers to serve as mirrors. FP cavities with Al mirrors {{are used in the}} experimental investigations. Typical finesse is about 4. However, finesse as high as 14 has been achieved. The transfer functions and polarization characteristics of single-mode <b>fiber</b> <b>FP</b> cavities are studied. To use optical <b>fiber</b> <b>FP</b> cavities as temperature and stress sensors, ways must be found to discern the direction of the change of the optical path length. Such a scheme has been developed and demonstrated. Theoretical study also shows two polarization modes are supported by FP cavities containing birefringent fibers, and the retardation between two polarization modes is varied when the fiber is stressed laterally. Taking advantage of the stress dependent retardation, optical fiber polarimetric sensors without using analyzers are proposed and demonstrated. The theoretical results are confirmed with the experimental investigations. ^ The main objectives of side-polished fiber research are to develop techniques to form and to characterize low-loss side polished single mode fibers. Theoretical calculations show that the polished surface has to be within 12 to 2 μm of the core if significant interaction with the fields guided by a single-mode fiber is desired. The study also reveals that the polishing depth must be determined accurately to within fractions of a micron for most applications. Therefore, stringent dimensional control is necessary if the polishing is to be successful. In this thesis, a reliable technique of fabricating side-polished fibers is established. Single mode fibers are embedded in the V grooves of silicon wafers and polished with 0. 05 μm colloidal silica slurries. A nondestructive method to estimate the polishing depth has been demonstrated. ...|$|R

Results were also {{compared with those of}} a similar composite of Al matrix. It was found that the composite in the transverse direction exhibited strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress and maximum stress within the studied strain rate range (10 - 4 to 1 x 103 s- 1). However the increase in strain rate decreased the failure strain. Microscopic observations on the failed samples have shown that the composite failed predominantly by shear banding. Near to the fracture surface DRX grains were observed within the shear band and it was proposedthat the lower ductility of the composite at increasing strain rates was due to the early DRX grain formation which softened thecomposite and resulted in lower ductility. Although twinning was observed in the deformed cross-sections of the samples at all strain rates particularly near the shear band region, it was proposed that the main deformation mechanism was slip which was evidenced by the slip lines on the fracture surface. The strain rate sensitivity in fracture stress of the composite in transverse direction was also found to be {{similar to that of the}} Al composite tested in the same direction. In the longitudinal direction, the composite failed by kink formation at quasi-static strain rates, while kinking and splitting at high strain rates. The maximum stress in the axial direction was however foundto be strain rate insensitive. In this direction similar to transverse direction DRXgrain formation was observed in the kink region. The lack of strain rate sensitivity in this direction was attributed to DRX grain formation at high strain rates combined with adiabatic heating and the brittle nature of the composite leading to fluctuatitonin the compressive strength...|$|R

The {{effect of}} dialyzer geometry, both flat plate (<b>FP)</b> and hollow <b>fiber</b> (HF), on platelet and granulocyte activation during dialysis with cuprophane membranes was studied in 12 patients. A subset of six patients was restudied after correction of their anemia with {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} (EPO). Granulocyte count and aggregation in vitro fell significantly (P < 0. 01) at 20 minutes of dialysis, followed by a gradual return towards pre-dialysis values at 240 minutes. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of free radical reactions generated by activated granulocytes, increased significantly during dialysis [pre-dialysis MDA (median, range) : 8. 4 (5. 8 to 11. 6) nmol/ml, 240 minutes MDA: 9. 7 (6. 6 to 12. 5) nmol/ml, P < 0. 01 Wilcoxon test). This increase, however, was not affected by dialyzer geometry or EPO therapy. Neither type of dialyzer was associated with significant platelet loss {{at the end of}} dialysis. Whole blood platelet aggregation in vitro (spontaneous and collagen-induced) decreased significantly, (P < 0. 01) during dialysis, the fall in spontaneous aggregation being significantly less following EPO therapy [spontaneous aggregation 240 minutes; pre-EPO: 34 (13 to 52) %; post-EPO 50 : (16 to 76) %, P < 0. 01) ]. The ratio of the platelet release proteins β-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 increased significantly during dialysis, indicating platelet activation in vivo, although there was no effect of dialyzer geometry or EPO. Factor VIII von Willebrand Factor antigen, a putative marker of endothelial damage, was raised pre-dialysis, and increased further during dialysis, irrespective of dialyzer geometry or EPO. In conclusion, dialyzer geometry had no significant effect on granulocyte and platelet counts and activity during hemodialysis with cuprophane membranes. Erythropoietin was associated with higher spontaneous platelet aggregation during dialysis, which could be relevant to the development of extracorporeal thrombosis...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) {{have been}} widely used in various applications to acquire distributed information through cooperative efforts of sensor nodes. Most of the sensor nodes used in WSNs are based on mechanical or electrical sensing mechanisms, which are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and can hardly be used in harsh environments. Although these disadvantages of conventional sensor nodes can be overcome by employing optical sensing methods, traditional optical systems are usually bulky and expensive, which can hardly be implemented in WSNs. Recently, the emerging technologies of silicon photonics and photonic crystal promise a solution of integrating a complete optical system through a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. However, such an integration still remains a challenge. The overall objective of this dissertation work is to develop a smart multifunctional optical system-on-a-chip (SOC) sensor platform capable of both phase modulation and wavelength tuningfor heterogeneous sensing, and implement this platform in a sensor node to achieve an optical WSN for various applications, including those in harsh environments. The contributions of this dissertation work are summarized as follows. i) A smart multifunctional optical SOC sensor platform for heterogeneous sensing has beendeveloped for the first time. This platform can be used to perform phase modulation and demodulation in a low coherence interferometric configuration or wavelength tuning in a spectrum sensing configuration. The multifunctional optical sensor platform is developed through hybrid integration of a light source, an optical modulator, and multiple photodetectors. As the key component of the SOC platform, two types of modulators, namely, the opto-mechanical and electro-optical modulators, are investigated. For the first time, interrogating different types of heterogeneous sensors, including various Fabry-Perot (<b>FP)</b> sensors and <b>fiber</b> Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, with a single SOC sensor platform, is demonstrated. ii) Enhanced understanding of the principles of the multifunctional optical platform withanopto-mechanical modulator has been achieved. As a representative of opto-mechanical modulators, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based FP tunable filter is thoroughly investigated through mechanical and optical modeling. The FP tunable filter is studied for both phase modulation and wavelength tuning, and design guidelines are developed based on the modeling and parametric studies. It is found that the MEMS tunable filter can achieve a large modulation depth, but it suffers from a trade-off between modulation depth and speed. iii) A novel silicon electro-optical modulator based on microring structures for optical phase modulation and wavelength tuning has been designed. To overcome the limitations of the opto-mechanical modulators including low modulation speed and mechanical instability, a CMOS compatible high speed electro-optical silicon modulator is designed, which combines microring and photonic crystal structures for phase modulation in interferometric sensors and makes use of two cascaded microrings for wavelength tuning in sensors that require spectrum domain signal processing. iv) A novel optical SOC WSN node has been developed. The optical SOC sensor platform and the associated electric circuit are integrated with a conventional WSN module to achieve an optical WSN node, enabling optical WSNs for various applications. v) A novel cross-axial dual-cavity FP sensor has been developed for simultaneous pressure and temperature sensing. Across-axial sensor is useful in measuring static pressures without picking up dynamic pressures in the presence of surface flows. The dual-cavity sensing structure is used for both temperature and pressure measurements without the need for another temperature sensor for temperature drift compensation. This sensor can be used in moderate to high temperature environments, which demonstrates the potential of using the optical WSN sensor node in a harsh environment...|$|R
