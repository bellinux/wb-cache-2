5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), <b>imides</b> (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
25|$|Imidazole is amphoteric. That is, it can {{function}} as both an acid {{and as a}} base. As an acid, the pKa of imidazole is 14.5, making it less acidic than carboxylic acids, phenols, and <b>imides,</b> but slightly more acidic than alcohols. The acidic proton is located on N-1. As a base, the pKa of the conjugate acid (cited as pKBH+ to avoid confusion between the two) is approximately 7, making imidazole approximately sixty times more basic than pyridine. The basic site is N3. Protonation gives the imidazolium cation, which is symmetrical.|$|E

The <b>imide</b> peptidomimetics were synthesized by coupling the in situ generated selenocarboxylate of Nα-protected amino acids with Nα-protected amino acid azides in good yields. The protocol was also successfully applied for the synthesis of hybrid tripeptidomimetics bearing both amide and <b>imide</b> functionalities. In addition, coumarinic <b>imide</b> conjugates of amino acids have been accomplished by employing this protocol.

2500|$|Imido ligands, {{also known}} as <b>imides</b> or nitrenes, most {{commonly}} form [...] "linear six electron bonds" [...] with metal centers. [...] Bent imidos are a rarity limited by complexes electron count, orbital bonding availability, or some similar phenomenon. [...] It is common to draw only two lines of bonding for all imidos, including the most common linear imidos with a six electron bonding interaction to the metal center. [...] Similarly amido complexes are usually drawn with a single line even though most amido bonds involve four electrons. [...] Alkoxides are generally drawn with a single bond although both two and four electron bonds are common.

40|$|On {{the role}} of the <b>imide</b> axial ligand in the spin and {{oxidation}} state of Mn corrole and corrolazine complexesElectronic structure calculations have been performed on four different Mn corrole and corrolazine complexes to clarify {{the role of}} the <b>imide</b> axial ligand on the relative stability of the different spin states and the stabilization of the high valent Mn ion in these complexes. Multiconfigurational perturbation theory energy calculations on the DFT optimized geometries shows that all complexes have a singlet ground state except the complex with the strongest electron withdrawing substituent on the <b>imide</b> axial ligand, which is found to have a triplet ground state. The analysis of the sigma and pi interaction between metal and <b>imide</b> ligand shows that this spin crossover is caused by a subtle interplay of geometrical factors (Mn-N distance and coordination angle) and the electron withdrawing character of the substituent on the <b>imide,</b> which reduces the electron donation to the metal centre. The analysis of the multiconfigurational wave functions reveals that the formally MnV ion is stabilized by an important electron transfer from both the equatorial corrole/corrolazine ligand and the axial <b>imide.</b> The macrocycle donates roughly half an electron, being somewhere between the closed-shell trianionic and the dianionic radical form. The <b>imide</b> ligand transfers 2. 5 electrons to the metal center, resulting in an effective d-electron count close to five in all complexes...|$|R
