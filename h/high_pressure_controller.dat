40|$|A model {{predictive}} controller for a wave-powered desalination unit is presented. The desalination unit {{is composed}} of a reverse osmosis membrane, and the water is pumped at <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> through the membrane by a wave energy converter. The wave energy converter is a heaving buoy type connected to an hydraulic circuit that converts the oscillating motion of the buoy into a rectified sea-water flow at <b>high</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>controller</b> acts on a throttle valve to regulate the pressure in the reverse osmosis unit {{in order to avoid}} damage to the membrane caused by excessive pressure and to improve both its longevity and the overall efficiency of the device. The control is constrained due to the rate and position limits of the throttle valve and the recovery ratio, which is the ratio between the total amount of pumped sea-water and the potable water. The system is also switched and non-stationary because of the check valves used for the rectification of the sea-water flow and the variation of the excitation force dynamic over time, respectively.

40|$|Background Cyclic {{redistribution}} of air within the cuff during respiratory pressure changes creates a self-sealing mechanism which allows tracheal sealing, despite tracheal airway pressure being above baseline cuff inflation pressure. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the effect of continuous automated cuff pressure regulation on tracheal sealing during cyclic respiratory pressure changes. Methods In vitro tracheal sealing was studied in four different <b>high</b> volume-low <b>pressure</b> (HVLP) tracheal tube cuffs size internal diameter 8. 0 and 5. 0 mm in combination with a conventional pressure manometer and two different automated <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers</b> (VBM Cuff Controller; Cuff Pressure Control Tracoe™). Experiments were performed at 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm H 2 O cuff pressure during intermittent positive pressure ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O. Air leakage was assessed spirometrically. Experiments were performed four times with each tube brand and size with two exemplars of each of the three cuff <b>pressure</b> <b>controllers.</b> Results Owing to immediate cuff pressure correction, tracheal sealing at cuff pressure below inspiratory pressure was reduced in most of the tracheal tube cuffs, except in those with reduced sealing characteristics when using the Pressure Control Tracoe™ compared with the conventional pressure manometer and the VBM Cuff Controller. Tracheal sealing with the Pressure Control Tracoe™ comparable with the other two devices was only achieved at cuff pressures of 20 and 25 cm H 2 O.

In VHPLC high flow rates are achieved, producing fast analyses but requiring <b>high</b> inlet <b>pressures.</b> The combination of high flow rates and <b>high</b> inlet <b>pressures</b> generates local heat, leading to temperature changes in the column. Usually {{in this case a}} post-run time is input into the analytical method to allow the return of the column temperature to its initial state. An alternative strategy involves operating the column without a post-run equilibration period and maintaining constant temperature variations for subsequent analysis after conducting one or a few separations to bring the column to a reproducible starting temperature. A liquid chromatography instrument equipped with a <b>pressure</b> <b>controller</b> was used to perform constant pressure and constant flow rate VHPLC separations.
