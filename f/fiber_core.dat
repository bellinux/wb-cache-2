25|$|Silica glass can be doped {{with various}} materials. One purpose of doping {{is to raise}} the {{refractive}} index (e.g. with germanium dioxide (GeO2) or aluminium oxide (Al2O3)) or to lower it (e.g. with fluorine or boron trioxide (B2O3)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare-earth-doped fibers) {{in order to obtain}} active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or laser applications. Both the <b>fiber</b> <b>core</b> and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or borosilicate glass).|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the <b>fiber</b> <b>core.</b> This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the <b>fiber</b> <b>core,</b> bouncing back and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E
40|$|An {{effort is}} {{underway}} to develop processes for making templates {{that could be}} used as deposition molds and etching masks in the fabrication of devices containing arrays of nanowires and/or nanoconduits. Highly-ordered, optical-fiber arrays consisting of dissimilar polymers comprise the template technology. The selective removal of the <b>fiber</b> <b>cores</b> in specific solvents creates the porous templates to be filled with a "top-down" deposition process such as electrochemical deposition, sputter deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, and the like. Typically, the fiber bundles consist of polystyrene (PS) <b>fiber</b> <b>cores,</b> which are clad with varying thickness poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). When arranged in hexagonal, close-packed configuration and pulled, the fibers form highly-ordered arrays comprised of PS <b>fiber</b> <b>cores</b> surrounded by a continuous matrix of PMMA. The ratio of PMMA cladding thickness to PS core diameter determines the spacing between PS <b>fiber</b> <b>cores</b> and typically ranges from 3 : 1 to 1 : 1. Essentially, the simultaneous heating and drawing or pulling in the longitudinal direction of polymer-fiber arrays fuses the fibers together...|$|R

40|$|Natural fiber {{composites}} {{composed of}} polypropylene, maleic anhydride-graft-polypropylene, and hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> were produced by two-roll mill mixing. The hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> was treated by alkaline. The morphology of the polypropylene/hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> composites was studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} technique. The mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of the polypropylene/hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> composites were determined in tensile, flexural tests, and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively, and discussed. It was found that incorporation of hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> in polypropylene increased the tensile and flexural modulus. Note that the stiffness of short hemp woody core fiber/polypropylene composites was markedly improved. However, the flexural and impact strength of polypropylene/hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> composites was reduced compared to the neat polypropylene. Incorporation of hemp fiber increased the water uptake compared to the neat polypropylene. It was established that the Fick’s law was fairly applicable to the water absorption results. The stiffness and thermogravimetric analysis behavior of the polypropylene/hemp woody <b>core</b> <b>fiber</b> composites were markedly affected by the surface treatments...|$|R
25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the <b>fiber</b> <b>core.</b> The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the <b>fiber</b> <b>core</b> {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E
25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the <b>fiber</b> <b>core</b> by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.|$|E
