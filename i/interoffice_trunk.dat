5000|$|Trunks Integrated Record Keeping System (TIRKS) is an {{operations}} support system from Telcordia Technologies (since acquired by Ericsson, Inc.), originally developed by the Bell System during the late 1970s. It was developed for inventory and order control management of <b>interoffice</b> <b>trunk</b> circuits that interconnect telephone switches. It grew to encompass and automate many functions required to build the ever-expanding data transport network. Supporting circuits from POTS and 150 baud modems up through T1, DS3, SONET and DWDM, it continues to evolve today, and unlike many software technologies today, provides complete backward compatibility. TIRKS was recently updated with a Java GUI, XML API, and WORD Sketch, which provides graphical views of the TIRKS Work Order Record and Details Document as well as SONET and DWDM networks. When TIRKS became a registered trademark in 1987, it became technically improper {{to use it as}} an acronym. TIRKS was one of many OSS technologies transferred to Bell Communications Research as part of the Modification of Final Judgment related to the AT&T divestiture on January 1, 1984. In the 1990s, the Facility and Equipment Planning System (FEPS) and Planning Workstation System (PWS) products were incorporated into the Telcordia TIRKS CE System. TIRKS is still in use at AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink, and Cincinnati Bell Telephone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{past year}} has seen {{explosive}} growth in internet traffic. Currently, the most common way of accessing the internet is via the switching systems and the <b>interoffice</b> <b>trunk</b> facilities of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The PSTN was designed to carry voice calls that have an average call holding time of about 3 minutes. The nominal 3 minute call assumption pervades all aspects of telco equipment design such as switch engineering, line concentration ratios, and trunk group sizes. However, internet calls violate this fundamental assumption and have a mean holding time {{of the order of}} 20 minutes with some calls lasting for many hours. This long holding time traffic severely taxes the PSTN. It requires additional equipment to be provisioned, without compensating revenues, and potentially affects service performance for all users. Internet traffic, which is packet data in nature, can in principle be carried much more efficiently on data networks. However, since the PSTN currently represents the only nearuniversal access method, any long term solution necessarily involves a staged migration from the present mode of operation towards some packet network solution. This paper reviews the impacts of internet traffic on the PSTN. It summarizes the impact of internet traffic on transmission and switching equipment, the need for comprehensive revisions to existing engineering and planning algorithms, and the implications of these issues for operational practices and operations support systems. It also provides analysis of the cost of supporting internet traffic on the PSTN. Finally, it describes a number of possible solutions. In each case the current barriers to implementing the solution are discussed. I...|$|E
50|$|This {{technique}} only affected interoffice multi-frequency (MF) trunks; local calls originated and terminated on {{the same}} switch. By placing a call to a non-local toll-free number, <b>interoffice</b> <b>trunks</b> were used for free. Using a blue box would then disconnect the toll-free call and let any other number be dialed. Since the phone was never physically hung up, the connection was still toll-free.|$|R
50|$|T-carrier spans are terminated, {{originally}} one per card but {{in later}} models usually two, in Digital Line Trunk Units (DLTU) which concentrate their DS0 channels into the TSI. These may serve either <b>interoffice</b> <b>trunks</b> or, using Integrated Subscriber Loop Carrier, subscriber lines. Higher-capacity DS3 signals {{can also have}} their DS0 signals switched in Digital Network Unit SONET (DNUS) units, without demultiplexing them into DS1. Newer SM's have DNUS (DS3) and Optical OIU interfaces (OC12) with {{a large amount of}} capacity.|$|R
50|$|Junctor Circuits were {{installed}} in similar frames, but were simpler, {{with only two}} relays. They were used only in Line to Line junctors. Large offices, {{in addition to these}} Junctor Circuits, had Intraoffice Trunks, which were of similar design but fit into the same Universal <b>Trunk</b> Frames as <b>interoffice</b> <b>trunks.</b> They carried overflow traffic when the small Junctor Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in relay racks similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|R
