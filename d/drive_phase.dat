2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer leans forward, and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and leans back. This is called the <b>drive</b> <b>phase</b> of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other - one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will [...] "dig" [...] in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so {{that it is possible to}} lean back further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to [...] "squeeze the finish".|$|E

5000|$|Rowing {{boats are}} {{designed}} for speed, not manoeuvrability, so steering requires effort. Coxswains may steer with either the tiller (a cable connected to the rudder), commands for increased [...] "pressure" [...] or strength from rowers {{on one side of}} the boat, or both, depending on what is necessary in the situation. In the most extreme cases, the coxswain may go [...] "full tiller", turning the rudder to its maximum angle, and may enlist the rowers to help the boat turn faster. This technique is usually reserved for only the sharpest turns, as the sharp angle of the rudder increases drag and upsets the balance of the boat. For more conventional turns, the coxswain may move the tiller slightly to one side or the other over the course of a few strokes. To minimize disturbance of the boat's stability, the motion of the tiller must be smooth and not sudden. The coxswain may also initiate the turn during the <b>drive</b> <b>phase</b> of the stroke, when the propulsive force of the oar blades in the water helps stabilize the boat. For very small steering adjustments, the coxswain may move the tiller very subtly during the recovery phase of a single stroke. This technique is most effective at higher speeds and on straight courses, and must be used discreetly since motion of the tiller during the recovery can easily disturb the boat's balance. Some coxswains advocate that the rudder should be applied only during the <b>drive</b> <b>phase</b> (and centered during the recovery phase), citing the fact that the boat is most stable when the oars are in the water and least stable when the oars are out of the water. The technique that often accompanies this view involves repeatedly moving the rudder back and forth over several strokes, making sure that the rudder is centered before every recovery. However, the rudder has much less steering power during the <b>drive</b> <b>phase</b> because of the very large forward propulsion force it must overcome. As a result, this technique often causes more boat drag due to longer rudder use, and the back-and-forth motion of the rudder tends to rock the boat.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} has accumulated {{in the recent}} decade that nanoscale patterns can self-assemble on solid surfaces. A two-component monolayer grown on a solid surface may separate into distinct phases. Sometimes the phases select sizes about 10 nm, and order into an array of stripes or disks. This paper reviews a model that accounts for these behaviors. Attention is focused on thermodynamic forces that drive the self-assembly. A double-welled, composition-dependent free energy <b>drives</b> <b>phase</b> separation. The <b>phase</b> boundary energy <b>drives</b> <b>phase</b> coarsening. The concentration-dependent surface stress <b>drives</b> <b>phase</b> refining. It is the competition between the coarsening and the refining that leads to size selection and spatial ordering. These thermodynamic forces are embodied in a nonlinear diffusion equation. Numerical simulations reveal rich dynamics of the pattern formation process. It is relatively fast for the phases to separate and select a uniform size, but exceedingly slow to order over a long distance, unless the symmetry is suitably broken...|$|R

Core confinement is reduced during a sawtooth instability but, although the electron energy is distributed outward by the sawtooth, the bulk electron energy confinement time is essentially unaffected. The radial deposition of energy into the electrons is noticeably more peaked for current <b>drive</b> <b>phasing</b> (longer wavelength excitation) relative to that for heating phasing (shorter wavelength excitation) as is expected theoretically.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to analyze shoulder joint kinematics and electromyographic activities of wheelchair propulsion between two stroke patterns. Twenty physical therapy students (14 females and 6 males, age 27. 4 ± 5. 9 years, body mass 64. 41 ± 9. 37 Kg and body height 169. 32 ± 9. 12 cm) participated. Eleven reflective markers were placed on thorax and right scapula, humerus, third metacarpophalangeal joint and wheelchair axle. Surface electrodes were placed on right pectoralis major, anterior and posterior deltoids, infraspinatus, middle trapezius, biceps brachialis long head and triceps brachialis. Participants propelled a standard wheelchair on a stationary roller system at 0. 9 m/s and 1. 8 m/s with semicircular (SC) and single loop (SL) stroke patterns for 20 seconds. Three-dimensional body movement and muscle activities were recorded at 100 and 1000 Hz, respectively. All data were compared for differences between two patterns and two speeds using 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA (α 3 ̆c. 05). Results showed longer <b>drive</b> <b>phase</b> and shorter recovery phase in SC when compared to SL, with no difference found on cycle time. Smaller release angles in SC caused longer angle ranges of hand contact on the pushrim while initial contact angles did not change. During <b>drive</b> <b>phase,</b> smaller scapular protraction range of motion (ROM) was found in SC. Shoulder abduction in <b>drive</b> <b>phase</b> was larger {{in terms of the}} maximal angle and ROM. In the recovery phase, minimal scapular tilting, protraction, and shoulder abduction and internal rotation were larger in SC when compared to SL pattern.

Measurements of the boat acceleration, boat velocity, handle force, oar angle, and velocity of body segments were made in competitive rowing boats using a telemetry system.
