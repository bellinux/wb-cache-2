50|$|Trabectome is a {{surgical}} device {{that can be}} used for Ab interno trabeculotomy, a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery for the surgical management of adult, juvenile and <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> Unlike trabeculectomy, the surgery does not create an external filtering bleb. Instead, the Trabectome handpiece opens access to Schlemm's canal by ablating the trabecular meshwork of the eye, therefore reducing intraocular pressure which is major risk factor for glaucomatous vision loss. The irrigation/aspiration device provides irrigation during surgery and collection of residual fluid and ablated tissue in a collection bag. This procedure is performed through a small incision and can be done on an outpatient basis.|$|E

40|$|Three typical pedigrees with {{hereditary}} glaucoma are presented, {{in which}} dominant goniodysgenesis {{is shown to}} be the actual genetic trait. Because of a marked variation in the expressivity of dysgenesis, the symptoms of the genetic malformation (elevated intraocular pressure and subsequent glaucoma) may appear early or late in life. Therefore, there is no justification in letting the patient's age {{at the onset of}} the symptoms decide the classification or the mode of inheritance of the <b>glaucoma</b> (<b>infantile,</b> juvenile, simple), when the common etiologic factor is a dominant dysgenic trait.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Morphological {{variability}} of the trabecular meshwork {{could be of}} considerable importance for the proper intraoperative outcome of non-perforating antiglaucomatous surgery, such as deep sclerectomy and viscocanalostomy. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to assess qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the trabecular meshwork in glaucoma patients undergoing trabeculectomy.  METHODS—Trabeculectomy specimens from 177  glaucoma patients were prepared for light microscopy; 100  specimens were found to be suitable for qualitative assessment and quantitative computerised image analysis; measurements were taken of the meridional diameter of Schlemm's canal as well as the thickness of the trabecular meshwork at different positions.  RESULTS—The mean meridional diameter of Schlemm's canal was 290  µm with the smallest values in the young patients with <b>infantile</b> and secondary <b>glaucomas.</b> the thickness of the trabecular meshwork ranged between 50 - 70 µm in the anterior region and between 100 - 130 µm for the posterior portion. The thickness of the anterior meshwork significantly decreased with age. The pigmentation of excised trabecular meshwork was found to be weak or even lacking in 68  patients. In 20  glaucoma patients the uveal meshwork was covered by an endothelial layer.  CONCLUSIONS—From the morphological point of view the risk of inadvertent perforation during deep sclerectomy in older, white glaucoma patients should be taken into account even by an experienced surgeon, because the anterior meshwork in these cases is very thin and trabecular pigmentation that {{can be used as a}} topographic landmark is often lacking. The functional success of non-perforating glaucoma surgery in many patients may be limited by endothelial covering of the trabecular meshwork. ...|$|R

40|$|AIM:To {{observe the}} {{long-term}} effect and influence factors of trabeculotomy in primary <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> METHODS: The clinical data of 172 infants(257 eyes) with primary glaucoma was analyzed. After the follow-up visits, {{the change of}} postoperative intraocular pressure was observed. Upon the rising intraocular pressure, the operation {{was considered to be}} failure as long as 1 or 2 kinds of drugs were taken to ineffectively reduce the pressure. Based on the multivariate Logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for the failure of trabeculotomy were analyzed. Through Cox regression analysis, the influence factor of successful operation and the curve for success rate of operation at each time point was drawn. RESULTS: The median time of follow-up visits was 30. 7 (8. 4 ～ 57. 9) mo and follow-up rate was 89. 02 %. Through the multivariate Logistic regression analysis, the preoperative intraocular pressure and corneal transparency were the high risk factors for the failure of trabeculotomy(P P CONCLUSION: Compared with preoperative intraocular pressure, the corneal transparency can reflect the severity of primary <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> in a securer way.

40|$|The size of {{the cornea}} is {{important}} in the diagnosis of primary <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> Reference values regarding eyes of premature infants are scarce. Such data are of special importance in areas such as the Middle East where <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> is common and often evident already at birth. The authors have measured the horizontal corneal diameter of the eyes of 127 premature Saudi infants with a gestational age between 23 and 36 weeks and a birth weight ranging from 540 g to 4720 g. The corneal diameter ranged from 7. 75 mm to 10 mm. The smallest diameter (7. 75 mm) was found in an infant with a gestational age of 23 weeks and having a birth weight of 520 g. The largest diameter (10 mm) belonged to two infants with a gestational age of 34 and 35 weeks and a birth weight of 2250 g and 2240 g respectively.

40|$|Relatively little data exist {{regarding}} {{the outcomes of}} children with primary <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> presenting with acute corneal hydrops. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} the surgical outcome of children of <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> who presented with acute corneal hydrops. In total, 38 eyes of 31 consecutive children of <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> presented with acute corneal hydrops who underwent primary combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy (CTT) by a single surgeon from January 1990 to December 2012 at the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), a tertiary eye care centre in Southern India were enrolled in this retrospective study. Primary outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP) control (IOP ≤ 16 mmHg under anaesthesia or IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without anaesthesia) and clearance of corneal edema. Secondary outcome measures were visual acuity (VA), corneal diameter, bleb appearance, intraoperative and postoperative complications. Mean age at presentation was 6. 4 months (range, 2 - 11 months) and seven eyes (23 %) had bilateral affliction. At presentation, all eyes (100 %) had moderate to severe degree of corneal edema with a mean preoperative IOP of 25. 6 ± 5. 1 mmHg. Postoperatively, the IOP reduced to 12. 0 ± 3. 8 mmHg (difference = - 13. 6, 95 % CI = - 15. 7 to - 11. 5, t = - 13. 18, p< 0. 0001), and the percentage reduction in IOP was 53. 05 %. Preoperatively 83 % of the eyes were on antiglaucoma medication, and postoperatively 2 eyes (5. 3 %) required 1 antiglaucoma medication for control of IOP. Preoperatively, corneal edema was present in all eyes and postoperatively it cleared in all of them. Significant myopic astigmatism was present in 28 eyes (74 %), the commonest being compound myopic astigmatism (75 %) followed by simple myopic astigmatism (21 %). Normal VA (best-corrected VA; BCVA ≥ 20 / 60) was achieved in 44. 4 % of the eyes and 22. 2 % eyes had low vision (BCVA, < 20 / 60 to 20 / 400). Complete success (IOP control and clearance of corneal oedema) was obtained in 94. 7 % eyes. There were no significant intraoperative or postoperative complications. Two thirds of the patients showed low, elevated functional filtering bleb. No patient had any bleb leak, blebitis or bleb related endophthalmitis. The median follow-up was 36 months (range 2 - 228 months). Primary CTT is safe and effective in controlling IOP, resulting in complete clearance of corneal edema with modest visual improvement in children of <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> presenting with acute corneal hydrops.

40|$|Tissue {{from ten}} eyes with <b>infantile</b> <b>{{glaucoma}}</b> and from 40 normal eyes of fetuses and infants without glaucoma were examined by light and electron microscopy. In normal development, the corneoscleral coat grows {{faster than the}} uveal tract during the last trimester, leading to a posterior migration of the ciliary body attachment from Schwalbe's line (5 th month) to the scleral spur (9 th month), {{and then to a}} location behind the scleral spur (postnatally). In <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> the insertion of the anterior ciliary body and iris overlaps the trabecular meshwork, similar to the late fetal position. The trabecular sheets are perforated, and there is no membrane over the surface of the trabecular meshwork. The trabecular beams are thicker than in normal infant eyes. There is both histologic and clinical evidence of traction on the iris root exerted by the thickened trabecular beams. These findings suggest that in congenital glaucoma the thickened beams had prevented the normal posterior migration of the ciliary body and iris root. This traction may compact the thickened trabecular beams, obstructing aqueous humor outflow. Release of the traction by an incision (goniotomy or trabeculotomy) of the thickened meshwork may relieve the obstruction. Of uncertain pathological significance is that there are no vacuoles in the endothelium of Schlemm's canal and there is a broad layer of collagen and amorphous material in the juxtacanalicular connective tissue. The ciliary processes are elongated inward, as if they were pulled by zonular traction (perhaps created by an enlarging diameter of the limbus with a fixed lens diameter) ...|$|E

40|$|Childhood {{blindness}} has {{an adverse}} effect on growth, development, social, and economic opportunities. Severe visual impairment (SVI) and blindness in infants must be detected {{as early as possible}} to initiate immediate treatment to prevent deep amblyopia. Although difficult, measurement of visual acuity of an infant is possible. The causes of SVI and blindness may be prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal. Congenital anomalies such as anophthalmos, microphthalmos, coloboma, congenital cataract, <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> and neuro-ophthalmic lesions are causes of impairment present at birth. Ophthalmia neonatorum, retinopathy of prematurity, and cortical visual impairment are acquired during the perinatal period. Leukocoria or white pupillary reflex can be cause by congenital cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, or retinoblastoma. While few medical or surgical options are available for congenital anomalies or neuro-ophthalmic disorders, many affected infants can still benefit from low vision aids and rehabilitation. Ideally, surgery for congenital cataracts should occur within the first 4 months of life. Anterior vitrectomy and primary posterior capsulotomy are required, followed by aphakic glasses with secondary intraocular lens implantation at a later date. The treatment of <b>infantile</b> <b>glaucoma</b> is surgery followed by anti-glaucoma medication. Retinopathy of prematurity is a proliferation of the retinal vasculature in response to relative hypoxia in a premature infant. Screening in the first few weeks of life can prevent blindness. Retinoblastoma can be debulked with chemotherapy; however, enucleation may still be required. Neonatologists, pediatricians, traditional birth attendants, nurses, and ophthalmologists should be sensitive to a parent’s complaints of poor vision in an infant and ensure adequate follow-up to determine the cause. If required, evaluation under anesthesia should be performed, which includes funduscopy, refraction, corneal diameter measurement, and measurement of intraocular pressure...|$|E

40|$|Von Hippel–Lindau disease (VHL) and {{neurofibromatosis}} type 1 (NF 1) are hereditary multitumor syndromes {{that show}} associated ocular manifestations. Capillary retinal angioma, a benign vascular tumor, is the classical ocular lesion in VHL. It often appears as the first manifestation {{of the disease and}} may thus lead to the diagnosis of VHL. Since small angiomas can be treated easily by laser photocoagulation, a regular ocular screening of VHL patients is recommended. Ocular manifestations of NF 1 are more diverse as compared to VHL. Lisch nodules of the iris are an important diagnostic criteria of NF 1 since they can be found in almost every affected patient. Optic glioma can occur both intraorbitally and intracranially. The intraorbital form causes progressive protrusion of the globe and eventually blindness. Extension of the tumor beyond the chiasm worsens the prognosis quoad vitam.
