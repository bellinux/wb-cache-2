40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a rather {{unexplored}} dimension to date of the HIV/AIDS epidemic: the resulting stigma and discrimination {{and its impact on}} the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS programs. It presents a conceptual framework that explains the interplay between stigma, discrimination and human rights. The study also provides guidelines for developing programmatic activities that situate HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination within the broader social context where a variety of stigmas related to class, race, gender and ethnicity exist. Thus, the framework and the paper can be useful both to those fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS as well as to those fighting exclusion in other social contexts. This paper was prepared as a background document for a seminar entitled HIV/AIDS and Development: Challenges and Responses in Latin America and the Caribbean held at the Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank and <b>Inter-American</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Corporation</b> in March 2002. ...|$|E
