500|$|For 2002's Blood Omen 2, {{developed}} by a different team within Crystal Dynamics, Kain returned as the playable protagonist. The development staff chose to focus on his rise to power as a younger vampire, combining aspects of his Blood Omen and Soul Reaver incarnations. He was marketed as a more powerful and ruthless character than traditional video game heroes, with lead designer Mike Ellis inviting comparison to Final Fantasy VIs Kefka Palazzo and Revolver Ocelot of the Metal Gear series. Design issues, raised by the wealth of abilities and equipment he accumulated in Blood Omen, prompted the team to add to his backstory and convincingly deprive him of these powers. Producer Sam Newman described him as [...] "a very unique character" [...] who [...] "doesn't fit to the <b>generic</b> <b>character</b> molds you find in many other games, books and movies [...] not good, he's not necessarily evil -- Kain does as Kain believes".|$|E

60|$|An {{hour or two}} later, Deacon Pratt and {{his niece}} were seated, in company with two others, at the dinner-table. The fare was simple, but good. Fish enters largely into the {{domestic}} consumption {{of all those who}} dwell near the water, {{in that part of the}} country; and, on that particular occasion, the uncle had, in the lightness of his heart, indulged in what, for him, was a piece of extravagance. In all such regions there are broken-down, elderly men, who live by taking fish. Liquor has usually been their great enemy, and all have the same <b>generic</b> <b>character</b> of laziness, shiftless and ill-regulated exertions, followed by much idleness, and fits of intemperance, that in the end commonly cause their deaths.

6000|$|Such, Riehl tells us, are {{the general}} {{characteristics}} of the German peasantry—characteristics which subsist amid {{a wide variety of}} circumstances. In Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and Brandenburg the peasant lives on extensive estates; in Westphalia he lives in large isolated homesteads; in the Westerwald and in Sauerland, in little groups of villages and hamlets; on the Rhine land is for the most part parcelled out among small proprietors, who live together in large villages. Then, of course, the diversified physical geography of Germany gives rise to equally diversified methods of land-culture; and out of these various circumstances grow numerous specific differences in manner and character. But the <b>generic</b> <b>character</b> of the German peasant is everywhere the same; in the clean mountain hamlet and in the dirty fishing village on the coast; in the plains of North Germany and in the backwoods of America. “Everywhere he has the same historical character—everywhere custom is his supreme law.

60|$|Nevertheless he {{submitted}} to be kissed willingly enough, though Maggie hung {{on his neck}} in rather a strangling fashion, while his blue-gray eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river, where he promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing to-morrow morning. He {{was one of those}} lads that grow everywhere in England, and at twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslings,--a lad with light-brown hair, cheeks of cream and roses, full lips, indeterminate nose and eyebrows,--a physiognomy in which it seems impossible to discern anything but the <b>generic</b> <b>character</b> to boyhood; as different as possible from poor Maggie's phiz, which Nature seemed to have moulded and colored with the most decided intention. But that same Nature has the deep cunning which hides itself under the appearance of openness, so that simple people think they can see through her quite well, and all the while she is secretly preparing a refutation of their confident prophecies. Under these average boyish physiognomies that she seems to turn off by the gross, she conceals some of her most rigid, inflexible purposes, some of her most unmodifiable characters; and the dark-eyed, demonstrative, rebellious girl may after all {{turn out to be a}} passive being compared with this pink-and-white bit of masculinity with the indeterminate features.|$|E

60|$|Affinities.--Considering {{the close}} {{affinity}} between the several genera, there are, I conceive, no grounds for dividing the Lepadidæ into sub-families, {{as has been}} proposed by some authors, who have trusted exclusively to external characters. In establishing the eleven genera in the Lepadidæ, no one part or set of organs affords sufficient diagnostic characters: {{the number of the}} valves is the most obvious, {{and one of the most}} useful characters, but it fails when the valves are nearly rudimentary, and when they are numerous: the direction of their lines of growth is more important, and fails to be characteristic only in Scalpellum: with the same exception, the presence or abscence of calcified or horny scales on the peduncle is a good <b>generic</b> <b>character.</b> For this same end, the shape of the scuta and carina, but not of the other valves, comes into play. In three genera, the presence of filamentary appendages on the animal's body is generic; in Pollicipes, however, they are found only on three out of the six species. The number of teeth in the mandibles, and the shape of the maxillæ, often prove serviceable for this end; as does more generally the presence of caudal appendages, and whether they be naked or spinose, uniarticulate or multiarticulate; in Pollicipes alone this part is variable, being uni-and multi-articulate; and in one species of Scalpellum they are absent, though present in all the others. The shape of the body, the absence or presence of teeth on the labrum, the inner edge of the outer maxillæ being notched or straight, the prominence of the olfactory orifices, the arrangement of the spines on the cirri, and the number and form of their segments, are only of specific value.|$|E
60|$|The {{principle}} discussed {{under the}} last heading may {{be applied to}} our present subject. It is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant: if in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific character, {{and no one would}} be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a <b>generic</b> <b>character,</b> and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because the explanation which most naturalists would advance is not here applicable, namely, that specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this point in the chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters are more variable than generic; but with respect to important characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author remarks with surprise that some important organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout a large group of species, DIFFERS considerably in closely-allied species, it is often VARIABLE in the individuals of the same species. And this fact shows that a character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire apparently entertains no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group, the more subject it is to anomalies in the individuals.|$|E

60|$|It {{should be}} {{observed}} that {{the evidence in this}} summary is of a cumulative nature. If we think it highly, or in some degree probable,--from the ordinary form of Ibla Cumingii having been shown on good evidence to be exclusively female,--from the absence of ova and ovaria in the assumed males of both species of Ibla, at the period when their vesiculæ seminales were gorged with spermatozoa,--from the close general resemblance between the parts of the mouth in the parasites and in the Iblas to which they are attached,--from {{the differences between the two}} parasites being strictly analogous to the differences between the two species of Ibla,--from the <b>generic</b> <b>character</b> of their prehensile antennæ,--and from other such points,--if from these several considerations, we admit that these parasites really are the males of the two species to which they adhere, then in some degree the occurrence of parasitic males in the allied genus Scalpellum is rendered more probable. So the absolute similarity in the antennæ of the males and hermaphrodites both in S. vulgare and S. Peronii; and such relations as that of the relative villosity of the several species in this same genus, all in return strengthen the case in Ibla. Again, the six-valved parasites of S. Peronii and S. villosum are so closely similar, that their nature, whatever it may be, must be the same; hence we may add up the evidence derived from the identity of the antennæ in the parasite and hermaphrodite S. Peronii, with that from the antennæ in the male S. villosum, approaching in character to Pollicipes, to which genus the hermaphrodite is so closely allied; and to this evidence, again, may be added the singular coincident absence of caudal appendages in the male and hermaphrodite S. villosum. If these two six-valved parasites be received as the complemental males of their respective species, no one, probably, will doubt regarding the nature of the parasite of S. rostratum, in which the direct evidence is the weakest; but even in this case, the particular point of attachment, and the state of development of the valves, form a link connecting in some degree, the parasites of the first three species with the last two species of Scalpellum, in accordance with the affinities of the hermaphrodites.|$|E
60|$|Metzger {{describes}} seven {{species of}} wheat, Godron refers to five, and De Candolle to only four. It is not improbable that, besides the kinds known in Europe, other strongly characterised forms {{exist in the}} more distant parts of the world; for Loiseleur-Deslongchamps (9/24. Considerations sur les Cereales' 1842-43 page 29.) speaks of three new species or varieties, sent to Europe in 1822 from Chinese Mongolia, which he considers as being there indigenous. Moorcroft (9/25. 'Travels in the Himalayan Provinces' etc. 1841 volume 1 page 224.) also speaks of Hasora wheat in Ladakh as very peculiar. If those botanists are right who believe that at least seven species of wheat originally existed, then the amount of variation in any important character which wheat has undergone under cultivation has been slight; but if only four or a lesser number of species originally existed, then {{it is evident that}} varieties have arisen so strongly marked, that they have been considered by capable judges as specifically distinct. But the impossibility of deciding which forms ought to be ranked as species and which as varieties, makes it useless to specify in detail the differences between the various kinds of wheat. Speaking generally, the organs of vegetation differ little (9/26. Col. J. Le Couteur on the 'Varieties of Wheat' pages 23, 79.); but some kinds grow close and upright, whilst others spread and trail along the ground. The straw differs in being more or less hollow, and in quality. The ears (9/27. Loiseleur-Deslongchamps 'Consid. sur les Cereales' page 11.) differ in colour and in shape, being quadrangular, compressed, or nearly cylindrical; and the florets differ in their approximation to each other, in their pubescence, and in being more or less elongated. The presence or absence of barbs is a conspicuous difference, and in certain Gramineae serves even as a <b>generic</b> <b>character</b> (9/28. See an excellent review in Hooker 'Journ. of Botany' volume 8 page 82 note.); although, as remarked by Godron (9/29. 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 73.) the presence of barbs is variable in certain wild grasses, and especially in those such as Bromus secalinus and Lolium temulentum, which habitually grow mingled with our cereal crops, and which have thus unintentionally been exposed to culture. The grains differ in size, weight, and colour; in being more or less downy at one end, in being smooth or wrinkled, in being either nearly globular, oval, or elongated; and finally in internal texture, being tender or hard, or even almost horny, and in the proportion of gluten which they contain.|$|E
