5|$|If {{opportunity}} costs are constant, a straight-line (linear) PPF is produced.

Products requiring similar resources (bread and pastry, for instance) will have an almost straight PPF and so almost constant {{opportunity costs}}. More specifically, with constant returns to scale, there are two opportunities for a linear PPF: if {{there was only one}} factor of production to consider or if the factor intensity ratios in the two sectors were constant at all points on the production-possibilities curve. With varying returns to scale, however, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> entirely linear in either case.|$|E

In still other cases, the crystallographer may detect that the covalent structure deduced for the molecule was incorrect, or changed. For example, proteins may be cleaved or undergo post-translational modifications that were not detected prior to the crystallization.|$|E
5|$|Marcelo Weksler {{and colleagues}} removed {{most of the}} species then placed in Oryzomys from the genus in 2006, {{retaining}} only the marsh rice rat and related species, including O.gorgasi. They also kept O.curasoae in the genus and suggested that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> distinct from O.gorgasi. In a 2009 paper, R.S. Voss and Weksler examined the two and concluded that they represented the same species {{on the basis of}} direct comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant tree placed O.curasoae and O.gorgasi sister to each other and closer to O.couesi than to the marsh rice rat. Accordingly, they placed O.curasoae as a junior synonym of the earlier described O.gorgasi.|$|E
5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{applies to}} any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements. Any Euclidean domain {{is a unique}} factorization domain (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the GCD domains, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a principal ideal domain (PID), an integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.|$|E
5|$|This {{doctrine}} {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing {{a certain number of}} buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} fearless in defence of its nest and young, and, like other Strix owls, strikes for the intruder's head with its sharp talons.

Dogs, cats and humans may be assaulted, sometimes without provocation. Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer Eric Hosking, who lost his left eye when struck by a bird he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. He later called his autobiography An Eye for a Bird.|$|E

5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible.

A small set of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E
5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E
