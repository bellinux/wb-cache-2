In 1984, Shabazz was given a new title, Director of Institutional Advancement and Public Affairs; she held that position at the college until her death.|$|E
5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had shown {{her father in}} a shop window a few days earlier.

In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|The passion {{she showed}} for Abigail, and the {{stubborn}} refusal to dismiss her, angered Sarah {{to the point}} that she implied that a lesbian affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah {{was the only one who}} refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anne <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.|$|E

5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|Gerty Theresa Radnitz {{was born}} into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896. Her father, Otto Radnitz, was a chemist who became manager of sugar {{refineries}} after inventing a successful method for refining sugar. Her mother, Martha, a friend of Franz Kafka, was a culturally sophisticated woman. Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls, and at the age of 16 she <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> wanted to be a medical doctor. Pursuing the study of science, Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Over the course of a year, she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin, five years of science, and five years of math.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Tarkovsky {{wanted his}} ex-wife, Irma Raush, as Hari. After meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, however, {{he decided that}} she was a better actress for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson {{accepted}} her salary in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I. Half-a-year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari after all.|$|E

5|$|While {{growing up}} in Calgary, Sing {{attended}} numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother. She knew {{she wanted to be}} a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children. As a teenager, Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time. Bret Hart, however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts. During a trip to Hawaii in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> wanted to pursue the sport. She later wrote to Mildred Burke, after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information, and sent her a biography and photo. Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in Encino, California.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well {{enough for him to}} believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E

25|$|In March 1981, 22-year-old Keryn Barnes, an {{aspiring}} actress from Georgia {{who had been}} the Carsons' roommate in San Francisco, was found dead in their shared apartment. She had been stabbed thirteen times and her skull crushed before being wrapped in a blanket and hidden in the basement.

25|$|Batwoman and Bat-Girl {{were created}} to be romantic {{interests}} for Batman and Robin, respectively, as well as wannabe crime-fighting associates. Bat-Girl appeared seven times between 1961 and 1964, but then disappeared in 1964 (along with Batwoman, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite) when new Batman editor, Julius Schwartz, <b>decided</b> <b>she</b> and other characters were too silly. It has been suggested by scholars that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and Bat-Girl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute allegations of homosexuality in Batman comics; specifically, the enduring claim that Batman and Robin were homosexuals.|$|E
