5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested {{that he would have}} a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar <b>in</b> <b>stature</b> to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar <b>in</b> <b>stature</b> to Robinson.|$|E

The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.|$|E

40|$|OBECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the occurrence of}} short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> school-aged children {{would be the same}} as that found in under-five year olds in terms of prevalence and some risk factors. METHODS: The sample consisted of 894 school-aged children (from 6 to 12 year-olds) and of 2. 078 under-five year olds. Pearson's c 2 test of association was employed to verify the association between short stature and possible risk factors in each of the groups investigated. The equality of proportions test was used to verify the differences in prevalence of short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> each age group, and an explanatory multivariate model of the short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> the under-five year olds was adjusted. RESULTS: Taking into account the entire sample, the proportion of short stature amongst school-aged children (16. 9 %) was significantly greater than amongst under-five year olds (12. 1 %). The multivariate model showed that short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> school-aged children, the per capita income and the mother's educational level and age, were the factors that best explained short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> the under-five year olds. CONCLUSION: In urban areas of the State of Pernambuco, the height/age indicator may be indicative of co-linearity between school-aged children and under-five year olds. The occurrence of short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> school-aged children was the main predictive factor of short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> under-five year old siblings...|$|R

5|$|While Jenner was alive, {{very few}} people knew of him, {{and the effects of}} his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely.

5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of Orion is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros.

It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} Orion and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E

40|$|Background: There was no {{large-scale}} population {{survey on}} {{the prevalence of}} short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> Anhui province yet. To further acquainting the epidemiological character of teenage children short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> Anhui province, and to provide basis for exploring reasonable intervention measure about children’s height, we took this survey on short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> primary and middle school students of Anhui province. Methods: Twelve thousand nine primary and secondary school students in urban and rural aged from 7 to 18 years were recruited. The comparison of short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> different genders, regions and age groups was done according to genetic metabolic endocrine group of pediatrics branch in Chinese Medical Association (CMA). Results: The average detection rate of short <b>stature</b> <b>in</b> primary and middle school students was 3. 16 % in Anhui province. The detection rate was higher in rural area than in urban area, higher in economic backward area than in economic developed areas.
