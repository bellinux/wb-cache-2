40|$|Africa, and in {{particular}} sub-Saharan Africa, stands out as facing tremendous difficulties in achieving even modest progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Today, over 46 % of Africans live in absolute poverty—a figure that is steadily rising. Life expectancy has fallen further to 46 years; in some countries to below 35 years. Child mortality and malnutrition, HIV/AIDS and other diseases continue to paralyse social and economic development. In this dire situation, innovative and <b>diversified</b> <b>interventions</b> are needed, including support to growth sectors in local economies. Fisheries, clearly, do not hold all {{the answers to the}} vexed questions about achieving the MDGs in Africa, but they do offer a key entry point to reach millions of poor people on the continent and to assist them to increase their income, improve the nutrition and health of their families, and become active agents of economic development and social change. Fish already makes a vital contribution to the food and nutritional security of 200 million Africans and provides income for over 10 million mostly small-scale fishers, farmers and entrepreneurs engaged in fish production, processing and trade. In addition, fish has become a leading export commodity for Africa, with an annual export value of US $ 2. 7 bn. Yet these benefits are at risk as the exploitation of natural fish stocks is reaching limits, fisheries management and trade increasingly target global markets, and aquaculture ha...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHealth related {{quality of}} life (HRQOL) can better reflect changes in {{acquired}} immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients and inform economic evaluation of AIDS treatment services, and the assessment of HRQOL can help us to detect problems that may influence the progression of the disease, hence HRQOL has become a particularly important assessment indictor for HIV comprehensive interventions. Being a multi-angle, multi-level, and <b>diversified</b> complex <b>intervention,</b> roles of Chinese medicine (CM) in AIDS treatment have been recognized and accepted by more and more patients, and HRQOL has been widely {{used to evaluate the}} comprehensive management effects of CM on AIDS. In this article, the authors analyze the definition and measurement of HRQOL, measurement of HRQOL of HIV/AIDS patients and effects of CM on AIDS, and give some reasonable advices for the usage of the scale of HRQOL. The authors hold that some new HRQOL instruments specific for CM treatment of AIDS should be developed and further prospective studies should be carried out to demonstrate the practicality, reliability and validity of HRQOL as an evaluation indictor for CM treatment of AIDS...|$|R

40|$|Aims: This study {{aimed to}} {{classify}} alcohol-dependent outpatients {{on the basis}} of clinical factors and to verify if the resulting types show different treatment retention. Methods: The sample comprised 332 alcoholics that were enrolled in three different pharmacological trials carried out at Sao Paulo University, Brazil. Based on four clinical factors problem drinking onset age, familial alcoholism, alcohol dependence severity, and depression - K-means cluster analysis was performed by using the average silhouette width to determine the number of clusters. A direct logistic regression was performed to analyze the influence of clusters, medication groups, and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance in treatment retention. Results: Two clusters were delineated. The cluster characterized by earlier onset age, more familial alcoholism, higher alcoholism severity, and less depression symptoms showed a higher chance of discontinuing the treatment, independently of medications used and AA attendance. Participation in AA was significantly related to treatment retention. Discussion: Health services should broaden the scope of services offered to meet heterogeneous needs of clients, and identify treatment practices and therapists which improve retention. Information about patients' characteristics linked to dropout should be used to make treatment programs more responsive and attractive, combining pharmacological agents with more intensive and <b>diversified</b> psychosocial <b>interventions.</b> Copyright (C) 2012 S.

40|$|AbstractObjective: One of {{the factors}} {{associated}} with low rates of compliance in the treatment for alcoholism {{seems to be the}} intensity of craving for alcohol. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between alcohol craving and biopsychosocial addiction model-related variables and to verify whether these variables could predict treatment retention. Methods: The sample consisted of 257 male alcoholics who were enrolled in two different pharmacological trials conducted at the Universidade de São Paulo in Brazil. Based on four factors measured at baseline – biological (age, race, and family alcoholism), psychiatric (depression symptoms), social (financial and marital status), and addiction (craving intensity, severity of alcohol dependence, smoking status, drinking history, preferential beverage, daily intake of alcohol before treatment) – direct logistic regression was performed to analyze these factors’ influence on treatment retention after controlling for medication groups and AA attendance. Results: Increasing age, participation in Alcoholics Anonymous groups, and beer preference among drinkers were independently associated with higher treatment retention. Conversely, higher scores for depression increased dropout rates. Conclusion: Health services should identify the treatment practices and therapists that improve retention. Information about patients’ characteristics linked to dropouts should be studied to render treatment programs more responsive and attractive, combining pharmacological agents with more intensive and <b>diversified</b> psychosocial <b>interventions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the governmental {{draft of the}} Act on counteracting threats of sexual offences. It assumes {{the creation of the}} Registry of Sex Offenders in a version with a limited access and a version available to the public. The registry is supplemented with a publically available map of sexual crime threats, which includes the places of sexual offences and the places of residence of offenders. Criticising the proposed solutions, the authors point out the lack of integration with other interventions conducted in Poland against sex offenders, noncompliance with the recommendations of the most important expert circles in the field, as well as the research results showing the lack of effectiveness of the planned measures to reduce sexual offences. A number of negative consequences of making the sex offenders’ data available to the public was also highlighted {{in the form of a}} clear deterioration of social rehabilitation prognoses, additional stigmatisation, as well as social exclusion of the offenders themselves and the victims of sexual violence. The summary emphasises the need to counteract the problem of sexual offences in a systematic way and the need to <b>diversify</b> the <b>interventions</b> undertaken against the offenders, depending on the level of risk of sexual recidivism...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years, the {{juvenile}} justice system in Romania has faced many difficulties which have determined, experimentally at least, the change of the emphasis laid upon the model of retributive (official) justice and the adoption of a new model based upon the increasing role played by community in the justice act and, complementarily, in the activities meant to re-socialize and re-insert juvenile offenders. In this context, more and more specialists of this field have got aware of the necessity of change with respect to criminal law policies meant for the punishment and treatment of juvenile offenders in Romania, by <b>diversifying</b> the <b>intervention</b> and prevention modalities of action conducted by the institutions meant to socialize and control youth from a social point of view, and especially by introducing principles and practices of restorative justice within the criminal law. The latter are meant to lead to the implication of community in the criminal law system and to an increasing number of juvenile offenders who should profit by punishments which are non-liberty-privative. The experience of many countries has demonstrated that the introduction of restorative justice practices within juvenile legislation may become on long term a living alternative to retributive justice. Both systems can function in parallell, thus offering much more efficient solutions to the problems concerning juvenile crime and punishments meant for juvenile offenders...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{incidence}} of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) {{has led to}} a surge in the number of children needing autism interventions. This paper is a call to clinicians to <b>diversify</b> autism <b>interventions</b> and to promote the use of embodied music-based approaches to facilitate multisystem development. Approximately 12 % of all autism interventions and 45 % of all alternative treatment strategies in schools involve music-based activities. Evidence suggests that musical training significantly impacts various forms of development including communication, social-emotional, motor, and behavioral development, in children with ASDs, typically developing individuals, and children with other neurological disabilities such as dyslexia and intellectual disabilities. In this review, we first highlight mechanisms and evidence for how music and movement interventions can enhance communication, social-emotional, behavioral, and motor skills in individuals with autism. We will support our claims by reviewing results from brain imaging studies in children with autism that provide neuroanatomical evidence for the effects of music therapies in autism. We will also discuss the critical elements and the different types of music therapy approaches commonly used in pediatric neurological populations including autism. We provide strong arguments for the use of music and movement interventions as a multisystem treatment tool for children with ASDs. Finally, we also make recommendations for assessment and treatment of children with ASDs, and provide directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a preliminary comparative {{analysis of the}} learning experiences of students from The Smith Family 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 Learning for Life 2 ̆ 7 (LFL) program and other students from low socio-economic backgrounds. The analysis is {{based on data from}} a survey of Year 11 LFL students conducted in 2001. The LFL program provides financial and educational support to disadvantaged families and their children. It aims to assist students to participate in mainstream school activities and improve their 2 ̆ 7 life opportunities and self-esteem 2 ̆ 7 in an attempt to break the cycle of disadvantage. The findings for LFL students are compared with results from a comparable group of Year 11 students that participated in the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth (LSAY), a major national survey conducted annually by the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER). Two key issues are examined in the paper: (1) how students evaluate their school and classroom experiences; and (2) whether students experience serious learning problems. The comparisons are drawn along two polarised issues: the factors contributing to differences among students with strong positive attitudes towards school and learning; and examining students with serious learning problems. The findings question the common assumption that students from low socioeconomic backgrounds are a homogenous group. A diversity of factors were found to influence attitudes towards learning and education and to impact on learning difficulties. The implications of these findings highlight the need to continue to <b>diversify</b> school-based <b>intervention</b> programs for students from disadvantaged backgrounds...|$|R

Some claim; it cannot effectively influence audiences to behave and use products and services, others questions marketing approach applicability in the health field and most argued about the non government organization involvement in sales and marketing of health programs. The general objective {{of this study is}} to assess Population Services International’s practice of social marketing: identify the company practice of social marketing, determine the applicability to health, identify potential challenges, and to identify how the company measure its impact and interventions. This study was exploratory and descriptive in nature in order to gain in-depth information about the problem under investigation. This is an organizational-based, cross-sectional, formative assessment that exclusively employed qualitative research methods. The study revealed that social marketing is an easy way to tackle health problems and other social change activities since the interventions are focused and targeted in all aspects. In addition, social marketing ensures the sustainability of such interventions by engaging the private sector and sharing the burden of diseases with interested stakeholders by utilizing income generating activities. However, PSI/E is weak in the public relations and communication of its social marketing interventions to government officials and other stakeholders, and that weakness creates confusion among external customers. The organization also lacks marketing and sales professionals and is outweighed by the health professionals with less marketing knowledge and experience. PSI has a huge opportunity to <b>diversify</b> its <b>interventions</b> by using more marketing approaches. Therefore, in order apply the social marketing approach in a more successful way, PSI/E should do structured public relations, advocacy and sensitization workshops and involve more marketing professionals to get buy-in and support from the local government and other stakeholders as well for better marketing strategy design...|$|R

40|$|Defense date: 25 / 06 / 2010 Examining Board: Mads ANDENAS (University of Oslo) Marise CREMONA (EUI) Christian JOERGES (Supervisor, former EUI and University of Bremen) Ellen VOS (University of Maastricht) This thesis aims {{to present}} a {{critical}} legal perspective on the current direction of European Union (EU) food safety regulation. Through an analysis of three regulatory mechanismsmutual recognition, scientific risk analysis and standardisation-combined with {{a study of the}} evolution of food legislation in the EU, I seek to show how the current framework fails to face new challenges, such as the globalization of world trade and the last two enlargements. In particular, the thesis focuses upon the case of a newly acceded EU member state, namely Poland. The main argument presented in the thesis is that an enlarged and more diversified Europe must not disregard the numerous socio-economic implications of market regulation. If not properly acknowledged and reflected in the regulatory scheme, the mismatch between market regulation and socio-economic factors can lead to a kind of gradual "disembedding" of the regulatory framework, in the Polanyian sense of the term. This is of critical importance as the EU project is not one-dimensionally geared towards securing greater European unity, but equally concerned with preserving unique European diversity-in the field of food as well as in other aspects. I am thus suggesting that the existing regulatory approach can be opened up to include a wider set of relevant socio-economic implications, allowing for protection of diversity while aiming for greater homogeneity. The legal system for the regulation of food can be rebalanced to become more flexible and responsive by shifting the use of existing regulatory mechanisms, in order to <b>diversify</b> regulatory <b>intervention.</b> First, this would require improvement of application of the risk analysis model, in order to guarantee inclusion of valid socio-economic concerns in the decision-making process. Second, it would also entail reliance on managed mutual recognition in those areas where protection of diversity does not collide with protection of consumers (for example, where either longstanding trust has been available or national codes have provided sufficient safety guarantees), and where consequently imposition of strict standardization is not necessary. Due to legitimate concerns with crisis, the regulatory framework for food in Europe has generated a bias against diversity leading to unforeseen and unintended consequences. This thesis argues that this need not be so...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo sobre os primeiros anos de atividades da Sociedade das Casas de Asilo da Infância Desvalida firmou-se na exploração do arquivo da instituição, denominada desde há poucos anos Fundação D. Pedro IV. Ela orientou-se pela filantropia, seguindo as tendências manifestadas pelas classes hegemônicas européias, sobretudo em França, tendo à sua frente o ex-Imperador do Brasil, que regressou a Lisboa após a derrota dos absolutistas. As Casas de Asilo tinham uma fisionomia própria que se distinguia das salles d'asile. No intuito de acharem um rumo ajustado às necessidades da sociedade portuguesa, os animadores da iniciativa começaram por criar uma "escola de ensino". Colhidos os primeiros frutos da experiência, o movimento das Casas de Asilo começou a difundir-se pelo país e a diversificar as suas intervenções. Embora destinadas a um público de crianças provenientes de famílias muito pobres ou indigentes, em idade pré-escolar, essas instituições configuravam as escolas de Primeiras Letras, mas incluíam no currículo atividades educativas, manuais ou artísticas, e de educação social, visando à integração de seu público. Apesar disso, essa experiência de educação infantil não logrou desprender-se da tradição escolarizante que a marcava.

40|$|This {{latest edition}} of the annual report {{includes}} {{provides an overview of}} migration from both the global perspective and through six regional chapters. Migration is a constant and dynamic phenomenon increasingly requiring <b>diversified</b> policy <b>intervention</b> in order to maximize its potential benefits and minimize related costs for both countries of origin and destination as well as migrants themselves. Better knowledge and enhanced capacities in different policy areas are essential to ensure the protection of migrants, the facilitation of legal migration, the integration of migrants into the country of destination, the support for sustainable voluntary return and the greater interlinking between migration and development. The challenge remains in translating improved understandings into policy and practice on the ground. State capacities around the world for managing migration are limited. Legal frameworks may need to be updated or overhauled to focus on new areas of migration, or to handle new influxes or outflows of migrants; staff working on the front line may need equipment, training and support; civil society and migrants themselves may not be adequately integrated into the process of data-gathering and making and implementing policy; vulnerability factors and health risks inherent to the migration process need to be better understood and addressed. International migration is likely to transform in scale, reach and complexity, due to growing demographic disparities, the effects of environmental change, new global political and economic dynamics, technological revolutions and social networks. These transformations will be associated with increasing opportunities, exacerbate existing problems and generate new challenges. The World Migration Report 2010 provides a tool for self-evaluation in terms of future scenarios, and demonstrates the need for a far more comprehensive approach to capacity-building for migration than has typically been adopted. The aim is not to prescribe ‘one-size-fits-all’ policies and practices, but to suggest objectives of migration management policies in each area, to stimulate thinking and provide examples of what States and other actors can do. Part A of the report focuses on identifying core capacities in key areas of migration management, raising key concepts and outlining important examples of existing practices in these areas. Part B provides an overview of migration in the world today, from both the global perspective and through six regional chapters, drawn from the most up-to-date data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} may {{be located}} in the wide debate on the effectiveness of policy interventions in developing countries, in the field of natural resource management (NRM). It is especially concerned with contributing {{to the understanding of the}} limited effectiveness of fishery management interventions in the municipality of Grand-Popo in Benin, where fishing people face fishery resource depletion and livelihood degradation. It looks at this topic from a learning perspective, and explores a way of stimulating learning and effectiveness with an action research approach. Building on Argyris and Schön (1976), the study contributes to discussions on learning in NRM by regarding learning as changes in action theories operationalized as the integration of specific micro-theories or micro-assumptions underlying stakeholders’ actions. Also novel is the experimentation with and evaluation of a responsive evaluation (RE) as an action research approach in the fishery context of Grand-Popo. To account for the research process and findings, this dissertation is structured around six chapters. Chapter 1 is the general introduction which discusses the background information justifying the research choices, the research objectives and questions, and the methodology that was used to answer the research questions. It explores possible reasons for the limited effectiveness of interventions in natural resource management (NRM). The conclusion is that NRM interventions are affected negatively by various limitations in the sphere of perspectives and understanding. Limited understandings of NRM complexity, limitations in interactions for exchange among stakeholders, differences in management action theories and practices, multiplicity and lack of coordination of interventions explain among others the ineffectiveness of NRM interventions. Therefore the study proposed to explore whether the limited effectiveness of generations of interventions in Grand-Popo is indeed related to limited learning. As there appeared to be scope to enhance learning, the study continued with the design, experimentation with and evaluation of a RE process. To deepen the understanding of the learning related to the problems faced by the fishing people and interventionists in the case study, the process of learning in generations of interventions was investigated and discussed in chapter 2. To redress fishery resources’ depletion and improve the fragile livelihoods of fishing people, successive interventions since the 1950 s continued to propose solutions such as income generating activities’ diversification and the establishment of fishing rules. This chapter reveals that fishery interventions were repeatedly ineffective, because of limited learning which was interpreted as repetitive discrepancy between espoused and in-use action theories of the interventionists. Therefore, we suggested to facilitate learning interaction among the stakeholders towards more effectiveness of the fishery management interventions. To develop a good action research approach to stimulate learning, in chapter 3, the study was extended to the unfolding of the action theories of the interventions’ beneficiaries, for the sake of comparing them with those of the interventionists. It shows ambiguity in the fishery problems solving action theories of the interventionists and the fishing people; power differences among the stakeholders; and, the absence of learning interactions among the stakeholders.   RE was chosen, since this is an evaluation approach that addresses such conditions. However, this approach needed to be adapted to the study context. The main adaptations compared to ‘regular’ RE related to the operationalization of learning in terms of changes in action theories, the investigation of action theories in-use in addition to those espoused, and the inclusion of an analysis of the history and the intervention system to deal with routine and complexity of NRM, and to stimulate high level learning. These adaptations led to what is called the contextualised RE approach in this chapter. In order to assess the relevance and performance of the proposed RE approach, we experimented with it in the fishery case study of Grand-Popo. Chapter 4 reports on how and the extent to which it contributed to learning by and among the interventionists and fishing people involved. This chapter reveals the occurrence of single-loop, double-loop, and social learning, but also a remaining gap between changes in espoused theories and theories in use. The single-loop learning concerned changes in action strategies like the extent of the fishing people’s demands, and the intervention resource raising strategy of the interventionists. The double-loop learning addressed the underlying reasons for action such as the redefinition of the roles played in intervention processes. The fishing people redefined their own roles as more active to show concern for solving their problems, to <b>diversify</b> their <b>intervention</b> partners, and to lobby for solutions. The interventionists suggested that they needed to empower the fishing people to lobby with politicians and financial partners in collaboration with interventionists about their problems. The social learning concerned emergent congruence in the action theories of the two stakeholder categories with regard to the need for mutual commitment to the effective solving of the fishery problems. The gaps between espoused and in-use action theories related to the complexity of NRM in this case and survival threats. We concluded that it may be difficult for RE to stimulate learning in NRM and provided some suggestions to improve its use. Chapter 5 goes into depth about exploring the reasons for the limitations in the learning notwithstanding the RE process. It discusses which issues were sensitive for the interventionists and the fishing people, and how they presented them in different interaction settings of the adapted RE approach (interviews, meetings). It discusses which discursive strategies the stakeholders employed to put their issues on the agenda in the meetings with the other stakeholder groups. It shows that some sensitive issues that were mentioned during the interviews, were not discussed at all, while others were discussed with indirect discursive strategies. The sensitive issues were: expectations of the fishing people unfulfilled by the interventionists; prevalence of material interests of the interventionists and the fishing people over concerns of effective interventions; compliance of the interventionists with the electoral concerns of politicians; corruption practices of the interventionists; and physical and occult aggressiveness of the fishing people. The discursive strategies used by the interventionists and the fishing people were silence and indirect discursive strategies. This chapter suggests the necessity of paying attention to discursive strategies and sensitive issues that may hinder learning in natural resource management (NRM) facilitation settings. Chapter 6 recalls the research questions, summarizes and discusses the major findings, and concludes the dissertation with lessons and implications for policy and practice in NRM and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The reasons for the limitations in learning by the interventionists and the fishing people were explored on the basis of relevant literature. They related to the opportunities to learn offered by the environment, the motivation and the capacity to learn of the interventionists and the fishing people, and to the level of complexity of the NRM context. Based on the analyses of the reasons for the limitations in learning by the interventionists and the fishing people, this chapter suggests a two track approach. The first track relates to working towards a more conducive learning environment, and the second to further improving the design of RE. It suggests to create and institutionalize incentives and mechanisms to train and raise awareness about the importance of, and to support feedback generating, exchanging, capturing and learning by stakeholders. This chapter suggests also to create incentive structure for implementers of policies and projects that rewards effectiveness and sanctions a lack of performance. In the second track, flexible learning strategies are seen to help improving the performance of the design of further RE in NRM context. To these ends, inclusive monitoring and evaluation, audio-visual learning stimulation strategies, action oriented learning strategy, and the training of evaluators on strategies to get sensitive issues on discussion and learning agendas are suggested. In all, the thesis demonstrates that limitations in learning are prevalent in Grand-Popo, and likely undermine the effectiveness of (series of) NRM interventions. It makes clear that we should not have naïve expectations about the potential of systematic approaches and methodologies to foster learning, and that creating more conducive conditions for learning should be a first priority...|$|R
