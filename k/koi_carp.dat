40|$|Abstract—Burst-and-coast is {{the most}} common {{locomotion}} type in freely routine swimming of <b>koi</b> <b>carps</b> (Cyprinus carpio <b>koi),</b> which consists of a burst phase and a coast phase in each cycle and mostly leads to a straight-line trajectory. Combining with the tracking experiment, the flow physics of <b>koi</b> <b>carp’s</b> burst-and-coast swimming is investigated using a novel integrated CFD method solving the body-fluid interaction problem. The dynamical equations of a deforming body are formulated. Following that, the loose-coupled equations of the body dynamics and the fluid dynamics are numerically solved with the integrated method. The two burst modes, MT (Multiple Tail-beat) and HT (Half Tail-beat), which have been reported by the experiments, are investigated by numerical simulations in this paper. The body kinematics is predicted and the flow physics is visualized, which are in good agreement with the corresponding experiments. Furthermore, the optimization on the energy cost and several critical control mechanisms in burst-and-coast swimming of <b>koi</b> <b>carps</b> are explored, by varying the parameters in its self-propelled swimming. In this paper, energetics is measured by the two mechanical quantities, total output power CP and Froude efficiency Fr. Results and discussion show that from the standpoint of mechanical energy, burst-and-coast swimming does not actually save energy comparing with steady swimming at the same average speed, in that frequently changing of speed leads to decrease of efficiency.

40|$|Japanese <b>carp</b> or <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> (Cyprinus carpio koi) – is a freshwater, {{partially}} {{saltwater fish}} {{which is a}} decorative subspecies of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) namely a primary black form of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> that has its domestic name Magoi. Constant complex activity of abiotic and biotic factors together with husbandry and selectional activity of human caused significant changes in water ecosystems that impacted on the biology of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> subspecies (Cyprinus carpio koi) {{and as a result}} caused the species-specific morphological adaptations in fish. Collection of materials was conducted from ornamental water ponds at the territory of Nemishaievo state agrotechnical college in the spring 2012. Author selected 3000 units of this year fish offsprings of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> with different colors. All the studied fish was divided into groups according to external indexes (among them color) in the following way: group I (sample) – grey and white form (Hikarimuji which is the most similar to Magoi), group II – black and white form (Kumonryu), group III – black and yellow form (Utsurimono), group IV – red and white form (Kohaku). For further researches scientists selected 25 exemplars of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> for each group. It is necessary to have a starting point (sample) for statistical research of differences in <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> forms. Sample or optimal form was determined by distances of deviations of scalar sums of form vectors of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> from nyvkivskyi <b>carp.</b> Morphometric study of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> was conducted according to 30 plastic attributes, in accordance with method proposed by I. F. Pravdin. In contrast with generally accepted relative magnitudes of indexes of plastic attributes of <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> body were calculated from zoological (not standard) length of the body of the fish that is connected with using koi as an object of decorative aquaculture. Statistic processing was conducted with using of average arithmetical discrepancy, root-mean-square error and variability index. Actuality of variances of morphometric indexes of fish from different groups is mathematically approved by Student’s index-criterion. Variances were considered to be valid if Student’s criterion exceeded 2, 68 at insurance level of magnitude α = 0, 01 that is accepted as an ample for majority of biological objects. By comparison of different <b>carp</b> <b>koi</b> (Cyprinus carpio koi) forms researchers used Mayr’s coefficient of resolution. (CD). It is evident that the less curves of two compared populations are lapped over, the more difference is between middle М 1 and М 2 divided by sum of middle quadric deviations σ 1 і σ 2. Coefficient of directive deviation (Кdv) characterizes percentage deviation of two compared indexes of particular attribute. For deviation determination (Кdv) between the index, the difference between an attribute A and the same attribute of sample index E is necessary to divide by index of attribute E and multiply by 100...|$|R

Since then it has been spreading rapidly throughout Java Island, Bali, southern part of Sumatra, East Kalimantan and Central Sulawesi. The disease cause very high mortality (80 - 95 %) to both <b>koi</b> and common <b>carp</b> with estimated losses of more than 150 billion rupiahs (equal to US$ 15 M) as of December 2003. To prevent the spread of the outbreaks to other islands, the Government of Indonesia issued Ministerial Degrees that declared Java and Bali Islands as an isolated area of the disease and moving <b>koi</b> and <b>carp</b> from Java and Bali Islands to other islands are strictly prohibited or should follow quarantine check for KHV. In addition, importing <b>koi</b> and common <b>carp</b> is permitted only from free KHV countries.
