5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the South Dakota economy. Although other industries have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still {{very important to the}} state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of ethanol in the nation.|$|E

5|$|Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, who {{was born}} in Poland, also was a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the Seminoles' scoring offense. In his career at Florida State prior to the Sugar Bowl, Janikowski made 65 of 83field goal attempts, {{including}} 33 of his previous 38kicks of less than 50yards. Janikowski also handled kickoffs, kicking the ball so hard that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks. Janikowski was considered to have the potential to be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.|$|E

5|$|Manganese is {{essential}} to {{iron and steel production}} by virtue of its sulfur-fixing, deoxidizing, and alloying properties, as first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet (1811 - 1891) who, in 1856, introduced the element, in the form of Spiegeleisen, into steel for the specific purpose of removing excess dissolved oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus in order to improve its malleability. Steelmaking, including its ironmaking component, has accounted for most manganese demand, presently in the range of 85% to 90% of the total demand. Manganese is a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> low-cost stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{was already}} {{working on a}} <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the device. In April 1943, Robert Serber had {{proposed}} that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day half life, which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto {{to work on the}} development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the urchin detonators.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks {{on the development of}} human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E
5|$|The Boston College offense, which gained 319 {{yards per}} game on average, was ranked 94th (of 120 Football Bowl Subdivision teams) in total offense. A <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the offense was guard Cliff Ramsey, who was named a first-team All-ACC selection, {{signifying}} his status as the best player at his position in the conference. Tight end Ryan Purvis was named a second-team All-ACC selection. Quarterback Dominique Davis led the Eagles' offense on the field heading into the ACC Championship. Davis had been the second-string quarterback until a season-ending injury to starter Chris Crane. During his limited time in the regular season, Davis had three passing and two rushing touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} sighting of Lord Howe Island {{took place on}} 17 February 1788, when Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, commander of the Armed Tender HMS Supply, was en route from Botany Bay to found a penal settlement on Norfolk Island. On the return journey Ball sent a party ashore on Lord Howe Island to claim it as a British possession. It subsequently became a provisioning port for the whaling industry, and was permanently settled in June 1834. When whaling declined, the 1880s saw {{the beginning of the}} worldwide export of the endemic kentia palms, which remains a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the Island's economy. The other continuing industry, tourism, began after World War II ended in 1945.|$|E

The Medicare hospice benefit is specifically designed for end-of-life care but is an elected benefit for individuals who have a terminal diagnosis with a prognosis of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normal course. GAO was asked to identify examples of programs that provide <b>key</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> end-of-life care. Specifically, GAO (1) identified <b>key</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> end-of-life care, (2) identified and described how certain programs incorporate <b>key</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> end-of-life care, and (3) described the challenges program providers have identified to delivering the <b>key</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> end-of-life care. To identify the <b>key</b> <b>components</b> <b>of</b> end-of-life care, GAO relied on studies by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). To identify and describe programs that implement these <b>key</b> <b>components</b> and describe the challenges providers of these programs face, GAO conducted site visits to four states, Arizona, Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin, that, in addition to other criteria, demonstrated a high use of end-of-life services.

5|$|Trade was a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> Maya society, {{and in the}} {{development}} of the Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's {{military}} strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom's imperial defence policy. The Singapore strategy, which seemingly negated the need for large-scale land forces in the Pacific, was a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> this policy and consequently most Australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed {{an integral part of the}} Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions dispatched to the Middle East were subsequently heavily involved in the fighting that followed. In addition to the force which was sent to North Africa, two AIF brigades (the 18th and 25th) were stationed in Britain from June1940 to January1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings. An Australian Army forestry group also served in Britain between 1940 and 1943.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home is {{assisting}} in research towards preventing some viruses, such as influenza and HIV, from recognizing and entering biological cells. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme RNase H, a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Mets' lead {{began to}} dissipate, as the Phillies {{combined}} several solid series; Rollins was a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> their success. Rollins {{was named the}} National League Player of the Week for August 27 to September 2, 2007. On September 25 against the Atlanta Braves, Rollins hit the home run that completed his 30–30 season. On {{the last day of}} the 2007 season, Rollins became the seventh player to collect at least 20 doubles, 20 triples, and 20 home runs in one season when he hit his 20th triple of the year in a 6–1 win over the Washington Nationals that clinched the National League East division championship for the Phillies, which confirmed Rollins' preseason assertion of the Phillies preeminence. The club advanced to the playoffs for the first time since their 1993 World Series loss; however, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Rollins {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as an excellent defensive shortstop. In July 2001, Rollins became the Phillies' leadoff hitter, a role he retained for almost ten years. He made three All-Star Game appearances early in his career. While a Phillie, Rollins compiled a 38-game hitting streak, which spanned the end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season, the longest in team history. Rollins was named the National League Most Valuable Player in 2007, as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive seasons. He was also a <b>key</b> <b>component</b> <b>of</b> the 2008 World Series champion team. In his final season with the Phillies, he became the franchise's all-time leader in hits.
