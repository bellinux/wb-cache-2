5000|$|MoCl5 is {{a strong}} oxidant. It is reduced by MeCN to afford an orange complex, MoCl4(MeCN)2, which in turn reacts with THF to give MoCl4(THF)2, a {{precursor}} to other molybdenum-containing complexes. MoCl5 is reduced by HBr to form MoBr4. The bromination reaction is conducted in <b>ethylbromide</b> at −50 °C, forming MoBr5 as an intermediate. Upon warming to 20 °C, Br2 is produced and the formal oxidation state of molybdenum changes from +5 to +4. The net transformation {{is shown in the}} equation: ...|$|E

Keywords:N-[3 -[3 -(dimethyl amino) - 1 -oxo- 2 -propenyl]phenyl] acetamide, N-[3 -[3 -(p-chlorophenylamino) - 1 -oxo- 2 -propenyl] phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide, 3 -amino- 4 -cyano pyrazole, N-[3 -(3 -Cyano pyrazolo [1, 5 -a] Pyrimidin- 7 -yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide, Zaleplon) ...|$|E
40|$|A 1, 6 -dichlorohexane-degrading {{strain of}} Acinetobacter sp. was {{isolated}} from activated sludge. The organism could grow with and quantitatively release halide from 1, 6 -dichlorohexane, 1, 9 -dichlorononane, 1 -chloropentane, 1 -chlorobutane, 1 -bromopentane, <b>ethylbromide,</b> and 1 -iodopropane. Crude extracts contained an inducible novel dehalogenase that liberated halide {{from the above}} compounds and also from 1, 3 -dichloropropane, 1, 2 -dibromoethane, and 2 -bromoethanol. The latter two compounds were toxic suicide substrates for the organism at concentrations of 10 and 5 µM, respectively. Mutants resistant to 1, 2 -dibromoethane (3 mM) lacked dehalogenase activity and did not utilize haloalkanes for growth. Mutants resistant to both 1, 2 -dibromoethane (3 mM) and 2 -bromoethanol (30 mM) could no longer oxidize or utilize alcohols and were capable of hydrolytic dehalogenation of 1, 2 -dibromoethane to ethylene glycol. ...|$|E
40|$|Native 5 -HT 3 and AChR ligand-gated cation {{channels}} can be inhibited (blocked) by the non-steroidal antioestrogentamoxifen. However, {{the exact}} site and mechanism of inhibition by tamoxifen on these channels remain unclear. We haveinvestigated {{the action of}} the membrane impermeant quaternary derivative, <b>ethylbromide</b> tamoxifen (EBT), on native ligandgated 5 -HT 3 receptor channels and voltage-gated K+ channels in NG 108 - 15 cells using whole cell patch clamp. ExtracellularEBT inhibited whole cell cationic currents of 5 -HT 3 receptors with IC 50 of 0. 22 þ 0. 4 WM (nH = 1. 05 þ 0. 2). The channel blockwas characterised by voltage independent and use independent behaviour (similar to that of tamoxifen). EBT was unable toinhibit voltage-gated K+ currents in NG 108 - 15 cells. This was in contrast to the inhibition by tamoxifen which, at similarconcentrations, accelerated the apparent inactivation of these outward K+ currents. The inhibition of 5 -HT 3 receptors by amembrane impermeant derivative of tamoxifen supports the view that the binding site for antioestrogens is extracellular andthe inhibition is not mediated through genomic/transcriptional activit...|$|E
