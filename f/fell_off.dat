40|$|AbstractA {{monolithic}} integrated bimaterial micro-cantilever resonant {{infrared sensor}} with on-chip auxiliary circuits was fabricated and tested. Surface micromachining method for cantilever fabrication has been merged with conventional CMOS process, and release of MEMS structure is conducted after CMOS process. Both the Cr/Au <b>felling</b> <b>off</b> the polysilicon cantilever during releasing {{process and the}} performance degradation of MOSFETs manufactured by standard CMOS or post-CMOS process are ascribed to the additive effects of hydrogen and mechanical stress. A novel post-CMOS process was raised to decrease the mechanical stress and to retain the metal layer of Cr/Au. On-chip digital/analog Bi-CMOS circuits function properly as demonstrated...|$|R

Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult. In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the War Manpower Commission. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.|$|E

60|$|A slight stir {{animated}} the faces, and a faint murmur {{ran along}} the line of paddlers.

60|$|The bows of {{the ship}} <b>fell</b> heavily <b>off,</b> and her stern pressed up towards the wind; but the trifling delay so much {{augmented}} the risk, that nothing saved the vessel but {{the formation of the}} run and counter, which, by receding as usual, allowed room to escape the dangerous point, as the Montauk hove by on a swell.|$|R
