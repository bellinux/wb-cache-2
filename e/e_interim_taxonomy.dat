5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an <b>interim</b> <b>taxonomy</b> of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|R

40|$|Tirole (1982) is {{commonly}} interpreted as proving that bubbles are impossible with finitely many rational traders with common priors. We study a simple variation of his {{model in which}} bubbles can occur, even though traders have common priors and common knowledge that the asset has no fundamental value. In equilibrium, agents purchase the asset at successively higher prices until the bubble “bursts” and no subsequent trade occurs. Each trader's initial wealth determines the last date at which he could possibly trade. The date at which the bubble bursts {{is a function of}} these finite “truncation dates” for the individual traders. Since initial wealth is private information, no trader knows when the bubble will burst. There are two key differences between our model and Tirole's which enable us to construct equilibrium bubbles this way. First, Tirole requires ex ante optimality, while we only require every trader's strategy to be optimal conditional on his information — i. <b>e.,</b> <b>interim</b> optimal. As we argue in the text, this would seem to be the relevant definition of optimality. Second, Tirole considers competitive equilibria, while we analyze a simple bargaining game...|$|R

40|$|EEG-feedback, {{also called}} neurofeedback, is a {{training}} procedure aimed at altering brain activity, {{and is used}} as a treatment for disorders like Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Studies have reported positive effects of neurofeedback on attention and other dependent variables. However, double-blind studies including a sham neurofeedback control group are lacking. The inclusion of such group is crucial to control for unspecific effects. The current work presents a sham-controlled, double-blind evaluation. The hypothesis was that neurofeedback enhances attention and decreases impulsive behavior. Participants (n = 27) were students selected on relatively high scores on impulsivity/inattention questionnaires (Barrat Impulsivity Scale and Broadbent CFQ). They were assigned to a neurofeedback treatment or a sham group. (sham) Neurofeedback training was planned for 15 weeks consisting of a total of 30 sessions, each lasting 22 min. Before and after 16 sessions (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>interim</b> analyses), qEEG was recorded and impulsivity and inattention was assessed using a stop signal task and reversed continuous performance task and two questionnaires. Results of the interim analyses showed that participants were blind with respect to group inclusion, but no trend towards an effect of neurofeedback on behavioral measures was observed. Therefore in line with ethical guidelines the experiment was ceased. These results implicate a possible lack of effect of neurofeedback when one accounts for non-specific effects. However, the specific form of feedback and application of the sham-controlled double-blind design may have diminished the effect of neurofeedback. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThe European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) {{consensus}} conference on mature B-cell lymphomas and {{chronic lymphocytic leukaemia}} (CLL) was held on 20 June 2015 in Lugano, Switzerland, and included a multidisciplinary panel of 25 leading experts. The aim of the conference was to develop recommendations on critical subjects difficult to consider in detail in the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines. The following areas were identified: (i) the elderly patient, (ii) prognostic factors suitable for clinical use and (iii) the 'ultra-high-risk' group. Before the conference, the expert panel was divided into three working groups; each group focused {{on one of these}} areas in order to address four clinically relevant questions relating to that topic. All relevant scientific literature, as identified by the experts, was reviewed in advance. During the {{consensus conference}}, each working group developed recommendations to address each of the four questions assigned to their group. These recommendations were then presented to the entire panel and a consensus was reached. This manuscript presents recommendations dedicated to the second area of interest, i. e. prognostic factors suitable for clinical use. The four topics [i. <b>e.</b> <b>interim</b> positron emission tomography (PET), TP 53 mutations, cell of origin (COO) and minimal residual disease (MRD) ] were primarily chosen because of the bulk of available data together with the lack of clear guidance regarding their use in clinical practice and within clinical trials. Results, including a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation, are detailed in this manuscript. The panel acknowledged that detection of TP 53 inactivation by deletion or mutation in CLL should be implemented in clinical practice (level of evidence I, strength of recommendation A). Due to their potentially high prognostic value, at least in some lymphoma entities, implementation of interim PET, COO and MRD was highly recommended in the context of clinical trials.

All calves were administered chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline in feed, {{and a majority}} of the animals (93 %) were injected with long-acting oxytetracycline upon arrival at the feedlot. Fecal samples from individual animals were collected upon arrival (i. e., entry sample), 69 days (standard deviation [SD] = 3 days) after arrival (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>interim</b> sample), and 189 days (SD = 33 days) after arrival (i. e., exit sample) at the feedlot. In total, 1, 586 Campylobacter isolates consisting of Campylobacter coli (n = 154), Campylobacter fetus (n = 994), Campylobacter jejuni (n = 431), Campylobacter hyointestinalis (n = 4), and Campylobacter lanienae (n = 3) were recovered and characterized. The administration of antimicrobials did not decrease carriage rates of campylobacters, and minimal resistance (≤ 4 %) to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, and meropenem was observed. In contrast, substantive increases in the prevalence of isolates resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline (56 to 89 %) for C. coli, C. fetus, and C. jejuni, {{as well as in the}} number of animals (7 to 42 %) from which resistant isolates were recovered, were observed during the feedlot period. Increased resistance to erythromycin (total isolates and carriages rates) was also observed in isolates of C. coli over the three isolation times. The majority of C. fetus isolates recovered were resistant to nalidixic acid, but this was independent of when they were isolated. A relatively limited number of multidrug-resistant isolates were recovered and consisted primarily of C. coli resistant to tetracyclines and erythromycin (10 % of isolates). Over the course of the feedlot period, considerable increases in antimicrobial resistance were observed in C. coli, C. fetus, and C. jejuni, but with the exception of erythromycin resistance in C. coli, the administration of antimicrobial agents to beef cattle was found to have a minimal impact on resistance to macrolides and fluoroquinolones, the two classes of antimicrobials used to treat campylobacteriosis in humans. However, the widespread use of antimicrobial agents in beef production and the possible horizontal transfer of mobile genetic elements with antimicrobial resistance determinants among Campylobacter and other bacterial taxa emphasize the need to monitor AMR development in bacteria from beef cattle...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is constructed {{to provide a}} comprehensive analysis of key factors that influence fund performance, and the methods of evaluating such performance. Our examination is from both the managerial and the investor perspectives {{in the context of}} the UK fund industry. We begin by analysing the managerial response. We examine the effectiveness of the internal monitoring and control system in UK funds, focusing on the relation between top manager turnover and the performance of UK unit trusts and OEICs. We apply a series of methods, including performance evaluation based on the factor models, percentile ranking, and sample matching tests. Funds that have experienced replacement of top managers are examined for their performance in the pre and post-replacement periods. A variety of methods are applied to measure factors that affect the probability of replacement in the pre-replacement period. Bootstrapping simulations are implemented to further examine whether UK fund companies can distinguish between poorly skilled managers and unlucky ones. It is found that many fund companies are not captivated by the ‘lucky’ managers’ extreme performance and are willing to give ‘unlucky’ managers another chance. Moreover, underperforming managers are more likely to be replaced when fund inflows are declining than are outperforming managers. Managers' adjustment of portfolio compositions exerts mixed influences on the probability of replacement. Next, we apply tournament analysis to the UK fund market. We find supportive evidence of significant risk shifting in the family tournament; i. <b>e.</b> <b>interim</b> winning managers tend to increase their levels of risk exposure more than the losing managers do. Our results also show that the risk-adjusted returns of the winners outperform those of the losers following the risk taking. As such, risk altering can be regarded as an indication of managers’ superior ability. However, the tournament behaviour can still be a costly strategy for investors, since in this case winners would be seen as beating the losers in terms of the observed returns due to deterioration in the performance of their major portfolio holdings. Finally, the thesis further examines the cross-fund learning among investors. A linear hierarchical model is constructed to consider cross-learning of the funds within a fund family in performance evaluation. We apply a full Bayesian treatment of all factors of the pricing model and allow both the fund family and individual managers to have dependent prior information regarding the funds’ alphas. The simulation results suggest that returns from peer funds within the family significantly affect investors’ updating on fund alphas, since the posterior distribution on fund alphas exhibits a faster shrinkage than is reported in the previous literature. The model is also simulated with various prior beliefs on different factors of the pricing model, i. e. fund alphas, betas and factor loadings of each pricing benchmark, to better address the learning process. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{consists}} introductory {{survey and}} three essays where investors' trading responses to interim earnings announcements are studied using Finnish data. The essays are individual papers, but their topics are closely connected since they address the trading response from different angles. The essays progress from an aggregated {{to a more}} detailed examination. The first essay was conducted on daily data, whereas {{the second and third}} consist of intraday trading data. In all three essays information asymmetry is assumed to affect trading behavior around interim earnings announcements. The first article contains empirical findings regarding the effect of interim earnings announcements on investors' trading policy using Finnish data. The aim of the paper is to investigate empirically the role of pre-disclosure information asymmetry and the information content in explaining volume responses to interim earnings announcements. Evidence is provided that the trading volume response is positively associated with the information content and to some extent with the level of pre-disclosure information asymmetry. The results are in line with the theoretical trading volume proposition. However, the significance levels are lower than in similar US studies and the association between positive and negative news is slightly asymmetric. The second article finds evidence from the Helsinki Stock Exchange that the widely documented U-shape pattern in trading activity - namely heavy trading in the beginning {{and at the end of}} the trading day and relatively light trading in the middle of the day - is affected by an anticipated information event (i. <b>e.</b> <b>interim</b> earnings announcement). Before the announcement day, trading is more concentrated at the close. This is consistent with investors' heterogeneous willingness to bear expected overnight risk, which is especially prevalent before an announcement. Moreover, a slight increase on the open is evident after the announcement day. Evidence is also provided that the change in intraday trading behavior is associated with announcement-related factors, such as the range of analysts' earnings forecasts, the magnitude of unexpected earnings and firm size. Furthermore, this association is evident to some extent during the transition between trading and non-trading regimes. The third study examines whether the permanent price effects of individual trades are greater before or after an interim earnings announcement on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. If the permanent price effects are greater before the announcement this would suggest that investors believe that some traders are better informed before the interim earnings announcement than after. Using permanent price effects as a measure of price adjustment for private information, tests were performed to see whether price adjustments are greater in pre-announcement periods than in post-announcement periods. The results, based on interim earnings releases for the period 1993 to 1997 by HSE-listed firms, suggest that large trades do indeed produce greater permanent price effects before an announcement than after it. This suggests that large trades associated with price changes (especially uptick trades) before an announcement send a stronger signal to other investors than similar trades after the announcement. For small trades the results were insignificant...|$|R

40|$|Many {{migrating}} birds divide their journeys into nocturnal flights interspersed by stopovers {{where they}} build up energy reserves (fuel) for subsequent flights. Given {{the difficulty in}} monitoring fuel loads of individual migrants over long distances, theoretical models are often used to interpret observed relations between departure fuel loads (DFLs) and fuel deposition rates (FDRs) {{in the context of}} time-minimised migration. Models applicable to nocturnal migration have hitherto considered only the departure decision, i. <b>e.</b> ignored <b>interim</b> stopover possibilities before fuel loads are depleted. This results in ‘risk-prone’ migratory schedules in terms of choice of stopover. In this study we assess ‘risk-averse’ behaviour, whereby nocturnal migrants minimise migration time by adjusting not only DFLs to experienced and expected FDRs, but also stopping fuel loads (SFLs), below which they stop to refuel at high-quality sites. We developed analytical formulae to solve for maximal risk-prone and risk-averse migration speeds in modelled environments comprised of two stopover qualities (high- and low-quality), and a constant probability of encountering a high-quality site (encounter probability). Risk-aversion was beneficial to migration speeds in over 99 % of the modelled environments, with median ratios of risk-averse to risk-prone migration speeds ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 8. Among modelled environments, this benefit increased with increasing FDRs at high-quality sites, and was highest with low probabilities of encountering high-quality sites. Time-minimising risk-averse DFLs at low-quality sites were minimal in nearly all modelled environments, and whenever encounter probabilities were low, risk-averse SFLs typically indicated that migrants should stop immediately on encountering high-quality sites. Modelled fuel loads in environments with high and low encounter probabilities resembled observed fuel loads of migratory populations with ubiquitous and scarce food availability, respectively. This study demonstrates the benefits of risk-averse exploitation of variable resources, presents a new approach to model time-minimised migration in heterogeneous environments and emphasises the importance of premium stopover sites to nocturnally migrating birds...|$|R

It summarised the different positions on market access, export competition and domestic support, and also reviewed a range of other issues that have emerged, including the problem of implementation. The ICTSD also provide a number of other reviews of the general state of negotiations on the eve of the Cancun Ministerial meeting. Comment: This text provides a useful review of the state of agricultural negotiations on the eve of the Cancun Ministerial negotiations, giving significant background to the failure of the Cancun Ministerial meeting.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with questions of a branch called "Evaluation", which has been implemented {{within the framework of}} EU Cohesion Policy. This policy is also topical for the Czech Republic, which has been involved to this policy's implementation since 1995. Author's approach to the evaluation is determined by the main task of this branch in the EU Cohesion Policy [...] it is evaluation of economy, efficiency and effectiveness (3 E) of public financial resources provided to accelerate a vision of economic and social cohesion through the EU. In this dissertation, author deals with an idea of strengthening of evaluation by means of development of evaluation's methodology at the level of public non-investment project. One of main attributes of this project's type is difficult quantification of its benefits, which are considered as intangible. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation (which is devoted to a literature search), author sets evaluation, which is supposed to be implemented in the terms of regional policy, in the necessary context; there are explained connections between evaluation and actual streams of public development theory (neo-liberalism and institutionalism). Further, evaluation is analyzed as a branch, which is appropriate for public budgets within the meaning of an explanatory tool for achieved values of public interventions (programs and projects). That is, why evaluation is interpreted as a process, which is composed of four basic steps. It is possible to apply these steps not only in the context of program, but they are also applicable in the project's context. At the end of the first part, author determines a new theoretical project evaluation model appropriate for the chosen group of projects. This model is based on an application of project's logic models which include evaluation questions and evaluation indicators through the whole project cycle. The main purpose of this model is measuring of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the conditions of project. To verify a functionality of this model, there is included a demonstration of model's use within the scope of a typical non-investment project of cross-border cooperation which is supported now from Fund of Small Projects given to a due operational program. The model is set in a sequence of methodical steps of project evaluation and it is advantageous to use well known evaluation's time classification (ex-ante, interim and ex-post). In ex-ante project's phase, it appears to be an appropriate tool for an assessing of various projects' alternates according to 3 <b>E.</b> In <b>interim</b> phase, there is demonstrated a possible procedure how to maximize both economy and cost-effectiveness only with the means of economy's control. There is also stated, how is a value of the cost-effectiveness's indicator influenced by the level of project's economy. Finally, in the ex-post phase, there is demonstrated how to measure a project's utility after ending of project's activities. All of these benefits are achieved by quantification of indicators; ex-ante phase {{is concerned with}} economy and cost-effectiveness indicators, interim phase especially with economy indicators and ex-post phase with utility indicators. With economic explanation of achieved values of monitoring indicators this methodical process makes a non-eligible cost minimization, sustainability and better assessment of factual project's benefits possible. On that ground, it is possible to recommend this methodical process both to project managers and Fund's administrators...|$|R
40|$|A transição do século XIX para o século XX configura-se como uma época assinalada por grandes transformações sociais. Era o advento da modernidade, fruto de revoluções, como as Burguesas e a Industrial, e da adoção de uma nova perspectiva social. Este processo, oriundo dos grandes centros urbanos da Europa Ocidental, propagou-se por diversos países. Neste contexto, os ideais modernizadores podem ser percebidos mesmo em regiões que vivenciaram de formas mais intensas o crescimento urbano e o movimento de industrialização em outros marcos cronológicos. O homem devia ser preparado para viver esta nova realidade, o que envolvia a difusão de modos cotidianos de vida mais afeitos ao mundo que se queria erigir. Este trabalho tem como objeto de estudo as manifestações de modernização da elite dominante da mais importante cidade do norte de Minas Gerais, Montes Claros, entre os anos de 1889 - 1926. Adota como pressuposto central a existência de discursos de modernidade na cidade que foram propagados de diversas formas e influenciaram as transformações locais; estes discursos, oriundos sobretudo das elites, foram partilhados, mesmo que com resistências, por parcela da população. O problema que originou este trabalho <b>é,</b> neste <b>ínterim,</b> o questionamento dos ideais e das maneiras fora do ambiente escolar institucionalizado utilizados para instruir a população para a prática de condutas vistas como adequadas. Para descortinar o problema levantado, a escolha foi focar as transformações na vida citadina representadas pelo que era publicado em jornais da época. Com isso, a {{principal}} fonte utilizada na pesquisa é a imprensa periódica escrita. Como fonte de apoio, considerou-se a produção de memorialistas da região. É importante ressaltar que, mesmo sob a direção de um grupo reduzido que integrava a elite econômica e política da cidade, os jornais não expressaram um sentido único para o processo de modernização da cidade, pois a própria elite se mostrava diversa e polissêmica, manifestando várias visões do que era entendido como moderno e também expressando, em muitos momentos, valores conservadores; além disso, a imprensa relacionou-se com a população em geral de forma plural, pois os indivíduos, alfabetizados ou não, inseriram-se de muitas maneiras na cultura escrita. A análise das fontes permitiu estabelecer quatro eixos para o processo de modernização da sociedade em estudo que são discutidos neste trabalho: a ação da imprensa periódica (percebida como ferramenta privilegiada para educar a população); as mudanças na materialidade da cidade (alargamento das ruas, modernização das construções, utilização da luz elétrica, entre outros); as ações higiênicas e sanitárias (sobretudo as que se propagavam em virtude de uma suposta cultura atrasada do sertanejo); e as práticas de diversão (ocupação útil do tempo, com destaque para o futebol). The {{transition from the}} 19 th century to the 20 th century is characterized as an era marked by great social transformations. Combined, revolutions such as the bourgeois revolution and the industrial revolution and {{the adoption of a}} new social vision resulted in the advent of modernity. This process, derived from large urban centers of Western Europe, spread across different countries. In this context, the ideals of modernization are noticed even in those areas that experienced more intensely, in other chronological milestones, the urban growth and the industrialization. Men had to be ready for a new reality by adopting lifestyles and etting up daily routines that would better fit a new world planned to be built soon. Thisdissertation has as its object of study the manifestations of modernization of the ruling elite from the most important city in northern Minas Gerais, Montes Claros (city of Montes Claros, State of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil) between the years 1889 and 1926. Thepresent study is based on the main assumption that the discourses of modernity were disseminated in various ways and had influence on local transformation processes. Despite the fact that these discourses, originated mainly from the elites, were met with some resistance, they were still shared by part of the population. One of the reasons for thisresearch to be done arouse from the questioning of the ideals and methods used outside the institutionalized, formal school environment during that period in order to teach appropriate behaviour to the population. In order to uncover and scrutinize the problem posed, we chose to focus on the changes in the city life represented by what was published in newspapers during that time. Thus, the main source used in this study was the periodical press. As an additional source of information, publications from local memorialists were also used. Itshould be emphasized that, even under the direction of a small group which belonged to the economic and political elite of the city, the newspapers did not express a single meaning to the process of modernization of the city since the elite itself was very diverse andpolysemic. The elite itself would give several views on what was perceived and cosidered as modern, and would also express, in many instances, conservative values. In addition, the press would use the plural in order to communicate with the general population since bothliterate and illiterate individuals were, in many ways, part of the written culture. Analysis of sources allowed us to establish the following axes for the process of modernization of the society under study: (1) the role of the periodical press (perceived as a privileged teaching tool for population education); (2) the changes in the materiality of the city (e. g. streetwidening, modernization of buildings, use of electric light, etc.), (3) implementation of action plans on improved hygiene and sanitation services (especially those propagated by virtue of a supposedly backward culture of the backcountry), and (4) leisure activities (wiseuse of leisure time) [especially soccer]...|$|R
