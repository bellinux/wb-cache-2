Thereafter he was full-time, until {{he retired from the}} AAEC on 15 April 1972. He was also the Australian member on the Board of Governors of the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Agency when it was created in 1957 and again from 1964 to 1972, serving as its chairman from 1969 to 1970.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Agency.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E

The {{workshop}} and exhibits dealing with analytical methods {{were selected to}} highlight {{the current state of}} the art in elemental analysis. The presentations in the first part of the workshop described approaches and advances important to the analysis of trace minerals. These presentations included: 1) two approaches to mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma and accelerator mass spectrometry; 2) use of nuclear magnetic resonance in studies of mineral function; and 3) the use and limitations of fluorescent probes in studies of metal uptake and regulation. In the second part of the workshop, the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy's</b> contributions to nutritional "metrology" were described. Advances in instrumentation over the past decade have led to extraordinary improvements in the precision and sensitivity of mineral analyses. The ability to address isotopic speciation at such low levels sets the stage for numerous novel approaches in the assessment of trace mineral function. Carl L. Keen, Thomas Jue, Cuong D.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{agencies}} and individuals {{associated with the}} UN have won the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their work. Two Secretaries-General, Dag Hammarskjöld and Kofi Annan, were each awarded the prize (in 1961 and 2001, respectively), as were Ralph Bunche (1950), a UN negotiator, René Cassin (1968), {{a contributor to the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull (1945), the latter {{for his role in the}} organization's founding. Lester B. Pearson, the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, was awarded the prize in 1957 for his role in organizing the UN's first peacekeeping force to resolve the Suez Crisis. UNICEF won the prize in 1965, the International Labour Organization in 1969, the UN Peace-Keeping Forces in 1988, the <b>International</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> Agency (which reports to the UN) in 2005, and the UN-supported Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees was awarded in 1954 and 1981, becoming one of only two recipients to win the prize twice. The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing it with Annan.|$|E

5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Wilson helped {{organize}} the Association of Los Alamos Scientists (ALAS), which called, with a scientists' petition, for the <b>international</b> control of <b>atomic</b> <b>energy.</b> The petition was carried by Oppenheimer to Washington, D.C., eventually making its way via Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to President Harry S. Truman.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} a 60-page Report on the <b>International</b> Control of <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy,</b> {{better known as the}} Acheson-Lilienthal Report. Released in March 1946, it {{proposed}} that the United States offer to turn over its monopoly on nuclear weapons to an international agency, in return for a system of strict inspections and control of fissile materials. This position was highly controversial.|$|R
50|$|On March 16, 1946, the committee's {{report was}} {{presented}} to the State Department, which released it to the public on March 28. The Report on the <b>International</b> Control of <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy</b> soon became known as the Acheson-Lilienthal Report. The primary message of the report was that control of <b>atomic</b> <b>energy</b> through inspections and policing operations was unlikely to succeed. Instead, the report proposed that all fissile material be owned by an international agency to be called the Atomic Development Authority, which would release small amounts to individual nations for the development of peaceful uses of <b>atomic</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Report on the <b>International</b> Control of <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy,</b> {{commonly}} known as the Acheson-Lilienthal Report, was written by a United States committee in 1946 and discussed possible methods for the international control of nuclear weapons and the avoidance of future nuclear warfare. The report was produced by the Committee on <b>Atomic</b> <b>Energy,</b> headed by Dean Acheson and David Lilienthal, and was mostly written by scientist Robert Oppenheimer. The report recommended that an international body, such as the United Nations, have control over both atomic materials and the means of producing nuclear energy. [...] Bruno Pellaud, the IAEA's former deputy director-general for safeguards, says the fuel bank idea was developed as far back as 1957.|$|R
