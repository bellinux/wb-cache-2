40|$|For almost 20 years, the Nicaraguan {{authorities}} have been implementing a fiscal decentralization process to devolve an increase. ng {{degree of autonomy}} to municipalities. As {{a part of this}} process, and mainly due to the efforts of the Association of Municipalities of Nicaragua (AMUNIC is the acronym in Spanish), the first municipal transfers were approved in just 1999. Later, the funds available for the municipalities were increased gradually {{as a percentage of the}} General Budget (PGR), until in August 2003 the new Law of Municipal Transfers set this percentage at 4 % of the total central government tax revenues in 2004, and stated that it should be increased at least by 0, 5 % per year up to 10 % of the PGR in 2010. In 2005 the transfer program corresponded to 5 % of the PGR, whereas in the present year the percentage increased to 6 %. The Law of Municipal Transfers defines five targets for the municipal transfer program: 1) to promote the development of the diverse parts of the national territory; 2) to reduce the imbalance between the capacity to raise revenues and the cost of public service provision at the municipal level; 3) to stimulate local revenue collections and efficiency in municipal management; 4) to make possible the management and implementation of local policies of development and to allow local governments to administer national policies and development programs against poverty; and 5) to contribute to increased transparency in local management. In order to reach these objectives, the Law of Municipal Transfers also establishes four fundamental criteria to compute the amount of municipal transfers: 1) Fiscal Equity, meant to reduce the horizontal imbalances between municipalities; 2) Efficiency (or Fiscal Effort) in the collection of property taxes (IBI), meant to stimulate IBI collections with respect to the potential revenues in each municipality; 3) Population, which responds solely to the number of inhabitants of each municipality; and 4) <b>Execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>transfers,</b> which rewards the full disbursement of capital transfers. According to the Law of Municipal Transfers, Managua is entitled to 2, 5 % of the transfer fund, whereas 97, 5 % is distributed among all other municipalities in accordance with the four criteria. Each distribution criterion is weighted equally, and so the 97, 5 % of the transfer fund is divided by four and the total transfers for each municipality consist of the sum of the transfers received by each criterion. The potential per capita tax revenues, required to assign the transfers by Fiscal Equity has been calculated so far on a historical basis and now the authorities are considering the introduction of a new methodology, the MDPTM, developed and applied by the Boston Institute for Developing Economies (BIDE). The determination of the potential IBI collection, required to assign the transfers by Fiscal Effort, would also depend on this model. Although the MDPTM would constitute a great improvement with respect to the methodology used in the present, it is also a complex model that requires a great deal of information. In any case, even if the application of the MDPTM is feasible in the immediate future, the proposals provided in this report could easily incorporate its estimations. fiscal decentralization, Municipal Transfer System, Nicaragua, local government...|$|E

40|$|Many {{scientific}} applications need {{to stage}} {{large volumes of}} files from one set of machines to another set of machines in a wide-area network.

Adaptive replica selection is employed to <b>transfer</b> different chunks <b>of</b> the same file by taking dynamically changing network bandwidths into account. We utilize GridFTP as the underlying mechanism for data transfers. The algorithm makes use of information from past GridFTP transfers to estimate network bandwidths and resource availability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated framework {{for evaluating the}} reduction of several types of mortality risk using a Choice Experiment (CE) approach, a type of stated preference technique. Using this approach, we can distinguish the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) {{for the amount of}} risk reduction from the MWTP for the opportunity of risk reduction and therefore calculate the “Quantity-based” Value of a Statistical Life. The risks in our survey include mortality risks due to accident, cancer, and heart disease. The Quantity-based VSL is calculated to be 350 million JPY (in 2002 Japanese Yen, about 2. 9 million US dollars). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of subjective risk perception and population characteristics of the respondents on their MWTP. Estimated results suggest that it is unnecessary to adjust the VSL according to the differences in the type of risk if the VSL is calculated using an adequate approach. However, adjustments for the timing of risk reduction and population characteristics are found to be significant for the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> benefit <b>transfer.</b> Copyright Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005 choice experiment, value of statistical life, stated preference, risk perception, benefit transfer, Japan,...|$|R

40|$|Since 2002 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) {{has begun}} {{significantly}} cooperate {{in the creation}} of standards based on the same principals. This is a process of convergence. It is realized through a series of sub-projects aimed at short-term or long-term period. Revenue recognition and lease reporting projects represent priority areas of convergence. The issue of leases belongs to one of the areas in which there have been, after a relatively long time, criticized the very principles applied in international accounting standards. The result of the convergence activities should be the creation of such methodological approaches of reporting the lease contracts on the side of lessee and then lessor that would eliminate the main weaknesses of the current system of reporting based on the classification of lease contracts in connection with the execution or non <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> risks and benefits associated with the lease to the lessee.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is {{to solve the problem}} <b>of</b> {{parallel}} <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> programs on the computers of PlanetLab. Users of PlanetLab must currently transfer and run the programs by hand. As the number of computers available to us, in our slices, is usually over 100, managing them can be time-consuming. In this lies our problem. For the purposes of the solution to this problem, it is necessary to set up scripts to transfer programs and data to all the computers as well as executing those programs. After the completion <b>of</b> <b>execution,</b> we <b>transfer</b> the results to the user's computer. If a particular program failed to stop, we have to force it to end and output that onto the screen as an error. We also need to display an error in case we failed to connect to a computer or any other problems were encountered. Connecting and executing of programs is done via SSH protocol, while transferring the files is done via SCP protocol. We solved our problem with three scripts written in the command syntax BASH. This allows for a quick and easy communication with many PlanetLab computers simultaneously. ...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{maintenance}} and assembly (IMA) {{is usually a}} complex task that involves the knowledge of specific procedures and techniques for each machine. Each technique and procedure requires cognitive memory {{and knowledge of the}} way the task should be performed as well as motor knowledge about the movements and forces that should be applied. IMA tasks are common activities since the industrial machineries, usually deployed by manufacturing companies in remote locations around the world, need complex and lengthy maintenance procedures to be performed periodically. Therefore, the training of the technicians to acquire the necessary skills to perform those tasks efficiently is a challenging point. In this sense, the use of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies could provide some benefits with respect to traditional training systems.

40|$|Historically, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> sentences passed at the level of international courts and tribunals. Capital punishment was still used, and custodial sanctions were imposed in the relevant states. It was not until the 1990 s, with the creation of the ad hoc tribunals, that the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> sentences also became a task for international tribunals, in cooperation with, and by means <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> the sentenced person to, a state which had committed itself to executing the sentence. The basic principles <b>of</b> these vertical <b>transfer,</b> or <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> sentence, procedures, as is also the case {{at the level of the}} ICC, are characterized by a system logic, with a limited role for the sentenced person. Nonetheless, minimal human rights and international standards for the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> sentences (as agreed upon at the level of the UN) are respected. The authors investigate if and to what extent the interests of the sentenced person could be better pursued and enhanced during vertical procedures for the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> sentences; they therefore take a clear-cut rehabilitation and social integration perspective. Given the dominant representation of EU member states among states willing to execute sentences passed by international tribunals and courts, the authors moreover wonder whether practice should not evolve towards reflecting the obligatory compliance of these states with, besides the UN standards, additional (sometimes wider, more precise and higher) Council of Europe and EU standards. This would be reflected in the policies of the tribunals and courts (especially the ICC) relating to the conclusion <b>of</b> sentence <b>execution</b> agreements with states, as well as in the actual case-based decisions in which particular sentence execution states are chosen. The authors further plead for the conclusion of a bilateral EU-ICC agreement on the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> sentences, since this would constitute an important contribution to international justice, and one that is likely to make the reintegration and rehabilitation of offenders (a greater) part of it...|$|R
