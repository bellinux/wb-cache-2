50|$|The tour {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of the Australian/New Zealand team, sponsored by Ravat. It was headed by Hubert Opperman, who had been the Australian cycling champion for a few years. After The Melbourne Herald had a campaign to send Opperman to the Tour de France, a team was made. The plan was to add six experienced <b>European</b> <b>cyclists</b> to the team, but this did not happen. Opperman rode some races in Europe and could compete with the <b>European</b> top <b>cyclists,</b> but the rest of his team could not. Because {{a major part of the}} race was in the team time trial format, Opperman had no chance to win the Tour. The Kennett Brothers wrote a book about the New Zealander on the team—Harry Watson—that was read by cycling enthusiast and The Amazing Race-host Phil Keoghan, who was surprised that he had never heard of the fellow Cantabrian before. Keoghan decided to celebrate the team's achievement and with a friend, he rode the 1928 stages on period bicycles to the original 26-day schedule. Their experience was turned into a film, Le Ride, which premiered in July 2016 in Watson's home town Christchurch.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{visitors}} may {{be surprised}} by the apparently large number of cycle parking facilities in Copenhagen, there {{is in fact a}} severe lack of available cycle stands, and among the subjective indicators measured by the city, bicycle parking fares worst, with only 29% being satisfied with the facilities. There are approximately 560.000 bicycles in the city of Copenhagen, more bicycles than people, yet they share only 48.000 bicycle stands. With a view to remedying the situation, in 2008 the Danish <b>Cyclists</b> <b>Federation</b> published a [...] "Bicycling Parking Manual" [...] with a number of guidelines.

A number of projects have been launched to ease Copenhagen's notorious shortage of bicycle parking spaces, particularly at transport hubs. While the city expects there will always be more bicycles in Copenhagen than parking spots, it hopes to increase satisfaction with bicycle parking significantly by 2025, through a coordinated effort to improve conditions and facilities.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the energy}} crisis, which hit Denmark harder than most countries, {{and the growing}} {{environmental}} movement in the 1970s, cycling experienced a renaissance. The Government was forced to introduce car-free Sundays to conserve oil reserves. Many city dwellers {{thought it was the}} best day of the week, and the Danish <b>Cyclists</b> <b>Federation</b> which had been on life support for years and were nearly in a coma, experienced a rapid and massive increase in membership during the 1970s and 1980s. Bolstered by the increasing membership and new enthusiastic younger grassroots, it organised massive demonstrations in Copenhagen and other major cities, demanding better infrastructure and safety for the city's cyclists. Another grassroots action cited for helping cycling infrastructure on the political agenda was operation [...] "White Crosses" [...] where white crosses were painted on the streets where a cyclist had been killed in traffic. These protests and actions came {{at the same time as}} a number of planning reforms were initiated nationally, which gave individual citizens the opportunity to have direct influence on new planning and zoning laws in their communities, and with that came a clear demand for segregated cycle paths.|$|R

30|$|The last {{trend that}} {{developed}} from these studies, {{which served as}} a classification method for Teramoto and Bungum’s [16] review, was {{the relationship between the}} type of sport and required energy systems for participation (i.e., aerobic/endurance, mixed, and anaerobic/power) and mortality. Similar to Teramoto and Bungum’s [16] findings, the largest gains in lifespan longevities were in endurance and mixed-sport athletes. The greatest LE advantages were found in <b>European</b> <b>cyclists</b> [13, 27, 28], whereas the lowest LEs were found in Finnish powerlifters [53]. Cross-sport analyses uniformly reported LE advantages in endurance and mixed-sport athletes compared to power sport athletes [3 – 6, 20, 31], who had some evidence of increased premature mortality from suicide suspected from prior anabolic steroid use [26, 53]. The inconsistent mortality outcomes in power sport athletes make it difficult to generalize across all sports. Nevertheless, there was considerable support in the existing literature for superior longevity outcomes for elite athletes compared to the age- and sex-matched controls from the general population.|$|R

40|$|The term {{vulnerable}} {{road user}} (VRU) is most commonly associated with pedestrians and in particular children and the elderly. In many <b>European</b> countries <b>cyclists</b> make up {{a significant number of}} VRU casualties - typically around one third. In the context of the European 6 th Framework Integrated Project APROSYS (Advance PROtection SYStems), a study was conducted to examine the safety requirements for cyclists and whether these were addressed by current pedestrian safety assessments of cars. An examination of accident statistics was first conducted to determine the principal accident scenarios for cyclists. Since insufficient cyclist cases were recorded in a detail database of VRU accidents compiled during APROSYS, a programme of virtual testing was then conducted. The objective was to identify the most significant parameters during cyclist impacts with a range of cars sizes and the likely injury consequences. The primary region of investigation was impacts to the legs and knees - the points of first contact. The study indicated that cyclists interacted differently with cars than pedestrians, resulting from the geometric configuration of their legs, the presence of the bicycle and their elevated riding position. The potential for injury was different and the current sub-system impactor tests used by Euro NCAP and for vehicle certification purposes did not address all these differences. It was determined that the relevance of the current pedestrian impact safety assessments of cars for cyclists could be improved by minor changes to the test parameters. However, the study also identified new injury mechanisms that may require further biomechanical investigations. Although this study has considered a wide range of cyclist impact configurations it should not be considered as definitive. Further work including physical testing is needed in order to take forward improved safety test procedures...|$|R
40|$|There {{are nearly}} 200 cyclist road {{deaths a year}} in the Netherlands. They are, therefore, the largest group of {{so-called}} vulnerable road users. The Netherlands has with 18 %, therefore, also the highest <b>European</b> Union percentage <b>cyclist</b> road deaths of all road deaths. Where motor vehicles are the crash opponent of cyclists, 80 % of these opponents are cars. The most common collision type is the crash in which the cyclist is hit in the flank by the front of a car. This study has concentrated on this collision type. For this study, the summons form was used to supplement the data from the standard police registration form. The accident analysis used the data of 209 crashes in which 10 cyclists were killed and 199 were in-patients. The number of analyzed summons forms was 32. In many cases, nothing was known {{about the nature of the}} cyclists' injuries, but it became clear that the cyclist's head was often injured. Head injury was more common among those killed than among the in-patients; the contact place was often the windscreen and the car roof. In general, cyclist casualties usually hit the windscreen and the roof in crashes on roads with a speed limit of 80 km/h and higher. A literature study confirmed these findings. In addition, it illustrated that pedestrians more often strike the bonnet with the head than the windscreen and its frame as is the case for cyclists. This report also discusses the requirements that, from 2005, will be valid for new cars. These requirements are based on collisions of motor vehicles and pedestrians, and not on those between motor vehicles and cyclists. The vehicle parts that are often hit by cyclists (the windscreen and its frame) are, however, not covered by the new requirements. With regard to these new requirements, we recommend additional research of the contacts with the windscreen and its frame. A proposal to evaluate the new requirements by means of EU research is supported inasmuch as it is not limited it to collisions with pedestrians, but also includes collisions with cyclists. In order to reduce the severity of collisions with cyclists (and pedestrians), what is needed is not only intervention in the construction of the vehicle front, but also measures to reduce the driving and, thus, the collision speeds. A collision speed of 30 km/h provides cyclists (and pedestrians) with a good chance of not incurring any severe injury. The layout of the infrastructure, and (in due time) the installation of locally controlled in-vehicle speed limiters, can result in a driving speed of 30 km/h...|$|R
