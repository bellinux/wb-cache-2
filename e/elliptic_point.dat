40|$|This article {{lays the}} {{foundations}} {{for the study of}} modular forms transforming with respect to representations of Fuchsian groups of genus zero. More precisely, we define geometrically weighted graded modules of such modular forms, where the graded structure comes from twisting with all isomorphism classes of line bundles on the corresponding compactified modular curve, and we study their structure by relating it to the structure of vector bundles over orbifold curves of genus zero. We prove that these modules are free whenever the Fuchsian group has at most two <b>elliptic</b> <b>points.</b> For three or more <b>elliptic</b> <b>points,</b> we give explicit constructions of indecomposable vector bundles of rank two over modular orbifold curves, which give rise to non-free modules of geometrically weighted modular forms...|$|R

In <b>Elliptic</b> curve <b>point</b> Multiplication latency depends {{on the number of}} one’s (Hamming Weight) in the binary representation of the scalar multiplier. By reducing the effective number of one’s in the multiplier, the multiplication speed is automatically increased. Therefore we describe a new method of effectively reducing the Hamming weight of the scalar multipliers thereby reduces the number of Point Adders when multi scalar multiplication is needed. The increase in speed achieved outweighs the hardware cost and complexity.

40|$|SUMMARY We discuss side channel leakage from modular {{reduction}} for NIST recommended domain parameters. FIPS 186 - 2 has 5 recommended prime fields. These primes have {{a special}} form which {{is referred to as}} generalized Mersenne prime. These special form primes facilitate especially efficient implementation. A typical implementation of efficient modular reduction with such primes includes conditional reduction. A conditional reduction in modular reduction can constitute an information channel on the secret exponent. Several researchers have produced unified code for <b>elliptic</b> <b>point</b> addition and doubling in order to avoid a simple power analysis (SPA). However, Walter showed that SPA still be possible if Montgomery multiplication with conditional reduction is implemented within the unified code. In this paper we show SPA on the modular reduction with NIST recommended primes, combining with the unified code for <b>elliptic</b> <b>point</b> operations. As Walter stated, our results also indicate that even if the unified codes are implemented for <b>elliptic</b> <b>point</b> operations, underlying field operations should be implemented in constant time. The unified approach in itself can not be a countermeasure for side channel attacks. key words: side channel analysis, elliptic curve cryptosystem, modular reduction, generalized Mersenne prime, unified code 1...|$|E

Moreover, for each such N and <b>elliptic</b> <b>point</b> e, we show how to explicitly evaluate j_N(e) and provide the list of generating polynomials (with small coefficients) of the class fields or their subfields corresponding to the orders over the imaginary quadratic extension of rationals stemming from the elliptic points under consideration...|$|E
40|$|Computer vision {{applications}} require representations for surfaces {{that are}} intrinsic and reflect the hierarchical {{nature of their}} geometric structure. Curvature-dependent flows have been successfully used for shape representation in two dimensions, principally due to a theorem on curve shortening flow stating that embedded curves evolving proportional to their curvature do not self-intersect and smoothly converge to a circular point. In this paper, we investigate properties of curvature-driven flows for surfaces and derive necessary conditions for the flows to avoid self-intersections. Since known curvature flows, such as mean and Gaussian flows, lead to self-intersections, we impose geometric constraints on the direction and magnitude of arbitrary flows to narrow down the space of candidates. Our main result is to establish necessary conditions for the direction of movement {{in order to avoid}} self-intersections: 1) convex <b>elliptic</b> <b>points</b> should move in, while concave <b>elliptic</b> <b>points</b> mo [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{geometric}} smoothing technique for three-dimensional surfaces and images. The technique relies on curvature-dependent deformations of surfaces and the intuition that highly curved regions should move into their convexity by an amount proportional to their curvature. While this intuition in 2 D has lead to a well-defined process and formal theorems about its smoothing properties, {{the development of a}} similar process in 3 D has been confounded by the existence of two directions of bending: when both directions of bending agree (<b>elliptic</b> <b>points)</b> the surface moving into the convexity flattens; however, when directions of bending disagree (hyperbolic points) the situation is ambiguous.
