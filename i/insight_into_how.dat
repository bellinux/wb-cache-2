5|$|Holbæk {{in northwestern}} Sealand {{began to develop}} {{towards the end of}} the Middle Ages. Prosperity peaked in the 17th century as corn grown locally was traded with Germany and the Netherlands. The half-timbered houses which now form the museum date back to that period, {{providing}} an <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>how</b> the town functioned at the time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to PET and fMRI, which show which {{areas of the}} brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>how</b> different areas interact. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.|$|E
5|$|Sheindlin has {{authored}} seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>how</b> and why the family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999.

5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>how</b> myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|The wreck timbers {{were found}} under a {{sediment}} that preserved {{the remains of}} the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to marine worms. Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was preserved. This has given us an <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>how</b> ships of this period were constructed—something which has not been seen before as no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave <b>insight</b> <b>into</b> <b>how</b> the characters operate and how their personal lives {{would be affected by}} it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in the Security Services, Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} semantic memory disorders, one must first understand how these disorders affect memory. Semantic memory disorders fractionate into two categories.

25|$|The soft-margin {{support vector machine}} {{described}} above {{is an example of}} an empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm for the hinge loss.
