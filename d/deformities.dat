30|$|Bone <b>deformity</b> is a {{combination}} of angulation and rotation commonly. Coronal plane angular <b>deformity</b> (varus and valgus) is seen on AP radiographs, and sagittal plane angular <b>deformity</b> (procurvatum and recurvatum) is seen on lateral radiographs. <b>Deformity</b> measured on both AP and lateral radiographs can be resolved into a single oblique plane. Imaging at right angles to this oblique plane of <b>deformity</b> shows the maximum <b>deformity</b> (as seen in profile), whereas imaging into the plane of <b>deformity</b> shows no <b>deformity.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{starting}} point for the osteotomy is the bisector of the angular <b>deformity</b> in the plane of the angular <b>deformity</b> (the resolved oblique plane performed in part one). The <b>deformity</b> is imaged in the plane of maximum <b>deformity</b> by rotating the limb until the maximum angular <b>deformity</b> is seen. A Kirschner wire (K-wire) is then placed along the bisector in the plane of angular <b>deformity.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to his <b>deformities,</b> {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical <b>deformities,</b> Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at a cotton factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E
30|$|We {{believe there}} are 2 {{advantages}} to treating skeletally immature children with guided growth, despite <b>deformity</b> recurrence following plate removal. Firstly, <b>deformity</b> progression is delayed. The plates remain in situ for a mean of 1.6  years and it takes 1  year for <b>deformity</b> to recur following plate removal. Thus, there is no <b>deformity</b> progression for over 2  years. In this time period, <b>deformity</b> progression of over one MAD zone (based on our results) would be expected if the plates had not been inserted. Secondly, <b>deformity</b> {{is not allowed to}} reach a ‘critical’ level that could limit function. The correlation between knee <b>deformity</b> and function in children with MPS requires further research. Recurrent <b>deformity</b> can be treated by reapplication of the guided growth principles.|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the cases of}} 10 patients with cubitus valgus <b>deformity</b> who had a supracondylar elbow fracture during childhood, {{in order to identify}} the causes of valgus <b>deformity.</b> Cubitus valgus <b>deformity</b> occurred in 3 cases because of failure to recognize the <b>deformity</b> at the initial treatment. In 7 patients the <b>deformity</b> was recognized but was insufficiently treated. In this series {{there was no evidence of}} progressive valgus <b>deformity</b> after healing of the fracture. Incomplete correction is the main cause of valgus <b>deformity.</b> It is suggested that, in order to reduce the incidence of valgus <b>deformity</b> following supracondylar elbow fracture, careful analysis of the fracture pattern is necessary and the initial angulation should be reduced anatomically and fixed in a correct manner.

5|$|A {{study showed}} that high levels of {{nutrients}} used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog <b>deformities</b> in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ships}} are {{prepared}} Sati {{gives birth to}} Kartik, her son with Shiva. The journey to Branga starts, with Sati staying back at Kashi to help the King with a lion attack on the local villagers. When Sati and her soldiers {{are on the verge}} of losing against the lions, a group of Naga soldiers led by a man and a woman arrive and assist them in killing the lions. The Naga woman reveals herself to be Kali, Sati's twin sister. She was denounced by their father Daksha since she was born with <b>deformities,</b> including two extra, functioning hands. The man reveals himself as Ganesh, Sati's first child, whom she believed to have died at child birth. Since Ganesh was also born with <b>deformities,</b> which led to his face resembling that of an elephant’s, Daksha denounced him and lied to Sati. Both Kali and Ganesh are brought back to Kashi by Sati and they wait for Shiva's arrival.|$|E
50|$|Adults with Madelung’s <b>deformity</b> {{may suffer}} from ulnar-sided wrist pain. Madelung's <b>Deformity</b> is usually treated by {{treating}} the distal radial <b>deformity.</b> However, if patients {{have a positive}} ulnar variance and focal wrist pathology, it’s possible to treat with an isolated ulnar-shortening osteotomy. In these patients the radial <b>deformity</b> is not treated.|$|R
40|$|The outward {{angulation}} of elbow with supinated forearm is cubitus varus <b>deformity.</b> This <b>deformity</b> {{is often}} seen as sequelae of malunited supracondylar fracture of humerus in paediatric age group of 5 – 8 years. The <b>deformity</b> is usually non-progressive, but in cases of physeal injury or congenital bony bar formation in the medial condyle of humerus, the <b>deformity</b> is progressive and can be grotesque in appearance. Various types of osteotomies are defined for standard non-progressive cubitus varus <b>deformity,</b> while multiple surgeries are required for progressive <b>deformity</b> until skeletal maturity. In this study we described a novel surgical approach and osteotomy of distal humerus in a 5 years old boy having grotesque progressive cubitus varus <b>deformity,</b> achieving good surgical outcome...|$|R
30|$|The {{plane of}} a pure angular <b>deformity</b> {{lies in the}} long axis of the bone. Rotational <b>deformity</b> is {{angulation}} in the axial plane. Rotational <b>deformity</b> is not seen on coronal or sagittal plane imaging directly and can only be measured directly on axial imaging. The plane of rotational <b>deformity</b> is transverse to the long axis. Osteotomy in this plane is used to correct pure rotational <b>deformity</b> allows full bone contact after correction.|$|R
5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth <b>deformities</b> were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital <b>deformities.</b> Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E

5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial <b>deformities</b> resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with <b>deformities</b> of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E
5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can {{be at risk for}} life-threatening <b>deformities</b> in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E

30|$|A {{transverse}} or {{axial plane}} osteotomy used for correction of angulation creates an opening wedge requiring bone graft (or not if performed by distraction osteogenesis) or requires {{removal of a}} wedge of bone (closing wedge). If an osteotomy is {{carried out in the}} plane of <b>deformity,</b> it allows correction of the <b>deformity</b> by rotating the opposing bone surfaces while maintaining maximum bone contact. Where the <b>deformity</b> is both angulation and rotation, the true plane of <b>deformity</b> is oblique to both the long axis and the transverse plane. Osteotomy in this plane allows rotation of opposing flat surfaces that correct angular and rotational <b>deformity</b> simultaneously and maintain full bone contact. We present a simple graphical method for determining this total plane of <b>deformity</b> and the plane of osteotomy about which the total <b>deformity</b> can be corrected.|$|R
30|$|The {{interobserver}} {{reliability for}} the calculated oblique plane <b>deformity</b> in SCFE ICC was 0.947 [95  % confidence interval (CI) 0.90 – 0.98] and the intraobserver reliability for the calculated oblique plane <b>deformity</b> of individual raters ranged from 0.81 to 0.94. The <b>deformity</b> in the oblique plane was always {{greater than the}} <b>deformity</b> measured in the axial or the coronal plane alone.|$|R

30|$|For a <b>deformity</b> that {{is mainly}} angular, the final plane {{is close to}} the plane of angular <b>deformity</b> (horizontal axis). For <b>deformity</b> that is mainly rotational, the plane is closer to the {{transverse}} or axial plane (vertical axis).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: First, {{to study}} how markers of matrix metabolism, {{inflammation}} markers, and adipokines relate to (superior) cam <b>deformity</b> and (possible) cam impingement of the hip. Second, to investigate whether they can identify subjects with cam <b>deformity</b> that {{are at risk of}} future hip osteoarthritis (OA). METHOD: In a cohort of 1002 subjects (CHECK), (superior) cam <b>deformity</b> was defined by an alpha angle > 60 ° on anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and (possible) cam impingement by a cam <b>deformity</b> together with internal hip rotation ≤ 20 °. Hip OA at 5 -year follow-up was defined by Kellgren and Lawrence grade ≥ 2 or total hip replacement. RESULTS: Subjects with (superior) cam <b>deformity</b> and (possible) cam impingement showed lower levels of bone turnover markers (uCTX-I, uNTX-I, sPINP, sOC) than those without. Cam <b>deformity</b> was positively associated with future hip OA, but associations were weaker at high levels of bone turnover. sCOMP and sHA levels were higher in subjects with cam <b>deformity,</b> while other cartilage and synovium markers were not. Some markers of inflammation (pLeptin, pAdiponectin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were lower in presence of cam <b>deformity</b> and cam impingement, but high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was not. Most associations depended largely on gender differences. CONCLUSION: Bone metabolism may be relevant in the pathogenesis of (superior) cam <b>deformity</b> and in the development of (superior) cam <b>deformity</b> into hip OA. Subjects with cam <b>deformity</b> and cam impingement surprisingly showed lower levels of inflammation markers and adipokines. Associations of cartilage turnover markers with cam <b>deformity</b> and cam impingement were less obvious...|$|R
