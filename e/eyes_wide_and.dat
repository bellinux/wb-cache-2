2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But then I get to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|During the journey, {{the fleet}} visited the Pulau Sembilan in the Strait of Malacca {{in the seventh}} year of the Yongle reign (1409), {{according}} to Fei Xin. He stated that the troops were sent there to cut wood. Dreyer (2007) concluded that the stop was during the return journey as the treasure fleet did not leave the Chinese coast for the third voyage until early 1410. Fei Xin's written words were: [...] "In the seventh year of Yongle, Zheng He and his associates sent government troops onto the island to cut incense. They obtained six logs, each eight or nine chi in diameter and six or seven zhang in length, whose aroma was pure and far-ranging. The pattern [...] was black, with fine lines. The people of the island opened their <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> stuck out their tongues in astonishment, and were told that 'We are the soldiers of the Heavenly Court, and our awe-inspiring power is {{like that of the}} gods.'" [...] The treasure fleet arrived back in Nanjing in the summer of 1409.|$|E
