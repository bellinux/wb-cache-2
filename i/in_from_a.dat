5|$|In the 37th minute Arsenal overcame their {{numerical}} disadvantage {{to score}} when Sol Campbell headed <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> free-kick following Carles Puyol's foul on Emmanuel Eboué, although some observers believed that Eboué appeared to dive. Arsenal held onto their lead {{for the remainder}} of the half, as Barcelona's best chance came courtesy of Eto'o, whose shot hit the post via a save from Almunia.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone {{with the}} Wind {{set a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated <b>in,</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone with the Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for Gone with the Wind is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone with the Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} a method {{for the detection of}} DNA damage and its repair in human telomeres, the natural ends of chromosomes which are necessary for replication and critical for chromosomal stability. We find that ultraviolet light-induced pyrimidine dimers in telomeric DNA are repaired less efficiently than endogenous genes but more efficiently than inactive, noncoding regions. We have also measured telomeric length, telomeric DNA damage, and its repair in relation to the progression of aging. Telomeres are shorter <b>in</b> fibroblasts <b>from</b> <b>an</b> old donor compared to fibroblasts <b>from</b> <b>a</b> young donor, shortest <b>in</b> cells <b>from</b> <b>a</b> patient with the progeroid disorder Werner syndrome, and relatively long <b>in</b> fibroblasts <b>from</b> <b>a</b> patient with Alzheimer disease. Telomeric DNA repair efficiency is lower <b>in</b> cells <b>from</b> <b>an</b> old donor than <b>in</b> cells <b>from</b> <b>a</b> young donor, normal in Alzheimer cells, and slightly lower in Werner cells. It is possible that this decline in telomeric repair with aging is of functional significance to an age-related decline in genomic stability...|$|R

He {{graduated}} <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> local worker's school in 1926, and in 1931 from the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry. He {{became a member of the}} All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1930. Like his friend and ally Andrei Kirilenko, Podgorny climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder (delivering the production goals set by the bureaucrats in charge of the centrally planned economy). By 1953 he had become Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. After Anastas Mikoyan's resignation, Podgorny was voted into office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After Premier Alexei Kosygin's fall from favour Podgorny became the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union until his removal as head of state in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} Le Corbusier. The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Birthday is a third-person {{role-playing}} shooter. The player controls series protagonist Aya Brea through rendered-to-scale environments <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{third person}} perspective. The game plays {{out as a}} series of missions, between which Aya rests at the Counter Twisted Investigation headquarters, which acts as the game's main hub. In the hub, Aya can receive briefings for missions, view additional documents, buy and customize new weapons. She also has the option to transport back there should she die during a mission. The game can be saved both at the hub and in safe zones within missions. At the end of each mission, Aya is given a grade based on performance, enemies killed, and the number of times she died. Depending on her score, she will earn differing amounts of Bounty Points, a currency used to customize weapons and repair protective gear in the hub area.|$|E

5|$|The bailey was {{designed}} to include a number of spacious domestic buildings. These include a great hall, a solarium, kitchen, buttery and pantry, with a luxuriously large number of gardrobes and fireplaces. The large towers provided additional accommodation. The design of the domestic buildings was skilfully interlocked to support the defensive arrangements of the bailey. The great hall for example, , {{was placed in the}} strongest position overlooking the river Wye, allowing it to benefit from multiple large windows and a huge fireplace without sacrificing defensive strength. Water for the castle was originally raised from the courtyard well, but was later piped <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> spring across the valley; the castle kitchens had acquired running water {{by the beginning of the}} 17th century. The design of the buildings ensured that the servants and nobility were able to live separately from one another in the confined space of the castle, revolutionary at the time.|$|E
5|$|United {{were denied}} victory by Bayern Munich twice, home and away.

The return leg ended in a stalemate; Roy Keane scored just before half-time via a low header before Hasan Salihamidžić equalised for the visitors.|$|E
5|$|Young {{signed for}} Conference National club Halifax Town on a free {{transfer}} on 25 February 2005 on a one-and-a-half-year contract. He made his debut {{the following day}} as a 57th-minute substitute in a 2–2 home draw with former club Northwich. His first goal for the club came on his sixth appearance against Tamworth after heading in a Martin Foster corner kick, the match ending in a 3–3 home draw. He finished the season with 13 appearances and 2 goals for Halifax. Young suffered an injury in August 2005 and made his return in a 4–0 home win over Tamworth on 10 September 2005. His only goal of 2005–06 came after heading <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Matt Doughty corner in the 35th-minute of a 1–1 home draw with Stevenage Borough on 14 April 2006. He played in both legs of Halifax's play-off semi-final victory over Grays Athletic, which the team won 5–4 on aggregate.

Three days later, Arsenal played against Stoke City away from home and lost 3–2. Peter Crouch gave Stoke the lead after only 19 seconds of the match, Bojan doubled Stoke's lead and Jon Walters added a third before half time. Arsenal came back in the second half. Santi Cazorla scored from a penalty and Aaron Ramsey volleying <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Santi Cazorla corner. Calum Chambers was sent off after getting a second yellow card and with ten men, Arsenal could not find an equalizer.

Udinese travelled without a win {{in five years}} at Parma's ground and came the closer to opening the scoring in the first half, but neither side was able to break the deadlock. In the second half, pacey wingman Jonathan Biabiany headed <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Giovinco corner to give Parma a lead with just over {{half an hour to}} go. Fifteen minutes later, Dušan Basta was adjudged to have fouled Biabiany in the penalty area and Giovinco stepped up to convert the penalty from 12 yards out to give Parma a remarkable two-goal victory and lift them out of {{the bottom half of the}} table.|$|E
25|$|The {{divisions}} of Hardy and Desfourneaux disembarked {{on the west}} side of Cap-Français on 5 February after Louverture's general Henri Christophe refused to let them land in the port. In this first operation Hardy led the advance guard which drove off several hundred Haitian soldiers and captured six cannons. He arrived at Cap-Français to find the town in flames. The French seized the coastal towns, forcing Louverture to withdraw into the interior. Leclerc planned to have the {{divisions of}} Hardy, Desfourneaux and Rochambeau sweep south from Cap-Français while Boudet was to move north from Port-au-Prince. Humbert's brigade led by Debelle would move <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> different direction. On 18 February the French columns advanced, with Desfourneaux on the right, Hardy in the center and Rochambeau on the left. Debelle landed at Port-de-Paix and moved south-east. Leclerc rode with Hardy's column which saw fighting at Marmelade. Hardy took Jean-Baptiste Salme's brigade on an all-night march and stormed Bayonnais at dawn. Meanwhile, Rochambeau's division experienced heavy fighting in the Battle of Ravine-à-Couleuvres. At one point a large body of Louverture's army was surrounded but it managed to slip away from the French. Hardy returned to Cap-Français at the end of the operation.|$|E

25|$|Grouper {{are often}} found around reefs. They have stout bodies and large mouths. They are not built for long-distance or fast swimming. They {{can be quite}} large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100kg are not uncommon. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth {{on the edges of}} their jaws, but they have heavy {{crushing}} tooth plates inside the pharynx. They lie in wait, rather than chasing in open water. They are found in areas of hard or consolidated substrate, and use structural features such as ledges, rocks, and coral reefs (as well as artificial reefs like wrecks and sunken barges) as their habitat. Their mouth and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey <b>in</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> distance. They also use their mouth to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill muscles are so powerful that it is nearly impossible to pull them out of their cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock themselves in. There is some research indicating that roving coral groupers (Plectropomus pessuliferus) sometimes cooperate with giant morays in hunting.|$|E
