25|$|They met on October 25, 1990. Douglas {{came into}} the fight at 246lb. and offered little {{in the fight against}} Holyfield, who was in great shape at 208lb. In the third round Douglas tried to start a {{combination}} with a big right uppercut. Holyfield countered with a straight right hand that was lightning quick and Douglas went down for the count. Holyfield was the new undefeated, Undisputed <b>Heavyweight</b> <b>Champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World.</b> At the time of the knockout, Holyfield was ahead on all three judges' scorecards, all seeing it 20–18 for Holyfield.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{said that}} by this point Ferguson's heart was no longer fully in the game. By the time he fought Oliver McCall in 1991, he had only had one fight in three years, a 6-round kayo of Terry Armstrong in 1990. Although rusty and overweight, Ferguson {{appeared}} to {{get the better of}} McCall. However Ferguson had been relegated to 'trial horse' status and McCall was given the decision. Three years later in 1994, McCall would knockout Lennox Lewis in two rounds to become <b>heavyweight</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> In 1992 he took on Bruce Seldon where an indifferent Ferguson retired after five rounds with an eye injury. Three years later, Seldon would win the vacant WBA heavyweight title.|$|E
25|$|Schmeling {{was born}} in the Pomeranian town of Klein Luckow. He first became acquainted with boxing as a teenager, when his father took him to watch film of the heavyweight {{championship}} match between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier. Impressed with Dempsey's performance in that fight, young Schmeling became determined to imitate his new hero. He began boxing in amateur competitions and, by 1924, won Germany's national amateur title in the light heavyweight division. Shortly thereafter, he turned professional. Ironically, though he idolised the raging, brawling Dempsey, Schmeling developed a careful, scientific style of fighting that lent itself more to counterpunching. Using this style, he won seventeen of his first twenty-three bouts, thirteen by knockout. In 1925, he got into the ring with Dempsey, who was then still <b>heavyweight</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and was touring Europe. Dempsey boxed for two rounds with the then-unknown German and, according to a story later told by Schmeling, was greatly impressed. He proved Dempsey's praises correct on 24 August 1926, when picking up the German light heavyweight championship with a first-round knockout of rival Max Diekmann, who had previously beaten Schmeling. The next year, Schmeling won the European championship by stopping Fernand Delarge in the first boxing match broadcast live in Germany. After defending both titles against Hein Domgoergen the same year and, in 1928, the European Title with a first-round knockout of Michele Bonaglia, he secured the German heavyweight championship with a point victory against Franz Diener and decided to chase bigger fights and bigger purses in the United States.|$|E

[...] On December 20, 2008, he fought, at the Hallenstadion in Zürich, Switzerland, the WBA Heavyweight Champion Nikolai Valuev for a paycheck of $600,000, the lowest amount {{he has ever}} received for a championship fight.

2500|$|Civil rights figures came {{to believe}} that Ali had an {{energizing}} effect on the freedom movement as a whole.

[...] "For the <b>heavyweight</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> who had achieved the highest level of athletic celebrity, to put all of that on the line—the money, the ability to get endorsements—to sacrifice all of that for a cause, gave a whole sense of legitimacy to the movement and the causes with young people that nothing else could have done. Even those who were assassinated, certainly lost their lives, but they didn't voluntarily do that. He knew he was going to jail and did it anyway. That's another level of leadership and sacrifice." ...|$|E
2500|$|The sanctioning bodies {{ordered a}} rematch. Eight months later in Las Vegas (13 November 1999), {{the two men}} fought again in a more open and {{entertaining}} contest than the original fight, with the two boxers having some heavy exchanges from rounds six to nine. The punch stats however still clearly favoured Lewis who landed 195 punches to Evander Holyfield's 137 punches, although interestingly Lewis landed 119 power shots and 76 jabs, showing a definite shift in his tactics from the first fight when he focused more on the jab. This time around the three judges scored the fight unanimously (115–113, 116–112 & 117–111) in favour of Lewis who became undisputed <b>heavyweight</b> <b>champion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World.</b> [...] The British public voted Lewis the 1999 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.|$|E
