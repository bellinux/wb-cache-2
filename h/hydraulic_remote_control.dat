40|$|The article {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of the <b>hydraulic</b> line for <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> of electro-hydraulic servo drive (EHSD) with throttle control. This type of hydraulic lines is designed as a backup to replace the electrical connections, which are used to <b>control</b> EHSD being <b>remote</b> from the site with devices located to form the control signals of any object. A disadvantage of electric connections {{is that they are}} sensitive to magnetic fields and thereby do not provide the required reliability of the <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> lines have no this disadvantage and therefore are used in aircraft and other industrial systems. However, dynamic characteristics of hydraulic systems still have been investigated insufficiently in the case of transmitting control signals at a distance at which the signal may be distorted when emerging the wave processes. The article results of mathematical simulation, which are verified through physical experimentation, largely eliminate the shortcomings of said information. The mathematical model described in the paper is based on the theory of unsteady pressure compressible fluids. In the model there are formulas that provide calculation of frequency characteristics of the hydraulic lines under hydraulic oscillations of the laminar flow parameters of viscous fluid. A real mock-up of the system under consideration and an experimental ad hoc unit are used to verify the results of mathematically simulated hydraulic systems. Calculated logarithmic amplitude and phase frequency characteristics compared with those obtained experimentally prove, under certain conditions, the proposed theoretical method of calculation. These conditions have to ensure compliance with initial parameters of fluid defined under stationary conditions. The applied theory takes into consideration a non-stationary hydraulic resistance of the line when calculating frequency characteristics. The scientific novelty in the article material is presented in verification results of the mathematical model of the hydraulic system in the space-distributed parameters. </p...|$|R
25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
