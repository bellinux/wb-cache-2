Afterward, series creator Kari Lizer {{slammed the}} network, suggesting {{the decision to}} cancel the series was sexist. In an interview with TV Guide, Lizer stated: [...] "As far as what happened at CBS, we’ve suffered from {{a serious lack of}} support from them since the beginning. I hate to say it, but I’m afraid they don’t care much for the female-of-a-certain-age point of view over there. <b>How</b> else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> them squandering the talents of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Wanda Sykes?" [...] With support from Lizer, Warner Bros. Television began negotiations to continue the series on ABC, but a deal could not be made reportedly due to a high licensing fee to keep the series going.|$|R

Sify gave it 2 out of 5 stars saying [...] "You try {{so hard to}} {{understand}} what No Smoking tries to say, but the film is like one big puzzle that refuses to get solved. John makes a sincere attempt to leave a mark and succeeds to an extent. Really, one wonders, what prompted John to instantly approve this bizarre story". Rajeev Masand of IBN Live giving it 1.5/5 said [...] "What the director gives us is an extremely arrogant piece of work that reeks of over-confidence and self-proclaimed genius. <b>How</b> else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> the intentionally incohesive screenplay, the bizarre dialogue, and the blatant disregard for the viewer's time and patience?". Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India also gave it 1.5/5 stars and said [...] "No Smoking leaves you completely baffled and desperately looking for logic in its surreal sequences of John in a jaded jail, John in a tunnel, John in a bathtub, John in Siberia-like surroundings". Indu Mirani from DNA India rated it 1.5/5 saying [...] "There is {{a fine line between}} intelligence and indulgence and with No Smoking, director Anurag Kashyap crosses it often. It’s not like he has made a rank bad film, but ‘No Smoking’ is so influenced by graphic novels and Neil Gaiman books, that understanding its plot’s many forward and backward movements would be out of the scope of the layman". Khalid Mohamed of Hindustan Times rated it 1 star and said [...] "Too in-depth man, too in-depth, puffing, driving, the sex act, fingers being chopped. Kcuf, kcuf. what’s happening out here? You can’t make out, you don’t care, and you’re fed up of the affectations, the self-indulgence." [...] Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama giving it 1 out of 5 said [...] "You try so hard to understand what No Smoking tries to say, but the film is like one big puzzle that refuses to get solved. What ails No Smoking, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ask. Simple, it's the most complicated cinematic experience of 2007. On the whole, No Smoking fails miserably. Very disappointing!". Prithviraj Hegde of Rediff.com gave the film 0 stars and said [...] "The movie unfolds like a bad dream and spins into a downward spiral that's unreal, incomprehensible and leaves you dazed. And as you may have gathered, I still have no clue what the movie was about." [...] On the contrary, Chandril bhattacharya of Anandabazar patrika praised the movie uninhibitedly and described the film as first of its kind in India and historical.|$|R
