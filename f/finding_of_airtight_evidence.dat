40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{projects that}} deal with important requirements for achieving an airtight building. The major themes are: (1) problem areas with respect to airtightness, (2) how to find leaky areas and improve their airtightness, (3) good and airtight solutions, and (4) durability <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> layers and joints. First, critical details for airtightness are identified and analyzed. Poor airtightness is often caused by lack <b>of</b> consideration <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> details in the design phase, by poor workmanship, or by {{lack of understanding of}} airtightness during construction. The consequences of poor airtightness are described. Second, different methods of searching for air leaks are investigated and evaluated. Searching for leaks during the construction phase is a good way of improving airtightness, since the airtight layers are more accessible during erection of the building than when the building is completed. Third, several buildings with very good measured airtightness are investigated in order to provide airtight solutions to designers and builders. A number of important details and designs are collected and presented to the building industry...|$|R
50|$|The Nicolas Appert Award {{is awarded}} by the Chicago Section of the Institute of Food Technologists for preeminence in and {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} food technology. The award has been given annually since 1942 and is named after Nicolas Appert, the French inventor <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> food preservation.

50|$|The {{hygroscopic}} {{nature of}} the honeycomb centre continued to be problematic. Competitors tried to prove the bars weren't fresh by squeezing them. Hoadley responded by instituting a strict coding system {{to keep track of}} the shelf life (12 months) and ensure that only the freshest bars were sold. In addition, he searched worldwide for a new type <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> wrapper that would keep the bar fresh. Eventually, a French company, La Cellophane, invented a metallised cellophane especially for Violet Crumble.|$|R
25|$|With the {{discovery}} of the importance <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> containers for food preservation by French inventor Nicholas Appert, the tin canning process was patented by British merchant Peter Durand in 1810. After receiving the patent, Durand did not himself follow up with canning food. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, who refined the process and product and set up the world's first commercial canning factory on Southwark Park Road, London. By 1813, they were producing the first canned goods for the Royal Navy.|$|R

This reduced the risk that they would be flooded by a following sea (i.e. having waves breaking over the stern). If a lifeboat had to be beached, the design would also resist the incoming surf. Another safety feature consisted <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> copper tanks within the boats' sides to provide extra buoyancy.|$|R

50|$|The movie deals {{about three}} friend Amarnath, Gopal and his sister, Mala. As Mala and Gopal's mom is a widow and {{is unable to}} care for both the children, she decides to let her Bombay-based cousin, Shobha R. Sharma, adopt Mala. Gopal is always {{in trouble with the}} villagers for petty theft, and when he learns that Mala has left, he too runs away from home. Years later, all three have grown up. Mala's mom is deceased, while she {{continues}} to live with her aunt and uncle, Public Prosecutor Ramnath Sharma; Amarnath is now an Advocate working with Senior Advocate Mehta, and is in love with Mala, not knowing that she is his childhood friend; while Gopal has been to prison in Poona, Madras, and the Police in Hyderabad want him for questioning. Soon Amarnath will be defending Gopal, alias Ram Singh, for the murder of one Mohanchand - and it will be an uphill task for Amarnath - for not only do the Police have <b>airtight</b> <b>evidence</b> against Gopal, Mohanchand was to be the future son-in-law of Ramnath - who has sworn to bring Gopal to justice by hook or by crook.|$|R
50|$|As {{air flows}} inwards through the {{insulation}} it picks up, via the insulation fibres, {{the heat that}} is being conducted to the outside. Dynamic insulation is thus able to achieve the dual function of reducing the heat loss through the walls and/or roof whilst {{at the same time}} supplying pre-warmed air to the indoor spaces. Dynamic insulation would appear, therefore, to overcome the major disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> envelopes which is that the quality of the indoor air will deteriorate unless there is natural or mechanical ventilation. However, dynamic insulation also requires mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in order to recover the heat in the exhaust air.|$|R

5000|$|The modern orchestral {{standard}} of using soprano clarinets in both B and A {{has to do}} partly {{with the history of}} the instrument, and partly with acoustics, aesthetics, and economics. Before about 1800, due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> pads (see History), practical woodwinds could have only a few keys to control accidentals (notes outside their diatonic home scales). The low (chalumeau) register of the clarinet spans a twelfth (an octave plus a perfect fifth), so the clarinet needs keys/holes to produce all nineteen notes in that range. This involves more keywork than is necessary on instruments that [...] "overblow" [...] at the octave—oboes, flutes, bassoons, and saxophones, for example, which need only twelve notes before overblowing.|$|R
5000|$|Persuasion {{can control}} a person {{through the use}} of pheromones, {{reducing}} them to a near-mindless state, extremely receptive to suggestion. A side effect of her power is that the people she controls turn purple temporarily. Upon recovery from Kara's power, her victims usually have a splitting headache. Persuasion's powers apparently cannot affect the body's involuntary systems. An order to [...] "drop dead" [...] would only result in the loss of consciousness. She can steal control of people from other mind controllers such as Mesmero. Her power can be nullified by encasing Kara in plastic or other forms <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> imprisonment (thus preventing her pheromones from affecting others), as does submerging the affected person.|$|R

Thorough investigation of the factors affecting catalyst performance under these conditions is of key importance for the successful implementation of catalytic processes. Here, we present a reactor setup suitable for comprehensive systematic characterization and optimization of biocatalyzed reactions in biphasic systems with distinct phases. It is distinguished by small volumes allowing reproducible experimentation with minimum amounts of solvent and catalyst. The interfacial area is kept constant and independent stirring of both phases is allowed {{in order to minimize}} superimposing effects. Evaporation of low-volatile organic solvents is prevented by use <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> construction.

Structure failure risk {{caused by}} air wave on {{high-speed}} vehicle airtight body is considered and it’s {{necessary to bring}} out the conception <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> fatigue strength and start related research. There is a review of airwave and structure fields, including air dynamic of rail-vehicle, load carrying structure and strength test standard. Nowadays, the direction of air dynamic research is focused on how to reduce air wave pressure and enhance stability of running vehicle; the structure study is focused on static and transient load carrying response of wheels, bogie and so on structures under traction running and weight load. It’s not been fully researched that how the airtight structure vehicles response when carrying air-dynamic in long run. Based on current research, an analysis line is brought out which contains simulation and experiment, fluid-structure interaction study and structure fatigue assessment calculation...|$|R

Endothelial cells were exposed to 20 % (control), 50, and 95 % O 2 for 3  days. Exposure to 30 % O 2 was not performed in this assay, due to limitations in the number <b>of</b> <b>airtight</b> boxes. Furthermore, pilot experiments showed that exposure to 30 % O 2 did not affect cell death and proliferative capacity when compared to 20 % O 2 (control). Cells from three donors were pooled and seeded in duplicate with a density of 13 [*]×[*] 103 cells/cm 2 on 12 wells 1 % w/v gelatin-coated culture plates. The plates were placed in airtight boxes and were exposed to the indicated oxygen concentration. Pictures were taken every 24  h using a phase-contrast microscope.
