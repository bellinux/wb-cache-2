25|$|Some fuses allow {{a special}} purpose micro switch or relay unit {{to be fixed}} to the fuse body. When the <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> blows, the {{indicating}} pin extends to activate the micro switch or relay, which, in turn, triggers an event.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> used in most {{distribution}} cutouts are tin {{or silver}} alloy wires that melt when subjected to high enough current. Ampere ratings of <b>fuse</b> <b>elements</b> vary from 1 ampere to 200 amperes.|$|R

25|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> {{is made of}} zinc, copper, silver, aluminum, or alloys {{to provide}} stable and {{predictable}} characteristics. The fuse ideally would carry its rated current indefinitely, and melt quickly on a small excess. The element must not be damaged by minor harmless surges of current, and must not oxidize or change its behavior after possibly years of service.|$|E
25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a metal strip or wire <b>fuse</b> <b>element,</b> of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E

2500|$|In medium-voltage {{distribution}} systems, a {{power fuse}} {{may be used}} to protect a transformer serving 1–3 houses. [...] Pole-mounted distribution transformers are nearly always protected by a fusible cutout, which can have the <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> replaced using live-line maintenance tools.|$|E
2500|$|The I2t {{rating is}} related to the amount of energy let through by the <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> when it clears the {{electrical}} fault. This term is normally used in short circuit conditions and the values are used to perform co-ordination studies in electrical networks. I2t [...] parameters are provided by charts in manufacturer data sheets for each fuse family. [...] For coordination of fuse operation with upstream or downstream devices, both [...] melting I2t and clearing I2t are specified. The melting I2t is proportional to the amount of energy required to begin melting the <b>fuse</b> <b>element.</b> The clearing I2t is proportional to the total energy let through by the fuse when clearing a fault. The energy is mainly dependent on current and time for fuses as well as the available fault level and system voltage. Since the I2t rating of the fuse is proportional to the energy it lets through, it {{is a measure of the}} thermal damage from the heat and magnetic forces that will be produced by a fault.|$|E
2500|$|While glass fuses {{have the}} {{advantage}} of a <b>fuse</b> <b>element</b> visible for inspection purposes, they have a low breaking capacity (interrupting rating), which generally restricts them to applications of 15 A or less at 250 VAC. Ceramic fuses {{have the advantage}} of a higher breaking capacity, facilitating their use in circuits with higher current and voltage. Filling a fuse body with sand provides additional cooling of the arc and increases the breaking capacity of the fuse. [...] Medium-voltage fuses may have liquid-filled envelopes to assist in the extinguishing of the arc. Some types of distribution switchgear use fuse links immersed in the oil that fills the equipment.|$|E
