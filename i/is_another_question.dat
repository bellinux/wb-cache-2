5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>question.</b> Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E
25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king had <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>question.</b> Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E
500|$|One such problem set as a {{task for}} a genetic program was {{to design a}} {{crossover}} filter for woofer and tweeter loudspeakers. The output design was identical in topology to a design found in a patent of Zobel's for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, {{not only because of}} the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were [...] "decomposed" [...] as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters. Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a hi-fi system <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>question.</b> The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the above}} {{equations}} {{are the most}} used form in literature, some comments about the notation are necessary. Generally, D and E are vectors, that is, Cartesian tensors of rank 1; and permittivity ε is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 tensors. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11→1; 22→2; 33→3; 23→4; 13→5; 12→6. (Different conventions may be used by different authors in literature. For example, some use 12→4; 23→5; 31→6 instead.) That is why S and T appear to have the [...] "vector form" [...] of six components. Consequently, s {{appears to be a}} 6-by-6 matrix instead of a rank-4 tensor. Such a relabeled notation is often called Voigt notation. Whether the shear strain components S4, S5, S6 are tensor components or engineering strains <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>question.</b> In the equation above, they must be engineering strains for the 6,6 coefficient of the compliance matrix to be written as shown, i.e., 2(s−s). Engineering shear strains are double the value of the corresponding tensor shear, such as S6=2S12 and so on. This also means that s66=, where G12 is the shear modulus.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000." [...] When this scenario did not occur, he responded that [...] "When you predict the future, you get things wrong. How wrong <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>question.</b> I would have lost if I had had taken the bet. However, if you look closely at England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else." [...] Ehrlich wrote in The Population Bomb that, [...] "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980." ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of {{electromagnetic}} propagation, men have for various reasons been striving for frequencies which drive higher and higher into the frequency spectrum. With the advent of these higher frequencies, other problems arose which were not encountered at lower orders of frequency.

Power radiating from an antenna was highly desired, but power, radiating from the transmission line which was feeding the antenna, <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>question...</b>|$|R
