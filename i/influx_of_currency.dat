40|$|This article {{employs the}} theory of buffer zone trade to {{understand}} archaeological data related to trade in Wiman Chosŏn (195 – 108 b. c.), {{one of the earliest}} states in Korean history. Buffer zone trade is performed by an entity (B) placed between a fully developed state with a centralized government (C), and an underdeveloped polity in a periphery (P). B creates a route to convey C’s advanced products, and exports imported goods from C as well as its own products to neighboring polities in the periphery, while controlling the flow of luxury materials. Significantly, in this process B moderates the impact of more powerful and regionally dominant civilizations on the polities in the periphery, therefore preventing these peripheral polities from losing their indigenous cultures entirely or experiencing structural collapse. Furthermore, B exercises authority over the polities in the periphery, controlling the flow of advanced materials. Wiman Chosŏn imported Han’s monetary currency, iron products, weapons, farming tools, high-fired pottery, horse trappings, bronze mirrors, and bronze vessels, while exporting a few simple iron tools like hand knives, bronze mirrors, slender daggers, and fine-lined mirrors to Chin. Interestingly, the discrepancy of both {{the quality and quantity of}} the imported Han products takes place in the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, there was no <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> Han <b>currencies</b> and iron weaponry in the southern Korean Peninsula before the second century b. c.

40|$|Heterocysts are {{differentiated}} cells {{formed by}} some filamentous, diazotrophic (dinitrogen-fixing) cyanobacteria. The heterocyst {{is the site}} of dinitrogen fixation providing the oxygen-sensitivenitrogenase with a low-oxygen environment. The diffusion of air into the heterocyst is a compromisebetween the maximum <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> dinitrogen gas while oxygen is kept sufficiently low to allownitrogenase activity. This investigation tested the hypothesis that the heterocyst is capable ofcontrolling the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> air. Here, the thermophilic heterocystous cyanobacterium Fischerella sp. was analysed for the effects of oxygen concentration and temperature on nitrogenase activity. Darknitrogenase activity is directly related to aerobic respiration and was therefore used as a measure ofthe <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> oxygen into the heterocyst. Above 30 % O 2, the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> oxygen was proportional to itsexternal concentration. Below this concentration, the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> oxygen was higher than expected fromthe external concentration. A higher or lower temperature also triggered the heterocyst to increase ordecrease, respectively, dark nitrogenase activity while the external concentration of oxygen was keptconstant. A higher dark nitrogenase activity requires a higher rate of respiration and therefore a higherflux of oxygen. Hence, the heterocyst of Fischerella sp. is capable <b>of</b> controlling the <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> air...|$|R
