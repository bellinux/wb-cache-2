50|$|In Japan, sushi has {{traditionally}} been considered a delicacy. The original type of sushi, nare-zushi, was first developed in Southeast Asia and then spread to southern China before its introduction to Japan sometime around the 8th century AD. Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Nare-zushi was made of this <b>gutted</b> <b>fish</b> stored in fermented rice {{for months at a}} time for preservation. The fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling. The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for the Japanese. During the Muromachi period, another way of preparing sushi was developed, called namanare. Namanare was partly raw fish wrapped in rice, consumed fresh, before it changed flavor. During the Edo period, a third type of sushi was developed, haya-zushi. Haya-zushi was assembled so that both rice and fish could be consumed at the same time, and the dish became unique to Japanese culture. It was the first time that rice was not being used for fermentation. Rice was now mixed with vinegar, with fish, vegetables and dried foodstuff added. This type of sushi is still very popular today. Each region utilizes local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations.|$|E
5000|$|Through {{interviews}} with the Russian and Ukrainian plane crew, local factory owners, guards, prostitutes, fishermen and other villagers, the film discusses {{the effects of the}} introduction of the Nile perch to Lake Victoria, how it has affected the ecosystem and economy of the region. The film also dwells at length on the dichotomy between European aid which is being funneled into Africa on the one hand, and the unending flow of munitions and weapons from European arms dealers on the other. Arms and munitions are often flown in on the same planes which transport the Nile perch fillets to European consumers, feeding the very conflicts which the aid was sent to remedy. As Dima, the radio engineer of the plane crew, says later on in the film: the children of Angola receive guns for Christmas, the children of Europe receive grapes. The appalling living and working conditions of the indigenous people, in which basic sanitation is completely absent and many children turn to drugs and prostitution, is covered in great depth; because the Nile perch is fished and processed for export, all the prime fillets are sold to European supermarkets, leaving the local people to survive on the festering carcasses of the <b>gutted</b> <b>fish.</b> As to why the local fish can't be sold to the domestic market to counter the impending famine (local news reports relayed in the film indicated Northern and Central Tanzania were facing famine), one fish processing factory manager says [...] "it is too expensive".|$|E

Here, we identify some deep-dwelling cephalopods that appear in the diet of seabirds, review the current knowledge of their vertical distribution, and compare the stomach contents of commercially captured tuna with those of seabirds foraging in the same area. The limited available information leads us to conclude that tuna longliners are unlikely to be a major source of deep-dwelling cephalopods for seabirds. However, much more information is required on the ecology of seabird prey, particularly commercially unexploited cephalopod species, which may be obtained from scientific cruises devoted to cephalopod biological research. In addition multispecies/foodweb modelling studies may be required to explore potential interactions between seabirds, their predators and prey, and commercial fishing operations...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the quality changes in whole, gutted and filleted three fish species, whiting (Gadus euxinus), gray mullet (Mugil cephalus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus), at frozen storage period (&# 8211; 26 0;C). Throughout the storage period, anchovy had the lowest values in all sensorial criteria among the fish spe-cies. During the storage period, whiting kept its freshness better than gray mullet and an-chovy as to chemical criteria. The lowest TVB-N value (17. 23 mg/ 100 g) was determined in whiting whereas the highest value (22. 55 mg/ 100 g) in anchovy. The highest TMA value (3. 50 mg/ 100 g) was found in anchovy. The TBA values increased up to 9 th month, depending on fish species. Differences between the species are found to be significant and the highest TBA value (2. 55) was obtained in anchovy. Although the TBA and peroxide values in anchovy significantly increase when compared to the others during storage pe-riod, acceptable limits expired at the end of 9 th month.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Solid {{fish waste}} is {{generated}} from the unwanted parts of fish including heads, tails, fins, frames, offal (guts, kidney and liver) and skin. It accounts for up to 80 % of material from production of surimi, 66 % from production of fillet and 27 % from production of headed and <b>gutted</b> <b>fish.</b> Currently, fish wastes are disposed off in land-based waste disposal systems or at sea generating toxic by-products during the decomposition process. However, fish processing waste {{can be used to}} produce commercially valuable by-products, such as chymotrypsin. Approach: A comperehensive review of the literature on the extraction, purification and characeterization of fish chymotrypsin was performed. Results: Chymotrypsin is an endopeptidase secreted by the pancreatic tissues of vertebrates and invertebrates. It has 3 different structures (chymotrypsin A, B and C) varying slightly in solubility, electrophoretic mobility, isoelectric point and cleavage specificity. Only chymotrypsin A and B are found in fish. Compared with mammal chymotrypsin, fish chymotrypsins have similar amino acid composition and molecular weights. Fish chymotrypsins have higher specific activity, especially those from cold-water fish, and low pH and temperature tolerance. The factors affecting the concentration and activity of chymotrypsin in fish are water temperature, fish species, fish age, fish weight and starvation. Chymotrypsin has application in various industries including the food industry, leather production industry chemical industry and medical industry...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of gutting on sensory, {{microbial}} and chemical characteristics, and fatty acid profile of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during storage at - 18 º C. To this end, 42 rainbow trout were prepared and divided into two groups. First group selected as whole fish and the other group were gutted, washed and were placed in selofan-pack and then were frozen at - 18 °C. Afterwards, the quality characteristics (TVB-N, TBA, and PV), nutrient compounds (protein, fat, moisture and ash), fatty acid profiles, microbial community (total count and psychrophilic bacteria) and sensory indices were evaluated during 3 months of frozen storage. The results showed a different between two groups in moisture contents, PV, TBA and TVB-N parameters during storage (P< 0. 05). Evaluation of fatty acid profile revealed 15 fatty acids. In both groups, the MUFA, SFA and PUFA were the most abundant fatty acids, respectively. During the storage period, the composition of fatty acids was found to be different between the two groups. Although microbial examinations showed no significant difference in the population of psychrophilic bacteria among the two groups, the load of total bacteria was found significantly (P< 0. 05) different. Sensory evaluations revealed significant (P< 0. 05) difference among all indices between the gutted and whole fishes.

40|$|The {{quality of}} portion-size farmed gilthead {{seabream}} (Sparus aurata) during frozen storage {{and the influence}} of post-mortem treatments were studied in order to find new ways of marketing this species. Portion-sized gilthead seabream, fasted for 48 h prior to slaughter, were frozen and stored at - 20 °C for up to one year. Whole fish were frozen immediately after rigor mortis; <b>gutted</b> <b>fish</b> were frozen immediately after rigor and after 5 days of storage in ice. All lots were stored at - 20 °C for up to one year. The myofibrillar protein of this species was very stable and a slight decrease of solubility in salt solutions was found only after one year of frozen storage. A slight decrease in water-holding capacity and a slight increase in shear strength were observed, but these were lower than in other species. These changes were reflected as increased toughness and reduced juiciness in sensory analysis of the cooked fillets after one year. The main changes in the cooked fillets were observed in odour and flavour. No significant detrimental effect due to the guts was detected during frozen storage. Storage in ice prior to freezing was reflected in sensory assessment of the raw fish, mainly in terms of initial higher demerit points for fishy odour, gills and eyes; however, no effect was observed in the cooked fillets. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.
