50|$|Systems Design (synthesis): The {{analysis}} is thoroughly reviewed {{and a new}} system is created. The system that surrounds the system is often the most important. What data needs {{to go into the}} system and how <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> handled? What information needs {{to come out of the}} system how is it going to be formatted? If we know what needs to come out, we know what we need to put into the system. The program we select will need to appropriately handle the process. The system is built with control files, sample master records, and the ability to perform processes on a test basis. The system is designed to include appropriate internal controls and to provide management with the information needed to make decisions. It is a goal of an accounting information system to provide information that is relevant, meaningful, reliable, useful, and current. To achieve this, the system is designed so that transactions are entered as they occur (either manually or electronically) and information is immediately available online for management.|$|E
5000|$|Early February 2011: Decided to make {{an album}} {{inspired}} by the Japanese post-war economic miracle. While searching for more information I found an old photo of the Mihama nuclear plant. The fact that this futuristic-looking plant was situated in such a beautiful spot {{so close to the}} sea made me curious. Are they safe when it comes to earthquakes and tsunamis? Further reading revealed that many of these plants are situated in earthquake-prone areas, some of them are even located next to shores that had been hit in the past by tsunamis.A photo of Mihama made me narrow down my focus only to Japanese nuclear plants. I wanted to make a soundtrack to some of them, concentrating on the architecture, design and localizations, but also questioning the potential radiation danger (a cooling system being destroyed by a landslide or earthquake, etc). As the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said: [...] "the plants were so well designed that 'such a situation is practically impossible'.The album was finished on February 13th. On March 17th I received the following message from a Facebook friend: 'Geir, some time ago you asked people for a photo of a Japanese nuclear powerplant. <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the sleeve of your new coming album? But more importantly: how did you actually predict the future? Kind regards, David.'" ...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the archiving of materials from endangered languages needs to be not just the archiving of recordings, but also a rich metadata, including, wherever possible, transcriptions, translations, and glossing of the meaningful elements in the languages which would otherwise be lost. All linguistic transcriptions and analysis face complex issues of transcription; there are always alternate ways to represent language transcriptions, such as whether certain grammatical elements {{should be treated as}} separate phonological elements, words or particles, or treated as affixes or clitics. In many cases these alternate analyses are in the purview of the linguist; with speakers of the language more or less agreeing on what the form is. With traditional songs and ritual texts, whether in oral or written form, there can be alternate analyses depending on the consultants that the linguist is working with, and these analyses can change over time. For example, when listening back to recordings of traditional ritual / sung texts, consultants sometimes interpret something different on the recording from that which is clearly audible. Which version should be transcribed? Which version is correct? The issue becomes much more complicated when the interpretation of the meaning of such texts is undertaken. And in traditional societies, the interpretations of these materials may have, and did, change over time. So how <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dealt and fit in with the archivist's intention to make 'permanent' records, records that don't change over time? The idea of a 'permanent' record wouldn't have been possible in traditional societies where reanalysis and meaning changing was ongoing. Using examples from Singpho sagas (Hka yawng ningkin, the 'water flowing song), the Tangsa ritual songs (Wihu Qhyoe, the song for the earth mother) and Ahom ritual manuscripts (Ming Mvng Lung Phai, the text for calling back the tutelary spirit of the country), we will demonstrate and discuss these issues.
