A company <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the 126th Infantry Brigade was deployed in Šuica, but it is unclear if it actively {{took part in the}} battle.

Her assessments use stimulus drawings to bypass language disorders in assessing cognitive skills, and {{to provide access to}} emotions and attitudes. The Silver Drawing Test, which measures perceptions essential to mathematics and reading, has three subtests: <b>drawing</b> <b>from</b> imagination, <b>drawing</b> <b>from</b> observation and predictive <b>drawing.</b> The <b>Drawing</b> <b>from</b> Imagination test in the Silver Drawing Test is similar to Silvers’ assessment, Draw a Story.|$|R
40|$|In the private-values, second-price auction framework, {{we propose}} a simple {{parametric}} model {{to analyze the}} effects of mergers when bidders' values are correlated. Correlation is induced by allowing bidders to <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> a mixture of distributions belonging to a power-related family. For example, if two bidders <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> "high" distributions at the same time, then their values are positively correlated. The dominant strategy equilibrium of second-price auctions implies that if bidders <b>draw</b> correlated values <b>from</b> a mixture of power-related distributions, then winning bids can be expressed as a mixture over auctions in which bidders <b>draw</b> <b>from</b> independent power-related distributions.
