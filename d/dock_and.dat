5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was also}} heavy on Bimini island, where heavy {{rainfall}} and powerful storm surge damaged homes, trees, and utility poles. On the island, the hurricane severely damaged {{a hotel and}} eight waterfront homes. On Abaco, eight homes and a governmental clinic were destroyed. The storm surge destroyed a government <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast. New Providence and the Berry Islands also reported minor wind damage from Wilma, primarily to downed trees and power lines. Throughout the Bahamas, Wilma damaged public infrastructure such as schools, roads, health clinics, and electrical systems.|$|E

During this service, she underwent refits at Portsmouth in 1909–1910, during which she received fire control equipment for her main battery, and 1911–1912. From June 1912 to January 1913 she served as a seagoing gunnery training ship at the Nore.

5|$|Portishead has a {{long history}} as a fishing port. As a Royal Manor it {{expanded}} rapidly during the early 19thcentury around the docks, with supporting transport infrastructure. A power station and chemical works were added in the 20th century, but the <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> industrial facilities have since closed and been redeveloped into a marina and residential areas. Portishead was also the telephone control centre used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as Portishead Radio.|$|E
5|$|The City of Bridgeport {{appointed}} a bridge commission {{to replace the}} aging East Washington Avenue Bridge on December 7, 1915. The commission chose a Joseph B. Strausss patented design from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company of Chicago, Illinois. The city engineer James A. McElroy drew up {{the plans for the}} bridge's specifications and the plans were completed on February 17, 1916. The steel for the construction was ordered from the Penn Bridge Company. The project was suspended because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds to erect the bridge, but in 1923 the State of Connecticut appropriated $350,000 to complete the project. Only two bids for the bridge's erection were placed, the first by Bridgeport Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>and</b> Dredging for $326,575 and the second by C. W. Blakeslee and Sons for $389,492 with estimations varying based on extra work needed. Bridgeport Dry <b>Dock</b> <b>and</b> Dredging won the contract and the materials were shipped to Bridgeport, with work beginning mid-1924. The completed bridge included an operator's house and a public toilet building. The bridge, costing over $550,000 in total, was turned over to the city on October 14, 1925.|$|E
