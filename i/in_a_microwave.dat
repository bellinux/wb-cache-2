25|$|Whether {{polystyrene}} can be microwaved {{with food}} is controversial. Some containers may be safely used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave,</b> {{but only if}} labelled as such. Some sources suggest that foods containing carotene (Vitamin A) or cooking oils must be avoided.|$|E
25|$|A popcorn bag is a {{specially}} designed, microwaveable bag that contains popcorn, along with oil, spices and seasoning. The bag is typically partially folded {{when it is}} placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven, and inflates {{as a result of}} steam pressure from the heated kernels. The earliest patent for the popcorn bag, U.S. patent #4,267,420 was filed on October 12, 1978 by William A. Brastad of Minneapolis and issued on May 12, 1981.|$|E

25|$|The {{second problem}} {{is due to}} food {{composition}} and geometry, and must be addressed by the cook, by arranging the food so that it absorbs energy evenly, and periodically testing and shielding any parts of the food that overheat. In some materials with low thermal conductivity, where dielectric constant increases with temperature, microwave heating can cause localized thermal runaway. Under certain conditions, glass can exhibit thermal runaway <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> {{to the point of}} melting.|$|E
25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven for 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal reflective layer, but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders {{are also designed to}} shred CDs.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{magnetron}} is {{a fairly}} efficient device. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven, for instance, a 1.1-kilowatt input will generally create about 700 watts of microwave power, an efficiency of around 65%. (The high-voltage and {{the properties of the}} cathode determine the power of a magnetron.) Large S band magnetrons can produce up to 2.5 megawatts peak power with an average power of 3.75kW. Some large magnetrons are water cooled. The magnetron remains in widespread use in roles which require high power, but where precise control over frequency and phase is unimportant.|$|E

A similar incident in 2005, involved students cooking a cat alive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> further aggravated the situation, as this {{was seen as a}} further example of animal cruelty by students of UKZN. The university was smashed for turning a 'blind eye' to animal cruelty and the university was criticised for not disciplining the alleged culprits.|$|E
25|$|Modern-day frozen dinners {{tend to come}} in {{microwave}}-safe containers. Product lines {{also tend}} to offer a larger variety of dinner types. These dinners, also known as microwave meals, {{can be purchased at}} most supermarkets. They are stored frozen. To prepare them, the plastic cover is removed or vented, and the meal is heated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven for a few minutes. They are convenient since they essentially require no preparation time other than the heating, although some frozen dinners may require the preparer to briefly carry out an intermediate step (such as stirring mashed potatoes midway through the heating cycle) to ensure adequate heating and uniform consistency of component items.|$|E
25|$|Common dishes are: mashed {{potatoes}}, {{which are}} first boiled (usually peeled), and then mashed with milk or yogurt and butter; whole baked potatoes; boiled or steamed potatoes; French-fried potatoes or chips; cut into cubes and roasted; scalloped, diced, or sliced and fried (home fries); grated into small thin strips and fried (hash browns); grated and formed into dumplings, Rösti or potato pancakes. Unlike many foods, potatoes {{can also be}} easily cooked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven and still retain nearly all of their nutritional value, provided they are covered in ventilated plastic wrap to prevent moisture from escaping; this method produces a meal very similar to a steamed potato, while retaining {{the appearance of a}} conventionally baked potato. Potato chunks also commonly appear as a stew ingredient.|$|E

25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the oven or frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside the oven, and {{partly due to the}} different rates of energy absorption {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts of the oven as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center of the oven, which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E
25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E

2500|$|Closed containers, such as eggs, can explode when heated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave</b> oven {{due to the}} {{increased}} pressure from steam. Intact fresh egg yolks outside the shell will also explode, as a result [...] of superheating. Insulating plastic foams of all types generally contain closed air pockets, and are generally not recommended for use <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>microwave,</b> as the air pockets explode and the foam (which can be toxic if consumed) may melt.

2500|$|Individual {{consumers}} can also buy and use specialized popping appliances that typically generate {{no more than}} a gallon or about four liters of popped corn per batch. Some of these appliances also accept a small volume of oil or melted butter to assist thermal transfer from a stationary heating element, but others are [...] "air poppers" [...] which rapidly circulate heated air up through the interior, keeping the un-popped kernels in motion to avoid burning and then blowing the popped kernels out through the chute.
