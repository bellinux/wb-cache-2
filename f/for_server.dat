5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used <b>for</b> <b>server</b> management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its expiry date from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Windows Live OneCare 2.5 (build 2.5.2900.28) final was {{released}} on 3 July 2008. On the same day, Microsoft also released Windows Live OneCare <b>for</b> <b>Server</b> 2.5.|$|E
25|$|After Windows 2000, Microsoft {{also changed}} its release {{schedules}} <b>for</b> <b>server</b> operating systems; the server counterpart of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, {{was released in}} April 2003. It was followed in December 2005, by Windows Server 2003 R2.|$|E

25|$|Server {{editions of}} Windows are widely used. In recent years, Microsoft has {{expended}} significant capital {{in an effort}} to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system. However, Windows' usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers as Windows competes against Linux and BSD <b>for</b> <b>server</b> market share.|$|E
25|$|Version 1.5 of OneCare is only {{compatible}} with the 32 bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Vista. Version 2 of OneCare supports 64 bit compatibility to Vista. In version 2.5, Microsoft released Windows Live OneCare <b>for</b> <b>Server</b> which supports Windows Server 2008 Standard 64-bit and Windows Small Business Server 2008 Standard and Premium editions. No edition of OneCare operates in safe mode. Windows Live OneCare will not support Windows 7 as its development has been discontinued and replaced by Microsoft Security Essentials.|$|E

25|$|HTML forms sent via email. Support <b>for</b> <b>server</b> side {{scripting}} {{was rare}} on shared servers during this period. To provide a feedback mechanism for web site visitors, mailto forms were used. A user would fill in a form, and upon clicking the form's submit button, their email client would launch {{and attempt to}} send an email containing the form's details. The popularity and complications of the mailto protocol led browser developers to incorporate email clients into their browsers.|$|E
25|$|Windows NT: Started as {{a family}} of {{operating}} system with Windows NT 3.1, an operating system <b>for</b> <b>server</b> computers and workstations. It now consists of three operating system subfamilies that are released almost {{at the same time}} and share the same kernel. It is almost impossible for someone unfamiliar with the subject to identify the members of this family by name because they do not adhere to any specific rule; e.g. Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 and Windows RT are members of this family but Windows 3.1 is not.|$|E
25|$|Bulldozer is AMD's {{microarchitecture}} codename <b>for</b> <b>server</b> and desktop AMD FX processors first {{released on}} October 12, 2011. This family 15h microarchitecture is {{the successor to}} the family 10h (K10) microarchitecture design. Bulldozer is designed from scratch, not a development of earlier processors. The core is specifically aimed at 10â€“125W TDP computing products. AMD claims dramatic performance-per-watt efficiency improvements in high-performance computing (HPC) applications with Bulldozer cores. While hopes were very high that Bulldozer would bring AMD to be performance competitive with archrival Intel once more, most benchmarks were disappointing. In some cases the new Bulldozer products were slower than the K10 model they were built to replace.|$|E

25|$|BSD {{operating}} systems can run much native software {{of several other}} {{operating systems}} on the same architecture, using a binary compatibility layer. Much simpler and faster than emulation, this allows, for instance, applications intended for Linux to be run at effectively full speed. This makes BSDs not only suitable <b>for</b> <b>server</b> environments, but also for workstation ones, given the increasing availability of commercial or closed-source software for Linux only. This also allows administrators to migrate legacy commercial applications, which may have only supported commercial Unix variants, to a more modern operating system, retaining the functionality of such applications until they can {{be replaced by a}} better alternative.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Tukwila" [...] Itanium {{processor}} model {{had been}} designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel's Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal was to streamline system development and reduce costs <b>for</b> <b>server</b> OEMs, many of which develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to [...] "evaluated for future implementation opportunities".|$|E
