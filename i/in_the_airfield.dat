25|$|Executed in the {{starting}} hours of Operation Just Cause, this operation was handled by SEAL Team 4. Consisting of 48 U.S. Navy SEALs (three SEAL Platoons; Golf, Echo, and Delta) {{under the command of}} Lt. Cmdr. Toohey, this SEAL Team was tasked with destroying Noriega's private jet on the ground at the Punta Paitilla Airport, a coastal airport in Panama City. The main force of SEALs landed just south of the airport at approximately 0030, shortly before the initial combat operations started within Panama City itself. Several reconnaissance teams were hidden {{on the north side of}} the airfield to provide real-time data on enemy movements. Once the SEALs landed, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey established a command post near the southern edge of the runway. At this time Cmdr. McGrath, a SEAL officer stationed on a patrol boat offshore coordinating several operations, passed on information implying that the aircraft was to be disabled with “minimal damage” (defined as shot out tires and cut control wires), rather than destroyed. This later became a point of controversy after the operation, as the message was poorly worded and forced the SEALs to change their tactics at the last minute and approach the aircraft more closely than anticipated. The three platoons then began advancing up the airfield, with Golf platoon taking up final assaulting positions outside the hangar at roughly 0105. At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey received a message stating that PDF V300 Cadillac Gage armored cars were heading towards the airport. To counter the threat, a squad (Squad One of Golf Platoon) was ordered to move into ambush positions on a nearby road. As they stood up to move, the PDF soldiers stationed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> immediately opened fire, killing one SEAL and wounding five others. The other two platoons moved to reinforce Golf, and within several minutes had secured the hangars, with two more SEALs killed and four more wounded. The SEALs then disabled Noriega’s private plane by shooting it with an AT4 rocket. Shortly after, a MEDEVAC helicopter arrived and transported the injured SEALs to the Joint Casualty Collection Point at Howard Air Force Base. The SEALs held the area throughout the night, and disabled the runway for use by any PDF transport planes by rolling other aircraft onto it. The next day, the SEALs were replaced by a company from the 75th Ranger Regiment. Due to the high level of casualties sustained and several inconsistencies regarding planning and command and control during the battle, the Battle of Paitilla Airport is considered one of the most controversial operations within Operation JUST CAUSE from the US military perspective.|$|E

5000|$|As of December 2015, its {{imminent}} closure was announced.

50|$|At high altitudes, {{there is}} plenty of space for recovery. But during the final approach, when the {{airplane}} is close to the ground, a stall-spin accident is often fatal. A common cause of this accident is to enter a skidding turn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> traffic pattern on the turn from base leg to final approach, unconsciously using excessive rudder in an attempt to tighten the turn and avoid overshooting the runway centreline.|$|E

However, it still {{remained}} operational for the Argentine C-130 Hercules transports. The bombs falling {{on either side of the}} runway caused slight damage to tented installations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> perimeter.

50|$|In 2009, during {{filming of}} the BBC show Top Gear, {{operations}} {{from the airport}} appeared to be disrupted when a caravan, adapted into an airship and flown by James May, drifted overhead the airport, infringing its controlled airspace.

50|$|The Squadron España {{operated}} {{with these}} aircraft until {{the arrival of}} the modern Polikarpov I-15 and I-16, at which time the three Dewoitine 371s were withdrawn from the front and continued as training aircraft.
