25|$|As the vitelline duct {{is made up}} of {{pluripotent}} cell lining, Meckel’s diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. <b>Jejunal,</b> duodenal mucosa or Brunner's tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. Heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.|$|E
25|$|Ileal {{hypertrophy}} {{occurs when}} the circular and longitudinal layers of the ileal intestinal wall hypertrophy, and can also occur with <b>jejunal</b> hypertrophy. The mucosa remains normal, so malabsorption {{is not expected to}} occur in this disease. Ileal hypertrophy may be idiopathic, with current theories for such cases including neural dysfunction within the intestinal wall secondary to parasite migration, and increased tone of the ileocecal valve which leads to hypertrophy of the ileum as it tries to push contents into the cecum. Hypertrophy may also occur secondary to obstruction, especially those that have had surgery for an obstruction that required an anastomosis. Hypertrophy gradually decreases the size of the lumen, resulting in intermittent colic, and in approximately 45% of cases includes weight loss of 1–6 month duration and anorexia. Although rectal examination may display a thickened ileal wall, usually the diagnosis is made at surgery, and an ileocecal or jejunocecal anastomosis is made to allow intestinal contents to bypass the affected area. If surgery and bypass is not performed, there is a risk of rupture, but prognosis is fair with surgical treatment.|$|E
500|$|The men {{knew that}} the {{pancreas}} produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in the duodenum and jejunum, because of the arrival of chyme there. By severing the duodenal and <b>jejunal</b> nerves in anaesthetized dogs, while leaving the blood vessels intact, then introducing acid into the duodenum and jejunum, they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response, but by {{a new type of}} chemical reflex. They named the chemical messenger secretin, because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, stimulating the pancreas on circulation. In 1905 Starling coined the term hormone—from the Greek hormao [...] meaning [...] "I arouse" [...] or [...] "I excite"—to describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable, in extremely small quantities, of stimulating organs from a distance.|$|E
2500|$|Breath {{tests have}} been {{developed}} to test for bacterial overgrowth, based on bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates to hydrogen and/or methane, or based on the detection of by-products of digestion of carbohydrates that are not usually metabolized. [...] The hydrogen breath test involves having the patient fast for a minimum of 12 hours then having them drink a substrate usually glucose or lactulose, then measuring expired hydrogen and methane concentrations typically over a period of 2–3 hours. [...] It compares well to <b>jejunal</b> aspirates in making the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth. [...] 13C and 14C based tests have also been developed based on the bacterial metabolism of D-xylose. [...] Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids. [...] The glycocholic acid breath test involves the administration of the bile acid 14C glychocholic acid, and the detection of 14CO2, which would be elevated in bacterial overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|Medical {{treatment}} is attempted first in many cases. In some cases, emergency surgery is necessary upon presentation. A six-week trial of medical {{treatment is}} recommended in pediatric cases. The goal of medical treatment for SMA Syndrome is resolution of underlying conditions and weight gain. Medical treatment may involve nasogastric tube placement for duodenal and gastric decompression, mobilization into the prone or left lateral decubitus position, the reversal or {{removal of the}} precipitating factor with proper nutrition and replacement of fluid and electrolytes, either by surgically inserted <b>jejunal</b> feeding tube, nasogastric intubation, or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) administering total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Pro-motility agents such as metoclopramide may also be beneficial. [...] Symptoms may improve after restoration of weight, except when reversed peristalsis persists, or if regained fat refuses to accumulate within the mesenteric angle. Most patients seem to benefit from nutritional support with hyperalimentation irrespective of disease history.|$|E

50|$|A jejunostomy is {{different}} from a <b>jejunal</b> feeding tube which is an alternative to a gastrostomy feeding tube commonly used when gastric enteral feeding is contraindicated or carries significant risks. The advantage over a gastrostomy is its low risk of aspiration due to its distal placement. Disadvantages include small bowel obstruction, ischemia, and requirement for continuous feeding.|$|E
50|$|Although {{it would}} seem to be the better way to go in terms of management, there has been recent {{criticism}} on the need for such testing because of reliability issues. However, it must be stated that there are options such as the glucose breath test and <b>jejunal</b> aspiration the explanations of which are {{beyond the scope of this}} current article.|$|E
50|$|The jejunum {{contains}} {{very few}} Brunner's glands (found in the duodenum) or Peyer's patches (found in the ileum). However, {{there are a}} few <b>jejunal</b> lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. The jejunum has many large circular folds in its submucosa called plicae circulares which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. The plicae circulares are the best developed in the jejunum.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 Abbott {{helped create}} a new {{instrument}} for gastrointestinal surgery called the Abbott-Rawson tube. The tube {{may be used for}} <b>Jejunal</b> feedings and for administrating potassium, antibiotics or vitamins. Although many uses beyond that for which it was first employed have been developed, it remains a much neglected surgical adjunct. For a time after it was described in 1937, the device was widely used for the emptying of the gastrointestinal tract at times of surgical stress. Now it is described in only one textbook on surgery.|$|E
50|$|After surgery, {{patients}} {{may have trouble}} with a regular diet and may have to consume softer foods, avoid liquids at meals, and stay upright for 1-3 hours after eating. Dysphagia is common and patients are encouraged to chew foods very well or grind their food. Patients may complain of substernal pain that resolves by sipping fluids or regurgitating food. Reflux-type symptoms can be severe, including intolerance to acidic foods and large, fatty meals. <b>Jejunal</b> feeding tubes may be placed during surgery to provide a temporary route of nutrition until oral eating resumes.|$|E
50|$|Enteropeptidase {{is a type}} II transmembrane serine {{protease}} (TTSP) localized to the brush border of the duodenal and <b>jejunal</b> mucosa and synthesized as a zymogen, proenteropeptidase, which requires activation by duodenase or trypsin. TTSPs are synthesized as single chain zymogens with N-terminal propeptide sequences of different lengths. These enzymes are activated by cleavage at the carboxyl side of lysine or arginine residues present in a highly conserved activation motif. Once activated, TTSPs are predicted to remain membrane-bound through a conserved disulfide bond linking the pro- and catalytic domains.|$|E

50|$|Vitamin B6 {{is absorbed}} in the jejunum and ileum by passive diffusion. With the {{capacity}} for absorption being so great, animals are able to absorb quantities much greater than necessary for physiological demands. The absorption of pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate involves their dephosphorylation catalyzed by a membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase. Those products and nonphosphorylated forms in the digestive tract are absorbed by diffusion, which is driven by trapping of the vitamin as 5′-phosphates through the action of phosphorylation (by a pyridoxal kinase) in the <b>jejunal</b> mucosa. The trapped pyridoxine and pyridoxamine are oxidized to pyridoxal phosphate in the tissue.|$|E
50|$|Initially the foregut, midgut, and hindgut are in {{extensive}} {{contact with}} the mesenchyme of the posterior abdominal wall. By the fifth week, the connecting tissue bridge has narrowed, and the caudal part of the foregut, the midgut, and {{a major part of}} the hindgut are suspended from the abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery, which extends from the lower end of the esophagus to the cloacal region of the hindgut. In the region of the stomach, it forms the dorsal mesogastrium or greater omentum. In the region of the duodenum, it forms the dorsal mesoduodenum; and in the region of the colon, it forms the dorsal mesocolon. Dorsal mesentery, of the <b>jejunal</b> and ileal loops, forms the mesentery proper.|$|E
50|$|If {{contrast}} {{cannot be}} refluxed into the distal small bowel, ileal atresia remains a diagnostic possibility. <b>Jejunal</b> and ileal atresia {{are caused by}} in utero vascular insults, leading to poor recanalization of distal small bowel segments, {{a condition in which}} surgical resection and reanastamosis are mandatory. Hirschsprung disease is due to an arrest in neural cell ganglia, leading to absent innervation of a segment distal bowel, and appears as a massively dilated segment of distal bowel on contrast enema. Surgical resection is necessary for this condition as well. Imperforate anus also requires surgical management, with the diagnosis made by inability to pass the rectal tube through the anal sphincter. Supportive intravenous hydration, gastric decompression, and ventilatory support may be needed due to poor neonatal nutrition resulting from dysfunctional bowel absorption.|$|E

5000|$|Lactulose is a {{carbohydrate}} {{that is not}} {{absorbed by}} humans. Lactulose is well known to measure oro-cecal transit time. [...] The mean oro-cecal transit time in normal healthy individuals is 70 to 90 minutes. [...] By 90 minutes, at least 50% of individuals would have delivered the lactulose dose to the colon. Approximately 90 to 95% of individuals have colonic bacteria that can metabolize lactulose to hydrogen or methane gas. Thus, any SIBO breath test that collects longer than 60 minutes may be measuring colonic activity. Diagnostic criteria of 20 ppm hydrogen and/or methane changes within 90 or 120 minutes will have higher positive rates of SIBO but this will reflect colonic activity not <b>jejunal</b> metabolism. A one-hour SIBO breath test avoids false positive results by collecting breath up to 60 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Percutaneous {{endoscopic}} gastrostomy (PEG) is an endoscopic {{medical procedure}} {{in which a}} tube (PEG tube) is passed into a patient's stomach through the abdominal wall, most commonly to provide a means of feeding when oral intake is not adequate (for example, because of dysphagia or sedation). This provides enteral nutrition (making use of the natural digestion process of the gastrointestinal tract) despite bypassing the mouth; enteral nutrition is generally preferable to parenteral nutrition (which is only used when the GI tract must be avoided). The PEG procedure is an alternative to open surgical gastrostomy insertion, and {{does not require a}} general anesthetic; mild sedation is typically used. PEG tubes may also be extended into the small intestine by passing a <b>jejunal</b> extension tube (PEG-J tube) through the PEG tube and into the jejunum via the pylorus.|$|E
