But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be {{explained in terms of}} lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way that}} demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

For another, their archness (Gothel sings with a forearm to her forehead) suggests that the filmmakers want to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways — to be sincere and to sneer." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the song a negative review, feeling that it was equally as unmemorable as the other tracks and writing, [...] "It's hard to imagine someone humming ...

500|$|Ryan Bray, {{writer for}} Consequence of Sound, {{concluded}} So was an [...] "all-too-rare record that manages to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways, earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving {{so much as}} an artistic inch". He added that [...] "it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s". Mark Blake of Q described the album as [...] "carbon-dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths". He added that [...] "Gabriel crafted an album of user-friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd." [...] Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote [...] "Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence." [...] Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed [...] "a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole".|$|E

At first they were offended at the suggestion that Harley-Davidson riders were not [...] "nice people." [...] Harley-Davidson had, {{since its founding in}} 1903, scrupulously cultivated an image of staid respectability, and would not begin to tentatively embrace the [...] "outlaw" [...] demographic of their customer base for at least another ten years. In 1964 they denied any association with one-percenter bikers, and so distanced themselves from the implications of Honda's campaign. But they also [...] "tried to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways", and soon joined Vespa and Yamaha in producing ads that were [...] "suspiciously similar" [...] to [...] "You meet the nicest people." [...] Whether they were being offended by or imitating Honda, at the time Harley-Davidson did not share the interpretation that Honda's advertisements, [...] "added to the macho Harley image." ...|$|E
500|$|Mikengreg first {{announced}} {{the game on}} March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that {{a quarter of the}} top grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, [...] "So far, humanity is proving to us that we can't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways." [...] They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. Gasketball had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the first}} few months of {{founding}} JC's Girls, Veitch and Albee launched the organization's first official website, which initially received little traffic. Three months later, it had received 40,000 hits. By December 2005, the organization had received messages through its website from pornographic film actors and men with pornography addiction who said that JC's Girls had changed their lives. A slogan on the main page of the website read, [...] "If you are a CHRISTIAN ... See us in ACTION ...". Without asking for payment, Veitch's friend, pornographic film director James DiGiorgio, took glamour photographs of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter for the JC's Girls website. DiGiorgio was not a Christian, but said that he was helping these organizations in order to support their freedom of speech; he said that the sex industry is [...] "always trying to preach freedom of speech [...] anyone in this industry who has a problem with [...] message is a fucking hypocrite. You can't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways." [...] Within a year of the organization's founding, Veitch, Albee, and Huerter were maintaining Myspace pages that they used to offer support, counsel, and advice. By 2008, the JC's Girls website, which included a blog, was receiving around 15,000 hits per day.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} book released in 1992, midway through his second term, Weizsäcker voiced a harsh {{critique of the}} leading political parties in Germany, claiming that they took {{a larger role in}} public life than was awarded to them by the constitution. He criticized the high number of career politicians (Berufspolitiker), who [...] "in general are neither expert nor dilettante, but generalists with particular knowledge only in political battle". The immediate reactions toward this interview were mixed. Prominent party politicians such as Rainer Barzel and Johannes Rau criticized the remarks, as did Minister of Labour Norbert Blüm, who asked the president to show more respect towards the work done by party members. Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt, on the other hand, conceded that Weizsäcker was [...] "essentially right". While comments from politicians were mainly negative, a public poll conducted by the Wickert-Institut in June 1992 showed that 87.4 per cent of the population agreed with the president. Political commentators generally interpreted the remarks as a hidden attack on the incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl, since Weizsäcker's relationship with his former patron had cooled over the years. In a column for the German newspaper Der Spiegel, chief-editor Rudolf Augstein criticized the president for his attack, writing: [...] "You cannot <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways: on the one hand giving a right and seminal political incentive, {{but on the other hand}} insulting the governing class and its chief".|$|E

Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event: [...] "You can't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways– you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying how terrible it is that people have been shot and killed." ...|$|E

[...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment.

I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I {{think he had a}} little reservation about that. I think he really wanted to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time. [...] "The dispute is around {{the question of whether}} you can <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on me because of what happened to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{moment in}} that race took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal on June 2, 1990, where the {{discussion}} quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord, which had emerged as the major policy issue that divided Martin and Chrétien. At the debate on June 2, 1990, Martin attempted to force Chrétien to abandon the latter's nuanced position on Meech Lake and speak out for or against it, arguing that his position of opposing Meech Lake as it is, but with willing to support with amendments was attempting to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>both</b> ways. When Chrétien refused to endorse Meech as it was, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant [...] "vendu" [...] ("sellout" [...] in French), [...] "you're selling out to the Anglos" [...] and [...] "Judas" [...] at Chrétien. One of Chrétien's aides frenetically asked that Martin [...] "get the fuck {{out there and do}} something" [...] as the Young Liberals continue shouting abuse at Chrétien-to his clear discomfort-only to be told that Quebec youth were [...] "hotheads" [...] whom nobody could control. In private, Chrétien was deeply enraged by the incident, and claimed that the delegates shouting vendu at him were actually Martin supporters from Toronto, charging that their poor French had betrayed that they were not from Quebec. Martin denied involvement in 'coordinating' any response from the floor, or a similar outburst by his supporters at the convention.|$|E
