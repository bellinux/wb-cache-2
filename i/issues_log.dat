50|$|An <b>issue</b> <b>log</b> is a {{documentation}} {{element of}} software project management {{that contains a}} list of ongoing and closed issues of the project. While <b>issue</b> <b>logs</b> {{can be viewed as}} a way to track errors in the project, the role it plays often extends further. <b>Issue</b> <b>logs</b> can be used to order and organize the current issues by type and severity in order to prioritize issues associated with the current milestone or iteration. <b>Issue</b> <b>logs</b> may also contain customer requests and remarks about the various problems that can be found in current code.|$|R

50|$|An <b>issue</b> <b>log</b> {{is usually}} blank at the {{beginning}} of the project, but this is not always true for subsequent releases. In some projects, the <b>issue</b> <b>log</b> is actually used as a guideline for the release schedule; in that case the <b>issue</b> <b>log</b> can be populated with issues that are specifically tagged for completion in the upcoming release. As a result, issue log-guided projects may be easier to manage in terms of completion time and progress estimation. In large projects, issues are usually managed by issue tracking software that can provide different ways and tools to help the project manager and the development team handle thousands of issues for one or several of their projects. Some issue tracking systems also provide a way for the community to contribute new ideas and/or code to the project; this type of collaboration is widely used in open-source programming.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Revalidation for UK doctors is {{expected}} to be introduced from late 2012. For general practitioners (GPs), this entails collecting supporting information to be submitted and assessed in a revalidation portfolio every five years. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the feasibility of GPs working in secure environments to collect supporting information for the Royal College of General Practitioners’ (RCGP) proposed revalidation portfolio. Methods We invited GPs working in secure environments in England to submit items of supporting information collected during the previous 12 months using criteria and standards required for the proposed RCGP revalidation portfolio and complete a GP <b>issues</b> <b>log.</b> Initial focus groups and initial and follow-up semi-structured face-to-face and telephone interviews were held to explore GPs’ views of this process. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and identifying themes respectively. Results Of the 50 GPs who consented to participate in the study, 20 submitted a portfolio. Thirty-eight GPs participated in an initial interview, nine took part in a follow-up interview and 17 completed a GP <b>issues</b> <b>log.</b> GPs reported difficulty in collecting supporting information for valid patient feedback, full-cycle clinical audits and evidence for their extended practice role(s) as sessional practitioners in the high population turnover custodial environment. Peripatetic practitioners experienced more difficulty than their institution based counterparts collating this evidence. Conclusions GPs working in secure environments may experience difficulties in collecting the newer types of supporting information for the proposed RCGP revalidation portfolio primarily due to their employment status within a non-medical environment and characteristics of the detainee population. Increased support from secure environment service commissioners and employers will be a prerequisite for these practitioners to enable them to re-license using the RCGP revalidation proposals. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{document}} {{describes the}} steps that have to follow an inspection. The first necessary step after an inspection is the rework. In this phase the errors found will be corrected. After that comes the follow-up. In this phase the corrections have to be verified. It must also be checked that every issue was addressed and the authors decisions about which issue to correct and which not have been reasonably. The causal analysis comes after that. Now {{the reasons for the}} errors must be found. Maybe some errors could have been avoided with a different development process, or an error happened in an earlier part of the development process and should have been found earlier. Finally the product must meet several exit criteria so the development can advance to the next step. Inspections are an important part in quality management. Inspections include the correction of the errors and possible conclusions and steps to avoid future errors. Here the parts following the finding of errors will be discussed. The input for this phase is an <b>issue</b> <b>log</b> containing all the defects or suggestions the inspection team has found o...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in process mining is fueled by the growing availability of event data. Process mining techniques use event logs to automatically discover process models, check conformance, identify bottlenecks and deviations, suggest improvements, and predict processing times. Lion's share of process mining research {{has been devoted to}} analysis techniques. However, the proper handling of problems and challenges arising in analyzing event logs used as input is critical for the success of any process mining effort. In this paper, we identify four categories of process characteristics issues that may manifest in an event log (e. g. process problems related to event granularity and case heterogeneity) and 27 categories of event <b>log</b> quality <b>issues</b> (e. g., problems related to timestamps in event logs, imprecise activity names, and missing events). The systematic identification and analysis of these issues calls for a consolidated effort from the process mining community. Five real-life event logs are analyzed to illustrate the omnipresence of process and event <b>log</b> <b>issues.</b> We hope that these findings will encourage systematic logging approaches (to prevent event <b>log</b> <b>issues),</b> repair techniques (to alleviate event <b>log</b> <b>issues)</b> and analysis techniques (to deal with the manifestation of process characteristics in event logs) ...|$|R

Healthcare pathways are a relatively new approach to delivering care in intellectual disability services. The authors endeavored to ascertain and explore successes and challenges in the implementation of care pathways in a National Health Service adult intellectual disability service in Leicestershire, UK. Data were obtained {{from a variety of sources}} including observations of multidisciplinary team meetings, <b>issue</b> <b>logs,</b> and feedback from health professionals. Constant comparative analysis identified 10 themes: communication between health professionals; clarity and dissemination of relevant documentation; multidisciplinary working; role of health professionals; role of administrative staff; locality differences; information technology systems; care pathway procedures; attitudes toward care pathways; and impact on clients. It was found that a new implementation of care pathways approach to service delivery in the healthcare setting can be challenging for health professionals. Some of the challenges were generic to service change and could be addressed through careful and organized preplanning of the implementation process. Others, such as organizational culture and attitudes within the organization, were contextual and may be unique to each service and warrant significant advance consideration when attempting implementation.

Given its growing importance, feedback concerning security enhancements is particularly noteworthy. In considering the rapid uptake of Android we {{have examined the}} scale and severity of Android security threats as reported by its stakeholders. Objective: We systematically mine Android <b>issue</b> <b>logs</b> to derive insights into stakeholder perceptions and experiences in relation to certain Android security issues. Method: We employed contextual analysis techniques to study issues raised regarding confidentiality and privacy {{in the last three}} major Android releases, considering covariance of stakeholder comments, and the level of consistency in user preferences and priorities. Results: Confidentiality and privacy concerns varied in severity, and were most prevalent over Jelly Bean releases. Issues raised in regard to confidentiality related mostly to access, user credentials and permission management, while privacy concerns were mainly expressed about phone locking. Community users also expressed divergent preferences for new security features, ranging from more relaxed to very strict. Conclusions: Strategies that support continuous corrective measures for both old and new Android releases would likely maintain stakeholder confidence. An approach that provides users with basic default security settings, but with the power to configure additional security features if desired, would provide the best balance for Android’s wide cohort of stakeholders...|$|R
