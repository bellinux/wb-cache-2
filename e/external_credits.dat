5000|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, Portugal {{experienced}} {{economic growth}} {{due to increased}} raw material exports to the war-ravaged and recovering nations of Europe. Until the 1960s, however, the country remained very poor and largely underdeveloped due to its disadvantaged starting position and lack of effective policies to counter that situation. Salazar managed to discipline the Portuguese public finances, after the chaotic First Portuguese Republic of 1910-1926, but consistent economic growth and development remained scarce {{until well into the}} 1960s, when due to the influence {{of a new generation of}} technocrats with background in economics and technical-industrial know-how, the Portuguese economy started to take off with visible accomplishments in the people's quality of life and standard of living, as well as in terms of secondary and post-secondary education attainment. During the early period of Salazar's rule, a brand new road system was built, new bridges spanned the rivers, and an educational program was able to build a primary school in each Portuguese town (an idea developed and begun during the democratic First Republic). Some liberal economic reforms advocated by elements of the ruling party, which were successfully implemented under similar circumstances in neighboring Spain, were rejected out of fear that industrialization would destabilize the regime and its ideological base and would strengthen the Communists and other left-wing movements. In 1958, when the Portuguese government announced the 1959-64 Six-Year Plan for National Development, a decision had been reached to accelerate the country's rate of economic growth, a decision whose urgency grew with the outbreak of guerrilla warfare in Angola in 1961 and in Portugal's other African territories thereafter. Salazar and his policy advisers recognized that additional military expenditure needs, as well as increased transfers of official investment to the [...] "overseas provinces", could only be met by a sharp rise in the country's productive capacity. Salazar's commitment to preserving Portugal's [...] "multiracial, pluricontinental" [...] state led him reluctantly to seek <b>external</b> <b>credits</b> beginning in 1962, an action from which the Portuguese treasury had abstained for several decades.Beyond military measures, the official Portuguese response to the [...] "winds of change" [...] in the African colonies was to integrate them administratively and economically more closely with the mainland. This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the Overseas Province of Angola and Mozambique, boomed.The liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar's successor, Prime Minister Marcello José das Neves Caetano (1968-1974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged European Community. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most community goods and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 percent of the EC's total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, EFTA membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal's industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in Sines. Notwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers. Before the 1974 Carnation Revolution, the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth. In 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average. On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974. Portuguese economic growth in the period 1960 to 1973 under the Estado Novo regime (and even with the effects of an expensive war effort in African territories against independence guerrilla groups), created an opportunity for real integration with the developed economies of Western Europe. Through emigration, trade, tourism and foreign investment, individuals and firms changed their patterns of production and consumption, bringing about a structural transformation. Simultaneously, the increasing complexity of a growing economy raised new technical and organizational challenges, stimulating the formation of modern professional and management teams.|$|E

Moreover, {{the increase in the}} cash saving rate after covenant violations is more pronounced among firms that are likely to be financially constrained, firms that have greater hedging needs, and firms that depend more on external finance.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{response}} of investment to changes in uncertainty about future profits. We find that in industries dominated by small firms, an increase in uncertainty about future profits depresses investment; in all other industries, increased uncertainty has virtually no effect (or has a positive effect) on investment. The data set from which these findings emerge is a balanced panel, consisting of annual data from 1958 to 1991 for 252 manufacturing industries in the United States. The theoretical work on this topic points to uncertainty about future profit flows {{as one of the}} important actors that determines the ease with which firms can access <b>external</b> <b>credit.</b> The prediction made by the theory is that an increase in uncertainty exacerbates informational asymmetries, and hence makes lenders reduce the flow of credit; this in turn lowers investment in credit-constrained firms.

40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to render}} a {{fundamental}} {{assessment of the}} Basel II internal ratings-based (IRB) approach by taking readings of the Australian banking sector since the implementation of Basel II and comparing them with signals from macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> ratings. The IRB approach to capital adequacy for credit risk, which implements an asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model, {{plays an important role}} in protecting the Australian banking sector against insolvency. Design/methodology/approach: Realisations of the single systematic risk factor, interpreted as describing the prevailing state of the Australian economy, are recovered from the ASRF model and compared with macroeconomic indicators. Similarly, estimates of distance-to-default, reflecting the capacity of the Australian banking sector to absorb credit losses, are recovered from the ASRF model and compared with financial statistics and <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> ratings. With the implementation of Basel II preceding the time when the effect of the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 was most acutely felt, the authors measure the impact of the crisis on the Australian banking sector. Findings: Measurements from the ASRF model find general agreement with signals from macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> ratings. This leads to a favourable assessment of the ASRF model for the purposes of capital allocation, performance attribution and risk monitoring. The empirical analysis used in this paper reveals that the recent crisis imparted a mild stress on the Australian banking sector. Research limitations/implications: Given the range of economic conditions, from mild contraction to moderate expansion, experienced in Australia since the implementation of Basel II, the authors cannot attest to the validity of the model specification of the IRB approach for its intended purpose of solvency assessment. Originality/value: Access to internal bank data collected by the prudential regulator distinguishes this paper from other empirical studies on the IRB approach and financial crisis of 2007 - 2009. The authors are not the first to attempt to measure the effects of the recent crisis, but they believe that they are the first to do so using regulatory data. Silvio Tarca, Marek Rutkowsk...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} enhances {{our understanding}} of the effect of foreign interest rate shocks on small open economies. This dissertation investigates related issues such as the result of structural break unit root tests, the role of net <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> (or debt) and financial integration, and the difference in the response of a small open economy based on its categorization. In chapter 2, this study compares various endogenous structural break unit root tests such as the ZA test, the LM test and the KP test. This study points out important drawbacks of the LM test that have been ignored, and also demonstrates practical problems of the KP test. The empirical result implies that the Asian financial crisis seems to be the most significant structural break in most macroeconomic variables of South Korea for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, it turns out that some macroeconomic variables of South Korea still remain nonstationary even after the consideration of a structural break. In chapter 3, this study shows that the Korean economy after the Asian financial crisis demonstrates that, when a small open economy has sizable net <b>external</b> <b>credit,</b> foreign interest rate hikes may cause real expansion due to a positive wealth effect. In addition, the empirical result implies that enhanced financial integration of a small open economy enables foreign interest rate shocks to explain a higher proportion of fluctuations in financial variables of the small open economy. Considering the co-movement of the foreign interest rate with the domestic interest rate of South Korea after the Asian financial crisis, enhanced financial integration seems to make the interest rate channel more important. In chapter 4, this study suggests a new method to categorize small open countries based on net <b>external</b> <b>credit</b> (or debt) and financial integration level. This study shows how responses of developing countries to foreign interest rate shocks differ depending on their categorization. The empirical result based on the Panel VAR methodology shows that overall responses seem to be consistent with the theoretical model that is based on 3 transmission channels...|$|R
