5|$|Due to {{the wild}} <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the state of Colorado in 2012, Senator Roberts was elected as Chairwoman of the {{bipartisan}} Lower North Fork Fire Commission, which convened during the interim and which proposed four pieces of legislation to address the threat of wildfire risk and damage in Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The American {{carriers}} {{launched an}} airstrike shortly after dawn; Zuikaku {{was struck by}} three bombs and one torpedo that started <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> both hangars, damaged one propeller shaft, {{and gave her a}} 29.5° list to port. Fifteen minutes later, the fires were extinguished and the list was reduced to 6° by counterflooding. She was mostly ignored by the second wave of attacking aircraft, but was a focus of the third wave that hit her with six more torpedoes and four bombs. The bombs started <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the hangars, the torpedoes caused major flooding that increased her list, and the order to abandon ship was issued before Zuikaku sank by the stern. Lost with the ship were 49 officers and 794 crewmen, but 47 officers and 815 crewmen were rescued by her escorting destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The three rebuilt RTG-II {{trainsets}} {{joined the}} RTL trainsets on the Empire Corridor in 1988. Insufficient maintenance {{in the early}} 1990s reduced reliability and led to several <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> 1993–1994. Amtrak retired the RTG-IIs after one caught fire in Pennsylvania Station in New York on September 11, 1994.|$|E
25|$|In recent history, {{the area}} has been struck by the Marble Cone <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> 1977, the Rat Creek Gorda Complex <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> 1985, the Kirk Complex <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> 1999, the Basin Complex <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> 2008, and the Soberanes <b>Fire</b> <b>in</b> 2016.|$|R

2500|$|Because {{it was a}} high-casualty fire {{caused by}} illegal indoor usage of outdoor pyrotechnics, the {{disaster}} bore similarities to the 2001 Canecão Mineiro nightclub <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Belo Horizonte, Brazil; the 2003 Station nightclub <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> West Warwick, Rhode Island, in the United States; the 2004 República Cromañón nightclub <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Buenos Aires, Argentina; [...] the 2008 Wuwang Club <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen, China; the 2009 Santika Club <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand (cause is disputed); the 2009 Lame Horse <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Perm, Russia, and the 2013 Kiss nightclub <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Santa Maria, Brazil.|$|R
5|$|Contamination {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} two major plutonium <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> 1957 and 1969 (plutonium is pyrophoric and shavings can spontaneously combust) and from wind-blown plutonium that leaked from barrels of radioactive waste. Much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational {{life of the}} plant from 1952 to 1992, from smaller accidents and from normal operational releases of plutonium particles {{too small to be}} filtered. Prevailing winds from the plant swept airborne contamination south and east, into populated areas northwest of Denver.|$|E
5|$|Fires were a {{constant}} problem as the palace compound was constructed {{almost entirely of}} wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and {{traveled}} across {{the area for}} at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island. These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three <b>Fires,</b> <b>in</b> A.D. 796. These clans came together through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.|$|E
25|$|It was the fourth-deadliest nightclub <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> US history, killing 100 people, and {{the second}} deadliest in New England, surpassed by the 1942 Cocoanut Grove <b>fire</b> which {{resulted}} <b>in</b> 492 deaths.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was also}} reported in Sinaloa on the Mexican mainland. The remnants of Ignacio produced thunderstorm activity in high terrain areas of central interior California. Over 300 lightning strikes from the remnant moisture {{was recorded in}} a one-hour period. The lightning caused 14 forest <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> Merced County, resulting {{in a loss of}} power to over 3,500 customers in and around the Atwater area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} United States, with its {{significant}} rainfall, wildfires {{are relatively small}} and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever {{been seen in the}} east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies.|$|E
5|$|Later <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> 1706 and 1864 {{destroyed}} most {{medieval and}} Georgian architecture, {{and a large}} proportion of the town's listed buildings date from the Victorian period onwards. However, many of the pasture fields on the outskirts of the town have evidence of ridge and furrow farming practices, although these are under threat by current building proposals.|$|E
50|$|The Laguna Fire was surpassed as {{the third}} largest <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> California history by the 280,278 acre (1,134 km²) Cedar <b>Fire</b> <b>in</b> October 2003. It was surpassed as the fourth largest by the 197,990 acre (801 km²) Witch Creek <b>Fire</b> <b>in</b> October 2007.|$|R
50|$|The word Agni {{is used in}} many contexts, {{ranging from}} the <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> stomach, the cooking <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> a home, the {{sacrificial}} <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> an altar, the fire of cremation, the fire of rebirth, the <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> the energetic saps concealed within plants, the atmospheric <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> lightning and the celestial <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> the sun. In the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas, such as in section 5.2.3 of Shatapatha Brahmana, Agni represents all the gods, all concepts of spiritual energy that permeates everything in the universe. In the Upanishads and post-Vedic literature, Agni additionally became a metaphor for immortal principle in man, and any energy or knowledge that consumes and dispels a state of darkness, transforms and procreates an enlightened state of existence.|$|R
25|$|The Beverly Hills Supper Club <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Southgate, Kentucky, is {{the third}} deadliest nightclub <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> U.S. history. It {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} May 28, 1977, during the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A total of 165 people died and more than 200 were injured {{as a result of the}} blaze. It was the deadliest <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> the United States since 1944, when 168 people were killed in the Hartford circus <b>fire</b> <b>in</b> Hartford, Connecticut.|$|R
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the town following a fire in 1731. After this the town's importance grew as it became a centre for clothmaking across Somerset and Devon, its importance as trade centre enhanced by <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> Taunton and Tiverton. By the 1831 census, 258 people were recorded as cloth workers in Wellington.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> high-oxygen test environments had {{occurred}} before the Apollo fire. In 1962, USAF Colonel B. Dean Smith was conducting {{a test of}} the Gemini space suit with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas when a fire broke out, destroying the chamber. Smith and his partner narrowly escaped.|$|E
5|$|The {{old town}} of Roskilde is centred around the main square, Stændertorvet, {{just south of}} the cathedral. The {{original}} street plan is preserved in nearby Skomagergade, Algade and Hestetorvet although most of the buildings were rebuilt after serious <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the 18th century. The area is flanked to the north by two large parks, Byparken and Folkeparken, which stretch down to Roskilde Fjord.|$|E

5|$|The parish of Chatteris is large, {{covering}} 6,099 hectares, and {{for much}} of its history was a raised island in the low-lying wetland of the Fens. Mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, the town has evidence of settlement from the Neolithic period. After several <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the majority of the}} town's housing dates from the late Victorian period onwards, with the tower of the parish church the only medieval building remaining.|$|E
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry moving along the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties.|$|E

5|$|By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was {{continuing}} its rapid growth {{and began to}} enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The first of several strange <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the University's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college's first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the university's main building. In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom {{as well as several}} dormitory buildings in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house <b>fires</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
