5000|$|Vitiligo is {{a disease}} which causes loss of {{pigmentation}} in portions of skin. When <b>khellin</b> is applied topically in combination with UVA light, {{it is able to}} stimulate melanocytes (cells that produce melanin) in hair follicles for successful treatment of vitiligo.

50|$|Starting with khella, a {{traditional}} remedy for asthma, Altounyan discovered in 1965 that khella's active ingredient was <b>khellin.</b> He eventually produced a safer chemical based on <b>khellin,</b> sodium cromoglycate.

Altounyan was investigating certain plants and herbs which have bronchodilating properties. One such plant was khella (Ammi visnaga) which had been used as a muscle relaxant since ancient times in Egypt.

40|$|The {{problematic}} {{and numerous}} {{side effects of}} PUVA (psoralen and UVA) and other treatments currently in use for vitiligo, have justified the search for an alternative treatment. In this study, the use of <b>khellin,</b> a naturally occurring furochromone, which is similar in structure to psoralens, is explored as an alternative treatment for vitiligo. When <b>khellin</b> is combined with UVA (KUVA), it is reported to repigment vitiligo skin as effectively as PUVA photochemotherapy, but without the adverse effects reported with PUVA. The exact mechanism for khellin-induced repigmentation is still to be determined and no cell biological studies have yet been done to elucidate its mechanism of action. The specific aim of this project was {{to set up an}} in vitro tissue culture system to determine the direct effects of <b>khellin,</b> UVA and KUVA on melanocyte proliferation and pigmentation. Studies were carried out on cultures of a human melanoma cell line (Mel- 1), normal human melanocytes and 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts. Cell proliferation assays revealed that the proliferation of melanoma cells and melanocytes were increased after exposure to <b>khellin</b> for four days at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 0. 5 mM. A peak of proliferation was obtained at 0. 01 mM <b>khellin,</b> which stimulated proliferation of melanoma cells and melanocytes by 2. 3 5 -fold and 2. 1 - fold, respectively. In contrast, <b>khellin</b> decreased proliferation of fibroblasts over the entire concentration range tested. At concentrations of 0. 5 mM and above, <b>khellin</b> was cytotoxic to both melanocytic cells and fibroblasts. Cytotoxic assays revealed that 1 mM <b>khellin</b> was equally cytotoxic to both melanoma cells and fibroblasts. In addition, these assays revealed that the proliferative response observed with 0. 01 mM and 0. 1 mM <b>khellin,</b> did not mask an underlying cytotoxic effect. Exposure to single doses of UVA between 150 - 280 mJ/cm², increased proliferation of melanoma cells with maximal proliferation at 250 mJ/cm², while the proliferation of normal melanocytes and fibroblasts were unaffected by this UVA dose. More significantly than <b>khellin</b> or UVA alone, the treatment with the combination of <b>khellin</b> and UVA (KUVA) stimulated proliferation of the melanocytic cells. The combination of 0. 01 mM <b>khellin</b> plus a single dose of UVA at 250 mJ/cm² was the most effective treatment. KUVA combination treatments were found to be more cytotoxic to the fibroblasts than <b>khellin</b> or UVA alone. To test the effect of <b>khellin,</b> UVA and KUVA on melanogenesis, standard radiometric assays were carried out. The combination of <b>khellin</b> and UVA enhanced melanogenesis of the melanocytic cells more significantly than <b>khellin</b> alone or UVA alone. The dose of 0. 01 mM <b>khellin</b> plus 250 mJ/cm² UVA (maximal proliferative dose) increased melanogenesis of the melanocytes by 290 % above the untreated control melanocytes. To determine whether <b>khellin</b> and KUVA act by increasing levels of melanogenic proteins, western blot analyses were carried out. The results revealed that there were no differences in the amounts of TRP- 2 and tyrosinase in the melanocytic cells treated with <b>khellin</b> alone. In contrast, those treated with KUVA (or UVA alone) had increased levels of the glycosylated form of the enzymes and also possibly had increased levels of the de nova form of the enzymes. These results suggest that UVA might be enhancing glycosylation of melanogenic enzymes and provides a novel insight into the possible mechanism for UVA-induced melanogenesis. The results also revealed that 3 T 3 fibroblasts expressed the non-glycosylated form of TRP- 2, as described by others. In conclusion, this study suggests a model in which <b>khellin</b> acts directly on melanocytic cells by acting as a mitogen and a melanogen at non-toxic concentrations. <b>Khellin</b> possibly increases melanogenesis by acting post-translationally or antagonizing or removing an inhibitor of the melanogenic pathway. The melanocyte-specific effect of <b>khellin</b> and even more so KUVA, seems to suggest that <b>khellin</b> acts along the signal transduction pathways which increases both proliferation and melanogenesis in melanocytes, possibly via endothelin- 1 pathways...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Khellin</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring furochromone which, {{when combined with}} artificial ultraviolet (UV) A or solar irradiation (KUVA), is reported to repigment vitiligo skin as effectively as PUVA photochemotherapy. The exact mechanism of KUVA-induced repigmentation is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to test the effect of <b>khellin</b> and KUVA on proliferation and melanogenesis of normal human melanocytes and Mel- 1 melanoma cells in vitro. METHODS: Cultured normal human melanocytes, Mel- 1 melanoma cells and fibroblasts were treated with <b>khellin,</b> UVA and KUVA and the effect on proliferation determined by cell counting. The effect on melanogenesis was determined by a radiometric melanin formation assay. Changes in gene expression and protein synthesis were determined by Northern blot, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. RESULTS: <b>Khellin</b> stimulated proliferation of Mel- 1 melanoma cells and melanocytes at concentrations between 1 nmol L- 1 and 0. 5 mmol L- 1 with a peak effect at 0. 01 mmol L- 1 <b>khellin.</b> In contrast, <b>khellin</b> inhibited proliferation of fibroblasts over the entire concentration range tested. At concentrations above 0. 5 mmol L- 1, <b>khellin</b> was cytotoxic to both melanocytic cells and fibroblasts. Exposure of khellin-treated cells to single doses of UVA between 150 and 280 mJ cm- 2 resulted in an enhanced proliferative effect. <b>Khellin</b> and KUVA also stimulated the melanogenic enzyme activity of pigmented cells, with the most effective treatment being 0. 01 mmol L- 1 <b>khellin</b> with 250 mJ cm- 2 UVA. Western blot, Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis revealed that these increases in melanogenic enzyme activity were not due to increases in gene expression or protein synthesis. UVA treatment resulted in an increase in enzyme glycosylation and this correlated with the increase in melanogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <b>khellin</b> activated by UVA stimulates melanocyte proliferation and melanogenesis. Our results point to the possibility that current treatment regimens might be improved if reduced <b>khellin</b> doses are applied and suggest that improved delivery vehicles be tested...|$|E

Materials and Methods: RP-HPLC analysis was performed on a C 18 column with methanol: Water (75 : 25, v/v) as a mobile phase. The HPTLC method involved densitometric evaluation of <b>khellin</b> after resolving it on silica gel plate using ethyl acetate: Toluene: Formic acid (5. 5 : 4. 0 : 0. 5, v/v/v) as a mobile phase. Results: The developed HPLC and HPTLC methods were validated for precision (interday, intraday and intersystem), robustness and accuracy, limit of detection and limit of quantification. The relationship between the concentration of standard solutions and the peak response was linear in both HPLC and HPTLC methods with the concentration range of 10 – 80 μg/mL in HPLC and 25 – 1, 000 ng/spot in HPTLC for <b>khellin.</b> The % relative standard deviation values for method precision was found to be 0. 63 – 1. 97 %, 0. 62 – 2. 05 % in HPLC and HPTLC for <b>khellin</b> respectively.

40|$|The high {{incidence}} of unpleasant side effects following the use of crude preparations of <b>khellin</b> {{in the treatment of}} angina pectoris has limited its clinical use. It was felt that if this vasodilator drug were prepared free of resins, chromones and other plant impurities, it might then be used more extensively in the treatment of coronary insufficiency. Currently, a crystalline preparation of high purity has become available. A series of patients with angina pectoris were studied using this preparation. A Starr ballistocardiograph was interjected into our study in an attempt to ob-tain objective evidence of any effect this drug might have on the mechanical action of the heart. F ROM ANCIENT times the people of Arabia and the Eastern Mediterranean countries have used extracts, tinctures and other preparations made from the seeds of Ammi visnaga (Arabic khella) for the treat-ment of renal colic and ureteral spasms due to renal calculi. Several crystalline substances were isolated early from the seeds of this plant. The more important of these were <b>khellin</b> (2 -methyl- 5, 8 - dimethoxyfuranochromone), vis-nagin (2 - methyl- 5 - methoxyfuranochro-mone), and khellol-glycoside, which is an oxy-glycoside of visnagin. <b>Khellin,</b> also known as visammin, was first prepared in an impure form by Mustapha in 1879. 1 In 1931 Samaan 2 reported on the pharmacologic action of this drug.

40|$|<b>Khellin</b> and visnagin are two furanochromones {{that can}} be {{frequently}} found in ethnomedical formulations in Asia and the Middle East. Both compounds possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, therefore modern medicine uses these compounds or structurally related derivatives for treatment of vitiligo, bronchial asthma and renal colics. Despite their frequent usage, the potential toxic properties of visnagin and <b>khellin</b> are not well characterized up-to-now. Many natural compounds modulate the expression and activity of cytochrome P 450 1 A 1 (CYP 1 A 1), which is well-known to bioactivate pro-carcinogens. The expression of this enzyme {{is controlled by the}} aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor and regulator of drug metabolism. Here, we investigated the influence of both furanochromones on AHR signaling in human HepG 2 hepatocarcinoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. Both compounds transactivated xenobiotic response element (XRE) -driven reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner and induced CYP 1 A 1 transcription in HepG 2 cells and primary hepatocytes. The latter was abolished in presence of a specific AHR antagonist. CYP 1 A enzyme activity assays done in HepG 2 cells and primary hepatocytes revealed an inhibition of enzyme activity by both furanochromones, which may become relevant regarding the metabolism of xenobiotics and co-administered therapeutic drugs. The observed induction of several other members of the AHR gene battery, whose gene products are involved in regulation of cell growth, differentiation and migration, indicates that a further toxicological characterization of visnagin and khelllin is urgently required in order to minimize potential drug-drug interactions and other toxic side-effects that may occur during therapeutic usage of these furanochromones...|$|E
40|$|Vitiligo is {{a common}} depigmenting skin {{disorder}} with devastating psychological implications. Although evidence strongly suggests that melanocytes die in various forms of vitiligo, it is also evident, at least in certain cases, that melanocytes/melanoblasts survive in an undifferentiated stem cell form and it is from these that re-pigmentation is assumed to occur. Treatment of this distressing condition remains 'hit-or-miss' and patients' responses are unpredictable. This study aims to integrate prognostic variables such as the molecular profile of vitiliginous lesions and the patient's epidemiological profile, to develop a reliable and sensitive prognostic test enabling clinicians to plan an individualized, rational therapeutic approach for their vitiligo patients. The analysis of tyrosinase and TRP- 2 mRNA expression in vitiliginous skin using quantitative RT-qPCR revealed the presence of melanoblasts/melanocytes in 60 % of patients (n= 21). When this survival was calculated {{as a percentage of}} the mRNA expression in the pigmented positive control specimen, it was found to range from 4 % to 46 % survival. Patients were subsequently treated with either potent topical corticosteroid ointment or 5 % <b>khellin</b> cream in combination with daily sunlight exposure for 3 months and their clinical response was then assessed and correlated to the lesional melanocyte status. A good response (> 50 % repigmentation) was found in 3 / 5 patients demonstrating both tyrosinase and TRP- 2 gene expression, in only 1 / 4 patients demonstrating TRP- 2 gene expression alone and in 0 / 3 patients demonstrating only tyrosinase gene expression. The presence of both tyrosinase and TRP- 2 mRNA expression is therefore a significant positive prognostic indicator.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is {{increasingly}} being {{recognized as an}} attractive, alternative treatment modality for superficial cancer, being an emerging method for local destruction of tissue by generating toxic oxygen species using light absorbed by an administered or an endogenously generated photosensitizer (porphyrins, phthalocyanines, <b>khellin,</b> hypericin, riboflavin). A considerable number of PDT research {{over the past ten}} years has been devoted to the development of new sensitizers. The development of new photosensitizers for localization and treatment of tumors is a research area or current interest. The data show that, when properly used, PDT is an effective alternative treatment option in oncology. This paper will present a case study of actinic keratosis treated with aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and 5, 10, 15, 20 - tetra (4 -sulfophenyl) porphyrin (TSPP) in a photodynamic therapy approach. The clinical data proved the efficacy and safety of the method and the new drug. From skin biopsies we have obtained lower absolute number of keratinocytes compared to control skin. The in vitro tests showed cells having lower viability, lower proliferation capacity, and high apoptosis/necrosis percentages; therefore after applying PDT we have obtained an active destruction of the cell...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} biologically active chromones occur in plants (eg. <b>Khellin)</b> and {{research}} in this field has eventually led to the discovery of chromoglycic acid, which is widely used as a sodium salt in asthma therapy. Since biological activity may be related to acidity, a range of chromone- 2 -carboxylic acids have been prepared via Claisen acylation of substituted 0 -hydroxyacetophenones and their acid dissociation constants determined potentiometrically to explore substituent effects. From this study it has been found that introduction of certain groups does have a marked effect on acidity. A variety of acrylamide derivatives have been prepared via the dimethylamine-mediated ring opening of chromone- 2 -carboxamides which, in turn, were prepared from the chromone- 2 -carboxylic acids via the corresponding acid chlorides. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy was employed to examine the effect of substituents on the rotational barriers and it has been found that for the acrylamides examined, ring substituents have little effect on the rotational barriers. A combination of low resolution, high resolution and meta-stable peak analysis has been used to study mass fragmentation patterns for a series of acrylamide derivatives. The proposed fragmentation pathways for selected peaks {{have been found to be}} common to all the spectra examined when differences in the atomic masses of substituents were taken into account. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{doctoral thesis}} was to use the sludge worm Tubifex tubifex {{as a model for}} biological activity testing. In the presented study, the Tubifex worm was used to evaluate photosensibilisation, i. e. sensibilisation of an organism towards UVA radiation (365 nm; radiant flux density of 350 μW/cm 2) after contact with certain substances. The tested substances included proven photosensibilizing agents - rose bengal, <b>khellin</b> and xanthotoxin; isolated natural substances - thiophene polyacetylene umbelliferon, scopoline, and scopoletine; synthetic compounds - salicylanilides and thiosalicylanilides; and penicillin drugs Augmentin and Ospamox and their active substance standard amoxicillin. The final evaluation of photosensibilizing properties of the substances was carried out according to the Commission Directive 2000 / 33 /EC PHOTOTOXICITY - IN VITRO 3 T 3 NRU PHOTOTOXICITY TEST. The test was performed in 24 -well plates where one set of plates with the photosensibilizing agent was irradiated and the second set was placed in an incubator (20 ± 2 řC) as a dark control without any light presence for the whole period of the experiment. The plates were evaluated immediately after the given period of irradiation (15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 minutes). Mortality and percentual number of damaged individuals were [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We report {{quantitative}} data on epidermal melanogenesis by established and new furocoumarins, The ears and dorsal skin of pigmented hairless mice were treated for 12 d with compounds in ethanol, at equi-optical concentrations, and exposed to subphototoxic doses of ultraviolet A. Increased pigmentation was observed with 6, 4, 4 '-trimethylangelicin > psoralen > 8 -methoxypsoralen > 5 -methoxypsoralen > 4, 4 ', 5 ' -trimethylazapsoralen = bergamot oil. Assessment, of melanocyte numbers and morphology in epidermal sheet dihydroxyphenylalanine preparations showed that 6, 4, 4 '-trimethylangelicin {{was the best}} compound with 536 ear melanocytes/mm 2 ± 15 SEM compared with 46 ± 4 in controls. Psoralen reduced 297 /mm 2 ± 33, compared with its methoxy derivatives with ranges between 200 and 240 / mm 2. 6. 4, 4 '-trimethylangelicin had a striking effect on dorsal skin with 462 ± 18 melanocytes/mm 2 compared to less than 80 /mm 2 in all other ultraviolet A treatment groups. <b>Khellin,</b> 5 -GOP and ultraviolet A only and all non-ultraviolet A controls had no effect. Melanogenesis was associated with increased dendricity, melanocyte size, especially with 5 -methoxypsoralen, and giant melanocytes were noted with some treatments. The potency of 6, 4, 4 '-trimethylangelicin, which does not form DNA interstrand crosslinks, {{may be related to}} its high DNA binding constant. Our data may be useful in the selection of compounds to treat vitiligo...|$|E
40|$|Photodermatology {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} research field in dermatology. During the last twenty years a good deal of progress has been made both in phototherapy and in photodiagnosis, as well as in the development of new irradiative sources. Ultraviolet irradiation, alone or in combination with psoralens, influences the immune system not only in the irradiated areas but also in the unirradiated ones. The UV exposure: 1) diminishes the skin ability to elicit a contact hypersensitivity reaction; 2) reduces the number of Langerhans cells; 3) alters the rejection of transplanted UV-radiation-induced tumors in mice; 4) induces changes in lymphocyte recirculation. Arachidonate transformation products play a mayor role as mediators of most type of delayed UV erythema: after UVB irradiation (18 - 48 hr) skin levels of prostaglandin E 2, F 2 α, D 2, 6 ketoPGF 1 α and 12 HETE are increased. <b>Khellin,</b> a molecule with a low phototoxic activity, is now currently used for vitiligo treatment, nevertheless other photosensitizing agents, not binding the DNA, could have some potential in photochemiotherapy of psoriasis. Several lasers are successfully employed in dermatology for the treatment of portwine stains (argon, dye and copper lasers) or tatoos (Nd-Yag and Q-switched ruby lasers). Laser technology will provide multipurpose, cheaper, smaller and user-friendly lasers such as tunable solid-state and semiconductor lasers that will certainly be useful in dermatology...|$|E
