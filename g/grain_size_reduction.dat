Microstructure and microhardness of welded specimens were evaluated across weld centerline. Torque base index, peak temperature, cooling rate, strain, strain rate, volumetric material flow rate, and width of extruded zone at weld nugget were calculated. Peak temperature at weld nugget was similar to 1300 - 1360 K. At this temperature, ferrite transformed to austenite during welding. Austenite was decomposed in to ferrite and bainite at cooling rate of similar to 4 - 7. 5 K/s. The presence of bainite was endorsed by increment in microhardness with respect to base material. Ferrite <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> at weld nugget was finer in comparison to as-received alloy. With the increment in tool rotational rate strain, strain rate, total heat input, and peak temperature at weld nugget were increased. High temperature at weld nugget promoted increment in ferrite <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>reduction</b> in area fraction of bainite. Heat-affected zone also experienced phase transformation and exhibited enhancement in ferrite <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> in comparison to base alloy at all welding parameters with marginal drop in microhardness.

40|$|International audienceFor {{the past}} decades, <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> leading to {{diffusion}} creep in olivine {{is believed to}} be a very important process for strain localisation in the lithospheric mantle. However, the mechanisms of <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> in this regime are still poorly understood (e. g., Platt, 2015).

40|$|International audienceIt is now {{admitted}} that the high strength of the subcontinental uppermost mantle controls the first order strength of the lithosphere. An incipient narrow continental rift therefore requires an important weakening in the subcontinental mantle to promote lithosphere-scale strain localisation and subsequent continental break-up. Based on the classical rheological layering of the continental lithosphere, the origin of a lithospheric mantle shear/fault zone {{has been attributed to}} the existence of a brittle uppermost mantle. However, the lack of mantle earthquakes and the absence of field occurrences in the mantle fault zone led {{to the idea of a}} ductile-related weakening mechanism, instead of brittle-related, for the incipient mantle strain localisation. In order to provide evidence for this mechanism, we investigated the microstructures and lattice preferred orientations of mantle rocks in a kilometre-scale ductile strain gradient in the Ronda Peridotites (Betics cordillera, Spain). Two main features were shown: 1) <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> by dynamic recrystallisation is found to be the only relevant weakening mechanism responsible for strain localisation and 2), with increasing strain, <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> is coeval with both the scattering of orthopyroxene neoblasts and the decrease of the olivine fabric strength (LPO). These features allow us to propose that grain boundary sliding (GBS) partly accommodates dynamic recrystallisation and subsequent <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction.</b> A new GBS-related experimental deformation mechanism, called dry-GBS creep, has been shown to accommodate <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> during dynamic recrystallisation and to induce significant weakening at low temperatures (T 800 °C), whereas dislocation creep and dry-GBS creep, are the accommodating mechanisms at low temperatures (< 800 °C). Consequently, weakening is very limited if the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> occurs at temperatures higher than 800 °C, whereas a large weakening is expected in lower temperatures. This large weakening related to GBS creep would occur at depths lower than 60 km and therefore provides an explanation for ductile strain localisation in the uppermost continental mantle, thus providing an alternative to the brittle mantle...|$|E
30|$|The {{mylonite}} in the Hundskjeften peridotite is a {{great example}} of shear localization in the lower crust or mantle condition. In the previous studies, <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> is {{recognized as one of the}} most important mechanisms of shear localization in ductile regime (White et al. 1980; Precigout et al. 2007; Raimbourg et al. 2008; Platt and Behr 2011). In case of the Hundskjeften peridotite, there are four possible mechanisms of <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction.</b> One possible explanation is that mylonite forms by <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> through enhanced dynamic recrystallization of olivine in the presence of water. Previous experimental study (Jung and Karato 2001 b) showed that water enhances dynamic recrystallization of olivine. Numerous hydrous minerals were found inside mylonite (Figure  3 C,D). We also observed B- and E-type LPO of olivine in the mylonite (Figure  5) which can be formed under water-rich conditions (Jung and Karato 2001 a; Katayama et al. 2004). These data suggest that enhanced dynamic recrystallization of olivine in the presence of water contributed to the shear localization for the Hundskjeften peridotite. The shear localization enhanced by the water have been reported from several other localities like Fizh massif (Oman) or Josephine Peridotite (SW Oregon, USA) (Michibayashi and Oohara 2013; Skemer et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|The sensing {{mechanism}} of resistive metal oxide gas sensors is quite complicated. Many factors determine the sensitivity {{and the response}} of these devices.

The developed model, describing spherical grains, is applied to WO 3 for NO 2 detection, and is compared with different models already in the literature.

40|$|We study pinch-and-swell {{structures}} {{in order to}} uncover the onset of strain localization and the change of deformation mechanisms in layered ductile rocks. To this end, boudinaged monomineralic veins embedded in an ultramylonitic matrix are analyzed quantitatively. The swells are built up by relatively undeformed original calcite grains, showing twinning and minor subgrain rotation recrystallization (SGR). Combined with progressive formation of high-angle misorientations between grains, indicative of SGR, severe <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> defines {{the transition to the}} pinches. Accordingly, dynamically recrystallized grains have a strong crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO). Toward the necks, further <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction,</b> increasingly random misorientations, nucleation of new grains, and a loss of the CPO occur. We postulate that this microstructure marks the transition from dislocation to diffusion creep induced by strain localization. We confirm that the development of boudins is insensitive to original grain sizes and single-crystal orientations. In order to test these microstructural interpretations, a self-consistent numerical grain size evolution is implemented, based on thermo-mechanical principles, end-member flow laws and microphysical processes. Applying constant velocity and isothermal boundary conditions to a 3 -layer finite element pure shear box, pinch-and-swell structures emerge out of the homogeneous layer through grain size softening at a critical state. Viscosity weakening due to elevated strain rates and dissipated heat from <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> <b>reduction</b> promotes strain rate weakening until a critical grain size is reached. At this point, a switch from dislocation to diffusion creep occurs. This state locks in at local steady states and is microstructurally expressed in pinches and swells, respectively.

We conclude from the similarity between natural observations and numerical results that critical deformation conditions of ductile creep can be derived for the surrounding highly-strained host rock matrix...|$|E

Annealing to 700  °C resulted in the partial disintegration of the nanosheet structure, observed both in SEM and by the loss of stoichiometry observed with AES.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic mineral assemblages in lake sediments are usulally {{interpreted}} as reflecting changing catchment erosion. Magnetic and chemical assemblages {{in a small}} eutrophic lake (Lough Augher, Northern Ireland) suggest diagenetic dissolution of fine-grained magnetite, however, probably {{as a result of}} changing redox conditions associated with eutrophication. Water-column results show internal cycling of Mn and Fe from the sediments into the armxic hypolimnion. Calculations suggest that late-summer hypolimnetic Fe concentrations are controlled by formation of aulhigenic viv-ianite; sedimentary pore-water concentrations of total soluble Fe and P suggest a similar process in the sediments. The loss of Mn from the lake by diffusion from the sediment and washout at overturn is indicated by Mn budget calculations and by it marked decrease in its sedimentary concentration, reflecting onset of eutrophication as indicated by diatom biostratigraph y. The changes in the sediment Mn profile are coincident with, and in some cases identical to, changes in several rnagnctic parameters. The changes in magnetic stratigraphy suggest a coarsening of the magnetic <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and <b>reduction</b> in the total concentration; agreement with chemical profiles indicative of changing rcdox suggest that this coarsening results from dissolution of fine-grained magnetite...|$|R
