This is partially due to a higher number of pensioners and single-parent families who are usually on fixed incomes and thus poorer. In 2001, the median income for those older than 15 was $15,600 (compared to $23,500 in 2006). In 2013 the median personal income was $27,200, slightly lower than the Auckland median at $29,600 due to a larger number of pensioners over 65 in the <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid.</b> The median household income was relatively low, at $51,100 per annum, compared to $76,500 in Auckland as a whole.|$|E

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of basic demographic components (population structure, mortality and modern immigration) in Greece, in the framework of the Demographic Transition Theory; particularly, for {{the second half of the}} 20 th century. The dissertation seeks to provide answers to two fundamental questions: a) Does demographic behaviours converge at the administrative level of Prefecture, as expected according to the Demographic Transition Theory?, and b) Was, the massive inflow of foreigners at the end of century, capable to lead to demographic inversions by altering the population age pyramid structure to a more juvenile one? The data used for the analysis, were provided by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG). Classic demographic methods were applied in order to derive all the necessary conclusions. However, they had not been applied again to Greek data, and/or to data of a lower administrative level. The results of the analysis lead to a positive answer for the first posed question, concerning the national level, as well as the Prefectures. Both spatial levels are characterised by common attitude from a balance of high mortality and fertility towards a new, low rate of birth and large life expectation. At the lower spatial level, this realisation is reflected to the sum of <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramids,</b> which changed their shape from a “juvenile” form, at the beginning of the 20 th century into aging population in the dawn the 21 st century; followed by significant increase of survival rates at the mortality tables. As far as, the second question is concerned, the derived results revealed that foreigners influenced the sex and age distribution of the total country population, although they did not present the critical size or an extreme demographic behaviour, in order to be able to alter the inclination of Greek population towards ageing. Finally, this dissertation is able to pose and inspire new inquiring questions, in terms of future research, in various conceptual levels as it constitutes an innovative effort into a relatively new scientific field for our country. ...|$|R
40|$|Numbers never lie. However {{the fashion}} of {{macroeconomic}} valuation {{has a long history}} of interpreting partially the truth that numbers are intended to resonate. During the last four years, statistical numbers regarding the Greek economy have been interpreted by multiple economists, international investors, and public policy decision makers. Amongst many others, the most popular numbers regurgitated by mass media are the 60 % youth unemployment, the 160 % debt-to-GDP ratio, the 10 % deficit, and the excessive credit default swaps (CDS) spreads widening. These numbers on the country’s current economic state, along with the inverting of the <b>demographic</b> age distribution <b>pyramid,</b> has led traditional methods of macroeconomic growth research to assure investors that the Greek economy has little or negligible growth potential. As a result, the public opinion has come to a consensus: the current Greek youth is a lost generation...|$|R

40|$|The Innovations Team: The U. S. {{will soon}} be {{a country with a}} “Majority-Minority” population. What {{demographic}} shifts are driving this change? Thomas LaVeist: There is a combination of things behind the demographic shift. There is a rapidly declining white birth rate and higher minority birth rates. In general, minorities have first births at a younger age than whites, meaning they utilize a longer portion of their reproductive years. And, of course, there is immigration—mainly from Latin America and Asia. Looking at the <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid</b> of the United States, a larger percentage of whites are in their nonreproductive years...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that, by 2007, the <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid</b> {{will be turned}} upside down in the European Union. Furthermore, people aged 65 + will make up around 28 % {{of the population in}} the EU in 2050. These developments raise a number of very serious questions for Europeans: - How do we reduce health care costs while maintaining a high quality of life? - How do we keep older Europeans socially networked and integrated? - How do we avoid losing the hidden investment of economic and human capital when active Europeans retire? Two relatively new concepts - Converging Applications; and Active Ageing - could help in finding answers to the above mentioned questions. These two important concepts are seldom examined together. While the policy relevance and challenges of Active Ageing are widely discussed, there appears to be little literature on how technology can contribute to this field, and even less on the contribution of emerging technologies. This apparent information gap motivated the authors to investigate how converging applications, in particular ICT and cognitive sciences, could help ageing Europeans to remain active. JRC.

30|$|Advances in {{medicine}} and living conditions are significantly increasing average life expectancy, {{while at the same}} time the natality rate in developed countries is falling. This creates a distorted <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid</b> where there are more elderly people over 65 than there are children under 15 [1]. It has been estimated by Eurostat that the working population (15 – 64 years) will decrease to 56 % of total population by the year 2050 [2]. This could lead to a number of problems for society, such as insufficient numbers of qualified personnel to care for the elderly, rising costs for individuals, families, and the public purse, and consequently a potential decrease in the perceived quality of life for individuals. At the same time, the WHO is promoting the concept of “active aging”, a process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security, in order to enhance the quality of life as people age [3]. We face two main challenges—first, to enable the elderly to live a high-quality independent life at home for as long as possible and, second, to facilitate the care provided in the nursing homes.|$|E
40|$|Europe’s <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid</b> is {{inverting}} at an ever-growing pace, bringing along dras-tic {{consequences to}} social security. The active workforce {{can no longer}} provide for the senior citizens. To revert this situation, which puts this increasing age group at risk, the social system must undergo a paradigm shift in order {{to cut costs and}} at the same time guarantee high standards of elder healthcare. Telemedicine is one of the most promising areas in this context. This project’s core is strongly connected to telemedicine, as it is integrated in the context of eCAALYX, a three-year project — April 2009 to April 2012 — funded by the European Commission under the Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme. One of the eCAALYX components is a Personal Health Channel, a software application that enables users to manage their health and to streamline communication with the health services. The main goal of this project is to perform a comparative study of the available tech-nological tools to develop and deploy the Personal Health Channel using COTS solutions. This allows for a great reduction in efforts and costs of the project. An in-depth analy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this paper the {{presence}} of migrants ’ children in the greek educational system is in the question. In the second part the focus will be on the role of gender in migrant’s students academic outcomes. The last decades after 1990, the school population in Greece changes considerably due to the immigration flows. The data that we have in our disposal are collected by two governmental institutions. IPODE, the Institute for the Greek Diaspora Education and Intercultural Studies and the national survey about “Migrant students in greek education ” (2004). And IMEPO, the Hellenic Migration Policy Institute and the research “Migrant students of secondary education in the region of Attica ” (2005). Migrant students rate According to the data, migrant students comprise 6, 9 % of the total student population in nursery school, 8, 6 % in Primary school, while in Gymnasium they represent 6, 9 %. In Lyceum and in the Technological Educational Institutes the percentage of migrant students is 3, 2 %. The majority of these students- 55 %- are concentrated in the Primary school. As we can observe, there are significant discrepancies in the proportion of migrant students in the different levels of education. However, there is no clear interpretation concerning these discrepancies. In order to examine the dimensions of this “student leak ” more data is needed, such as the number of migrants ’ children in Gymnasium during the previous school years. In addition, given that migration flows are recent in our country, migrants ’ children born in Greece still concentrate in the younger age groups of the <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid.</b> Many migrants also left initially their children in their country of origin and brought them to Greece later on. What is worhtwhile to mention is that the data change considerably over the school years. If we compare the rates of the two researches, we draw significant conclusions. The total student population of secondary school in Attica is reduced by 8, 9 % and simultaniously the migrant students ’ rate is increased by 20, 8 %. In two years time the greek students are 33. 000 less and the migrant students in full expansion...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the acquisition of L 3 German by adult native speakers of Swedish living in Germany for 3 to > 30 years (AO> 18 years). These learners have different professions or study other subjects than languages at German universities. All of them learnt L 2 English and all but one L 3 German in upper secondary schools in Sweden. This thesis is a holistic study, the ambition of which is to answer the following questions:-	What are the common characteristics, if any, of the interlanguages of these Swedish learners? -	In what language domains could adult learners attain near-native or native-like proficiency?-	What factors contribute to successful foreign language acquisition?Five tests were presented to the Swedish participants and to a group of native Germans:-	a multiple-choice lexicon test-	a grammaticality judgement test-	an oral production test (retelling a story and commenting on <b>demographic</b> <b>pyramid</b> graphs) -	a test of modal particles (also elicited in oral production) -	a test of speech act performanceA highly significant correlation between length of residence/quantity of input and the result of the lexicon test was found. Thus some of the tested non-native speakers should be able to attain native-like proficiency in this domain. In morphosyntax difficulties lie in the use of case rather than in word-order, tense and subjunctive. In pragmatics Swedish learners are able to insert modal particles into sentences, although they make scarce use of them in oral production. Common characteristics are Swedish information structure and the use of verbal phrases instead of German information structure and nominal style. In speech act performance Swedish learners often choose unmarked IFIDs instead of more difficult marked ones. Cognitive and affective factors could not be quantified, but have been considered in the elicitation of successful ultimate attainment. Results from a self assessment of language skills, based on the Council of Europe scale, was compared with the test results of the Swedish participants. Two participants were considered native-like in all tested domains. Title:	 Sackgasse oder Autobahn?
