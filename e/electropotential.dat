5000|$|It {{has been}} found that all the common metals behave {{relatively}} similarly. The two spaced electrodes, having a load in an external circuit connected between them, are disposed in an electrical medium, and energy is imparted to the medium in such manner that [...] "free electrons" [...] in the medium are excited. The free electrons then flow into one electrode to a greater degree than in the other electrode, thereby causing electric current to flow in the external circuit through the load. The current flows from that plate whose position in the <b>electropotential</b> series is near the negative end (such as palladium). The current produced is highest when the two metals are most widely separated from each other in the <b>electropotential</b> series, and when the material nearer the positive end is to the north, while that at the negative end is towards the south. The plates, one copper and another iron or carbon, are connected above ground by means of a wire with as little resistance as possible. In such an arrangement, the electrodes are not appreciably chemically corroded, even when they are in earth saturated with water, and are connected together by a wire for a long time.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{electrorefining}} copper consists of placing a copper anode (about 99.5-99.7% pure copper) in sulfuric acid, {{together with a}} cathode, and passing a current between the anode and cathode through an external circuit. At the applied <b>electropotential,</b> copper and less noble elements dissolve in the electrolyte, while elements more noble than copper, such as gold and silver, do not.

40|$|The rapid {{reduction}} in cell <b>electropotentials</b> induced by metabolic inhibitors is strong evidence for an electrogenic ion pump.

40|$|Neural microelectrodes are an {{important}} component of neural prosthetic systems which assist paralyzed patients by allowing them to operate computers or robots using their neural activity. These microelectrodes are also used in clinical settings to localize the locus of seizure initiation in epilepsy or to stimulate sub-cortical structures in patients with Parkinson’s disease. In neural prosthetic systems, implanted microelectrodes record the electrical potential generated by specific thoughts and relay the signals to algorithms trained to interpret these thoughts. In this paper, we describe novel elongated multi-site neural electrodes that can record electrical signals and specific neural biomarkers and that can reach depths greater than 8 mm in the sulcus of non-human primates (monkeys). We hypothesize that additional signals recorded by the multimodal probes will increase the information yield when compared to standard probes that record just <b>electropotentials.</b> We describe integration of optical biochemical sensors with neural microelectrodes.

As a prototype, we demonstrate direct-write patterning to create oxygen-responsive xerogel waveguide structures on the neural microelectrodes.

40|$|Single cell <b>electropotentials</b> {{of barley}} (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. `Compana') root cortex were {{measured}} at different external concentrations of KCl {{in the presence}} of Ca 2 +. The roots were low in salt from seedlings grown on 0. 5 mm aerated CaSO 4 solution. Thus, the conditions were equivalent to those used to define the dual mechanisms found with radioactive tracer-labeled ion uptake. In 0. 5 mm CaSO 4 alone, there is an increase with time of cell negativity from about - 65 millivolts 15 minutes after cutting segments to about - 185 millivolts in 6 to 8 hours. Two possible hypotheses, not mutually exclusive, are offered to explain this aging effect: that cutting exposes plasmodesmata which are leaky initially but which seal in time, and that some internal factors, e. g., hormones diffusing from the apex, have a regulatory effect on the cell potential, an influence which becomes dissipated in isolated segments and permits the development of a higher potential difference. In any case changes in selective ion transport must be involved. The cell potentials at KCl concentrations above 2. 0 mm are more negative than would be expected for a passive diffusion potential. It is suggested that this discrepancy may be due to an electrogenic pump or to a higher K+ concentration in the cytoplasm than in the remainder of the cell, or perhaps to both. Whether there is a clear relationship between cell potential and mechanisms 1 and 2 of cation transport depends upon whether the cell potentials of freshly cut or of aged tissue represent the values relevant to intact roots...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance the}} {{performance}} of dehydrogenases in synthetic organic chemistry, coenzyme analogs of NAD(P) $ sp+$/NAD(P) H were examined. Our study shows that dehydrogenases are more efficient with NAD(P) $ sp+$ than with the APAD(P) $ sp+,$ FPAD$ sp+$ or SPAD(P) $ sp+$ under non-regenerating oxidative conditions in terms of yields. Under regenerating conditions, APAD$ sp+$ often exceeded NAD$ sp+$ in terms of product formation. Lower yields were observed with SPAD(P) $ sp+$ and FPAD$ sp+. $ These coenzyme analogs also displayed reduced reactivity, but APAD$ sp+$ was the most promising of the three. In reduction experiments, the analogs are as equally or slightly less efficient as NAD(P) H in terms of yields, but react slower. <b>Electropotentials</b> could not explain all {{of the variation in}} yields. Therefore, to better understand the interactions made by the 3 -substituent of the nicotinamide ring in the dehydrogenase active site, the binding properties of 1 -methyl- 3 -substituted pyridinium salts (iodide and chloride) to 8 different dehydrogenases were examined. The salts were R = CONH$ sb 2,$ COONa, CN, CH$ sb 3,$ CONHCH$ sb 3,$ CH$ sb 2 $OH, CH$ sb 2 $CN, Cl, H, CH(OH) $ sb 2,$ COOCH$ sb 3 $ and COCH$ sb 3 $ did not bind well into the active site. However, the five compounds that did bind, in order of their observed increased inhibitory effects are R = CH=NOH, CONHNH$ sb 2,$ CSNH$ sb 2,$ NH$ sb 2 $ and ONa. The ONa chloride salt binds on average 336 times more tightly than CONH$ sb 2. $ It is proposed that the tightly bound compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents (CH=NOH, CONHNH$ sb 2,$ CSNH$ sb 2) $ and pKa's in the range of 9. 4 - 10. 4 form stronger hydrogen bonds and the two with strong electron-donating groups (ONa and NH$ sb 2) $ with low pKa's in their protonated forms bound in a geometry optimized for efficient hydrogen bond exchange. The difference in binding between the nicotinamide and thio derivatives can be geometry related. The X-ray crystal structure of 1 -methyl-thionicotinamide shows a different ground state orientation (s-cis) than that previously reported for 1 -methyl-nicotinamide (s-trans). From ab initio calculations, the thio derivative has a global and local minima at $ approx$ 30 $ sp circ$ and 135 $ sp circ$ as compared to 0 $ sp circ$ and 180 $ sp circ$ respectively for the oxygen compound. However, both compounds have an out-of-plane conformation in crystal. The enzyme favored trans out-of-plane conformation may also be more easily accessible for the thio than the oxygen derivative since the equilibrium constant for the cis to trans process is favored by a factor of 5. 4. By extension, the geometry that SPAD(P) $ sp+$ adopts to maximize hydrogen bond formation may cause it to have a slow turnover rate and to be an inefficient hydride acceptor, while APAD(P) $ sp+$ which is not as tightly bound to dehydrogenases, is a more efficient coenzyme...|$|R

50|$|Dissimilar {{metals and}} alloys have {{different}} electrode potentials, and when two or more come into contact in an electrolyte, one metal acts as anode and the other as cathode. If the electrolyte contains only metal ions that are not easily reduced (such as Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, or Zn2+), the cathode reaction is reduction of dissolved H+ to H2 or O2 to OH−. The <b>electropotential</b> difference between the reactions at the two electrodes {{is the driving force}} for an accelerated attack on the anode metal, which dissolves into the electrolyte. This leads to the metal at the anode corroding more quickly than it otherwise would and corrosion at the cathode being inhibited. The presence of an electrolyte and an electrical conducting path between the metals is essential for galvanic corrosion to occur. The electrolyte provides a means for ion migration whereby ions move to prevent charge build-up that would otherwise stop the reaction.|$|E
