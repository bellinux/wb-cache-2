30|$|In rice, a QTL for grain <b>number</b> per panicle, <b>Gn</b> 1, was mapped on {{chromosome}} 1 {{and later}} found {{to consist of}} two loci, QTLGn 1 a and QTLGn 1 b, with a single QTLGn 1 a locus increasing grain number by 21 % [3]. Gn 1 a encodes a gene for cytokinin oxidase–dehydrogenase (OsCKX 2), which can effectively degrade cytokinin; hence, reduced expression of OsCKX 2 is causal to higher accumulated cytokinin in inflorescence meristems and to increased grain number, leading to a higher yield potential [3]. Moreover, two agriculturally useful traits, grain <b>number</b> (<b>Gn</b> 1 locus) and plant height (sd 1, the rice Green Revolution gene), have been successfully combined into a common genetic background (QTL pyramiding), thereby generating a new superior variety having both beneficial traits [3].|$|R
