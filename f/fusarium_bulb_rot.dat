Aplikasi bahan kimia sintetik untuk mengendalikan penyakit ini berdampak negatif terhadap kerusakan lingkungan. Aplikasi organisme antagonis dan kultivar resisten merupakan alternatif pengendalian penyakit ramah lingkungan, berdampak positif terhadap kelestariannya, dan meningkatkan produktivitas lili. Penelitian bertujuan untuk mendapatkan informasi mikrobe antagonis, mikrobe nonpatogenik, dan klon lili yang dapat menekan penyakit layu Fusarium. Penelitian dilakukan di Laboratorium Biokontrol dan Rumah Sere, Balai Penelitian Tanaman Hias pada bulan Januari sampai dengan Desember 2007. Tata letak percobaan disusun berdasarkan rancangan acak kelompok pola faktorial denga tiga ulangan. Faktor pertama ialah klon lili yang terdiri dari klon No. 1, No 2, No. 3 (tahan), dan No. 4 (rentan). Faktor kedua ialah perlakuan mikrobe antagonis (1) Gliocladium sp. 107 spora/ml, (2). Trichoderma sp. 107 sel/ml, (3) Fusarium a virulen 107 spora/ml dan, (4) kontrol (tanpa mikrobe antagonis). Hasil percobaan menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan mikrobe antagonis Gliocladium sp. dan klon resisten paling efektif mengendalikan penyakit busuk umbi Fusarium pada lili. Hal ini dibuktikan dari persentase tanaman layu pada perlakuan aplikasi mikrobe dan penggunaan tanaman {{resistant}} dibandingkan dengan tanpa perlakuan. Penanaman tanaman resisten diikuti dengan aplikasi Gliocladium paling efektif menekan layu Fusarium dibanding perlakuan lainnya. Lilium {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and the heigest economic value of cut flower in Indonesia. Cultivation of Lilium faces major constrain, that is wilt disease caused by Fusarium. Application of synthetic chemicals to control the diseases is not recommended, because its impact is dangerous for environment and human life. Therefore other control measures that are move environmentally friendly and more effective/efficient have to applied. The use of antagonistic microbes and resistance varieties are the most promising control measures to be recommended in the field. The study was aimed to find out of antagonist and nonpathogenic microbes and plant resistant that were effective to control <b>Fusarium</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>rot</b> on lili. The experiment was conducted at Laboratory and Glasshouse of Indonesian Ornamental Crops Research Institute (1, 100 m asl.) on January to December 2007. Factorial experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with three replications. The first factor was Lilium clones i. e. No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 (resistant), and No. 4 (susceptible clone as control). The second factor was antagonism microbes i. e. (1) Gliocladium sp. 107 spora/ml, (2). 107 Trichoderma sp. cel/ml, (3) Fusarium nonpathogenic 107 spora/ml, and (4) control (tap water without antagonist microbe). The results indicated that the use of Gliocladium sp. and resistant clone of Lilium i. e. clone No. 3 was effective to control <b>Fusarium</b> <b>bulb</b> <b>rot</b> of Lilium. This proven from lower percentage of disease occurance on the treatment of antagonistics microbes and resistance varieties compared both to those of without treatment (control). The use of resistance plant followed by application of Gliocladium was known to be most effective to control fusarial wilt disease compared to the other treatment combinations...|$|E

5000|$|Phytophthora nicotianae or Black Shank is an Oomycete {{belonging}} to the order Peronosprales and family Pythiaceae. Phytophthora nicotinae has a broad host range comprising 255 genera from 90 families. Hosts include tobacco, onion, tomato, ornamentals, cotton, pepper, and citrus plants. This pathogen can cause root rot, crown rot, fruit rot, leaf infection, and stem infection. Root rot symptoms are observed on tobacco, poinsettia, tomato, pineapple, watermelon, and African violet. Fruit rots occur on tomato, papaya, and eggplant. Onion shows a leaf and stem infection. In tobacco Black Shank affects the roots and basal stem area, but {{all parts of the}} plant can become infected. Damping off symptoms can be observed in young seedlings. The first above ground symptom that will be observed is the wilting of plants, which leads to stunting. Roots will be blackened and decayed. In final stages of the disease the stem begins to turn black, hence the name Black Shank. As this happens, tobacco leaves turn brown and become not marketable. Another symptom is disk-like appearance of the pith, although this is not a definitive symptom as it may also be the result of lightning strikes.

Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} to study the present status of the onion postharvest handling, identify optimum storage conditions and analysis of the feasibility of providing those conditions for short-term storage. Primary and secondary data related to onion storage and marketing were gathered and analyzed to get information on postharvest handling, storage environment and marketing system. Storage behaviour of big onions under two temperatures: 25 C and 30 oC and three RH conditions; 60 %, 75 % and 90 % was studied using a locally fabricated environment control chamber. A complete randomized design was used for the experiment. Loss of weight and external quality parameters were studied. The rainy season coincided with the storage period developing high RH above 75 %. Both the temperature and RH effects are significant at α = 0. 05 on the percentage losses but there is no interaction effect between these two factors. The difference in the weight reduction due to loss of moisture was significant under two temperatures and three RH conditions at α = 0. 05.

Major deterioration problems that occur during onion storage are weight loss, sprouting, root growth, diseases, sugar accumulation, loss of pyruvic acid and ascorbic acid. Combination of relative humidity and temperature could prevent or minimize onion losses during storage, however, {{it depends on}} onion cultivar. Pyruvic acid is a trademark of onions and is the main factor why this vegetable is used in food industries throughout the world. Loss of ascorbic acid indicates loss in quality or loss in other nutrients components such as carbohydrate and protein.

Besides cultivation practices and chemical protection, resistant cultivars {{can play an important}} role in preventing this disease. To breed Fusarium resistant cultivars, screening and selection tests have to be developed and genetic variation in the host and in the pathogen determined. Information about the inheritance can be helpful in selecting the parents with the best breeding value for Fusarium resistance. Clonal screening tests under standardized conditions (e. g., concerning temperature, inoculum concentration and duration of the test) are developed for lily, narcissus, gladiolus and tulip using artificially infested soil or bulbs. By using a clone of a genotype, levels of resistance can be determined accurately. Severity of the disease is mainly observed by using disease ratings or the percentage of diseased bulbs. Partial resistance to Fusarium is present in all four crops. In Narcissus and Gladiolus even species with absolute resistance were identified. Resistant species are used in interspecific breeding programmes with commercial cultivars. Variation in virulence of Fusarium was investigated for f. sp. lilii, f. sp. gladioli and f. sp. narcissi. In all these formae speciales indications for race-formation were observed. Comparison of different sizes of bulbs within genotypes showed that screening immature bulbs is possible. Tests of individual plants in the seedling stage also gave promising results for a more efficient selection system.

Losses up to 40 % can occur as a result of reduced onion quantity and quality. Ultimately, an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach will be required to manage bacterial {{diseases of}} which cultural practices will be important components. Recently, studies with small-scale production of onions on plastic mulch showed that when plant spacing was reduced from 6 or 8 to 4, this provided 53 to 64 % control of bacterial bulb decay at harvest. Marketable yield also increased by 1. 4 to 2. 4 times due to more marketable jumbo-sized bulbs. Wide plant spacing produced big bushy plants with more leaves, thicker necks, delayed maturity and bigger bulbs, and it was these bigger colossal-sized <b>bulbs</b> that <b>rotted.</b> By narrowing plant spacing, having significantly more healthy jumbo bulbs more than made up for fewer colossal bulbs. Whether reduced plant spacing also reduces bacterial bulb decay in direct seeded onions that are already grown at high plant populations warranted investigation. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the effect on bacterial bulb decay and yield of plant and row spacing, and bulb area in large-scale production of direct seeded and transplanted onions. An on-farm small-plot research trial was conducted using transplanted onions (c. v. Canady) and included 13 planting configurations. Plant size and maturity trends were generally opposite of what was found previously in studies with small-scale onion production: in this study, plant height, number of leaves per plant and maturity generally increased as plant population increased. Despite this, yield and bulb size distribution were similar to previous results. There was a general trend that total yield, boiler, small and medium sized bulb weight, and economic return increased as plant population increased. Within each row spacing (15, 10 and 7. 5), these parameters increased as the plant spacing decreased from 8 to 6 to 4. Although less dramatic, within each plant spacing (4, 6 and 8), these parameters increased as row spacing decreased from 15 to 10 to 7. 5. Generally, yield increased as plant population increased because there were more bulbs per area to contribute to yield. Our data suggests that plant spacing is a stronger predictor of yield and bulb size than row spacing or bulb area. Bacterial bulb decay 9 weeks after the onions were pulled from the field ranged from 0. 8 to 3. 6 % incidence and no significant differences occurred among planting configurations. There were no significant correlations between incidence of bacterial bulb decay and plant size, maturity, yield and bulb size distribution. There was no relationship between bacterial bulb decay and plant population. Repeating this study is certainly warranted in order to generate robust data from which to make recommendations for planting configurations to manage bacterial diseases in large-scale onion production...|$|R

(some col.) 29 cmOverall, control {{efforts are}} focused on breaking the disease cycle. The disease cycle is initiated when spores disperse from a contaminated source to a healthy host. For Fusarium species, two types of asexual spores, macroconidia and microconidia, are often the primary means of dispersal, although sexual spores (ascospores) can also playa role (21). In nurseries, ascospore dispersal is by wind (45), and conidia can spread by both wind and water splash, primarily from overhead watering (21, 45). Vectors, such as insects and tools which contact infected material, also contribute to spread (2). Once {{in contact with the}} host, the spore germinates, penetrates the tissue, and enters the host. The pathogen infects the tissue, feeding on cellular material, growing, and producing spores that are then dispersed, perpetuating the disease cycle. If a host is absent, thick walled survival spores, called chlamydospores, can develop from cells in the hyphae and/or the macroconidia (87). Chlamydospores can allow for survival in plant parts (such as root matter) or in the soil for many years (87). Spread of Fusarium in greenhouse or field grown orchids can be reduced by various cultural practices, including removal of infected material (2, 28, 34), regulation of watering and wind (when possible) (21, 45, 56), and management of vectors (96), among other sanitary practices. Fusarium infection and reproduction can also be prevented through the use of resistant cultivars (2, 77). Fusarium germination growth and infection can also be inhibited by anti-fungal compounds, including chemical fungicides and biological controls (2). Some of the most successful practices in controlling fusarial diseases on nursery crops have involved the use of anti-fungal compounds, and the various types are reviewed below, together with examples of efficacy in controlling Fusarium in nursery systems. Chemical Fungicides: Chemical fungicides are toxic compounds which inhibit fungal germination, infection, growth, and reproduction. Compounds are either broad spectrum, with efficacy against many fungi, or are specific to certain fungi. Most fungicides are preventative, protecting the surface tissues on which they are applied, and inhibiting fungal germination (2). However, some fungicides are systemic, and enter the plants vascular system, reducing fungal growth and reproduction within the host, and curing very early stages of infection. Most systemic fungicides function either by releasing antifungal toxins into host's vascular system, or by inducing a systemic resistance response in the plant. Many of these fungicides are "traditional" compounds, which persist in the environment, and have higher mammalian toxicity than newer compounds. As an alternative to traditional fungicides, there are several compounds available, characterized as reduced risk, which have low mammalian toxicity and degrade quickly in the environment. Although many of these reduced risk compounds can be effective, they are often expensive and necessitate frequent applications. There are many effective fungicides currently available for Fusarium disease control in nursery crops. Effective traditional fungicides include captan and carbendaxim, found to inhibit gladiolus corm rot caused by F. oxysporum (76), carboxim (Vivetax), which was inhibited F. oxysporum wilt of gladiolus, (63), and thiram, a successful control of cucumber root and stem rot caused by F. oxysporum (77). Strobilurins are compounds that inhibit fungal mitochondrial respiration, and have been effective in Fusarium control. The strobilurin Kreoxim-methyl (Sovarn/BAS 490), a traditional compound, was found to control F. oxysporum on carnation and cyclamen (76). Azoxystrobin, developed from a compound originally isolated from mushrooms, is a broad spectrum reduced risk compound marketed as either Heritage (for ornamentals) or Quadris (for vegetables). Heritage is registered for control of Fusarium on more than 100 ornamental crops, including chrysanthemums (Chrysathemum spp.), carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus), geranium (Pelargonium spp.), and rose (Rosa spp.) (40, 76). This compound is reported to have equal or greater efficacy than traditional chemical compounds, such as benomyl, in Fusarium disease control on several ornamentals (76). Biological Control: In many cases, fungicides are not the preferred means for control of Fusarium, as efficacy is often poor (22, 61, 62, 72). One alternative to chemical fungicides is the use of biological controls (2, 22, 77). Biocontrols reduce disease levels by inhibition of the pathogen germination, growth, and reproduction. Inhibition can be either direct, through toxin production or nutrient competition, or indirect, by activation of a systemic resistance response in the host (2). Fungal, bacterial, and actinomycete biocontrols have all been able to effectively control Fusarium diseases in nursery systems. On cucumbers, root and stem rot caused by F. oxysporum was reduced by the fungi Gliocladium catenulatum (Prestop WP or Prestop Mix), Trichoderma harzianum and T. virens (SoilGard), the bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 63 - 28, and the actinomycete Streptomyces griseoviridis (Mycostop) (77). Trichoderma virens was also effective in reducing root rot levels caused by F. oxysporum on gladiolus (63). On Cymbidium orchids, a weakly virulent Fusarium species, HPF-l, was able to induce a systemic resistance response in the host that suppressed leaf spot caused by F. proliferatum and F. subglutinans, and both <b>bulb</b> and root <b>rot</b> caused by F. oxysporum (45). The actinomycete Streptomyces kasugaensis, reduced Fusarium wilt of Cymbidium caused by F. oxysporum, by production of an macrolide toxin (47, 49). Integrated Control: The most effective control of fusarial diseases has frequently been achieved through the integration of several different control methods (13, 18, 22, 72, 73, 77). Effective control of F. oxysporum on greenhouse cucumbers was achieved through the integrated use of greenhouse composts as pathogen-suppressive potting media, and the application of both the chemical fungicide thiram, and the bacterial biocontrol, Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 63 - 28 (77). On gladiolus, the application of carboxim together with Trichoderma virens, reduced disease levels more than either treatment alone (63). On carnation, cyclamen, and chrysanthemum, the most effective management of Fusarium wilt was achieved through the use of resistant varieties, steam sterilization of planting material, clean plant propagules, and fungicides, particularly benzimidazoles (28, 34). For effective control of Fusarium diseases on orchids, many different control methods may therefore need to be employed together. Overview of Objectives: The first objective of this research was to provide a comprehensive review of the of Fusarium diseases on orchids, the taxonomic considerations in determining the etiology of Fusarium orchid diseases, and possible measures available for control of Fusarium pathogens on orchids (Chapter 1). The second objective was to conduct a statewide survey to determine the fungi associated with new orchid diseases in Hawaii, their frequency and distribution, and their associations with symptoms and hosts (Chapter 2). The third objective was to determine the etiology of Fusarial diseases, by conducting pathogenicity tests on Dendrobium orchids, in fulfillment of Koch's postulates (Chapter 3). The fourth objective was to survey the incidence of Fusarial diseases in the field, which are caused by the established pathogens (Chapter 3). The fifth objective was to characterize the strain populations of the most common Fusarium orchid pathogen (Chapter 3). The sixth and final objective was to determine effective control measures for the Fusarium pathogens found, examining both biological controls and chemical fungicides (Chapter 4) ...|$|R
