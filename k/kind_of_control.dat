He secured in {{perpetuity}} for the Company the Diwani (revenue and civil justice) of the then Bengal subah from the then Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II and thus the system of Dual Government was established and the Bengal Presidency was formed. In 1772 the Dual Government system was abolished and Bengal was brought under direct control of the British. In 1793, when the Nizamat (military power and criminal justice) of the Nawab was also taken away from them, they remained as the mere pensioners of the British East India Company. After the Revolt of 1857, Company rule in India ended and the British Crown took over the territories which were under the direct rule of the British East India Company in 1858, which {{marked the beginning of}} the British Raj. These territories, including the territory of the Nawab Nazims came under the direct rule of the British Crown and British Raj was established in India. Thus, [...] the Nawab Nizams remained just the titular heads of their territory, which was now ruled by the British Crown, and they had no political or any other <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over the territory. The last Nawab of Bengal, Mansoor Ali Khan abdicated on 1 November 1880 in favour of his eldest son.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all of the}} dated chariot graves, {{the heads}} and hooves {{of a pair of}} horses were placed in a grave that once {{contained}} a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked wheels set in grave floors 1.2–1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition a pair of disk-shaped antler [...] "cheekpieces," [...] an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice.

2500|$|In {{attempting}} to solve puzzles {{it is often}} the case that pieces seem impossible to fit ndash& until we discover we have been holding them the wrong way. [...] It is often the same way with scientific puzzles. [...] In an article titled [...] "The value of outrageous geological hypotheses", [...] mentioned [...] "the Wegener outrage of wandering continents". [...] It is instructive to note that the similarity of the western and eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean ndash& obvious even to a schoolchild ndash& was long a puzzle. [...] It seemed to require choosing between obvious impossibilities: [...] either some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of shore-line building processes over thousands of miles apart, or [...] "wandering continents". [...] Either of these seemed outrageous. [...] Wegener's theory of continental drift, first published in 1912, was rejected on the basis of impossibility until the theory of plate tectonics explained how continents could 'wander'. Such reinterpretation of concepts and evidence seems characteristic of the resolution of puzzles; it is intriguing to consider what modifications and extensions will result when the puzzle of the OWL is finally solved.|$|E
