40|$|Hot Plane Strain Compression (PSC) {{testing is}} a {{thermomechanical}} testing method used {{to simulate the}} deformation condition of industrial rolling. Thermomechanical processing (TMP) {{factors such as the}} amount of strain, strain rate and temperature all influence the microstructural evolution. The geometry of the PSC test sample and anvil are important factors in order to achieve the plane strain condition and acceptable strain distribution within deformed sample. Geometrical factors such as the breadth ratio (BR) relates the the samples breadth (b) to anvils face width (w) and this ratio has a significant effect on the breadth spread of the sample. The height ratio (HR) relates w to the samples height (h) and this ratio has a significant effect on the strain distribution. Two different geometric PSC testing configurations were investigated for this study, the one configuration had less favourable geometric ratios with a BR of 3 and a HR of 1 and the other configuration had more favourable ratios, with the BR of 4. 62 and the HR of 1. 3. This investigation is to evaluate the feasibility of a newly installed TMP machinery, the Gleeble 3800, to simulate the <b>hot</b> <b>finishing</b> rolling conditions by the use of hot PSC tests for the production of the can body stock (CBS) aluminium alloy AA 3104.

40|$|Abstract. Rougher bar {{samples of}} 2. 0 %Si and 0. 25 %Al Non Oriented Grain with 25 mm {{thickness}} were rolled to 2. 3 mm {{in a pilot}} reversible mill with temperatures ranging from 920 to 1120 °C and processed until the final annealing to study the evolution of grain size and crystallographic orientation. The results showed that higher <b>hot</b> rolling <b>finishing</b> temperature results in larger hot band grain size, but the texture, composed mainly by alpha, gamma, { 100 }, and eta fibers suffers little effect. As a consequence, after final annealing, an increase of fraction of the grains with eta fiber orientation and a reduction of grains with gamma fiber orientation are observed, improving the magnetic induction. The final grain size decreases with <b>hot</b> rolling <b>finishing</b> temperatures above 1040 °C in spite of increasing hot band grain size, deteriorating the core loss results. This was explained by the increasing of shear bands when the grain size prior to cold rolling increases. More shear bands generates more sites for nucleation on recrystallization, then smaller final grain size results. The Goss orientation is generated mainly in the sites inside shear bands. The increasing of prior grain size also increases the fraction of grains with Goss orientation after final annealing and its fraction increases suddenly when the <b>hot</b> rolling <b>finishing</b> temperature achieves 1040 °C, supporting that affirmation...|$|R

Sponge iron and iron scrap is melted in electric arc furnaces, after which liquid steel is purified in secondary purification units. The steel’s chemical compound is designed by customer demand.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to predict the {{front-end}} curvature in <b>hot</b> strip <b>finishing</b> mills and to prevent it by controlling the rolling conditions. A theoretical model based on the slab method is developed for predicting the front-end curvature by taking into account the entrance angle of the strip, the friction condition and the back tension. To validate the developed theoretical model, the theoretically obtained curvature value is compared with the results of finite element analysis. Consequently, it is shown that the calculation results of the theoretical model are in good agreement with the measured results of the finite element analysis. Furthermore, a curvature control model based on geometrical and mathematical approaches that can reduce the front-end curvature by the control of the roll speed ratio of the upper to lower rolls is proposed. The proposed curvature control model is verified by finite element analysis, and it is shown that the front-end curvature can be reduced considerably using the proposed model. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed control model for reducing the front-end curvature in a <b>hot</b> strip <b>finishing</b> mill can be used to improve the quality of the rolled product...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of an innovative discrete-time EMPC (Explicit Model Predictive Control) strategy based on multi-parametric quadratic program is traced for the gauge-looper integrated control in HSFM (<b>Hot</b> Strip <b>Finishing</b> Mill). Controller design {{is based on the}} linearized model of the integration of downstream AGC (Automatic Gauge Control) sys-tem and upstream looper-tension system. The proposed EMPC strategy gives an explicit piecewise affine control law which greatly reduces the on-line computational burden. Discrete-time EMPC achieves better performance by coordina-tion control and is more suitable for implementation on PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) compared with conven-tional controllers. Experiment results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy...|$|R

We design a non-interactive controller to decouple the looper system into two subsystems. However, these subsystems have uncertainties, disturbances and interactions with each other. In this paper we consider these uncertainties, disturbances and interactions as each nominal subsystem’s disturbance. To reduce these disturbances, we use a nonlinear disturbance observer. In comparison with other methods, the proposed method reduces response time and fluctuations in strip tension. This means that the proposed method can {{improve the quality of}} the <b>hot</b> strip <b>finishing</b> mill in the steel making process...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: p. 100 - 106. This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} austenite potential and <b>hot</b> roll <b>finish</b> temperature {{on the evolution of}} microstructure in the ferritic stainless steel grade AISI 430. In particular, it focuses on the influence of these variables on the hot band annealing behaviour of this steel. The material employed was obtained from laboratory and commercial heats. Two <b>hot</b> roll <b>finish</b> temperatures, viz. 600 °C and 800 °C for the commercial heats and two alloy compositions of austenite potential 11 and 61 % for the laboratory heats were studied. Electron channelling contrast (ECC) obtained in scanning electron microscopy was used to follow the evolution of microstructure. Limited micro texture measurements were made using electron backscattered techniques. It was found that a low finish temperature produced a hot rolled microstructure that showed limited softening and a fully recrystallised microstructure after annealing while a high <b>hot</b> roll <b>finish</b> temperature produced a completely softened as-hot-rolled microstructure and only partial recrystallisation after annealing. A high austenite potential encouraged the ferrite phase to undergo extensive continuous recrystallisation during hot band annealing. However, the affinity for the precipitation of carbo-nitrides tended {{to play a role in}} slowing down the process. On the other hand, the ferrite phase deformed in the presence of a low austenite content mostly underwent extended recovery during hot band annealing. The softening here was affected by a low driving force. The end microstructures after annealing were however similar in both cases in as much as they consisted of elongated structures. The martensite phase was found to behave similarly regardless of the austenite content, where both recovery to produce subgrains and occasional recrystallisation occurred. During final recrystallisation after cold rolling, the high austenite potential coupled with a short hot band anneal time resulted in incomplete recrystallisation. This caused sharper alpha fibre texture components in the final sheet. A long hot band anneal time however resulted in sharper gamma-fibre texture components. In the case of low austenite potential, a long hot band anneal produced a random texture in the final texture. Ridging was observed in all cases but a high austenite content was found to lessen its severity. Also, it (ridging) was reduced by the random texture produced by long hot band annealing in the case where the austenite potential was low...|$|R
