Apart from them, the line-up {{consists}} of: Anastacia, Isobel Campbell, Dido, Céline Dion, Melissa Etheridge, Fergie, Beth Gibbons, Faith Hill, Angélique Kidjo, Beverley Knight, Gladys Knight, k.d. lang, Sarah McLachlan, Beth Orton, Pink, Bonnie Raitt, Shakira, Shingai Shoniwa, Joss Stone, Sugababes, KT Tunstall and, Martha Wainwright. Since accommodating all the singers would have posed a scheduling challenge, Lennox asked them to contribute vocals on the chorus of the song. When she received the recorded vocals from Madonna, Lennox found that Madonna had not only sung during the chorus, but also contributed by singing the second verse. She [...] "was really touched – for Madonna is very rigorous in what she gets involved in and for her to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> I was thrilled to bits". Lennox also admitted that featuring Madonna would bring a bigger audience for the song, thereby helping the cause. The refrain consists of an [...] "empowering message" [...] with the group of singers belting the line [...] "Sing my sister Sing! / Let your voice be heard" [...] while interpolating [...] "Jikelele" [...] in between. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "Sing" [...] consists of a piano played in the background reminiscent of Marvin Gaye's 1968 single, [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Yeston and David Hahn's In the Beginning, {{a musical}} poking good-natured {{fun at the}} first five books of the Bible from the {{perspective}} of ordinary people living through the events described, had been workshopped at the Manhattan Theatre Club with an initial Book by Larry Gelbart under the title [...] 1-2-3-4-5 in 1987 and 1988. [...] After various revisions and tryouts, it was finally produced under its current title at Maine State Music Theatre in 1998. A producer introduced Yeston to Alan Jay Lerner to show him a song from the show, [...] "New Words", and [...] "Lerner thought the song was so wonderful he invited me to stop by his office every couple of weeks so he could give me pointers. He said Oscar Hammerstein had done that for him and he wanted to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> So, I really got coaching lessons – mentoring – in a series of meetings with Alan Jay Lerner as a result of having written that song." [...] In 1988 Yeston recorded a studio recording of a musical entitled , produced by the noted Phil Ramone. Plácido Domingo sang the role of Spanish painter Francisco de Goya, with Jennifer Rush, Gloria Estefan, Dionne Warwick, Richie Havens, and Seiko Matsuda. [...] Domingo was interested in starring in a stage musical about Goya and suggested to producer Alan Carr that Yeston would be the right person to create the vehicle, since Domingo had admired Yeston's work on Nine. [...] Because of Domingo's time commitments, the musical was made into a concept album instead.|$|E

5000|$|Chesler {{employees}} {{remembered him}} as a tough but warm boss who always wore a hat and smoked a big cigar. Artist Joe Kubert recalled Chesler paying him $5 a week, at age 12 (c. 1938) to apprentice at his studio after school. Similarly, artist Carmine Infantino remembers that, c. 1940, he was paid by Chesler [...] "a dollar a day, just to study art, learn, and grow. That was damn nice of him, I thought.

Her gown angered him. [...] "Why did she wear that dress?" [...] he fiercely asked himself. [...] "She does not <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> She {{is in love with}} him--that is why.

His inexperience quickly led to being cheated and ruined. He has dabbled various trades, experiencing great difficulties before starting his career in hardcore pornography in the mid-1970s. Having moved to Paris to open an antique shop at the bottom of the Rue Saint-Denis, he had as a neighbor of his store one of the first erotic theaters of Paris, the Saint-Denis Theatre. Ceray was closing his shop when his neighbor was opening his. His neighbor came to dinner at a restaurant that faced their two shops.

Then Françoise Filastre, a worker in the {{household}} of the Fontanges was arrested, she admitted to be a poisoner and abortionist, she entered the trial of Marie Angélique. When asked about what she knew about the duchess' strange death, Filastre panicked and admitted that Montespan hired her to perform the murder on Fontanges. [...] Montespan wished death on her young rival so she could regain {{the love of the}} king. Later Filastre said about her statements: [...] "All I said is false.

[...] however she was executed by burning in Paris after Marguerite Monvoisin accused her of a child sacrifice. Though many believed the Duchess was indeed poisoned by Madame de Montespan, the evidence by the witnesses whom later denied every statements from them as false made it impossible for the court to determine Montespan as the actual murderer.|$|R
