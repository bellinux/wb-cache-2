5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's What <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this is reflected in the albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's What <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music or the Hits series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so that, from 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} record label is Virgin Records, who have released eight Christmas number one albums. Benefitting from {{sales of the}} Now That's What <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> Music! compilation series, Virgin achieved {{four of the five}} Christmas number ones between 1983 and 1987. From 14 January 1989, compilation albums featuring various artists were no longer included in the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of times}} rather than {{time-out}} and I've got times rather than <b>I</b> <b>call</b> time {{appears to have}} been influenced by older forms such as kings and I've got kings X. There was also one report of times X. Similarly derivatives of time-out are often accompanied by the traditional crossed fingers.|$|E

5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} <b>I</b> <b>call,</b> Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources suggest {{that it could be}} his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking is that there are one or two earlier examples.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Scorsese {{made his}} first feature-length film, {{the black and white}} <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking at My Door with his fellow {{students}} actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators.

25|$|But the {{position}} <b>I</b> <b>call</b> initial may be arbitrarily chosen from among all {{the position}}s my body has successively occupied. If {{a more or less}} unconscious memory of these successive positions is necessary for the genesis of the notion of space, this memory can go back more or less into the past. Hence results a certain indeterminateness in the very definition of space, and it is precisely this indeterminateness which constitutes its relativity.|$|E
