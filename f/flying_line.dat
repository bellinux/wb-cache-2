60|$|In {{the night}} the {{struggling}} naval battle and retreat had entered upon a new phase. The Americans had drawn together {{the ends of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>line</b> skilfully and dexterously, until at last it was a column and well to the south of the lax sweeping pursuit of the Germans. Then in the darkness before the dawn they had come about and steamed northward in close order with the idea of passing through the German battle-line and falling upon the flotilla that was making for New York in support of the German air-fleet. Much had altered since the first contact of the fleets. By this time the American admiral, O'Connor, was fully informed of the existence of the airships, and he was no longer vitally concerned for Panama, since the submarine flotilla was reported arrived there from Key West, and the Delaware and Abraham Lincoln, two powerful and entirely modern ships, were already at Rio Grande, on the Pacific side of the canal. His manoeuvre was, however, delayed by a boiler explosion on board the Susquehanna, and dawn found this ship in sight of and indeed so close to the Bremen and Weimar that they instantly engaged. There was no alternative to her abandonment but a fleet engagement. O'Connor chose the latter course. It was by no means a hopeless fight. The Germans, though much more numerous and powerful than the Americans, were in a dispersed line measuring nearly forty-five miles from end to end, and there were many chances that before they could gather in for the fight the column of seven Americans would have ripped them from end to end.|$|E

5000|$|To {{control the}} airplane, the lines must remain in tension. Centrifugal force is {{generally}} sufficient to maintain line tension if the airplane is properly [...] "trimmed" [...] (adjusted), but sometimes additional {{features such as}} rudder offset and engine offset are added to provide extra tension. Weight in the outboard wing tip is usually used to balance {{the weight of the}} lines. Top aerobatics models typically have a large number of adjustable features like tip weight boxes, adjustable rudder offset, adjustable line sweep, and adjustable elevator and flap controls. Some aerobatics models use a variable rudder system (commonly called the Rabe rudder after its inventor, Al Rabe) to vary the rudder offset during flight. The adjustment of the various adjustable features on a modern stunt model can become quite complex.Many models also feature a longer inboard wing; aerobatics models use this to balance the lift from side-to-side, compensating for the difference in velocity from inboard to outboard wing, while some speed models use a very exaggerated longer inboard wing to provide streamlining of the <b>flying</b> <b>lines.</b> On small speed models the drag of the <b>flying</b> <b>lines</b> can be three times the drag {{of the rest of the}} model.|$|R

5000|$|During World War II, Germany {{developed}} a hand-crank 500 kHz rescue radio, the [...] "Notsender" [...] (emergency transmitter) NS2. It used two vacuum tubes and was crystal-controlled. The radio case curved inward {{in the middle}} so that a user seated in an inflatable life boat could hold it stationary, between the legs and above the knees, while the generator handle was turned. The distress signal, in Morse code, was produced automatically as the crank handle was turned. An NS2 unit was captured by the British in 1941, who produced a copy, the Dinghy Transmitter T-1333. Britain gave a second captured unit to the United States, which produced its own copy, the SCR-578. United States Army Air Forces aircraft carried the SCR-578 on over-water operations. Named the Gibson Girl because of its hourglass shape, it was supplied with a fold-up metal frame box kite, and a balloon with a small hydrogen generator, for which the <b>flying</b> <b>line</b> was the aerial wire. Power was provided by a hand cranked generator. The transmitter component was the BC-778. The frequency was 500 kHz at 4.8 watts, giving it a range of 200 mi. Keying could be automatic SOS, or manual. Crystals were a scarce item for the U.S. {{during the war and}} the SCR-578 was not crystal-controlled.|$|E
40|$|In autobiographical writing, {{the mirror}} {{is not only}} a privileged metaphor for the genre as a whole; it also {{functions}} as a primary administrator of boundaries, demarcating the space of the self from the foreign, the chaotic, and the unknown. The mirror metaphor is not gender neutral: in Western elite culture the mirror has served to reinforce the patriarchal dichotomy between man/mind and woman/body, prompting Luce Irigaray’s view of the mirror as “a male-directed instrument of literal objectification. ” This article examines two women-authored texts in which the mirror motif is fundamental to the construction of the autobiographical self: the actress Alla Demidova’s The <b>Flying</b> <b>Line</b> of Memory (2000) and the literary scholar Vera Luknitskaia’s Ego – Echo (2003). A close reading of the texts maps out the operations performed by the mirror and locates the boundaries delineated. The reading shows that the two authors are united by the fervency with which they affirm their social identity as members of the intelligentsia. Their gendered identity is expressed in terms of vulnerability, implicitly in Demidova, by the omission of all intimate detail, and explicitly in Luknitskaia, in reports of sexual assault. However, both have omitted one of the most frequently encountered uses of the mirror motif in European culture—to connote female vanity. In their work, the mirror is a productive literary device, affirming the feminine self...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] “WEST POINT OF THE AIR” July 25, 1942 Dear Bryant Co-Ed: While {{going through}} some papers, I came across your letter of April 27 {{and decided to}} answer it late as it is. Having {{forgotten}} almost everything Mr. Naylor taught me about correspondence while I was at Bryant I will try to compose an interesting and reasonable letter. I am a lieutenant in the Air Corps and was assigned to Randolph Field as a flying instructor last May much against my will. When I received my wings I had visions of flying bombers in Australia but these have long since faded into the distance. My work here consists of teaching flying cadets to fly basic trainers and myself to fly the new fighting ships {{as fast as the}} Army receives them. In case you have ambitions of becoming a flying instructor, here is an accounting of a day’s work. At 8 : 00 A. M. (a reasonable hour) I go to the <b>flying</b> <b>line</b> and make a preflight inspection of my plane and any plane my students may fly. At 9 : 00 A. M. the eager! young! cadets arrive. Five are assigned and report to me. We have a little talk about what is expected of them and then start flying. I fly one hour with each student and spend about 15 minutes criticizing the student’s flight. By about 4 P. M. we are through flying unless night flying is scheduled. I give the planes their daily inspection and put them to bed. After spending about an hour making out students’ grade slips for the day’s work it is 6 P. M. and suppertime. We are then off until 8 P. M. when night flying starts. This is just a repetition of the day’s flying and usually lasts until 2 A. M. If no night flying is scheduled we teach ground school until about 10 P. M. We get time off every time weather does not permit flying. Otherwise the above schedule goes on seven days a week. For recreation I generally get about an hour’s swimming just before supper at the pool at the Officers’ Club which is pretty nice. You can tell my teachers at Bryant that I never knew what they were up against until I started teaching navigation, meteorology, etc. to these cadets. If you have a chance I would appreciate your showing this letter to Mr. Gulski. I am sure he will remember me as I was more trouble to him than most students. I also wish to express my thanks for the packages from the Bryant Service Club and the Bryant Alumni Bulletin which arrives frequently. Texas isn’t a very good place to spend the summer and work here is very monotonous. I would like to be back in New England where the temperature isn’t 100 - 110 ° almost every day. I think that if I am a good boy I may get a five day leave around Christmas. However, with all the flying regulations we have here {{it is very hard to}} behave myself considering my reckless nature. Twice so far I have been reprimanded for doing maneuvers which are considered bad examples to students. They will admit I am still alive so my flying must be safe enough. Please let me hear more about the happenings at Bryant and in Providence. Sincerely, Kirke Everson [Transcription ends...|$|E

A typical kite force polar is presented and a sensitivity study is carried out to identify the importance of various parameters in the ship kite propulsion system. Small horizontally orientated figure of eights shape kite trajectories centred on an elevation of 15 ° is preferred for maximizing propulsive benefit. Propulsive force is found to be highly sensitive to aspect ratio. Increasing aspect ratio from 4 to 5 is estimated to yield up to 15 % more drive force <br/...|$|R

40|$|Kite {{propulsion}} {{has emerged}} as an attractive means to harness wind power {{in a way that}} yields environmental and financial benefits. An understanding of the dynamics that affect kite motion and the resulting forces is required to facilitate the design and optimization of kite propulsion systems. In this thesis results from two line tension models are compared with experimentally recorded time histories for dynamic kite flight. New methodologies for investigating kite performance are established. The first zero mass model assumes that the kite and lines are weightless. The second, lumped mass model, considers the kites mass and thus makes use of the equations of motion. It is found that the two different models converge to the same result in the limit where the kite mass tends to zero. The zero mass model has been shown to compare favourably with experimental results. A method for parameterising figure of eight shape kite trajectories and for predicting kite velocity is presented. Results are shown for a variety of manoeuvre shapes, assuming realistic performance characteristics from an experimental test kite.
