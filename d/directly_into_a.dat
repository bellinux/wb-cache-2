5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced {{than they did in}} the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the {{minefield}}, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E

5|$|In 1815, Emperor Gia Long summoned {{him back}} in order to {{suppress}} widespread rebellions in central Vietnam. In 1819, Duyệt was in Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa in northern Vietnam putting down revolts for Gia Long. During this time, he joined forces with a former rebel leader from a highlands minority group in Cao Bằng. This man became Duyệt's adopted son under the name Lê Văn Khôi and his men also rallied to the court. Khoi was then propelled <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> high-ranking post in Gia Định. During the final four years of Gia Long's reign, Duyệt ascended to the highest rank in the court, and he and Pham Dang Hung, another southerner, {{were the only people}} present as the emperor died. Gia Long decreed that Duyệt take command of five royal regiments.|$|E
5|$|On August29, an area {{of weather}} {{developed}} <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm, skipping the tropical depression stage. Katrina steadily intensified as it headed west-northwest, gradually turning to the northwest. It peaked in intensity on September3 as a Category4 hurricane with winds of , the second highest of the season. Katrina then headed westward and rapidly weakened. It was downgraded into a tropical storm on September5 and a depression on September6. The last advisory was issued on September7 when Katrina dissipated. Although the hurricane brought Category3-equivalent winds to Socorro Island on September2, no damage was reported there or anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
25|$|Playing back {{a signal}} from {{recording}} studio equipment <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> guitar amplifier can cause unwanted side-effects such as input-stage distortion, treble loss or overemphasis, and ground-loop hum; thus there is sometimes a need for impedance conversion, level-matching, and ground alteration. Like running a guitar signal through a guitar effects pedal that is set to Bypass, re-amping introduces some degree of sonic degradation compared to playing a guitar live <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> guitar amp rig.|$|E

25|$|Young isopod {{crustaceans}} hatch <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> manca stage, {{which is}} similar in appearance to the adult.

25|$|In the UK, the huff-duff {{system had}} largely {{displaced}} BTDF by about 1943. Huff-duff used balanced amplifiers that fed <b>directly</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> CRT to instantly display the direction {{directly from the}} incoming signal, requiring no mechanical movement of any sort. This allowed even the most fleeting signals to be captured and located. The display, in spite of operating on entirely different principles, was {{very similar to the}} US mechanical system.
