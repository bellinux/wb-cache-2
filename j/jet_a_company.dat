50|$|The Vantage is {{currently}} being developed by VisionAire <b>Jets,</b> LLC, <b>a</b> successor <b>company</b> to VisionAire Corporation, founded in 1988, to fill a perceived gap in the light aircraft market between high performance piston-engined aircraft and twin-engined executive jets.

It was of all-composite construction, and its wing was forward swept to reduce drag and to allow an unobstructed cabin by mounting the wing spar behind the cabin. It was planned to sell the Vantage for $1.65 million, compared with $3.3 million for the Cessna CitationJet.|$|R

40|$|Three {{series of}} {{laboratory}} experiments were run, varying the flume water discharge and the downstream water depth, to investigate local scouring downstream of a trapezoidal drop {{followed by a}} rigid apron. Three different kinds of jets, developing downstream of the drop, were observed: <b>a</b> submerged <b>jet,</b> <b>a</b> surface wave <b>jet,</b> and <b>an</b> oscillating <b>jet.</b> The oscillating jet is defined as <b>a</b> <b>jet</b> which changes intermittently between <b>a</b> surface wave <b>jet</b> and <b>a</b> submerged <b>jet.</b> <b>A</b> different development of the scouring process due to {{the different kinds of}} <b>jet</b> was observed: <b>a</b> submerged <b>jet</b> produced <b>a</b> local scouring with a downstream dune, while <b>a</b> surface wave <b>jet</b> produced <b>a</b> local scouring with both an upstream and a downstream dune; the scouring process due to the oscillating jet {{was the result of the}} interaction of the scouring processes due to <b>a</b> submerged <b>jet</b> and <b>a</b> surface wave <b>jet.</b> <b>A</b> stability analysis of the surface wave jet was performed, with both a flat and a scoured bed, by means of the modified De Saint - Venant equations, that is, with correction terms accounting for the curvature of the streamlines.

A positive displacement gear pump for <b>jet</b> <b>A</b> was employed, and a progressive cavity rotary screw pump was used for slurry pumping. Turbine flow meters were employed for <b>jet</b> <b>A</b> metering while the slurry flow rate was calibrated against the pressure drop in the injection tube.

40|$|Air-atomizing, splash-groove {{injectors}} {{were shown}} to improve primary-zone fuel spreading and reduce combustor exhaust emissions for <b>Jet</b> <b>A</b> and diesel number 2 fuels. With <b>Jet</b> <b>A</b> fuel large-orifice, splash-groove injectors the oxides-of-nitrogen emission index was reduced, but emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, or smoke were unaffected. Small-orifice, splash-groove injectors did not reduce oxides of nitrogen, but reduced the smoke number and carbon monoxide and unburned-hydrocarbon emission indices. With diesel number 2 fuel, the small-orifice, splash-groove injectors reduced oxides of nitrogen by 19 percent, smoke number by 28 percent, carbon monoxide by 75 percent, and unburned hydrocarbons by 50 percent. Smoke number and unburned hydrocarbons were twice as high with diesel number 2 as with <b>Jet</b> <b>A</b> fuel.
