5|$|After graduation, Holmes {{quickly became}} a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local medical scene by joining the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Boston Medical Society, and the Boston Society for Medical Improvement — an {{organization}} composed of young, Paris-trained doctors. He also gained a greater reputation after winning Harvard Medical School's prestigious Boylston Prize, for which he submitted a paper {{on the benefits of}} using the stethoscope, a device with which many American doctors were not familiar.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{were soon}} {{accepted}} into orchestras. Later models had a mellower tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orchestra.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} Mussie likely began around 1916, though folk tales claim that Canadian pioneer Samuel de Champlain {{wrote about it}} in the early seventeenth century.

5|$|Though Swift quickly {{established}} himself as a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Manchester City first team line-up, his performances were not all positive. In one of his early matches, against West Bromwich Albion, Swift conceded seven goals.

5|$|After {{playing in}} the first two Tests against Pakistan during October, Buttler was dropped for the third Test, {{replaced}} as wicket-keeper by Jonny Bairstow, and was not selected for any of the Test matches during England's tour of South Africa, although he did play again in the one-day fixtures during the tour. Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> limited-overs squad throughout the year. He scored an unbeaten 90 runs against Pakistan as part of an England record score of 444/3, the fastest half-century by an Englishman.|$|E
5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E

5|$|The 1998–99 {{season was}} the most {{successful}} season {{in the history of}} Manchester United Football Club. After finishing the previous season without winning any titles, United won a treble of trophies (the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League), the first side in English football to achieve such a feat. During the campaign United lost only five times, including a one-off Charity Shield <b>fixture,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> League Cup against eventual winners Tottenham Hotspur and their only home defeat, a league match against Middlesbrough in December 1998. A run of 33 games unbeaten in all competitions began on 26 December at home to Nottingham Forest.|$|E

5|$|A one-off golden replica trophy was {{commissioned}} by the Premier League thereafter; it was awarded to Arsenal before their first home game of the following season. The team eclipsed the league record of 42 matches without defeat (set by Nottingham Forest) against Blackburn Rovers and went seven more matches unbeaten until they lost – away to Manchester United in October 2004. Although Arsenal regained the FA Cup – on penalties against United – they finished second to Chelsea in the league. The move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 coincided with a transitional phase for the club. Several experienced first teamers were displaced in favour of youth and the style of football shifted more towards ball retention. Arsenal have since failed to regain the league title; they nevertheless remain a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Champions League under Wenger's stewardship as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|He joined Ebbsfleet United in August 2007 {{ahead of}} the 2007–08 season, playing {{regularly}} throughout the campaign, helping Ebbsfleet win the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in May 2008. Bostwick rejected a contract offer from Ebbsfleet, and signed for Stevenage just ten days after the FA Trophy success. He was a regular <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's defence and midfield throughout the season, winning the FA Trophy once more in May 2009. His second season at the club was a successful one, helping the Hertfordshire club earn promotion to the Football League {{for the first time}} in the club's history. The following season, Bostwick played an instrumental part in Stevenage earning back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011. After four years at Stevenage, Bostwick signed for Peterborough United in July 2012, where he spent five seasons. He then joined Lincoln City {{ahead of the}} 201718 season.|$|E
5|$|Julian {{started his}} career at Brentford, {{progressing}} through the youth side and making his first-team debut in 2002. After failing to cement a place as Brentford's number one goalkeeper, he left to join Stevenage Borough in February 2005. Julian was a regular <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side, helping the club win the FA Trophy in May 2007. He left Stevenage to join Gillingham on a free transfer in May 2008. Julian was released by Gillingham in May 2011, having played 80 games for the club during his three-year tenure. He spent a season at his former club, now called simply Stevenage, before being released in May 2012, and subsequently joined Newport County a month later. He was released by the club in May 2013, and subsequently joined Dartford on a free transfer.|$|E

5|$|Moncton grew rapidly {{during the}} early 20th century, {{particularly}} after provincial lobbying helped the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912. In 1918, the ICR and National Transcontinental Railway (NTR) were merged {{by the federal government}} into the newly formed Canadian National Railways (CNR) system. The ICR shops would become CNR's major locomotive repair facility for the Maritimes and Moncton became the headquarters for CNR's Maritime division. The T. Eaton Company's catalogue warehouse moved to the city in the early 1920s, employing over 700 people. Transportation and distribution became increasingly important to the Moncton economy throughout the middle part of the 20th century. The Moncton Airport opened in 1929 and quickly became an important <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community. During the Second World War the Canadian Army built a large military supply base in the city to service the Maritime military establishment. The CNR continued to dominate the economy of the city with railway employment in Moncton peaked at nearly six thousand workers in the 1950s before beginning a slow decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a {{spin-off}} from the established BBC medical drama Casualty, and premiered on 12 January 1999. It {{is set in the}} same hospital as Casualty, in the fictional city of Holby, and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both Casualty (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as Casualty@Holby City) and the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off HolbyBlue. Its first executive producers were Young and Johnathan Young, who were succeeded by Kathleen Hutchison from 2002 to 2004, Richard Stokes from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, and Oliver Kent from 2013. Since the show's initial development, it has become a weekly <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> schedule. Holby City airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.|$|E
5|$|While she {{had only}} competed in ten races during her first World Cup winter, Neuner became a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German team in the 2006–07 season. She proved {{to be one of}} the fastest {{cross-country}} skiers in biathlon, and at 19 years old, regularly set the fastest course times. On 5 January 2007, Neuner won her first World Cup event, the sprint race in Oberhof, Germany. Her victory on home soil, before a crowd of 19,000 people, received considerable media attention and put her into the national spotlight for the first time. Two days later at the pursuit race, she forgot to reload her rifle after warm-up. She was handed a new magazine during the prone shooting and managed to finish third despite a total of six shooting errors.|$|E

5|$|With the {{departure}} of Alex Song ahead of the 2012–13 season, Diaby started all three of Arsenal's opening games. His performance against Liverpool saw him awarded Man of the Match by Sky Sports in Arsenal's 2–0 win at Anfield. However, he was later injured in Arsenal's 2-1 loss against Chelsea on 29 September and was substituted. On 13 January 2013, Diaby made his return against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium. This controversial <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Premier League, saw two red cards awarded, one for each team. Arsenal lost the match 2–0. Following several spells on the sidelines during February and March, it was announced on 28 March 2013 that Diaby had torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee and that after surgery, he would be out for approximately eight or nine months.|$|E
5|$|Domínguez {{continued}} to be a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlético Madrid first-team the following season and in August 2010 he started and played the full 90 minutes in the team's UEFA Super Cup win over Inter Milan. He then scored his first senior goal for the club on 19 December, netting the team's second in a 3–0 La Liga win over Málaga. He scored once more for Atlético Madrid as he ended the season with 28 appearances to his name across all competitions. In the 2011–12 campaign, Domínguez was named as the third-captain for the season, behind López and vice-captain Luis Amaranto Perea. On 10 September, he made his 50th league appearance for Atlético Madrid when he started in a 1–0 loss against Valencia at the Mestalla. Domínguez ultimately featured in 41 matches as the club ended the season in fifth in the league, thereby missing out on a Champions League spot. He enjoyed success in the Europa League, however, coming on as a late substitute for Arda Turan as Atlético Madrid beat fellow Spaniards Athletic Bilbao 3–0 in the final to reclaim their title.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, Valbuena {{returned}} to his early season form after scoring four goals {{over the course of}} three matches. He scored his first goal of the month on 5 November in a 2–1 win at home against Nîmes. Two weeks later, Valbuena scored against Angers in another win and, in the following week, scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Pau. As a result of his performances, Valbuena was linked to several clubs in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, most notably Saint-Étienne and Auxerre, in December. The midfielder, however, denied the approaches stating his desire to help Libourne achieve promotion to the second division. Valbuena went scoreless through the winter months, but remained a <b>fixture</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting eleven as the club remained in contention for promotion to Ligue 2. On 29 April 2006, with Libourne in a battle for the final promotion spot, Valbuena scored another double, this time against Toulon in another shutout victory. Libourne went unbeaten in its final four matches, which resulted in the club finishing in third place, thus achieving promotion to Ligue 2 {{for the first time in}} its history since the local clubs of Libourne and Saint-Seurin agreed to merge in 1998. For his efforts that season, Valbuena was named the league's Player of the Year, which led to heightened interest from several professional clubs in Ligue 2 and Ligue 1.|$|E
