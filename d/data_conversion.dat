The product was a joint commercial effort of Getronics and TransVirtual Systems, developer of the Wang VS virtualization technology that makes the New VS possible. VS software can be run under New VS without program or <b>data</b> <b>conversion.</b> The New VS {{is a combination of}} very specifically configured mainstream PC or PowerPC server hardware running virtualization software. It is interoperable with SCSI-based Wang VS tape and disk drives, which provide a means of restoring VS files from standard backup tapes or copying VS disk drives.

2500|$|ArcGIS for Desktop {{consists}} of several integrated applications, including ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcToolbox, ArcScene, ArcGlobe, and ArcGIS Pro. [...] ArcCatalog is the data management application, used to browse datasets and files on one's computer, database, or other sources. [...] In addition to showing what data is available, ArcCatalog also {{allows users to}} preview the data on a map. [...] ArcCatalog also provides the ability to view and manage metadata for spatial datasets. [...] ArcMap is the application used to view, edit and query geospatial data, and create maps. [...] The ArcMap interface has two main sections, including a table of contents {{on the left and}} the data frame(s) which display the map. [...] Items in the table of contents correspond with layers on the map. [...] ArcToolbox contains geoprocessing, <b>data</b> <b>conversion,</b> and analysis tools, along with much of the functionality in ArcInfo. [...] It is also possible to use batch processing with ArcToolbox, for frequently repeated tasks. ArcScene is an application which allows the user to view their GIS data in 3-D and is available with the 3D Analyst License. [...] In the layer properties of ArcScene there is an Extrusion function which allows the user to exaggerate features three dimension-ally. ArcGlobe is another one of ArcGIS's 3D visualization applications available with the 3D Analyst License. ArcGlobe is a 3D visualization application that allows you to view large amounts of GIS data on a globe surface. [...] The ArcGIS Pro application was added to ArcGIS for Desktop in 2015. It had the combined capabilities of the other integrated applications and was built as a fully 64-bit software application.|$|E

40|$|Modeling of {{lignocellulosic}} biomass pyrolysis processes {{can be used}} {{to determine}} their key operating and design parameters. This requires significant amount of information about pyrolysis kinetic parameters, in particular the activation energy. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is the most commonly used tool to obtain experimental kinetic data, and isoconversional kinetic analysis is the most effective way for processing TGA data to calculate effective activation energies for lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis. This paper reviews the overall procedure of processing TGA data for isoconversional kinetic analysis of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis by using the Friedman isoconversional method. This includes the removal of “error” data points and dehydration stage from original TGA data, transformation of TGA <b>data</b> to <b>conversion</b> <b>data,</b> differentiation of <b>conversion</b> <b>data</b> and smoothing of derivative <b>conversion</b> <b>data,</b> interpolation of <b>conversion</b> and derivative <b>conversion</b> <b>data,</b> isoconversional calculations, and reconstruction of kinetic process. The detailed isoconversional kinetic analysis of TGA data obtained from the pyrolysis of corn stalk at five heating rates were presented. The results have shown that the effective activation energies of corn stalk pyrolysis vary from 148 to 473 kJ mol− 1 when the conversion ranges from 0. 05 to 0. 85...|$|R
