5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> quite pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E

Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times stated, [...] "despite that first-night stumble and several numbers in which her dancing was no more than adequate, Spears can safely call this performance a success". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that [...] " [...] was less a concert than a Las Vegas-style revue of intimidating complexity. Throughout, though she spoke little, Ms. Spears appeared radiant and unfettered, often smiling and never uncommitted". Dixie Reid of The Sacramento Bee commented that the show was [...] "a mesmerizingly big production with entertaining videos (including the infamous Spears-Madonna kiss), confetti, sparklers and even a stilt-walker. Who could ask for more? <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to have a good time}} at the circus". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph said Spears is [...] "the queen of production line pop and reclaims that diamanté crown with the most perfectly plastic pop show ever staged".|$|E

500|$|Retrospectively, the 32X {{is widely}} criticized {{as having been}} under-supported and a poor idea {{in the wake of}} the release of the Sega Saturn. [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X [...] "tainted just about {{everything}} it touched." [...] GamesRadar also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that [...] "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sackville-West become {{involved}} in planning the coronation of Rezā Khan, and {{got to know the}} six-year old Crown Prince Mohammad Reza fairly well. She noted how the Persian court were obsessed with attempting to ensure the coronation was up to European standards and remarked [...] "there was no point, however humble, on which they would not consult their British friends", with their guidebook being a copy of [...] "the proceedings at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of His Majesty George V". Much to her amusement, Sackville-West was asked by one Persian minister what a [...] "Rougedragon Poursuivant" [...] was, believing it was a type of animal. On the coronation day, Sackville described waking up to a [...] "Tehran spruce and furnished beyond recognition". At the Golestan Palace, the throne room which housed the fabled Peacock Throne had been [...] "repainted, the garden paved, such breaches in the walls as revealed the presence of rubbish-heaps were to be filled up". Observing the coronation of Rezā Khan upon the Peacock Throne, Sackville-West referred to the Shia clergymen as a [...] "bevy of bearded old men in long robes and turbans" [...] who appeared like the [...] "baleful chorus of a Greek play". Sackville-West noted that <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> to dislike the Shia clerics and kept a distance from them. Rezā Khan was due to enter the throne room of the Golestan Palace at precisely 3 pm for the coronation, but Sackville-West noted how everyone become tense when the shah was half an hour late, which caused alarm as Rezā Khan was well known for his punctuality and had his ministers flogged if they were late to cabinet meetings. Finally, the main doors opened and in marched Rezā Khan, dressed in his finest uniform and wearing a blue clock, and everyone fell silent. Despite her disdain for the Persian monarchy as [...] "absurd", Sackville-West found the coronation captivating as she found herself craning her neck to see Rezā Khan march up to the Peacock Throne. Walking besides him was his son, the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, who she wrote was [...] "frightened, possessed himself of a corner of his father's clock". Finally, Sackville-West noted that Rezā Khan crowned himself. In her account of her visit to the former capital of Isfahan to see the Safavid palaces, Sackville-West's repeated use of the word [...] "we" [...] is misleading as it suggests that only Nicolson accompanied her to Isfahan, when in fact, Raymond Mortimer, her husband's lover also traveled in the same car with them.|$|E
