Ground {{penetrating}} radar {{technology is}} used to provide a fast and accurate method for target location compare to other geophysical sensing techniques. An existing ground penetrating <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> developed by Open Fuel (Pty) Ltd {{is used in the}} detection and avoidance of obstacles for a sub-surface horizontal directional drill mechanism. This ground penetrating <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> could be implemented as a portable surface-based version of the system for geophysical applications. A factor limiting its implementation is a personal or a laptop computer required to execute the human-machine interface software package for the <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b> Thus, there exists a need to produce a radar user interface to replace the computer required by the current ground penetrating <b>radar</b> <b>system,</b> while maintaining the original functionality of the <b>radar</b> <b>system,</b> while maintaining the original functionality of the <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b> The purpose of this design project was to develop a user interface for a ground penetrating <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> in hardware.

40|$|In typical <b>radar</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the process}} of {{recognizing}} a target requires human involvement. This human element makes <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> not fully reliable due to unstable performance that varies between operators. This paper describes an intelligent <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> which addresses this problem in a border surveillance environment. The proposed <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> is capable of automatically detecting and then classifying different targets using an artificial neural network trained with the Levenberg‐Marquardt algorithm. The training and test sets presented to the neural network are composed by high‐resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar pictures obtained by the radar’s detection module. Simulation {{results show that the}} intelligent <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> can reliably detect and distinguish the different objectives. Moreover, the <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> can outperform human operators and another <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> that deals with similar objectives. These results indicate that future intelligent systems can potentially replace human radar operators in this critical security setting...|$|R

40|$|Ground based <b>radar</b> <b>systems</b> are a {{critical}} resource to the command, control and communications system. This thesis provides {{the tools and}} methods {{to better understand the}} actual performance of an operational ground based <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis defines two measurable performance standards: (1) the baseline performance, which is based on the sensor's internal characteristics and (2) the theoretical performance, which considers not only the sensor's internal characteristics, but also the effects of the surrounding terrain and atmosphere on the sensor's performance. The baseline <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> performance, often used by operators, contractors, and radar modeling software to determine the expected system performance, is a simplistic and unrealistic means to predict actual <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> performance. The theoretical <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> performance is more complex; but, the results are much more indicative of the actual performance of an operational <b>radar</b> <b>system.</b> The AN/UPS- 1 at the Naval Postgraduate School was used as the system under test to illustrate the baseline and theoretical <b>radar</b> <b>system</b> performance. The terrain effects are shown by performing a multipath study and producing coverage diagrams. The key variables used to construct the multipath study and coverage diagrams are discussed in detail.
