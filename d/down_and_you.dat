Kindler {{described}} the episode as a [...] "nice procedural, with heart," [...] that follows the same style as episodes of the medical drama ER, where [...] "stuff goes <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{have to kind of}} follow the team in different aspects and see how they're handling the situation." [...] The idea behind [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] came when Kindler and Wood noticed a rescue helicopter that was available for rent, prompting the two {{to come up with a}} [...] "helicopter story." [...] The episode also introduces a next level in Will and Magnus' friendship; arguments, which would create a [...] "far more realistic thread of tension" [...] between the two characters who [...] "obviously love each other," [...] and [...] "obviously get along," [...] which Kindler felt made a [...] "cool character layer." [...] This was also based on the producers themselves, who despite being good friends, often argue while producing the series.|$|E
500|$|Christman {{worked with}} the Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove {{material}} critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the Internet. She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while {{a member of the}} Scientology organization. OSA agents serve as the [...] "internal security force and intelligence unit" [...] within Scientology. Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in Clearwater, Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city. She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning. He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater. In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member. She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury, and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors. At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents. Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, [...] "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes not watching the news. It keeps you inside a Truman Show where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology." ...|$|E
