An ancient period of erosion removed that part of the Pahrump due to its being higher (and thus more exposed) than the rest of the formation.|$|E

40|$|The same {{method of}} {{investigation}} {{as stated in}} part Ⅰ was used on 4 cases of the monkey brain (Macaca muletta). 1) <b>The</b> <b>extent</b> of <b>the</b> center for the hind limb responded to electric stimulation was almost as same as or a little narrower than <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> with <b>the</b> Betz cells, while <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of <b>the</b> center for the fore limb was much wider than <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> with <b>the</b> Betz cells. 2) <b>The</b> <b>extent</b> with motor response first appeared like islands at the threshold voltage, became larger as the voltage increased and then <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> for <b>the</b> upper and lower limbs became doubled, thus making the mixed area. 3) This enlargement of the mixed area by increased stimulation {{had a tendency to}} move towards the center for the lower limb. 4) The threshold of stimulation was the lowest at the center for the upper limb, then at that for the lower limb, and the highest at the mixed area. And even in the same center, the threshold was lower at the central part with more Betz cells and higher at the peripheral part with less Betz cells. From these facts, it would appear that <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of <b>the</b> motor cortex determined physiologically is not always the same as <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> of <b>the</b> distribution of the Betz cells, but is due to the density and sensitivity of the original nerve cells of the pyramidal tract, regardless {{of the size of the}} cells...|$|R

5|$|Mineralocorticoid {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} <b>extent</b> <b>the</b> concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary {{design work}} for the Montana class began before the US entry into World War II.

The success of carrier combat at the Battle of the Coral Sea and, to a greater <b>extent,</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Midway, diminished the value of the battleship. Consequently, the US Navy chose to cancel the Montana class in favor of more urgently needed aircraft carriers, amphibious and anti-submarine vessels.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser <b>extent,</b> <b>the</b> oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} <b>extent</b> <b>the</b> central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing {{of the eyes}} and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30%–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30%–50%), fever (up to 20%), {{and changes in the}} color of stool or urine. To some <b>extent,</b> <b>the</b> symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) {{are more likely to have}} jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|E

Steamboats also operated briefly on the lower river and Kootenay Lake to service silver mines in the nearby mountains.|$|E
