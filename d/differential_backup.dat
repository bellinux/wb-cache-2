5000|$|Differential : Each <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> {{saves the}} data that has changed since the last full backup. It has the {{advantage}} that only a maximum of two data sets are needed to restore the data. One disadvantage, compared to the incremental backup method, is that as time from the last full backup (and thus the accumulated changes in data) increases, so does the time to perform the <b>differential</b> <b>backup.</b> Restoring an entire system would require starting from the most recent full backup and then applying just the last <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> since the last full backup.|$|E
50|$|A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> is a {{cumulative}} backup of all changes made {{since the last}} full or normal backup, i.e., the differences since the last full backup. The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full backup and the last <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> to restore the system. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full backup, more data needs to be backed up, especially if {{a significant proportion of}} the data has changed.|$|E

5000|$|Oracle Software also leverages a {{backward}} description of <b>differential</b> <b>backups</b> in their DB product as of May 14, 2015: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/backup.102/b14192/bkup004.htm ...|$|R
50|$|In general, {{this method}} of {{external}} backup is highly effective when the backup solution supports incremental or <b>differential</b> <b>backups.</b> The first backup is then performed using seed load technology; afterwards only new and changed data has to be backed up over the Internet.|$|R
50|$|An {{unsupported}} free edition {{is available}} for non-commercial use, which lacks some features of full versions e.g. incremental backup (though it includes <b>differential</b> <b>backup).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Differential backup: When a <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> is performed, {{only the}} files {{which have been}} {{modified}} since the last FULL backup are stored in your archive.|$|E
5000|$|Cobian Backup {{supports}} Unicode, FTP, compression (ZIP, SQX, 7z), encryption (including Blowfish, Rijndael, DES, RSA-Rijndael [...] ), incremental and <b>differential</b> <b>backup,</b> {{for example}} a <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> every night (which backs up user files that {{have changed since}} the last full backup) and a full backup every seventh night (backing up {{a full set of}} user files). Backups can be saved to CD, DVD, USB memory stick, a second hard drive (internal or external), etc. It supports long file names (32,000 characters) for all backup routines.|$|E
50|$|Backup {{solutions}} generally support <b>differential</b> <b>backups</b> and incremental backups {{in addition}} to full backups, so only material that is newer or changed compared to the backed up data is actually backed up. The effect of these is to increase significantly {{the speed of the}} backup process over slow networks while decreasing space requirements.|$|R
40|$|Data {{deduplication}} avoids redundant data in {{the storage}} of backup operation. Deduplication reduces storage space and overall amount of time. In this system, files that contain data are split into chunks by using context aware chunking and fingerprints lookup to each chunk. Backup storage process is for avoiding duplicate data using fingerprints lookup. In this paper, we compare three methodology of backup systems such as full backup, cumulative incremental <b>backup</b> and <b>differential</b> incremental <b>backup.</b> Full backups contain all data file blocks. Cumulative incremental backups contain blocks from level n- 1 or lower. Restoration speed is faster than <b>differential</b> incremental <b>backup</b> but storage space occupy much more. <b>Differential</b> incremental <b>backups</b> contain only modified blocks from level n or lower. The processes of <b>differential</b> incremental <b>backup</b> in which data objects changes made since the last full backups are copied...|$|R
50|$|In some situations, {{continuous}} data protection requires less space on backup media (usually disk) than traditional backup. Most {{continuous data}} protection solutions save byte or block-level differences rather than file-level differences. This {{means that if}} one byte of a 100 GB file is modified, only the changed byte or block is backed up. Traditional incremental and <b>differential</b> <b>backups</b> make copies of entire files.|$|R
5000|$|Handy Backup stores {{information}} about each backup task in index files {{of its own}} [...]HBI format. Each index file contains the list of files, their sizes, time of creation, time of last modification, file attributes, and other data. It also includes {{a reference to the}} previous index file and is renewed with each execution of the task, which enables doing incremental and <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> and save only changes. In Handy Backup, incremental backup is made on file level and <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> is made on byte level.|$|E
50|$|A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> is a {{cumulative}} backup of all changes made {{since the last}} full backup, i.e., the differences since the last full backup. The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full backup and the last <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> to restore the entire data repository. The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full backup, more data needs to be backed up, especially if {{a significant proportion of}} the data has changed, thus increasing backup time as compared to the incremental backup method.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to use the terms [...] "differential backup" [...] and [...] "incremental backup" [...] correctly. The two terms are widely used in the industry, and their use is universally standard. A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> refers to a backup made to include the differences since the last full backup, while an incremental backup contains only the changes since the last incremental backup. (Or, of course, since the last full backup if the incremental backup in questions is the first incremental backup immediately after the last full backup.) All the major data backup vendors have standardized on these definitions, including Microsoft, Acronis, and Symantec. Microsoft, makers of Backup and Restore, defines incremental backups and differential backups as follows: [...] "Incremental: An incremental backup provides a backup of files that have changed or are new since the last incremental backup....Differential: A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> provides a backup of files that have changed since a full backup was performed. A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> typically saves only the files that are different or new since the last full backup, but this can vary in different backup programs. Together, a full backup and a <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> include all the files on your computer, changed and unchanged." [...] Microsoft products, such as Exchange Server 2010 use this definition in their literature and support sites.|$|E
5000|$|An {{incremental}} backup {{is one in}} which successive copies of the data contain only that portion that has changed since the preceding backup copy was made. [...] When a full recovery is needed, the restoration process would need the last full backup plus all the {{incremental backup}}s until the point of restoration. Incremental backups are often desirable as they reduce storage space usage, and are quicker to perform than <b>differential</b> <b>backups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|EMC Corporation, {{makers of}} EMC NetWorker (formerly Legato), states that “Incremental is a backup of latest changes {{since the last}} backup (any level) so when a full {{recovery}} is needed {{you would need to}} restore the last full backup plus all the incremental backups until the point-in-time you want to restore...Differential backups are incremental backups since the last full backup… the <b>differential</b> <b>backups</b> will always save the differences between the last full.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The Standard Edition can {{complete}} backup {{and restoring}} of disks (including system disks), partitions, files, and folders. It provides {{the ability to}} schedule automated incremental and <b>differential</b> <b>backups.</b> The feature called [...] "universal restore" [...] enables migration of an operating system to physical computers or virtual machines with dissimilar hardware. System and data backups use the Shadow Copy technology, which enables creating backups without interrupting running software. The utility can create a bootable recovery disk based either on Linux or on Windows PE (which supports both BIOS and UEFI).|$|R
5000|$|Acronis, {{makers of}} Acronis True Image, states that “A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> backs up only the files that {{changed since the}} last full back...Incremental backups also back up only the changed data, but they only back up the data that has changed since the last backup — be it a full or {{incremental}} backup.” ...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{improvements}} {{are made to}} various other system tools and accessories in Windows 98. Microsoft Backup supports <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> and SCSI tape devices in Windows 98. Disk Cleanup, a new tool, enables users to clear their disks of unnecessary files. Cleanup locations are extensible through Disk Cleanup handlers. Disk Cleanup can be automated for regular silent cleanups.|$|E
50|$|In February 2010, UpdateStar began a {{commercial}} online backup service called UpdateStar Online Backup. Users of UpdateStar Online Backup can select files and folders through a desktop application, {{which are then}} periodically backed up to a remote data center. The program employs a <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> algorithm to minimize the amount of data {{that needs to be}} backed up on subsequent runs.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of backup supported: File backup and system image. File backups are saved to ZIP files. Two methods of file backup are supported: The first, normal backup, stores everything selected for backup. The second, incremental backup stores only files that are changed after a previous backup. The other method of backup, system image, is a disk image of the backed up system saved block by block in a VHD file (versus file by file in the file backup and NTBackup). Block-based backup is more efficient at performing subsequent <b>differential</b> <b>backups,</b> as only the blocks that have changed need to be backed up.|$|R

A super node never shuts down randomly or frequently, for maintenance related shut down, <b>differential</b> <b>backups</b> {{may be used for}} consistency requirements. The (V) Volunteer node rarely gets a replicated copy, if there are no persistent node nearby and for temporal requirement a volunteer node may also act as a replica, {{but as soon as the}} requirements are satisfied it submits back, or if the persistent nodes are up, the persistent nodes bully the volunteer nodes and all further requests are served by the persistent node after handover.|$|R

50|$|By default, Bacula's <b>differential</b> and {{incremental}} <b>backups</b> {{are based}} on system time stamps. Consequently, if you move files into an existing directory or move a whole directory into the backup FileSet after a full backup, those files may not be backed up by an incremental save because they may have old dates. You must explicitly update the date/time stamp on all moved files. Bacula versions starting with 3.0 or later support Accurate backup, which is an option that addresses this issue without requiring modification of the files timestamps. This feature should always be used if an accurate state of the filesystem is important. Which criteria should be applied is configurable, i.e. inode comparisons, modification times or md5/sha1 signatures.|$|R
5000|$|Backup4all is {{a backup}} {{software}} for Microsoft Windows developed by Softland. It allows files {{to be backed}} up to any local or network drive, FTP or SFTP server, CD/DVD/Blu-ray, or other removable media. The term [...] "backing up" [...] means to save data on an external hard drive in case something happens to you personal computer. This is useful to safeguard sensitive data from deletion. Four different types of backups are supported: incremental backup, <b>differential</b> <b>backup,</b> full backup and mirror backup.|$|E
5000|$|Note: Vendors have {{standardized}} on {{the meaning}} of the terms [...] "incremental backup" [...] and [...] "differential backup". However, there have been cases where conflicting definitions of these terms have been used. The most relevant characteristic of an incremental backup is which reference point it uses to check for changes. By standard definition, a <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> copies files that have been created or changed since the last full backup, regardless of whether any other differential backups have been made since then, whereas an incremental backup copies files that have been created or changed since the most recent backup of any type (full or incremental). Other variations of incremental backup include multi-level incrementals and incremental backups that compare parts of files instead of just the whole file.|$|E
50|$|A <b>differential</b> <b>backup</b> {{is a type}} of {{data backup}} that {{preserves}} data, saving only the difference in the data since the last full backup. The rationale in this is that, since changes to data are generally few compared to the entire amount of data in the data repository, the amount of time required to complete the backup will be smaller than if a full backup was performed every time that the organization or data owner wishes to back up changes since the last full backup. Another advantage, at least as compared to the incremental backup method of data backup, is that at data restoration time, at most two backup media are ever needed to restore all the data. This simplifies data restores as well as increases the likelihood of shortening data restoration time.|$|E
