5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat to}} humans in {{developed}} countries is rising {{as a result of}} social trends: the increase in organic farming, which uses manure and sewage sludge rather than artificial fertilizers, and spreads parasites both directly and via the droppings of seagulls which feed on manure and sludge; the increasing popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods; imports of meat, seafood and salad vegetables from high-risk areas; and, as an underlying cause, reduced awareness of parasites compared with other public health issues such as pollution. In less-developed countries, inadequate sanitation and the use of <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> (night soil) as fertilizer and to enrich fish farm ponds continues to spread parasitic platyhelminths, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects have provided additional channels for their spread. People in these countries often cannot afford the cost of fuel required to cook food thoroughly enough to kill parasites. Controlling parasites that infect humans and livestock has become more difficult, as many species have become resistant to drugs that used to be effective, mainly for killing juveniles in meat. While poorer countries still struggle with unintentional infection, cases have been reported of intentional infection in the US by dieters desperate for rapid weight-loss.|$|E
25|$|A {{pit latrine}} or pit toilet {{is a type}} of toilet that {{collects}} <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> in a hole in the ground. They use either no water or one to three liters per flush with pour-flush pit latrines. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are the lowest cost method of separating feces from people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are {{a number}} of options to control the odor during the {{degradation}} of organic wastes and biofiltration is one of them. Fresh vermicompost has a high surface area, adequate absorption capacity and high diversity and population of micro-organisms. Vermicompost helps in degradation process as well as in suppressing the odor. Study was organized in order to use the vermicompost as a biofilter media to suppress odor and optimize the thickness of vermicompost to remove/degrade the volatile fatty acids (VFA) emission. The 2. 5 cm thick vermicompost layer in bedding and covering was found to be sufficient enough to eliminate the odor of system and reduce the Volatile Fatty Acids level from 161. 55 to 39. 61 mg/g within a period of 21 days.

50|$|<b>Humans</b> expel <b>feces</b> with a {{frequency}} varying {{from a few}} times daily to a few times weekly. Waves of muscular contraction (known as peristalsis) in {{the walls of the}} colon move fecal matter through the digestive tract towards the rectum. Undigested food may also be expelled this way, in a process called egestion.|$|R
50|$|Gordius worms {{have been}} {{recovered}} from <b>human</b> vomit, <b>feces,</b> and urine. When worms are expelled from the gastrointestinal tract, their mode of entry was likely ingestion of contaminated food or water, or of an infested insect. When present in the urine, the worm may have entered the urethra from the anus or while the victim was swimming in contaminated water. Horsehair worms are not considered pathogenic or parasitic on humans and {{their presence in the}} body is incidental.|$|R
50|$|Stagnant {{water can}} be {{dangerous}} for drinking because it provides a better incubator than running water for many kinds of bacteria and parasites. Stagnant water is often contaminated with <b>human</b> and animal <b>feces,</b> particularly in deserts or other areas of low rain.|$|R
25|$|The {{source of}} {{infection}} is from objects which have been contaminated with fecal matter containing eggs. Ingestion of infective eggs from soil contaminated with <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> or contaminated vegetables and water is the primary route of infection. Infectious eggs may occur on other objects such as hands, money and furniture. Transmission from human to human by direct contact is impossible.|$|E

25|$|L. mexicana is {{geographically}} {{distributed in}} North and South America. Specifically, their range {{is in the}} southwestern United States and extends into Mexico. This species {{is also found in}} Brazil and Central America, although they are not abundant there. In Texas, the range for L. mexicana is similar to L. eximia. Lucilia mexicana is mainly found in wooded areas, but may also inhabit urban areas due to its attraction to animal and <b>human</b> <b>feces,</b> garbage and fresh carrion.|$|E
50|$|Proteus is a genus of Gram-negative Proteobacteria. Proteus bacilli {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in nature as saprophytes, being found in decomposing animal matter, sewage, manure soil, the mamallian intestine, and <b>human</b> and animal <b>feces.</b> They are opportunistic pathogens, commonly responsible for urinary and septic infections, often nosocomial.|$|R

25|$|Animal urine forms {{part of the}} {{nitrogen}} cycle. In balanced ecosystems it fertilizes soil and plants, which in turn continue to support the animal population. Some animals use it to mark their territories. Human urine and <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> are collectively referred to as human waste; as sewage, they require sewage treatment in places where population density is high. Livestock urine and feces similarly require proper management if the livestock population density is high. Such management is part of ecological sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Although much {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a reservoir, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera was not known in the Americas for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century.|$|E
25|$|Cholera {{is caused}} by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types {{producing}} more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> containing the bacteria. Undercooked seafood is a common source. Humans are the only animal affected. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. There are concerns that rising sea levels will increase rates of disease. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. A rapid dipstick test is available but is not as accurate.|$|E
50|$|S. {{africa is}} a synanthropic species {{known to cause}} myiasis in humans and livestock. The species is {{considered}} useful in forensic entomology due to this quality.

50|$|The {{coliform}} {{index is}} {{a rating of}} the purity of water based on a count of fecal bacteria. It {{is one of many}} tests done to assure sufficient water quality. Coliform bacteria are microorganisms that primarily originate in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. By testing for coliforms, especially the well known Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is a thermotolerant coliform, one can determine if the water has possibly been exposed to fecal contamination; that is, whether it has come in contact with <b>human</b> or animal <b>feces.</b> It is important to know this because many disease-causing organisms are transferred from <b>human</b> and animal <b>feces</b> to water, from where they can be ingested by people and infect them. Water that has been contaminated by feces usually contains pathogenic bacteria, which can cause disease. Some types of coliforms cause disease, but the coliform index is primarily used to judge if other types of pathogenic bacteria are likely to be present in the water.|$|R
2500|$|A toilet is a {{sanitation}} fixture {{used for}} the storing or disposal of <b>human</b> urine and <b>feces.</b> Toilets can be with or without flushing water (flush toilet or dry toilet).

Bodies of water have been found to serve as a reservoir, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease. Cholera did not occur in the Americas for most of the 20th century after the early 1900s in New York City. It reappeared in the Caribbean toward the end of that century and seems likely to persist.|$|E
25|$|Many mass {{deworming}} {{programs also}} combine their efforts {{with a public}} health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating, and staying away from water/areas contaminated by <b>human</b> <b>feces.</b> These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with their own health risks {{and may not be}} effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{investigations}} {{have shown a}} complicated variety of intensive agricultural techniques utilized by the Maya, explaining the high population of the Classic Maya polities. Modern archaeologists now comprehend the sophisticated intensive and productive agricultural techniques of the ancient Maya, {{and several of the}} Maya agricultural methods have not yet been reproduced. Intensive agricultural methods were developed and utilized by all the Mesoamerican cultures to boost their food production and give them a competitive advantage over less skillful peoples. These intensive agricultural methods included canals, terracing, raised fields, ridged fields, chinampas, the use of <b>human</b> <b>feces</b> as fertilizer, seasonal swamps or bajos, using muck from the bajos to create fertile fields, dikes, dams, irrigation, water reservoirs, several types of water storage systems, hydraulic systems, swamp reclamation, swidden systems, and other agricultural techniques that have not yet been fully understood.
