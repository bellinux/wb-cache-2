25|$|Rhamnolipids are a {{class of}} <b>glycolipid</b> {{produced}} by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, amongst other organisms, frequently cited as the best characterised of the bacterial surfactants. They have a glycosyl head group, {{in this case a}} rhamnose moiety, and a 3-(hydroxyalkanoyloxy)alkanoic acid (HAA) fatty acid tail, such as 3-hydroxydecanoic acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{dermatological}} {{symptoms are}} caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin. The nature of this material is unknown, but researchers have suggested {{that it may be}} a glycoprotein, a <b>glycolipid,</b> an acid mucopolysaccharide, altered collagen or elastic tissue.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmunity {{also affects}} {{sulfatide}} levels. When an enhanced antibody response against myelin lipids occurs, including sulfatide {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis, the demyelination process is increased significantly. When sulfatide and gangliosides are present, the proliferation or production of Natural Killer-T cells that produce cytokines are activated. However, when CD1d deficient-mice are tested for their response to sulfatide, the same response is not seen, which indicates that in myelin, sulfatide is a <b>glycolipid</b> that possesses immunodominance.|$|E
40|$|The <b>glycolipids</b> {{of normal}} {{fibroblasts}} cells {{at different stages}} of growth and with differing degrees of susceptibility to contact inhibition have been analyzed, as well as the <b>glycolipids</b> of virally transformed cells. The concentrations (per mg protein) of certain <b>glycolipids,</b> including galactosylgalactosyl-glucosyl-, N-acetylneuraminosylgalactosylglucosyl-, and N-acetylneuraminosyl-(N-acetylneuraminosyl) galactosylglucosyl-c eramide, increase on cell-to-cell contact of susceptible cells. The concentrations of these <b>glycolipids</b> decrease when susceptibility to contact inhibition is lost as a result of extensive passage in vitro or transformation by simian virus 40 or polyoma virus, and in all the malignant cells examined, the concentrations of these <b>glycolipids</b> were independent of cell density...|$|R
50|$|Oligosaccharides are sugar {{containing}} polymers. In the membrane, {{they can}} be covalently bound to lipids to form <b>glycolipids</b> or covalently bound to proteins to form glycoproteins. Membranes contain sugar-containing lipid molecules known as <b>glycolipids.</b> In the bilayer, the sugar groups of <b>glycolipids</b> are exposed at the cell surface, where they can form hydrogen bonds. <b>Glycolipids</b> provide the most extreme example of asymmetry in the lipid bilayer. <b>Glycolipids</b> perform {{a vast number of}} functions in the biological membrane that are mainly communicative, including cell recognition and cell-cell adhesion. Glycoproteins are integral proteins. They {{play an important role in}} the immune response and protection.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnnatural <b>glycolipids</b> {{possessing}} the diyne moiety in their acyl groups were successfully biosynthesized {{in the green}} sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Chlorobaculum (Cba.) tepidum by cultivation with supplementation of 10, 12 -heptadecadiynic acid. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and rhamnosylgalactosyldiacylglycerol (RGDG) esterified with one 10, 12 -heptadecadiynic acid were primarily formed in the cells, and small amounts of <b>glycolipids</b> esterified with the two unnatural fatty acids can also be detected. The relative ratio of these unnatural <b>glycolipids</b> occupied in the total <b>glycolipids</b> {{was estimated to be}} 49 % based on HPLC analysis using a evaporative light scattering detector. These results indicate that the acyl groups in <b>glycolipids,</b> which play important roles in the formation of extramembranous antenna complexes called chlorosomes, can be modified in vivo by cultivation of green sulfur photosynthetic bacteria with exogenous synthetic fatty acids. Visible absorption and circular dichroism spectra of Cba. tepidum containing the unnatural <b>glycolipids</b> demonstrated the formation of chlorosomes, indicating that the unnatural <b>glycolipids</b> in this study did not interfere with the biogenesis of chlorosomes...|$|R
25|$|Oats, after corn (maize), {{have the}} highest lipid content of any cereal, i.e. greater than 10% for oats and as high as 17% for some maize cultivars {{compared}} to about 2–3% for wheat and most other cereals. The polar lipid content of oats (about 8–17% <b>glycolipid</b> and 10–20% phospholipid or {{a total of about}} 33%) is greater than that of other cereals, since much of the lipid fraction is contained within the endosperm.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small <b>glycolipid</b> transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency {{in any one of}} these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{acts as a}} <b>glycolipid</b> {{receptor}} that {{functions to}} aid in the adherence of these bacteria to the mucosal surface. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae are pathogens that cause respiratory disease in swine. Haemophilus influenza, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumonia, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause respiratory disease in humans. Accordingly, sulfatide is located in the tracheas of both human and swine, and through the use of sulfatide present in the trachea, these several bacteria are capable of adherence to the respiratory tract. Hsp-70 on the outside of H. influenzae, has also been shown {{to aid in the}} ability of this bacteria to bind to sulfatide.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{compared}} the specificity for the globoseries of <b>glycolipids</b> of Escherichia coli expressing the O-negative, A-positive (ONAP) adhesin and clones transformed with the pap-like (prs or pap- 2) gene cluster. Receptor-active <b>glycolipids</b> were identified by the ability of radiolabeled bacteria to bind to the <b>glycolipids</b> on thin-layer chromatogram plates. The ONAP adhesin and pap-like clones bound with high affinity to the globo-A and Forssman <b>glycolipids.</b> The ONAP strains did not recognize other <b>glycolipids</b> of the globoseries. In contrast, the pap-like clones also showed weak binding to globotriaosylceramide and reacted weakly with Gal alpha 1 [...] 4 Gal beta-latex beads. We suggest that the pap-like and ONAP adhesins recognize an epitope shared by the globo-A and Forssman structures, e. g., terminal GalNAc alpha 1 [...] 3 bound to Gal alpha 1 [...] 4 Gal beta-containing <b>glycolipids...</b>|$|R
40|$|Process {{parameters}} for {{the extraction of}} <b>glycolipids</b> by scCO(2) from Lactobacillus plantarum B- 01 were optimized by carrying out a two-level fractional design experiment. The highest <b>glycolipids</b> extract yield was obtained at 250 bar, 40 degrees C, CO 2 flow rate, 10 g/min and hydrometanolic co-solvent, 9. 3 % (v/v). In the lipid extracts the carbohydrate moiety of <b>glycolipids</b> and in phospholipids phosphorus moiety were quantified and compared to the reference material isolated by classical organic solvent extraction. By TLC four groups of <b>glycolipids</b> were identified. A two step scCO(2) extraction process was established, whereby the second step yielded seven times more of <b>glycolipids</b> and four times more of phospholipids than in the extracts obtained with organic solvents. Prolonged scCO(2) extraction to 9 h resulted in 620 mu g of <b>glycolipids</b> and 875 mu g of phospholipids in a mg of extract in comparison to (1. 5 h) 55 mu g and 15 mu g of <b>glycolipids</b> and phospholipids, respectively.

40|$|Mycoplasma pneumoniae lipids were {{fractionated}} by combined {{silicic acid}} and diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. The lipid fractions were tested for complement-fixing activity and for blocking of metabolism-inhibiting antibodies in human and rabbit antisera to M. pneumoniae. Thin-layer chromatography and carbohydrate analysis of hydrolysates of the lipid fractions indicated that <b>glycolipids</b> {{were responsible for}} the specific serological activities of the lipid extracts of the organism. Phosphatidylglycerol, which accompanied the <b>glycolipids,</b> was serologically inactive when isolated free from <b>glycolipids.</b> Phosphatidylglycerol considerably enhanced the serological activity of the <b>glycolipids,</b> serving as an auxiliary lipid. Because of this auxiliary effect, minute quantities of contaminating <b>glycolipids</b> sufficed to render serological activity to “purified” phosphatidylgylcerol preparations, providing an explanation to the previous identification of the active lipid as a phospholipid...|$|R
25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} <b>glycolipid</b> receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum. In {{order for the}} A subunit to reach its target, a disulfide bond between the A1 and A2 domain must be broken. This breakage is catalyzed by a protein disulfide isomerase {{that is in the}} endoplasmic reticulum. Following separation, the A1 domain unfolds and is redirected back to the cytosol where it refolds and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of certain G protein alpha subunits. In doing so, the downstream effects of the G protein signal transduction pathway is disrupted by activating adenylate cyclase. This causes a higher concentration of cAMP in the cell, which disrupts the regulation of ion transport mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Amastigotes of L. donovani enter macrophages via a Rac1- and Arf6-dependent process, and {{are found}} in {{phagocytic}} vacuoles that interact with endosomes and lysosomes and acquire lysosomal features. During phagocytosis by macrophages, the promastigotes inhibit {{the formation of the}} phagolysosome, a cellular product by which invading pathogens are removed. The promastigote can do this using its <b>glycolipid</b> lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on its cell membrane. LPG causes disorganisation of F-actin and disruption of phagosomal lipid microdomains. They are capable of evading the microbicidal actions of macrophages, which can kill ordinary pathogens using reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates. They effectively subvert the production of reactive oxygen species. In this way the amastigotes are able to survive and replicate inside these primary immune systems. The parasites manipulate the cell signalling pathway of the macrophages, such as down-regulating of Jak/stat signalling, NO and TNF-α production, and also by blocking the NF-κB-dependent pathway. There are two major mechanisms of immune evasion such as induction of immune suppressive IL-10 responses and the generation of poor and functionally impaired CD8(+) T-cell responses.|$|E
500|$|PrPC is {{a normal}} protein found on the {{membranes}} of cells. It has 209 amino acids (in humans), one disulfide bond, a molecular mass of 35–36 kDa and a mainly alpha-helical structure. Several topological forms exist; one cell surface form anchored via <b>glycolipid</b> and two transmembrane forms. The normal protein is not sedimentable; meaning that it cannot be separated by centrifuging techniques. Its function is a complex issue that continues to be investigated. PrPC binds copper (II) ions with high affinity. The significance of this finding is not clear, but it is presumed to relate to PrP structure or function. PrPC is readily digested by proteinase K and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) <b>glycolipid</b> anchor. [...] PrP {{has been reported to}} play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling in vivo, and may therefore be involved in cell-cell communication in the brain.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, Porifera {{are showing}} {{to be one}} of the richest source of new <b>glycolipids.</b> Many <b>glycolipids</b> from marine sponges, even though {{belonging}} to the wide class of glycosphingolipids, have unusual structure, such as the immunostimulating alpha-galactosyl-glycosphingolipids from Agelas species or the immunosuppressive plakoside A (1) and B from Plakortis simplex. In addition, marine sponges contain a number of atypical <b>glycolipids,</b> without counterpart among <b>glycolipids</b> from other phyla. For example, simplexides (2) are glycoside of a very-long-chain secondary alcohol, whereas plaxyloside (3) possesses a linear polyisoprenoid aglycon and a carbohydrate chain composed of six linearly arranged xylopyranose units.

40|$|Two novel <b>glycolipids,</b> docosanyl 3 -O-methyl [...] rhamnopyranoside and docosanyl 3 -O-methylxylopyranoside, were {{identified}} as the most abundant GC-amenable components of extracts of sediments of Ace Lake, an Antarctic meromictic lake. Docosanyl 3 -O-methyl [...] rhamnopyranoside was identified by isolation and high-field two-dimensional NMR techniques. Docosanyl 3 -O-methylxylopyranoside was tentatively identified by characterisation of its sugar moiety by methanolysis and demethylation. Both <b>glycolipids</b> also have a minor homologue, containing a C 24 instead of a C 22 n-alkyl chain. Stable carbon isotope measurements indicate that the sugar moieties of these <b>glycolipids</b> are ca. 8 9 enriched relative to the alkyl chains. Concentrations increased markedly with depth reaching 2 mg/g sediment at 25 cm depth. Structurally related <b>glycolipids</b> occur in specialised cells of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, so a cyanobacterial origin is suggested for these sedimentary <b>glycolipids...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study of}} <b>glycolipids</b> from sponges is quite recent. Earlier investigators {{have probably been}} discouraged by the difficulty of obtain pure <b>glycolipids,</b> when the standard techniques for the isolation of natural products are used. In addition, up to the early 1990 s structure elucidation of <b>glycolipids</b> required specific skills, being largely based on chemical degradation, {{in contrast with the}} spectroscopic techniques largely used for other classes of natural products. Actually, Porifera are one of the richest source of new <b>glycolipids.</b> Many glycosphingolipids (GSLs) from marine sponges have unique structures, such as the immunostimulating alpha-galactosyl-GSLs from Agelas species, the immunosuppressive plakoside A and B from Plakortis simplex, or ectyoceramide, a galactofuranosyl ceramide from Ectyoplasia ferox. In addition, marine sponges contain a number of atypical <b>glycolipids,</b> without counterpart among <b>glycolipids</b> from other phyla.

40|$|Under nitrogen-depleted conditions, N 2 -fixing {{cyanobacteria}} of {{the order}} Nostocales and Stigonematales differentiate vegetative cells into heterocysts. The cell envelope of these specialized cells contains unique <b>glycolipids,</b> consisting of a sugar moiety glycosidically bound to long-chain diols, triols and hydroxyketones. Only few reports have been published on these <b>glycolipids</b> in cultured cyanobacteria and none has reported them in natural environments.
