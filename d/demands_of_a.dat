5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic {{through the tunnel}} would rise on {{the completion of the}} M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels {{would not be able to}} cope with the full <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> completed M25.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Dunne {{moved to}} New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed {{to satisfy the}} <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} audience. In January 1900, just {{before he left the}} Journal, he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the Journal.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} reasons put forth {{as to why}} Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The Council's {{official}} reasoning {{was that they were}} unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council may have thought that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully. The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third theory is that the Council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few members of Congress.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{preliminary}} draft paper is to identify a framework for studying demand in hierarchical networks. <b>A</b> specific choice <b>of</b> technical conditions are given for precisely formulating four equivalent well-known ways to specify the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buyer: by a demand function, an inverse demand function, a valuation function, or a demand set. Unimodality (or quasi-concavity) <b>of</b> profit is <b>a</b> basic property insuring the ability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seller to find a profit maximizing operating point. Conditions on the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buyer are identified which insure that the profit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> seller with fixed production cost is <b>a</b> unimodality function, <b>of</b> either the price set or quantity sold. Five methods are identified for aggregating the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> buyer, and three methods are indentified for combining competing sellers. ...|$|R

They were given one opportunity to change their ratios once the season had started, but any subsequent changes would have incurred a grid penalty.|$|E

Internally at UNDP, which was facing increased competition from the World Bank in its areas of responsibility such as capacity building, governance and emergency recovery, he tried to re orient UNDP's activities (sometimes controversially), because of competition with other UN agencies who were also adapting to the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> globalising world.

As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops.|$|E

In December 1952, Dayan was promoted to chief of the Operations (G) Branch, the second most senior General Staff post. One of Dayan's actions in this post was to commence work on the canal diverting water from the River Jordan, September 1953.|$|E

25|$|Many views value unity as a good: to {{go beyond}} eudaimonia by saying that an {{individual}} person's flourishing is valuable only {{as a means to}} the flourishing of society as a whole. In other words, a single person's life is, ultimately, not important or worthwhile in itself, but is good only as a means to the success of society as a whole. Some elements of Confucianism are an example of this, encouraging the view that people ought to conform as individuals to <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peaceful and ordered society.|$|E
25|$|With the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large {{home and}} four young boys to raise, Mulligan's mother hired an African-American nanny named Lily Rose, who became {{especially}} {{fond of the}} youngest Mulligan. As he became older, Mulligan began spending time at Rose's house and was especially amused by Rose's player piano, which Mulligan later recalled as having rolls by numerous players, including Fats Waller. Black musicians sometimes came through town, and because many motels would not take them, they often had to stay at homes within the black community. The young Mulligan occasionally met such musicians staying at Rose's home.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the Pakistani {{government}} implemented an autonomy {{package for}} Gilgit-Baltistan, which entails rights {{similar to those}} of Pakistan’s other provinces. Gilgit-Baltistan thus gains province-like status without actually being conferred such status constitutionally. Direct rule by Islamabad has been replaced by an elected legislative assembly under a chief minister. The 2009 reform has not satisfied locals who demand citizenship rights and it has continued to leave Gilgit Baltistan's constitutional status within Pakistan undefined; although it has added to the self-identification of the territory. According to Antia Mato Bouzas, the PPP-led Pakistani government had attempted a compromise between its official position on Kashmir and the <b>demands</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> population where the majority may have pro-Pakistan sentiments.|$|E
