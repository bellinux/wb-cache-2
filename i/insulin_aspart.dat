40|$|Aim: Type II {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) {{increases the risk}} of cardiovascular disease. Treatment with insulin substantially reduces C - reactive protein (CRP) because of its anti-atherosclerotic action. This study was designed to explore and compare the cardio protective role of regular human <b>insulin</b> (RHI), <b>aspart</b> and lispro <b>insulin</b> in type II DM. Materials and Methods: A randomized, open, parallel group, comparative clinical study was conducted on 90 patients of type II DM. After baseline clinical assessment and investigations, RHI was prescribed to 30 patients, <b>aspart</b> <b>insulin</b> to 30 patients and lispro insulin to another 30 patients for 12 weeks. The efficacy variables were change in blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid profile, serum potassium, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and UKPDS 10 -year CHD risk scoring over 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the patients were followed up and changes in variables from baseline were analyzed by statistical tools. Results: Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in aspart group (P = 0. 008) whereas diastolic blood pressure was decreased significantly both in aspart (P < 0. 001) and lispro group (P = 0. 01). Fasting, postprandial blood glucose and HbA 1 c were decreased in all three groups significantly but change in aspart group was superior (P = 0. 01). Triglyceride was significantly better controlled by lispro (P < 0. 01) whereas <b>aspart</b> <b>insulin</b> was superior to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (P < 0. 05). The extent of potassium loss was significantly more with RHI (P = 0. 004) than others.

40|$|Candis M Morello 1, 21 Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego, 2 School of Pharmacy, University of California San Francisco, Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USAIntroduction: The goal {{of insulin}} therapy in {{patients}} with either type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) is to match {{as closely as possible}} normal physiologic insulin secretion to control fasting and postprandial plasma glucose. Modifications of the insulin molecule have resulted in two long-acting insulin analogs (glargine and detemir) and three rapid-acting <b>insulins</b> (<b>aspart,</b> lispro, and glulisine) with improved pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles. These agents can be used together in basal-bolus therapy to more closely mimic physiologic insulin secretion patterns. Methods: This study reviews effects of the multiple demographic and clinical parameters in the insulin analogs glargine, detemir, lispro, aspart, and glulisine {{in patients with}} T 2 DM. A search was conducted on PubMed for each major topic considered (effects of injection site, age, race/ethnicity, obesity, renal or hepatic dysfunction, pregnancy, exercise, drug interactions) using the topic words and name of each type of insulin analog. Information was also obtained from the prescribing information for each insulin analog. Results: The PK/PD profiles for insulin analogs may be influenced by many variables including age, weight, and hepatic and renal function. However, these variables do not have equivalent effects on all long-acting or rapid-acting insulin analogs. Conclusion: Rapid-acting and long-acting insulin analogs represent major advances in treatment for patients with T 2 DM who require insulin therapy. However, there are potentially important PK and PD differences between the two long-acting agents and among the three rapid-acting insulin analogs, which should be considered when designing treatment regimens for special patient groups.

5000|$|Slight {{variations}} of the human insulin molecule are called insulin analogues, (technically [...] "insulin receptor ligands") so named {{because they are not}} technically insulin, rather they are analogues which retain the hormone's glucose management functionality. They have absorption and activity characteristics not currently possible with subcutaneously injected insulin proper. They are either absorbed rapidly in an attempt to mimic real beta cell insulin (as with insulin lispro, <b>insulin</b> <b>aspart,</b> and insulin glulisine), or steadily absorbed after injection instead of having a 'peak' followed by a more or less rapid decline in insulin action (as with insulin detemir and insulin glargine), all while retaining insulin's glucose-lowering action in the human body. However, a number of meta-analyses, including those done by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2005, Germany's Institute for Quality and Cost Effectiveness in the Health Care Sector IQWiG released in 2007, and the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH) also released in 2007 have shown no unequivocal advantages in clinical use of insulin analogues over more conventional insulin types.|$|E
