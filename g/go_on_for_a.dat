5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

I think it's {{important}} {{that any of}} the companies engaged in promoting these types of goods have some sense of responsibility and also some sensitivity to the feelings of others. I think this is an immensely difficult area, the relationship between what happens with these games and its impact on young people. I've no doubt this debate will <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> significant period of time, but I do agree. I think it is important that people understand there is a wider social responsibility as well as an interior responsibility for profits." ...|$|E

[...] Naturally athletic, she began playing tennis and became one of the best players around the local country clubs.|$|E
500|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, mating {{takes place}} in late summer and early autumn. Tropical bats may mate during the dry season. After copulation, the male may leave behind a mating plug to insure his paternity. In hibernating species, males are known mate with females in torpor. Female bats {{use a variety of}} strategies to control the timing of pregnancy and the birth of young, to make delivery coincide with maximum food ability and other ecological factors. Females of some species have delayed fertilization, in which sperm is stored in the reproductive tract for several months after mating. While mating occurs in the fall fertilization does not occur until the following spring. Other species exhibit delayed implantation, in which the egg is fertilized after mating, but remains free in the reproductive tract until external conditions become favorable for giving birth and caring for the offspring. In another strategy, fertilization and implantation both occur, but development of the fetus is delayed until favorable conditions prevail, during the delayed development the mother still gives the fertilized egg nutrients, and oxygenated blood to keep it alive. However, this process can <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long period of time, because of the advanced gas exchange system.|$|E
