40|$|AbstractObjective: Uteroglobin is {{a protein}} with potent {{anti-inflammatory}} and immunomodulatory effects. We hypothesize that induction of uteroglobin {{expression in the}} artery wall by local adenoviral gene transfer will decrease neointimal hyperplasia in the rat carotid artery after balloon injury. Methods: Seven male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent balloon injury of the common carotid artery. After the injury, with flow occluded, the artery was instilled with 50 μL of the adenoviral vector encoding uteroglobin gene (Ad. UG) at a concentration of 1. 35 × 1011 pfu/mL (n = 7) or 0. 68 × 1011 pfu/mL (n = 7) (n = 7). Control animals were similarly treated: either an adenovirus encoding for β-galactosidase gene (Ad. LacZ) at 1 × 1011 pfu/mL (n = 7) or the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle (n = 6) was used. The solution was allowed to dwell for 20 minutes. The rats were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> after 14 days by perfusion fixation, and the carotid arteries were sectioned for analysis with computerized planimetry. The intima-media area ratios were calculated for each artery and compared with analysis of variance with Bonferroni/Dunn post hoc testing. One additional rat from the PBS, Ad. LacZ, and Ad. UG (1. 35 × 1011 pfu/mL) groups was <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> 4 days after treatment for carotid artery protein extraction and Western blotting. Results: Uteroglobin protein production was confirmed in the Ad. UG-treated arteries with Western blotting. Morphometric analysis showed that the Ad. UG group at 1. 35 × 1011 pfu/mL had a significantly lower intima-media area ratio than both the Ad. LacZ (P =. 002) and PBS (P =. 004) controls. The Ad. UG group at 0. 68 × 1011 pfu/mL was also {{significantly different from the}} Ad. LacZ (P =. 003) and PBS (P =. 006) controls. There was no statistical difference between the two control groups or between the two Ad. UG groups. Conclusion: Adenoviral gene transfer of uteroglobin, delivered intraluminally after arterial injury causes the production of uteroglobin protein and has an inhibitory effect on neointimal accumulation in the rat model.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to ultrastructurally examine the {{influence}} of simvastatin on bone healing in surgically created defects in rat mandibles. Study design. Bone defects 0. 8 mm in diameter were created in the buccal aspect of first mandibular molar roots and filled with 2. 5 % simvastatin gel, while the controls were allowed to heal spontaneously. The rats were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> 7, 9, 11, or 14 days postoperatively, and the specimens were processed for scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as for colloidal gold immunolabeling of osteopontin. Results. The regenerated alveolar bone in the simvastatin-treated defects presented smaller marrow spaces, and the collagen fibrils were regularly packed exhibiting a lamellar bone aspect. Osteopontin was present through the bone matrix during the wound healing and alveolar bone regeneration. Conclusion. The present study provides evidence that a single topical application of 2. 5 % simvastatin gel improves the quality of the new bone and decreases bone resorption.

This study compared lambs given two different amounts (x 1 and x 1. 5) of the same urea-supplemented diet.

In contrast half of the H. contortus infected lambs on this dietary allowance had to be <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> {{before the end of the}} experiment due to severe anaemia and anorexia. All infected lambs on this dietary allowance showed decreased mean red cell volumes and decreased plasma albumin concentrations indicating inadequate replacement of red blood cells and plasma proteins last during the infection. The remaining lambs were offered proportionately 0. 5 more of the same dietary allowance. Among lambs an this dietary allowance, there were very few differences between uninfected and infected sheep in clinical signs and growth rate. Therefore, dietary allowances that are adequate for uninfected lambs are not necessarily sufficient for infected lambs. As nearly all grazing lambs are infected with nematodes, dietary recommendations should take parasitic infection and its nutritional demands into account...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Porcine torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) {{is a small}} {{icosahedral}} and non-enveloped virus {{which contains}} a single-stranded (ssDNA), circular and negative DNA genome and infects mainly vertebrates and is currently classified into the 'floating' genus Anellovirus of Circoviridae with two species. Viral DNA of both porcine TTSuV species has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes {{of the same species}} has been documented in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, there exists no information about histopathological lesions caused by infection with porcine TTSuV 2. Methods Porcine liver tissue homogenate with 1 ml of 6. 91 × 10 7 genomic copies viral loads of porcine TTSuV 2 that had positive result for torque teno sus virus type 2 and negative result for torque teno sus virus type 1 and porcine pseudorabies virus type 2 were used to inoculate specific pathogen-free piglets by intramuscular route and <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21 and 24 days post inoculation (dpi), the control pigs were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of sterile DMEM and <b>humanely</b> <b>killed</b> {{the end of the study}} for histopathological examination routinely processed, respectively. Results All porcine TTSuV 2 inoculated piglets were clinic asymptomatic but developed myocardial fibroklasts and endocardium, interstitial pneumonia, membranous glomerular nephropathy, and modest inflammatory cells infiltration in portal areas in the liver, foci of hemorrhage in some pancreas islet, a tiny amount red blood cells in venule of muscularis mucosae and outer longitudinal muscle, rarely red blood cells in the microvasculation and infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and eosinophils) of tonsil and hilar lymph nodes, infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes and necrosis or degeneration and focal gliosis of lymphocytes in the paracortical zone after inoculation with porcine TTSuV 2 -containing tissue homogenate. Conclusions Analysis of these presentations revealed that porcine TTSuV 2 was readily transmitted to TTSuV-negative swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in specific pathogen-free piglets inoculated with porcine TTSuV 2. Those results indicated no markedly histopathological changes happened in those parenchymatous organs, especially the digestive system and immune system when the specific pathogen-free pigs were infected with porcine TTSuV 2, hence, to some extent, it was not remarkable pathological agent for domestic pigs at least. So, porcine TTSuV 2 could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious etiology of swine. This study indicated a directly related description of lesions responsible for TTSuV 2 infection in swine. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Rat {{models of}} peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) {{are useful for}} studying the physiology of peritoneal transport and evaluating new osmotic agents. Intraperitoneal (IP) solute concentrations and their evolution over time are easy to measure, but IP volume (IPV) is not. Direct volumetric measurements are the "gold standard;' but they are expensive and do not allow for repetitive measurements in the same animal. The indicator dilution technique is therefore used as an alternative. However, that technique is based on assumptions that are not always valid. The present study compares direct volume measurement with the indicator dilution technique [radioiodinated serum albumin (RISA) ] to determine the IPV over time curves in a rat model of PD. Methods: In series 1, 17 Sprague-Dawley rats were instilled IP with 25 mL 1. 36 % glucose dialysate through a Teflon catheter. In 9 animals, 0. 35 mL dialysate was sampled and discarded at time points 0, 3, 15, 30, 60, 180, and 240 minutes. In the other 8 animals, no sampling was performed. At 240 minutes, all 12 animals were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed,</b> and direct volumetric measurements of IPV were performed. In series 2, rats were instilled IP with 25 mL 1. 36 % glucose dialysate containing 18. 5 kBq I- 131 RISA. In 9 animals, dialysate was sampled at 0, 3, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes {{for the construction of}} the RISA concentration-over-time curve, and to calculate the elimination constant K-e. At 30, 60, 180, and 240 minutes, dialysate was sampled in 6 different animals (total n = 24) to calculate IPV using the RISA dilution technique. Immediately afterward, the animals were <b>humanely</b> <b>killed,</b> and direct volumetric measurements of IPV were performed. Results: In series 1, after 240 minutes' dwell time, the IPV was lower in the sampled animals as compared with the non sampled animals (27. 11 +/- 1. 85 mL vs 30. 75 +/- 0. 59 mL, p = 0. 001). In series 2, the evolution of RISA activity in the dialysate over time was described by piece-wise linear regression, yielding 3288 - 8. 2 T counts (cts) for T 52. 72 minutes. The IPV was better predicted with a K-e that took into account the disappearance of RISA by sampling than with a K-e that took into account disappearance of RISA only by absorption. Conclusions: If indicator dilution techniques are used to measure IPV, attention must be paid to the disappearance of the osmotic agent and the marker by multiple sampling. The best way to meet that goal is to use micropipettes to avoid large sample volumes...|$|R
