5|$|When Rovio {{began writing}} new {{versions}} of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, they observed {{the large number of}} configurations of <b>device</b> <b>types</b> and {{versions of the}} Android software. The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E

25|$|The SDC {{device is}} {{operational}} immediately after fabrication. Switching {{occurs in the}} Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, are found. The three layers consisting of Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver-source layer is not {{in direct contact with}} the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly higher processing and operating temperatures (above 250°C and at least 150°C, respectively) since silver does not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains a high glass transition temperature (~350°C). These processing and operating temperatures are higher than most ion-conducting chalcogenide <b>device</b> <b>types,</b> including the S-based glasses (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It is a combination of these factors that allow the SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, including long-term continuous operation at 150°C.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{original}} two <b>device</b> <b>types,</b> the [...] "Spindt array", used silicon-integrated-circuit (IC) fabrication techniques to make regular arrays in which molybdenum cones were deposited in small cylindrical voids in an oxide film, with the void covered by a counterelectrode with a central circular aperture. This overall geometry has also been used with carbon nanotubes grown in the void.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{thyristor}} {{devices were}} released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control {{a relatively large}} amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from light dimmers and electric motor speed control to high-voltage direct current power transmission. Thyristors {{may be used in}} power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc. [...] Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer <b>device</b> <b>types</b> can be turned on and off through the control gate signal. [...] The latter is known as a gate turn-off thyristor, or GTO thyristor. [...] A thyristor is not a proportional device like a transistor. In other words, a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.|$|E
