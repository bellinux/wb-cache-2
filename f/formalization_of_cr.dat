However, two additional options {{are available in}} such countries: <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> self-governing village councils and <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> community development councils (CDCs). We designed a survey experiment in Afghanistan that compares the consequences of elections to establish village councils to each alternative. We find that elections, {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> CDCs, improve support for democracy, while <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> customary councils improves support for reconciliation with the Taliban. Moreover, the consequences of transplanting elections are contingent on social norms and institutions supportive of democracy...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the limitations of state-of-the-art simulation based probabilistic analysis, we propose to perform probabilistic analysis within the environment of a higher-order-logic theorem prover. The foremost requirement for conducting such analysis is the <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> probability distributions. In this report, we present a methodology for the <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> continuous probability distributions for which the inverse of the cumulative distribution function can be expressed in a closed mathematical form. Our methodology is primarily based on the <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> the Standard Uniform random variable, cumulative distribution function properties and the Inverse Transform method. The report presents all this formalization using the HOL theorem prover. In order to illustrate the practical effectiveness of our methodology, the <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> a few continuous probability distributions has also been included. 1...|$|R

30|$|According to {{the theory}} of shared {{understanding}} [1], the <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> a process in a software project helps reduce the overall complexity, and once the stakeholders are familiarized with the process itself, they can make assumptions on parts of the organizations that are unfamiliar to them. Paraphrasing Aranda [1], the <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> the release process in a FOSS ecosystem, enables the coordination of a large group of people, and allows the ecosystem to grow. However, this <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> processes in our study is constrained to the management of the release process, not how each project develops its own software.|$|R

Then we can tell whether a given set with a binary operation is a group or not, and derive all properties of groups constructively from these inference rules as well as the axioms of the set theory. The <b>formalization</b> <b>of</b> all other concepts in abstract algebra is based on that of the group.
