5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>encephalitis</b> {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Histopathologically, <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus type 1 causes hemorrhagic necrosis. Overt {{hemorrhage}} is infrequent in <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> but {{can lead}} to poor outcomes. This report describes a successfully treated case of <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> associated with subarachnoid bleeding in which real-time polymerase chain reaction was useful for diagnosis. Case presentation A 30 -year-old previously healthy Japanese woman who had fever and headache for five days presented with disorganised speech, unusual behavior and delusional thinking. Real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification of <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus type 1 in cerebrospinal fluid was positive (38, 000 copies/mL) and antivirus treatment was started. During {{the course of her}} illness, the level of her consciousness decreased in association with desaturation and tachycardia. Thrombosis of the right pulmonary artery trunk with pulmonary embolism was evident on enhanced chest computed tomography. In addition, cranial computed tomography revealed subarachnoid and intraventricular bleeding. Intravenous heparin (12, 000 U/day) was started and the dose was adjusted according to the activated partial thromboplastin time for about a month (maximum dose of heparin, 20, 400 U/day). After the treatments, her Glasgow coma score increased and the thrombosis of the pulmonary artery trunk had disappeared. Conclusions The present case {{raises the question of whether}} anticoagulant treatment is safe in patients with <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> complicated by subarachnoid bleeding. </p...|$|R
25|$|Different {{diseases}} and disorders {{can affect the}} biological workings of semantic memory. A variety of {{studies have been done}} in an attempt to determine the effects on varying aspects of semantic memory. For example, Lambon, Lowe, & Rogers (2007) studied the different effects semantic dementia and <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> have on semantic memory. They found that semantic dementia has a more generalized semantic impairment. Additionally, deficits in semantic memory as a result of <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> tend to have more category-specific impairments. Other disorders that affect semantic memory - such as Alzheimer's disease - has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects. Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of semantic knowledge (Koenig et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|Klüver-Bucy {{syndrome}} {{was first}} documented among certain humans {{who had experienced}} temporal lobectomy in 1955 by H. Terzian and G.D. Ore. It was first noted in a human with meningoencephalitis in 1975 by Marlowe et al. Klüver-Bucy syndrome can manifest after either of these (lobectomies can be medically required by such reasons as accidents or tumors), but may also appear in humans with acute <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>encephalitis</b> or following a stroke. Other conditions may also contribute to a diagnosis of Klüver-Bucy syndrome, including Pick Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, ischemia, anoxia, progressive subcortical gliosis, Rett syndrome, porphyria and carbon monoxide poisoning, among others.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of limbic encephalitis {{is extremely difficult}} and it is usual for the diagnosis to be delayed for weeks.

Some of the rarer auto-antibodies (e.g., NMDAR) have no commercially available assay and can only be measured by {{a very small number}} of research laboratories worldwide, further delaying diagnosis by weeks or months. Most patients with limbic encephalitis are initially diagnosed with <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> because the two syndromes cannot be distinguished clinically.

5000|$|<b>Herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (HSE) is a viral {{infection}} of the human central nervous system. It is estimated to affect at least 1 in 500,000 individuals per year and some studies suggest an incidence rate of 5.9 cases per 100,000 live births. The majority of cases of herpes encephalitis are caused by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), the same virus that causes cold sores. 57% of American adults are infected with HSV-1, [...] which is spread through droplets, casual contact, and sometimes sexual contact, though most infected people never have cold sores. About 10% of cases of herpes encephalitis are due to HSV-2, which is typically spread through sexual contact.

5000|$|This {{disorder}} is usually acquired {{in one of}} four ways: One cause is benzodiazepine drugs such as; midazolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and nimetazepam; {{all of which are}} known to have powerful amnesic effects.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground There is evidence that the current clinical management of serious acute neurological infections is suboptimal [1 - 3]. Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain tissue, is most commonly caused by <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus in the United Kingdom (UK) [4, 5]. When <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> is treated promptly with aciclovir, there is a significant improvement in patient outcomes [6, 7].

Whilst <b>herpes</b> <b>simplex</b> virus <b>encephalitis</b> is relatively rare [5], clinical presentations including features con-sistent with suspected encephalitis occur relatively fre-quently but in different ways to other brain injuries. Encephalitis typically presents with one or more of headache, fever, new-onset seizures, altered conscious-ness, and behavioural disturbances [11].
