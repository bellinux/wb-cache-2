6000|$|I woke with {{stiff and}} cramped muscles from having slept {{long on the}} incommodious seat of a day coach. I leaned {{my head against the}} seat and tried to think. After a long time I said to myself: [...] "I must have a name of some sort." [...] I searched my pockets. Not a card; not a letter; not a paper or {{monogram}} could <b>I</b> <b>find.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>found</b> in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in bills of large denomination. [...] "I must be some one, of course," [...] I repeated to myself, and began again to consider.|$|R
60|$|Rod. Julia has reason, if she love him; yet, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> cannot bear it. [Aside.|$|R
60|$|Mar. No, sir, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am a {{trouble to}} you; You will not hear my suit.|$|R
60|$|Isab. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> must be troubled {{with this}} idle talk some minutes more, but 'tis your last.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he declared. [...] "It {{concerns}} me vitally to understand you. You were {{good enough to}} wish that <b>I</b> should <b>find</b> happiness. <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> the possibility of it--in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} scolding Cawthorn without a cause, as <b>I</b> <b>found</b> two [...] parcels with two letters from you on my return to Malta. By these it [...] appears {{you have not}} {{received}} a letter from Constantinople, addressed [...] to Longman's, but it was of no consequence.|$|R
60|$|Sir Mart. Well, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am {{a miserable}} man: I have lost my mistress, and may thank myself for it.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} in an enigmatic sentence which impressed {{me so much}} that <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> entered it verbatim in my notebook.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I?" [...] he replied. [...] "Ah, I {{dare say}} I did. Deuce take me," [...] he added, suddenly, [...] "I know <b>I</b> did. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am not quite {{unscrewed}} yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Ant. When {{that day}} comes, I must take my revenge, and turn {{gardener}} again; for <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am much given to planting.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{afterwards}} when I {{could go}} alone <b>I</b> couldn't <b>find</b> it. <b>I</b> never <b>found</b> it. <b>I</b> seem {{now to have}} been always looking for it through my school-boy days, but I never came upon it--never." ...|$|R
60|$|Cand. Reason, like foreign foes, would ne'er o'ercome, But that <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am betrayed at home; You have a friend, that {{fights for}} you within.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> {{have still}} {{an hour to}} spare this morning before my {{conveyance}} goes away, I will give you [...] "Nannie, O", at length.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{afterwards}} when I {{could go}} alone <b>I</b> couldn't <b>find</b> it. <b>I</b> never <b>found</b> it. <b>I</b> seem {{now to have}} been always looking for it through my school-boy days, but I've never come upon it again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ya sujt-on tel me la j-tae [...] ("Ill return <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it/when <b>I</b> {{will have}} <b>found</b> it") ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Prism. I think, dear Doctor, I {{will have}} a stroll with you. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> have a {{headache}} after all, and a walk might do it good.|$|R
6000|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. A very {{agreeable}} age {{to associate}} with, <b>I</b> <b>find.</b> <b>I</b> am recovering rapidly. I {{have a sense}} of blossoming like a flower. May I ask your name? ...|$|R
6000|$|Hip. Some {{other time}} be it; but, sir, remember, [...] That I both seek and much entreat your friendship; [...] For, next to women, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> can love you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, none--none at all, on'y <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> must sail this afternoon, an' I've took a fancy to you, an' hope you've made up {{your mind}} to ship with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Vergil Gunch {{interrupted}} harshly, [...] "I {{wonder if}} you are so conservative? <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds like Doane in it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hip. Indeed I {{think it}} was, but I repent it; [...] The fault {{was only in}} my blood, for now [...] 'Tis gone, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> do not love so many.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{recognize}} terror as {{the finest}} emotion and so I {{will try to}} terrorize the reader. But if <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that <b>I</b> cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that <b>I</b> cannot horrify, I'll go for the gross-out. I'm not proud." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{you have}} a spite against Carson, and you wish to get him into trouble. I used to think you a fair and square man, Hardwick, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am mistaken." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{undertake}} to {{tell the}} best, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> cannot, My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots, My breath will not be obedient to its organs, I become a dumb man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Thorn, {{giving his}} name. [...] "Make {{a note to}} tell him he need not call on me to-morrow. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am unable to do what he requires." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More am I," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> am dining {{with the}} Prime Minister at nine o'clock. It {{occurs to me}} that you may have some {{influence}} with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not frightened, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> must {{go down to}} {{the station}} again. Just run up and put on your bonnet. It will be a nice little walk for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hip. You {{need not}} doubt it: Alas! <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> cannot, if I would: I am but freed to {{be a greater}} slave: [Aside. How much am I obliged, sir, to your valour! ...|$|R
60|$|Rod. Too late <b>I</b> <b>find,</b> <b>I</b> wronged {{her in my}} thoughts. I'm {{every way}} A wretched man:-- Something we must resolve on, ere we sleep; Draw in the bed, I feel the cold.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot tell till I {{have thought}} it all over. If, on reflection, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; {{but it was not}} right." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have done}} {{no more to}} my fables. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> must let things take their time. I am {{constant}} to my schemes; but I must work at them fitfully as the humour moves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thankee," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "you 'ave been quick. I wish I could move {{as quick as}} you do. But you can take 'em back now, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> can do without 'em." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{admitted}} the straw man, [...] "I've been considerable of a traveler, in my time, and I like to explore strange places. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> learn much more by traveling than by staying at home." ...|$|R
60|$|I thought I had no heart. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>I</b> have, and a heart doesn't suit me. Somehow it doesn't go {{with modern}} dress. It makes one look old, and it spoils one's career at {{critical}} moments.|$|R
