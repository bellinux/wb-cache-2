40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 8, 790 firm-years between 1993 and 1998, I examine {{investment}} policies of firms in Japanese <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> relative to independent firms. Unlike independent firms, {{there is little evidence}} that group firms' investment is sensitive to ex ante proxies of growth opportunities, and for the most tightly linked firms in the <b>industrial</b> <b>group,</b> there is a negative relation between industry Q and industry-adjusted investment. The difference in the investment pattern for group firms relative to independent firms is directly related to lower excess values for group firms. These findings are consistent with <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> decreasing investment efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the {{research}} of the functioning of financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> on Ukraine’s markets for corporate control and investments. The largest financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> of Ukraine - “Finance & Credit”, “Privat-Invest”, “Ukrsibbank” and “The Industrial Union of Donbass” - were studied during the research. The research revealed the most important criteria that financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> have to meet for the efficient functioning on the Ukrainian markets for corporate control and investments. These are the following criteria: a powerful bank capable of carrying out the function of cash generator within a group; high degree of business diversification; optimum concentration of property; minimal hierarchy of the system of corporate control. The research has studied such criterion as transparency of the structure of property, which is highly valued by the corporate governance in other countries. In Ukraine, the structure of ownership of most of efficiently functioning financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> is not transparent, which is paradoxical. This {{can be explained by the}} lack of proper legislation for protection of property rights, low activity of small shareholders and reluctance of financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> themselves to make transparent the motives of their participation on the market for corporate control...|$|R
