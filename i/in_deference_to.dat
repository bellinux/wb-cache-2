40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the role of {{judicial}} <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> academic decisions <b>in</b> Rehabilitation Act Section 504 and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) actions involving claims that a student is “otherwise qualified” to participate in a program. I initially present in Part II of this article an overview of Section 504 and Titles II and III of the ADA with particular emphasis on their effects on higher education and on judicial interpretations of the “otherwise qualified” standard. In the next section, I review the constitutional and common law principles that courts have relied on <b>in</b> granting <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> academic decisions. Part IV describes the approaches employed by the lower courts <b>in</b> giving <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> academic authorities when program modification claims arise under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. Finally, in Part V, I argue that <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> academic decisions is justified by the incompetence of courts to review academic standards...|$|R
5|$|Catherine {{was first}} {{cared for by}} her {{paternal}} grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of Piero de' Medici). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her duchessina ("the little duchess"), <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. <b>In</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal state.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, after {{pressure}} from the returned soldiers, a second competition was announced. Once again the budget was set at £25,000. As per the first competition, all entrants had to be South Australian British subjects, and all entries were to be judged anonymously, but {{this time there was}} to be only one assessor: John Smith Murdoch, the chief architect for the Commonwealth of Australia. <b>In</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> the previous competition, the top five entrants from 1924 were each given £75 upon the submission of a new design, and all of the designs were insured by the government for £100 each.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} strict Confucian orthodoxy. Upon {{toppling}} the Tây Sơn, he repealed their reforms and reimposed a classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi in the north to Huế in central Vietnam to reflect the southward migration of the population over the preceding centuries. The emperor built new fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, Gia Long modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. <b>In</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Catholic missionaries, something that was increasingly restricted by his successors. Under Gia Long's rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siam from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} vassal. Despite this, he was relatively isolationist in outlook towards European powers.|$|E

5|$|In 1862 {{he visited}} Jamestown to inspect, equip and provide uniforms for the Chautauqua regiment, his first return since infancy, and was welcomed {{by a group}} of {{prominent}} citizens. Shepard recruited and organized the 51st Regiment, New York Volunteers, which was named the Shepard Rifles in his honor. George W. Whitman, brother of the poet Walt Whitman {{and a member of the}} regiment, was notified by Shepard of a promotion; Shepard may have influenced his subsequent promotion to major in 1865. In addition, Shepard was involved in correspondence with Walt Whitman. Although President Abraham Lincoln offered him a promotion to brigadier general, Shepard declined <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> officers who had seen field service; Shepard himself never entered the field. From 1866 to 1868 Shepard served as aide-de-camp to Reuben E. Fenton.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. <b>In</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} {{to report to}} prison on March 18, Farmer was granted a one-week delay by Van Tatenhove to watch his son, Trey, play for Clay County High School in the KHSAA basketball tournament. Clay County lost that game to Covington Catholic High School 80-78 {{in the first round}} of the tournament. Covington Catholic went on to win the KHSAA State Championship. Van Tatenhove insisted that he granted the delay <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> the Farmer family, not as a special favor for Farmer himself. On March 25, 2014, Farmer reported to the satellite camp of the Hazelton prison to begin serving his sentence. He was imprisoned for almost 20 months, transitioned to a halfway house in Lexington on December 18, 2015, and was released on January 21, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal, on {{the night}} of the sixth day after childbirth, a number of items may be placed in the lying-in chamber <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> Shashthi, such as an earthen pitcher of water covered with a napkin, offerings of husked rice, cooked rice, bananas and sweets, bangles, and pieces of gold and silver. A pen and paper are also kept in the room, because it is {{believed}} that Shashthi (or, according to some traditions, Chitragupta or Brahma) comes into the home after everyone is asleep and writes the child's fortune on the paper with invisible ink. In Bihar, the sixth day ceremony is called Chathi or Chati ("sixth") and Shashthi is known by the epithet Chati Mata ("Mother Chati"). A lump of cow dung dressed in red cloth or paper and covered with vermilion, symbolising the goddess, is kept in the lying-in room. Here, the new-born baby is oiled and dressed in new clothes and rings and then named; a feast follows this ceremony. Childless people may perform a vrata (ritual) in worship of Shashthi, called either Chati Mata or Shashthi Vrata, in an effort to conceive.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to common Christian festivals like Christmas, Good Friday, and Easter, the community celebrates many other festivals {{of religious and}} historical significance. Monti Fest {{is one of the}} major festivals, celebrated on 8 September. It combines the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and blessing of Novem (new crops). The festival derives its name from the Monte Mariano Church at Farangipet in South Canara, and was initiated by Fr. Joachim Miranda, a Goan Catholic priest at Farangipet, in 1763. Although Tipu Sultan destroyed the churches of Canara, he spared Monte Mariano Church <b>in</b> <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> the friendship of his father Hyder Ali with Fr. Miranda. Attur Jatre or Attur Fest (Attur festival) is the feast of St. Lawrence, celebrated in the St. Lawrence Shrine on the outskirts of Karkala in South Canara. This shrine, in existence since 1759, is said to have a history of miracles. Evkaristik Purshanv (Eucharistic Procession) is an annual religious procession led by the Bishop of Mangalore from Milagres Church to Rosario Cathedral. The procession, held on the first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar, seeks blessings for the new year.|$|E

On the set during production, Stiers met Gene Roddenberry, the series producer, and was invited to his house to practice scenes with Roddenberry's wife, Majel Barrett.

5000|$|Maimonides {{claims in}} the {{introduction}} to Sefer HaMitzvot, his own prose enumeration of the commandments, that he was motivated to compose that work because of errors <b>in</b> the azharot. <b>Deference</b> <b>to</b> Maimonides' criticism led major rabbis (18th-century Rabbi Haim Yosef David Azoulai 20th-century Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef) to prefer reading Maimonides' prose list to the poetic azharot.

50|$|Finland {{rejected}} Marshall aid, <b>in</b> apparent <b>deference</b> <b>to</b> Soviet desires. However, the United States provided secret {{development aid}} {{and helped the}} (non-Communist) Social Democratic Party in hopes of preserving Finland's independence. Establishing trade with the Western powers, such as the United Kingdom, and paying reparations to the Soviet Union produced a transformation of Finland from a primarily agrarian economy to an industrialised one. For example, the Valmet corporation was founded to create materials for war reparations, but, after the reparations had been paid off, Finland—which was poor in certain resources necessary for an industrialized nation (such as iron and oil)—continued to trade with the Soviet Union {{in the framework of}} bilateral trade.|$|R
