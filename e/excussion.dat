In that everythink was prepayred for my marridge--the {{consent of}} the parents of my Hangelina was gaynd, the lovely gal herself was ready (as I thought) to be led to Himing's halter--the trooso was hordered--the wedding dressis were being phitted hon--a weddinkake {{weighing}} half a tunn was a gettn reddy by Mesurs Gunter of Buckley Square; there was such an account for Shantilly and Honiton laces as would have staggerd hennyboddy (I know they did the Commissioner when I came hup for my Stiffikit), and has for Injar-shawls I bawt a dozen sich fine ones as never was given away--no not by Hiss Iness the Injan Prins Juggernaut Tygore.
