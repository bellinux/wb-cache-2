60|$|The {{country through}} which {{the long line of}} waggons passed was as varied as can well be imagined, being one of the wildest and least {{inhabited}} tracts of the frontier districts. The features of the landscape changed continually from dark jungle to rich park-like scenery, embellished with graceful clumps of evergreens, and from that again to the sterility of savage mountains or parched and desert plains. Sometimes they plodded wearily over the karroo for twenty miles or more at a stretch without seeing a drop of water. At other times they came to a wretched mud hovel, the farm-house of a boer, near a permanent spring of water. Again, they were entangled among the rugged, roadless gorges and precipices of a mountain range, through which no vehicle of <b>European</b> <b>construction</b> could have passed without absolute demolition, and up parts of which the Cape-waggons were sometimes compelled to go by means of two teams,--that is, from twenty to thirty or more oxen,--being attached to each. At other times they had to descend and re-ascend the precipitous banks of rivers whose beds were sometimes quite dry and paved with mighty boulders.|$|E
60|$|From {{the foot}} of the hill we rode for some {{distance}} along a wide valley, with water in several places, and a good deal of cultivated ground. Then, after three or four miles of undulating plain we arrived at our camping-ground at a little after three o’clock. The natives here must be either a more warlike people than those whose villages we have passed since entering the country, or they must have much more warlike neighbours. For the villages are almost always surrounded by strong walls, and one or two were perched on eminences, and defended by walls and towers. One very curious castle we passed strongly resembling the old baronial castles one meets with in southern Scotland and the north of England. This was situated upon the edge of a precipice, and the rocks went sheer down from three sides of its walls for fifty or sixty feet. It must be impregnable in a country like this, where cannon are all but unknown. Another fort, which certainly looked of <b>European</b> <b>construction,</b> and if not must unquestionably have been built from a picture of a European fort, was perched upon {{the top of the mountain}} near where we descended into the valley. The precipice at its foot was at least a thousand feet down, but curiously enough the fort was in a sort of hollow, higher rocks at the distance of only a hundred yards on either side commanding it. If a European designed it, he certainly did not choose its position. It was a round fort, of perhaps fifty feet high, but it was difficult to judge its height from our position on the plain so much below it. Its diameter was about equal to its height. It had regular lines of loopholes, and appeared to have been built by some robber-chief to enable him to swoop down upon the caravans of traders journeying up and down the road we had just come. This camp is at about the same elevation as that at Mai Wahiz, and the climate is even more charming than that of Attegrat, for the heat is less during the day, and the cold last night was not at all equal to that which we experienced there. The on dit is that the King cannot arrive to-day, but will come to-morrow, and that we shall move out early and pitch our camp upon a plain six miles from here, and there receive him properly.|$|E

40|$|Research on EUropean {{democracy}} and integration has {{pointed to the}} <b>construction</b> of <b>European</b> identity and the Europeanisation of national public spheres as means to mitigate the broadly recognized democratic deficit of the European Union. However, as pointed out by Olausson (2010), studies of Europeanisation {{and the impact of}} news media in <b>European</b> identity <b>construction</b> have tended to quantitatively focus on the visibility and frequency of ‘EU topics’ and EU actors in the news. Thereby missing the potentiality of a ‘hidden’ and naturalized <b>European</b> identity <b>construction</b> and legitimation of EU politics. This thesis examines the <b>construction</b> of <b>European</b> identity in the coverage on climate change in Danish news media. Based on public sphere theory, nationalism theory, and identity theory the thesis utilizes a twofold analytical approach; performing both a content analysis of 285 news articles and television broadcasts and a discourse analysis of prominent textual tendencies based primarily on the systemic theory of language. The findings suggest the presence of a naturalized <b>European</b> identity <b>construction</b> in Danish news coverage on climate change where the national identity is transcended and incorporated into the European identity. Thus, the thesis put forward the idea that <b>European</b> identity <b>construction</b> and Europeanisation of national spheres should be understood in terms of - and in relation to - ‘banal transnationalism’. Furthermore, the thesis stresses the importance of studying these phenomena in the issue-specific news coverage such as climate change; future research could look into the topics of environmental politics, energy politics, culture politics and defense politics. Finally the thesis underlines the potential of a combined quantitative and qualitative approach in describing the relationship between collective identity and Europeanisation, which has only been vaguely established by previous studies that use both concepts...|$|R
