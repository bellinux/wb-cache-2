25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E
25|$|The Morayshire Railway was {{the first}} railway to be built north of Aberdeen, in Scotland. It {{received}} royal assent in 1846 but construction did not start until 1851 due to the economic conditions existing in the United Kingdom at the time. The railway was built in two phases with the section from Elgin to Lossiemouth completed in 1852. When the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (<b>I)</b> <b>reached</b> Keith via Elgin, the Morayshire was able to complete the Speyside second phase by connecting the Craigellachie line at Orton. Initially, the Morayshire ran its own locomotives on the I track between Elgin and Orton but this lasted {{only a short time}} and the Morayshire carriages were then hauled to Orton by the I Disagreements with the I eventually forced the Morayshire into building a new section of track between their Elgin station and Rothes and was completed in 1862. The Morayshire completed its final act of enlargement by connecting to the new Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) station in 1863. Crippling debt forced the company into agreeing with the GNoSR for it to take over the running of the track in 1866. When the Morayshire finally managed to greatly reduce its debt, a long sought after amalgamation with the GNoSR finally took place in 1881.|$|E

500|$|The Allied West African Campaign of World War <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Kamerun in 1914. Douala fell on 17 September, and the Germans regrouped at Jaunde. Beti {{informants}} alerted Atangana {{as to the}} Allies' progress, and as {{the loss}} of Jaunde seemed inevitable, Atangana prepared to escape with his masters. He and the chiefs under him gave their posts to weaker relatives so they could more easily take them back should the Germans return. They held out in Jaunde until 1 January 1916, when troops of the British Army captured the town, and the German soldiers and missionaries fled into the forest. Atangana and 72 Ewondo and Bane chiefs, along with 14–20,000 villagers (mostly soldiers and their families), led them through.

500|$|The {{unresolved}} {{question of}} {{what would happen to the}} Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was asked how he would avoid such a problem. His reply, [...] "I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Runcorn, and then I would strike inland", prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. [...] Despite continued opposition, the committee's third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. Certain conditions were attached; £5million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.|$|E

Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what?

500|$|The {{architecture}} is epitomized {{by a combination}} of Romanesque and Gothic Revival buildings spread across the eastern and central portions of campus, most dating between 1858 and 1929. The traditional heart of the university, known as Front Campus, is near the campus centre in an oval lawn enclosed by King's College Circle. The centrepiece is the main building of University College, built in 1857 with an eclectic blend of Richardsonian Romanesque and Norman architectural elements. The dramatic effect of this blended design by architect Frederick William Cumberland drew praise from European visitors of the time: [...] "Until <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> Toronto," [...] remarked Lord Dufferin during his visit in 1872, [...] "I confess I was not aware that so magnificent a specimen of architecture existed upon the American continent." [...] The building was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1968. Built in 1907, Convocation Hall is recognizable for its domed roof and Ionic-pillared rotunda. Although its foremost function is hosting the annual convocation ceremonies, the building is a venue for academic and social events throughout the year. The sandstone buildings of Knox College epitomizes the North American collegiate Gothic design, with its characteristic cloisters surrounding a secluded courtyard.|$|E
500|$|Tavevele Noa was {{the sole}} male {{athletic}} competitor to compete for Tuvalu at the London Olympics {{at the age of}} 20. He had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games. Noa qualified for the Games by using a wildcard after competing in an event on Tuvalu's main island and was selected {{to take part in the}} men's 100 metres dash. In an interview before the Games he said he was looking to competing in the Olympics and felt nervous but aimed to establish a new personal best time. Noa was drawn in the second heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing sixth out of seven runners, with a time of 11.55 seconds. He finished ahead of Timi Garstang of the Marshall Islands (12.81 seconds) but behind Palau's Rodman Teltull (11.06 seconds) in a heat led by Jurgen Themen from Suriname (10.55 seconds). Overall Noa finished 72nd out of 76 participants and did not advance to the later stages after being 0.75 slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who progressed. After his event he stated: [...] "My race was not good, my aim was to get 10 seconds. The start of my race was good but then when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> 60 meters, I let it down." ...|$|E

But that soon passed, and <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent."

500|$|With [...] over [...] {{still to}} travel before the {{relative}} safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, [...] "eking out {{his life with}} the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still [...] from Hut Point, with [...] {{only one or two}} days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean should go on alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment, Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov. Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: [...] "So it fell to my lot to do the 30miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to do it.
