5000|$|Chemicals are {{regulated}} under various laws including the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). In 2010, Congress was considering {{a new law}} entitled the Safe Chemicals Act. Over the following several years, the Senate considered a number of legislative texts to amend the TSCA. These included the Safer Chemicals Act, several versions of which were introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), with the latest in 2013, and the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (S. 1009, CSIA) introduced by Senators Lautenberg and David Vitter (R-LA) in 2013. Senator Lautenberg died shortly after CSIA's introduction, and over time his mantle {{was picked up by}} Senator Tom Udall (D-NM), who continued to work with Senator Vitter on revisions to the CSIA. The result of that effort was the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, passed by the Senate on December 17, 2015. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2576), passed the House of Representatives on June 23, 2015. Revised legislation, which resolved differences between the House and Senate versions, was forwarded to the President on June 14, 2016. [...] President Obama signed the bill into law on June 22, 2016. The Senator's widow, Bonnie Lautenberg, was present at the White House signing ceremony.

40|$|By {{designing}} <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> {{based on}} product platforms, {{many companies are}} providing product variety efficiently and effectively and facilitating {{the development of an}} overall product development strategy. An important factor in product development is the evolution of a family of products in response to changing technologies, market demands, competitive pressures, and other factors. In this paper, we present a method for designing product platforms for an evolving product family that meets changing performance requirements with an expanding portfolio of products. The method is based on the utility-based compromise Decision Support Problem—a multi-objective decision support model with an objective function derived from utility theory. With this method, a designer can balance multiple, non-deterministic objectives in product platform design and explicitly consider the evolution of platform-based <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in response to shifting performance targets. We apply this method to an example study of product platform design for an expanding family of absorption chillers. 2 KEYWORDS...|$|E
