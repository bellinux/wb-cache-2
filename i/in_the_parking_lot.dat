He orders Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) to {{interview}} Phyllis and make a sketch of the flasher. However, Phyllis says she didn't {{get a good look}} at him, so Pam instead draws a picture of Dwight with a mustache and without glasses. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) assists (who also seems to notice that the sketch looks similar to Dwight) an oblivious Dwight in posting fliers with Pam's sketch on it around town.|$|E
5|$|After the tornado, {{there was}} an {{investigation}} into whether the students should have been dismissed before the tornado stuck the school. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due to the extreme damage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> and the area nearby. In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in the area with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41am CST) made evacuating the area unsafe.|$|E

5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> outside the hospital and {{into the back of}} an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford).

The bomb, which was disguised {{as a piece of}} lumber, injured Gary Wright when he attempted to remove it from the store's parking lot. The explosion severed nerves in Wright's left arm and propelled more than 200 pieces of shrapnel into his body. Kaczynski's brother, David—who would {{play a vital role in}} Kaczynski's capture by alerting federal authorities to the prospect of his brother's involvement in the Unabomber cases—sought out and became friends with Wright after Kaczynski was detained in 1996.

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} having secret {{meetings}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot,</b> where Dwight provides information about Dunder Mifflin so Michael can undercut the company. However, Dwight's loyalty is {{put to the test}} as Charles Miner (Idris Elba) seems to show more respect for Dwight than Michael ever did. Dwight brings Charles to the parking lot during one of the secret meetings, where Charles orders Michael to stop pestering Dwight. This begins a rivalry between Michael and Dwight, and Michael begins to steal Dwight's clients. Dwight asks for a truce and offers to take Michael and his employees out to lunch; Dwight does not go to the restaurant and instead sneaks into the empty Michael Scott Paper Company office and steals everything on Michael's desk, including his Rolodex contact list, and places a dead fish in the air conditioning vent.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) {{meet with}} an {{important}} potential client, Christian (Tim Meadows), at Chili's. The client represents the governmental paper {{interests of the}} branch's entire surrounding county, and it is mentioned that taking him on could mean Dunder-Mifflin {{will not have to}} close one of its branches – a threat that had been looming for the past year. Jan is initially disgusted with Michael's antics (which began with Michael changing the meeting location from a hotel meeting room to Chili's without permission) and refusal to talk business, but discovers {{at the end of the}} day that there is a method to his madness when the client bonds with Michael, allowing him to close the deal.

5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. Susan was supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her. Mark tells Mr. Griffin to beg but he refuses, so the students decide to leave him alone there until midnight.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recent {{studies of}} public {{underground}} <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> showed <b>the</b> influence of radon concentration and the probable discomfort caused by parking cars. Materials and Methods Radon concentration {{was measured in}} semi-closed public <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> six governorates of Kuwait, using Durridge RAD 7 radon detector (USA). Results The peak radon concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> of Kuwait governorates was relatively higher during winter (63. 15 Bq/m 3) compared to summer (41. 73 Bq/m 3). Radon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> revealed a mean annual absorbed dose (DRn: 0. 02 mSv/y) and annual effective dose (HE: 0. 06 mSv/y).   Conclusion This study validated the influence of relative humidity and temperature as the major components of discomfort index (DI). The mean annual absorbed and effective dose  of radon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> were found below the permissible limits. However, high radon DRn and HE were reported when the assessment included <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> <b>the</b> surrounding residential apartments, and office premises. Furthermore, the time-series analysis indicated significant variations of the seasonal and site-wise distribution of radon concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> indoor evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> of <b>the</b> six Kuwait governorate...|$|R
