5|$|In 1900, it was {{suggested}} <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Review that the City Branch should be replaced with an electric deep-level railway (i.e. a 'tube' line) between Herne Hill and Farringdon in order to remove Blackfriars Railway Bridge, which the author {{considered to be a}} blight on the Thames.|$|E

5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange. Peter then states that it is no {{stranger}} than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E
5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

In 2007, New Zealand even declared 15 February their official National Lamb Day to celebrate the country's history of sheep production.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 2 {{examines}} productivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> economy. Cowen describes spurts {{in productivity}} growth, 2.8% between 1996 and 2000 and 3.8% from 2000 to 2004, and he asks if they disprove the stagnation thesis. He concedes {{that there have}} been gains in certain areas, such as information technology, but argues that in other important areas such as finance, which is 8% of GDP, there has been less value created.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Union {{released}} its first film, Kedok Ketawa, in July 1940. This was followed by a series of films penned by Saeroen which were increasingly oriented towards the Indies' growing intelligentsia and attempted to distance themselves from the theatrical conventions which were common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> film industry. This continued after Saeroen left for Star Film in 1941, with Union's final two productions emphasising realism. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in March 1942, Union was dissolved, though its films continued to be screened into the mid 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of higher education. The established universities in Germany include some of the oldest in the world, with Heidelberg University (established in 1386) being the oldest. It is followed by the Leipzig University (1409), the Rostock University (1419) and the Greifswald University (1456). The University of Berlin, founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, became the academic model for many European and Western universities. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> era Germany has developed eleven Universities of Excellence: Humboldt University Berlin, the University of Bremen, the University of Cologne, TU Dresden, the University of Tübingen, RWTH Aachen, FU Berlin, Heidelberg University, the University of Konstanz, LMU Munich, and the Technical University of Munich.|$|E
5|$|Gottesman and Shields {{published}} Schizophrenia and Genetics {{to document}} their twin-study {{research at the}} Maudsley Hospital in London, the work that in part earned them the Hofheimer Prize for Research, the highest award for psychiatric research from the American Psychiatric Association. The study expanded on an earlier one by Eliot Slater at the same hospital, covering 24 identical and 33 fraternal twins, {{with at least one}} from every pair a schizophrenic being treated at the hospital between 1948 and 1964. This study was one of eleven such <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> literature, and the book detailed the methodology and analytic detail differentiating it from the others.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 and 1885, {{through the}} {{influence}} of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to follow their precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of art for art's sake, and insisted that all great art must be didactic.|$|E

50|$|Established <b>in</b> 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Art Gallery (originally {{called the}} Greater Vancouver Artist's Gallery) {{began as an}} {{outgrowth}} of the Social Planning Department of the City of Vancouver, in which Vancouver artists were hired for a six-month period to produce art for exhibition at the gallery, and for inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> City of Vancouver Art Collection. <b>In</b> 1976, <b>the</b> CAG was incorporated as a registered federal charity and a non-profit society under the Societies Act of British Columbia. <b>In</b> 1984, <b>the</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Art Gallery became an artist-run centre. It was widely recognized for providing initial solo exhibitions and catalogues for many of Vancouver's now well-known artists. By the early 1990s, the exhibition program had expanded to include artists of national and international origin. <b>In</b> 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Art Gallery was transformed from an artist-run centre into an independent public art gallery, fulfilling the need for a contemporary visual arts institution with programming positioned between the vibrant experimentalism of Vancouver's artist-run centres and the more popular programs of large general-interest institutions. <b>In</b> May 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Contemporary</b> Art Gallery moved to a new purpose-built facility.|$|R
5|$|Leo Phokas {{released}} the Byzantine prisoners after {{providing them with}} provisions, and took the booty and Arab prisoners back to Constantinople, where he celebrated a triumph at the Hippodrome. Indeed, the battle of Andrassos made a deep impression among contemporaries, provoking outbursts of celebration in the Empire, and grief and lamentation in the Syrian cities; it is mentioned by all historical sources of the time, and upheld <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Byzantine treatise De velitatione bellica {{as one of the}} chief examples of a successful ambush.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese. Little notice was taken {{of his life and}} activities; only a few charters originated in his household and there is only one listing of gifts to his diocese. No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and there is just a brief death notice in the Leofric Missal, although no notice of his death occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He occurs as a witness to royal charters.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, no {{relevant}} information is found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> Greek Linear B records.

Moreover, although {{the title of the}} Mycenaean kings, the wanax, has been read several times in the Linear B texts, no correspondent personal names have been found.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{performances}} often set {{the play}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> world. For example, in 1986, the Royal Shakespeare Company set the play in modern Verona. Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo committed suicide by hypodermic needle.

Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt's death while in class at school.|$|E

5|$|The early Ottomans {{preserved}} the imarat al-arab at least during the 16th century, {{during which the}} title {{was referred to as}} amir ʿarab-i Shām. However, the rights and role of the amir al-arab and his status in the Ottoman administration in Ottoman Syria are not well-defined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>contemporary</b> sources, according to historian Muhammad Adnan Bakhit. The provincial records of Damascus Eyalet (Province of Damascus), whose jurisdiction extended throughout Syria until the mid-16th century, do not mention the emirate's function. Moreover, Bakhit asserts that it is unclear if the sultan's ratification was required for the Bedouin tribes or the provincial government to recognize the amir al-arab.|$|E
