5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E

50|$|In many {{cultures}} <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> traditionally packaged in some way. For example, in Western cultures, <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> often wrapped in wrapping paper {{and accompanied by}} a gift note which may note the occasion, the recipient's name, and the giver's name. In Chinese culture, red wrapping connotes luck. Although inexpensive <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> common among colleagues, associates and acquaintances, expensive or amorous <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> considered more appropriate among close friends, romantic interests or relatives.|$|R

5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
50|$|While some Charismatic Christians {{believe that}} spiritual <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> an {{arbitrary}} endowment of grace, an important Mormon idea <b>is</b> that spiritual <b>gifts</b> can <b>be</b> developed through diligent seeking. Some <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> developed in pre-existence. Other spiritual <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> developed during mortal life and identified by priesthood blessings. As teenagers, many Mormons receive a patriarchal blessing {{which seeks to}} reveal some spiritual gifts by revelation. For those {{who are members of}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), this blessing is recorded and saved in the official church archives.|$|R

5|$|In the two Grand Punk Railroad novels, set during late 1931, {{the pair}} receive {{a letter from}} Ennis and decide to visit her in Manhattan. To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail Tracer has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria make up their minds to ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E

The Dutch <b>Gift</b> <b>was</b> a collection of 28 mostly Italian Renaissance paintings and 12 classical sculptures, along with a yacht, the Mary, and furniture, which was presented to King Charles II of England by the States-General of the Netherlands in 1660.|$|R

25|$|Just as fruit {{should be}} {{evident in the}} life of every Christian, Pentecostals believe that every Spirit-filled believer is given some {{capacity}} for the manifestation of the Spirit. It {{is important to note that}} the exercise of a <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> a manifestation of the Spirit, not of the gifted person, and though the gifts operate through people, they are primarily gifts given to the Church. They are valuable only when they minister spiritual profit and edification to the body of Christ. Pentecostal writers point out that the lists of spiritual gifts in the New Testament do not seem to be exhaustive. It is generally believed that there are as many gifts as there are useful ministries and functions in the Church. A spiritual <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> often exercised in partnership with another gift. For example, in a Pentecostal church service, the gift of tongues might be exercised followed by the operation of the gift of interpretation.|$|E

On Madhu Purnima, Buddhists remember this act by giving honey to monks. The monkey's <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> frequently depicted in Buddhist art.|$|E
40|$|Incorporating philanthropy into tourism, through {{practices}} such as volunteer tourism and non-governmental organization (NGO) work, is becoming an increasingly popular way for tourists to aid people of developing nations socially and economically. The roles and impacts of tourist philanthropy on developing nations have been discussed in the literature but one form of tourist philanthropy has, thus far, <b>been</b> missed. Philanthropic <b>gifting,</b> that <b>is</b> the bringing of gifts by tourists to give to local people of developing nations, {{has not yet been}} examined and its impacts have not been discussed in the literature. This study examines the knowledge and prevalence of philanthropic gifting among tourists and travel agents and analyzes the possible implications of philanthropic gifting on the economies of developing nations. These objectives are addressed through a mixed-methods research approach and a case study of two tourism areas in Cuba, Guardalavaca and Varadero. 	The findings of this study demonstrated that philanthropic <b>gifting</b> <b>is</b> prevalent in Cuba and that the knowledge of it among tourists is widespread. Motivation for participating in philanthropic gifting related to the fact that Cuba is a poor nation with strained ties with the United States of America in regards to trade and access to goods. Further research revealed that, though philanthropic <b>gifting</b> <b>was</b> prevalent, <b>gifts</b> <b>were</b> not distributed equally among groups of Cuban people in society, with people working within the tourism industry receiving the large majority of gifts. The main conclusion of this study <b>is</b> that <b>gifting</b> <b>is</b> likely a great source of economic assistance for Cuban people who receive gifts. The economic independence that could be created through receiving <b>gifts</b> <b>is</b> greatly benefitting these Cuban people. The fact that <b>gifts</b> <b>are</b> not equally allocated throughout Cuban society, however, suggests that philanthropic <b>gifting</b> <b>is</b> strengthening the divide between workers of the tourism industry and those outside of it. A greater effort should be made to ensure that gifts reach a greater number of Cubans so that the benefits of philanthropic <b>gifting</b> can <b>be</b> more widespread...|$|R

Trained as a Mentat and a Zensunni philosopher, Hayt has no memory of his former life, but constantly feels vague hints and reminders of his previous incarnation that make him hope he can recover those memories.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, for example, {{most major}} {{holidays}} now {{are represented by}} rationalized, secularized figures which serve as a corporate totem. In more traditional environments, gifts are more often hand-crafted works which hold some symbolic meaning. This qualitative value of gifts diminishes in rationalized societies, where individuals often offer hints or speak directly about what present {{they are interested in}} receiving. In these societies, the value of a <b>gift</b> <b>is</b> more likely to be weighed by objective measures (i.e. monetary value) than subjective (i.e. symbolism).|$|E
