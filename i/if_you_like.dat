5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it, was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
25|$|It's beautifully made—handsome, artfully crafted and acted. Smith, {{who plays}} the {{formidable}} and disdainful Dowager Countess, has a lovely way of delivering words, always spaced to perfection. This {{is going to be}} a treat <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> a lavish period drama of a Sunday evening.|$|E
500|$|... "Legendary Axe II has {{the same}} magic as the first version, but with snazzier graphics. You get more power-ups here so you {{can stay in the}} hunt longer, {{enhancing}} the game's arcade feel There's also a better variety of enemies. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> thumb-numbing, hack-em, slash-em action, give this sequel a try! Remember, you axed for it!" [...] -David Winstead ...|$|E

500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes you feel as <b>if</b> <b>you,</b> <b>like</b> the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|Primarily an uptempo latin pop track, [...] "Rabiosa" [...] {{additionally}} borrows influences from merengue {{and dance}} music. In the song, Shakira and Pitbull/El Cata trade verses regarding each other's sex appeal. English and Spanish words are mixed together in various lines, {{such as when}} Shakira sings [...] "Oye papi, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it mocha / Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca". Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily described Shakira and Pitbull's vocals as [...] "sultry" [...] and [...] "raspy," [...] respectively.|$|E
500|$|According to critic Stephen Holden, art pop often {{refers to}} any pop style which {{deliberately}} aspires {{to the formal}} values of classical music and poetry, though these works are often marketed by commercial interests rather than respected cultural institutions. Writers for The Independent and the Financial Times have noted the attempts of art pop music to distance its audiences from the public at large. The Independents Nick Coleman wrote: [...] "Art-pop is partly about attitude and style; but it's essentially about art. It is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> {{a way of making}} pure formalism socially acceptable in a pop context.|$|E
6000|$|... "And try {{and look}} as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> it," [...] he said, severely. [...] "Why, {{from the window}} even the back view of you looks disagreeable." ...|$|R

500|$|Till plays as winger on {{the left}} or right sides and his play has been {{described}} as [...] "tricky". He has described himself as an old-fashioned winger, saying [...] "I am very quick, very fit. I like to get at the full-back – an old-fashioned winger type, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> I like to cause the full-back problems and get my crosses in and link up with our full-back as well". Walsall manager Chris Hutchings described him as [...] "an attacking wide-man with pace who is not afraid to take people on" [...] in 2009. Till is also able to play as a striker.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{some heavy}} {{promotion}} the black comedy approach {{was not what}} audiences wanted to see, especially with Paul Lynde. As a result, the ratings for the series fell well below the levels of the previous season. The last of The New Temperatures Rising Shows thirteen episodes aired on January 8, 1974. The following Tuesday, January 15, ABC premiered Happy Days in its place. According to co-producer Mitchell, [...] "...the audience didn't buy that at all. They just didn't get it. It was funny <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> black comedy, but if you don't it would disturb you. So the show failed miserably and we lost the job and the show." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Jacques Pépin {{wrote an}} article that called the {{inclusion}} of canned tuna the [...] "conventional choice", and recommended sauteed fresh tuna instead as [...] "more elegant". Mimi Sheraton disagrees, commenting, [...] "Salade Nicoise with fresh tuna is a travesty [...] [...] [...] <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it, [...] you are wrong!" [...] In 1999, Pépin joined with Julia Child in a TV series, [...] Jacques and Julia: Cooking at Home. Each prepared a salad they called [...] "Near Nicoise". Child's version was a composed salad including tuna and anchovies canned in olive oil, [...] and blanched green beans. [...] Pépin's was a tossed salad including sauteed fresh tuna and potatoes.|$|E

500|$|Rediff.com stated: [...] "Sporting a new, rugged look, 'Prince' Mahesh Babu {{has stolen}} the show. He carries the film on his shoulders, {{consolidating}} his winning streak after last year's Athadu. Another {{highlight of the}} film is its well-choreographed action sequences (if you can digest the violence), which give it a slick look." [...] IndiaGlitz gave a positive review stating: [...] "In Pokiri, the hero is introduced to us a ruthless baddie, part of the huge underbelly of mafia. By the time we come to the denouement, there is much twist and turn. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> some racy action, fun, glamour and love, then Pokiri would be your kind of film." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Phoenix New Times, Nicki Escudero {{compared}} {{the book to}} an entry on Wikipedia. She wrote, [...] "It's {{sort of like a}} really expanded Wikipedia entry, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that type of thing, though Herbert's voice shows that she's definitely a fan, and the book isn't completely unbiasedit's a very revering [...] tale of Gaga's 24-year-old life." [...] Sharon Galligar Chance reviewed the book for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and wrote, [...] "Using references from many, many different sources, Herbert has put together a fairly solid biography of the new pop icon". She concluded her review saying, [...] "Although sometimes redundant, Herbert...does give the reader a full-bodied accounting of the persona behind Lady Gaga".|$|E
500|$|Francesco Algarotti's Essay on the Opera (1755) {{was a major}} {{influence}} {{in the development of}} Gluck's reformist ideology. Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of opera seria, with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music or ballet or staging. The drama itself should [...] "delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist, Calzabigi. Calzabigi was himself a prominent advocate of reform, and he stated: [...] "If Mr Gluck was the creator of dramatic music, he did not create it from nothing. I provided him with the material or the chaos, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> We therefore share the honour of that creation." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just want to know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|Schwarzman {{received}} a severe backlash from both {{critics of the}} private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. [...] The lavish event which reminded many of the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). [...] David Bonderman, the founder of TPG Capital remarked, [...] "We have all wanted to be private – at least until now. [...] When Steve Schwarzman's biography with all the dollar signs is posted {{on the web site}} none of us will like the furor that results – and that's even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Rod Stewart." [...] As the IPO drew closer, there were moves by a number of congressman and senators to block the stock offering and to raise taxes on private equity firms and/or their partners—proposals many attributed in part to the extravagance of the party.|$|E

I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it raw.|$|E

According to James Reed of The Boston Globe the lines [...] "What? You want me naked/ If you likin' this position, you can tape it" [...] are sung with an accent which was [...] "part Long Island, part Barbados". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] {{is very similar to}} Missy Elliott's songs. Rolling Stones Christian Hoard and The Washington Posts J. Freedom du Lac found similarities between [...] "Video Phone" [...] and the songs by rock band Nine Inch Nails. San Francisco Chronicles Aidin Vaziri noted that the song sounded like it was swiped from Björk.|$|E
500|$|The Morning Advertiser {{thought that}} [...] "There is an evident attempt {{to copy the}} creations of a foreign {{composer}} who is so popular at the present time, and who has written some charming music for the gods and goddesses en bouffes." [...] Others accused Sullivan of blatant copying. The Athenaeum wrote that the music [...] "was arranged and composed by Mr A. S. Sullivan (the first verb {{was not in the}} bills as it ought to have been)". One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, [...] "Here far away from all the world", was one of the [...] "single best items of the piece". In 1873, the arranger Joseph Rummell (who had arranged Sullivan's Merchant of Venice score for the piano) wrote to Sullivan, asking about the song, with a view to publication. The composer replied, [...] "Thespis is not published but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> I will send you the Full Score of the Duet in question", but nothing came of it.|$|E

It also happens to be one of Konami’s best products!" [...] They added that [...] "With superb Roland sound (the TV show theme and opening animations are quite good) and smooth animation, our only wish is that Konami would consider releasing this fine arcade delight with full VGA support sometime in the future. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Bart and really enjoy arcade games, you have to get this one." [...] William Burrill of Toronto Star commented that [...] "the graphics in House of Weirdness are sharp and colorful, and look much like the television show. Music from the real show is also included, along with digitized samples of Bart's rather whining voice." [...] Computer Gaming World liked the graphics' resemblance to the TV show, and concluded that [...] "House of Weirdness stands up as well as any 'Super-Maroid' arcade game".|$|E
