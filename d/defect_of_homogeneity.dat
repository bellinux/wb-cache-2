40|$|In massive {{concrete}} structures, {{the heat}} generated by hydration reaction {{is the main}} cause <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> in <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the structure as the rate of hydration itself depends on temperature, which results in uneven temperature field distributions throughout the structure and subsequent cracking. This effect, which occurs during solidification and further hardening of concrete, influences the integrity and thus durability of the entire structure, therefore, it is analyzed beforehand by means of various numerical methods. This paper presents a simple heating system for curing concrete specimens under prescribed temperature history so that material parameters in arbitrary locations inside massive structure can be experimentally obtained, providing relevant input data necessary in the numerical methods. The controlling unit of the heating system is constructed very simply, based on the fuzzy logic techniques...|$|R
40|$|Rework {{cycle is}} at the heart of {{modeling}} projects, one of the major application areas of system dynamics. In this paper we introduce a new formulation for rework cycle in which multiple defects may exist in a task. We compare the performance of this model with three other formulations, two adopted from system dynamics literature and one agent-based formulation. This comparative study illustrates the impact of underlying assumptions about the nature <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> and <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> tasks in different formulations on model behaviors and provides information needed for effective formulation selection decisions. The new formulation we introduce allows for capturing significant schedule over-runs due to a few tasks, with multiple defects, that may go through rework cycle multiple times. Its perfect mixing assumption, however, limits its precision in terms of simulating the final project quality. Sensitivity analysis informs the robustness of results to multiple projects parameters. We discuss the implications for selecting robust formulations in modeling project dynamics...|$|R

Demonstrations of composite solidification, electrophoresis, and fluid flow were developed for Apollo. Fourteen different experiments in metal processing and single crystal growth were done in the space processing facility on Skylab. Metals were melted and solidified in a variety of configurations using different methods of heating to produce improved alloys and composite materials. Single crystals were grown by directional solidification and vapor transport to achieve uniform crystalline perfection, decreased structural <b>defects,</b> and <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the dopant material...|$|R

40|$|In the multi-fractal {{analysis}} of large scale matter distribution, the scale <b>of</b> transition to <b>homogeneity</b> {{is defined as}} the scale above which the fractal dimension of underlying point distribution is equal to the ambient dimension of the space in which points are distributed. With finite sized weakly clustered distribution of tracers obtained from galaxy redshift surveys it is difficult to achieve this equality. Recently we have defined the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> to be the scale above which the deviation of fractal dimension from the ambient dimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion. In this paper we use the relation between the fractal dimensions and the correlation function to compute the dispersion for any given model in the limit of weak clustering amplitude. We compare the deviation and dispersion for the LCDM model and discuss the implication of this comparison for the expected scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> in the concordant model of cosmology. We estimate the upper limit to the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> to be close to 260 Mpc/h for the LCDM model. Actual estimates of the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> should be smaller than this as we have considered only statistical contribution to the dispersion in fractal dimension and we have ignored cosmic variance and contributions due to survey geometry and the selection function. We find that as long as non linear correction are insignificant, scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> as defined above does not change with epoch. The scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> depends very weakly on the choice of tracer of the density field. Thus the suggested definition of the scale <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> is fairly robust.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>homogeneity</b> {{in regional}} science {{is based on}} two very different notions: composition and similarity. In {{the case of the}} states of the US, measures <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> based on these different notions are "negatively" correlated with each other, suggesting that the results of studies that use measures <b>of</b> economic <b>homogeneity</b> are likely {{to be sensitive to the}} conceptual basis of the specific measure. In order to overcome this problem, a portfolio-theoretic measure <b>of</b> economic <b>homogeneity</b> with some attractive properties is presented. It is naturally decomposable into two components reflecting each of these notions and easy to construct using widely available data. Using this measure, patterns <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> for the states of the US are illustrated and discussed, and hypotheses about the relationship between homogeneity and economic instability are tested.

Two new statistical tests are proposed and their performances compared with existing methods.

An alternative randomisation test <b>of</b> <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> product-moment correlations is {{shown to be a}} useful compromise between the approximate tests and the randomisation tests on Spearman’s rank correlations: it is not as sensitive to departures from normality as the approximate tests, but has greater power than the rank correlation test.

This result makes it possible to extend previous results on homogeneous systems to the geometric framework. As an application of our results, we consider ¯nite-time stability of homogeneous systems.
