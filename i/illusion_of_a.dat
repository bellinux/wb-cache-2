5|$|Immediately {{after hearing}} the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 {{horsemen}} (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large force.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet. On maps {{where there is no}} fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
5|$|The song {{featured}} two music videos. The {{first and}} most commonly seen video was filmed at Brooklyn Academy of Music performing arts center. The video features both singers, and begins with Houston and Carey performing in a large auditorium, giving the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concert. Towards {{the end of the}} video, clips of the film are projected onto a large screen at the concert, while they belt out the final verse. The alternate video was only released on NBC's special, When You Believe: Music Inspired by the Prince of Egypt, broadcast on December 13, 1998. It features a similar synopsis, with both singers performing on a large stage of an old Egyptian pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique {{as a means of}} shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E

5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree}} that it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E

50|$|In theatre, a box set is a {{set with}} a {{proscenium}} arch stage and three walls. The proscenium opening is the fourth wall.

25|$|Mercury(II) {{chloride}} {{was used}} as a photographic intensifier to produce positive pictures in the collodion process of the 1800s.

At the time of its construction, Storer House is said to have resembled a Pompeiian villa. Frank Lloyd Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, was both the on-site construction manager and the landscape architect, providing an <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ruin barely visible within its jungle environment.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan's Copper Tents, {{originally}} three {{buildings for}} the palace guard, {{designed by the}} painter Louis Jean Desprez and built during 1787 to 1790. Desprez proposed that all the façades of the buildings should be designed as three Turkish tents, clad in decoratively painted copper plate. However, tent façades were only built on the side facing the main lawns, which still gives the desired <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sultan's encampment {{on the edge of}} the forest.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 Schiaparelli {{collaborated with}} the artist Jean Cocteau to produce two of her most notable art-themed designs for that year's Autumn collection. An evening jacket was {{embroidered}} with a female figure with one hand caressing the waist of the wearer, and long blonde hair cascading down one sleeve. A long evening coat featured two profiles facing each other, creating the optical <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vase of roses. The embroidering of both garments was executed by the couture embroiderers Lesage.|$|E

25|$|The {{lower jaw}} is {{straight}} and elongated. The jaw bone is rather low: the specimen creates the <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong jaw because the left jaw is visible below the right one. It bears ten teeth. In the 1998 description {{a part of}} the splenial was mistaken for a supradentarium and the angular was misidentified as the surangular because in the fossil it had been displaced upwards, creating the false impression an external mandibular fenestra, an opening in the outer side of the jaw, would be present.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 Cornell anatomy {{professor}} G.S. Moler made {{an early}} movie using frame-by-frame technology.

During the early 20th century, Ithaca was an important center in the silent film industry. These films often featured the local natural scenery.

25|$|For example, if a 530Hz {{pure tone}} is {{presented}} to a subject's right ear, while a 520Hz pure tone {{is presented to}} the subject's left ear, the listener will perceive the auditory <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> third tone, {{in addition to the}} two pure-tones presented to each ear. The third sound is called a binaural beat, and in this example would have a perceived pitch correlating to a frequency of 10Hz, that being the difference between the 530Hz and 520Hz pure tones presented to each ear.|$|E
