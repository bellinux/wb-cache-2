25|$|The port town {{is called}} Merichas (pop. 369), its {{population}} significantly fluctuating during the year. Before the 1970s, {{there were no}} year-round residents in recent history; a Greek fisherman named Manolas Psaras and his wife <b>Foto</b> {{were the first to}} live in the port year-round. Today, there is a growing year-round population, and, especially during the peak of the summer tourist season, the town becomes quite busy. Many residents of the port speak at least some English, the most popular second language. Merihas is connected to Piraeus and to Lavrion by ferry boat, and the ride takes one to four hours, depending on the speed of the ship and the weather. Construction of a new mole began in 2005 to accommodate larger ferryboats and was completed in 2008. Kythnos was until recently considered {{to be one of the}} last Cycladic islands unaffected by the impact of tourism, but this is inexorably changing. Still, the island has not yet been overdeveloped, and in the more remote areas of the villages, traditional ways live on relatively unchanged.|$|E
