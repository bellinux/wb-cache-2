40|$|Metal flow {{inside the}} {{container}} {{and in the}} metal behind a butt-ended die bridge in idealized aluminum extrusion welding has been investigated by FEA and experiment {{with respect to the}} deformation of the material flowing around the bridge and into the layers close the extrusion seam weld. Along the mid-axis of the extrusion process the effective strain subjected to the <b>extrusion</b> <b>material</b> can be determined in three different ways. One way is to determine the strains from grid pattern experiments that reveal the real deformations. When it comes to FEA there are two options; the strains can be determined from the initial and final positions of a number of material points distributed along the mid-axis of the material, where after traditional theoretical strain-equations can be used to calculate the effective strain distribution along the axis. Another possibility is to use the post-processor of the software to calculate the strain distribution. In this work the effective strain distribution along the mid-axis of the billet inside the container volume were determined by all these three methods. The effective strain in the thin layer of the squeeze zone ahead of the dead zone in front of the die bridge determined from the experiments was found to be much larger than the strains elsewhere along this axis.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{mathematical model}} of the hot extrusion process for aluminum alloys has been developed and validated. The model is capable of predicting the material flow behaviour and microstructure evolution that occurs in aluminum alloy AA 3003 during extrusion. The plasticity module was developed using a commercial finite element package, DEFORM, a transient Lagrangian model which couples the thermal and deformation phenomena {{and is able to}} predict the temperature, strain rate and strain distribution in the billet/extrudate at any position in the container and die. Validation of the model against industrial data indicated that it gave excellent predictions of the pressure and temperature history during <b>extrusion.</b> <b>Material</b> flow effects during extrusion such as surface cladding (a transverse weld defect) as one billet is fed in after another through the die were also well predicted. The results of the FEM model for material flow and thermomechanical history were post processed using MATLAB software to predict the grain deformation and stored energy in the extruded material as well as the thickness and extent of the transverse weld defect. Finally, the model predictions for microstructure and transverse weld were compared to microstructure observations. The stored energy or driving pressure for Static Recrystallization (SRX) and Geometric Dynamic Recrystallization (GDRX) and how they are influenced by extrusion parameters were investigated using the mathematical model and experimental measurements. The experimental measurements for grain thickness and microstructural features made using Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) technique and optical microscope show good agreement with model predictions. The mathematical model was then used to assess the effect a change in die design would have on the flow behaviour of the material during extrusion and on the transverse weld that forms. 1 yea...|$|E

The 3 D FEM module was used to study the required load, the temperature evolution, surface formation of the extrudate and material flow during the process. The effect of varying process conditions on the selected geometries were investigated and verified by means of experiment. Considering the difficulty in performing the experiments (high temperature and high strain rates) the simulation results can {{be considered to be}} acceptable. The simulations were performed with the implicit finite element code Forge 2009 ® with user input written in Visual Fortran®. Alloy EN AW- 6082 was selected on the basis that is a commonly used <b>extrusion</b> <b>material</b> in industry. A range of simulations were designed which would produce differing structures to those experienced within the industry. The effect of variation of the bridge design for hollow dies and the effect of variation of the sink in for solid dies was investigated. 3 D simulations were performed to investigate the effect of these variations in the design features on extrusion process parameters. The process parameters which are likely to be affected are load, deflection, velocity and temperature. The results indicated that the design of the die affected the process parameters. The microstructure evolution during the extrusion process was investigated for the selected complex geometries. The following microstructure features were included in the investigations: Recrystallised grain size, subgrain size, misorientation, dislocation density and volume fraction recrystallised. Simulations were performed using physically-based mathematical microstructure models integrated into FEM through its Fortran® subroutine interface. Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of varying process conditions on the microstructure. For hollow section, the emphasis was placed on the study of the complicated metal flow and the seam welding quality. EBSD analyses were performed to investigate the substructure. Surface cracking was modelled and compared with experiments. The agreement between the predicted microstructures using associated models and experimental measurements were acceptable. Predicted cracking show good correlation with experimental result...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chitosan has {{multiple}} applications and as inhibitor of microbial growth, there is {{interest in developing}} new methodologies to its incorporation into plastics, which would avoid microbial growth in foods. In {{the frame of the}} project “Preparation of active packaging with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity based on astaxanthin and chitosan” (PAPAAABAC), chitosan was extracted from shrimp by-products and used to prepare plastic films by solvent evaporation (casting) and <b>extrusion.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: Chitosan films were prepared by extrusion of polyamide and by casting. By casting, films were prepared at different concentrations (1 %, 2 %, and 3 %) by dissolving chitosan in acetic acid aqueous solution 1 % (w/v), with and without plasticizer (1 % glycerol). By extrusion, chitosan pellets were made of polyamide 6 at 2 %, 5 %, 6 %, 8 %, and 10 % with two different particle sizes (180 and 300 µm). Then, they were rolled in an extruder using a specific screw for polyamide. In order to determine chitosan in food simulants (ultrapure water and ethanol 95 % (v/v)), it was degraded into the glucosamine units by hydrolysis and quantified by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection after its derivatization with 9 -fluorenylmethyl chloroformate. Results and conclusion: From the plastic films prepared by casting and by extrusion, only those prepared by casting without plasticizer presented chitosan migration that increases with the amount of chitosan added. These films could not be used to pack aqueous foodstuffs. However, the addition of a plasticizer (glycerol) has avoided the migration of chitosan. Therefore, the use of casting films with chitosan shall include a plasticizer in the formulation. Films prepared by extrusion presented no migration into both simulants indicating suitability to pack both aqueous and fatty foodstuffs.

40|$|Among {{the most}} widely used {{additive}} manufacturing technologies is the <b>material</b> <b>extrusion</b> based process, in which a filament of thermoplastic material is liquefied and extruded through a nozzle to build a three-dimensional object in a layer-upon-layer fashion. One of the challenges of this technology is the limited availability of materials. In order to expand the portfolio of available materials, while reducing the cost of existing material productions, polypropylene-based polymers and composite <b>materials</b> for <b>material</b> <b>extrusion</b> additive manufacturing are investigated. However, since polypropylene is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic, a three-dimensional part fabricated with this material has a tendency to warp. In this thesis, <b>material</b> <b>extrusion</b> process simulation models are developed that are capable of predicting the temperature distributions, deposited filament shapes, residual stresses and warpages/deformations of fabricated parts. An alternative to reduce warpage of polypropylene parts is to create composite materials by combining with additives. Therefore, these process simulation models support the development of new materials by predicting part warpages quickly and cost effectively without the need of iterative experiments. These <b>material</b> <b>extrusion</b> process simulation models can be applied to both the quality and performance of fabricated parts, such as warpage and mechanical property anisotropy. The correlations between process variable settings on additive manufacturing machines and material properties of polypropylene-based composite materials on warpage characteristics are determined. In addition, the correlations between mechanical property anisotropy and the bonding quality of extruded filaments are examined experimentally by producing tensile property data of fabricated parts with different fill angles. The efficacy of the process simulation models are then evaluated by comparing the experimental and simulation model results. M. S...|$|R
