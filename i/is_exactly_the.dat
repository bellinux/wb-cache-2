The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold {{in many of the}} company's international markets in several forms.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The crowd is represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E
5|$|Players who buy the Limited Collector's Edition get a {{polished}} Steelbook case, with the 2012 BMW M5 as the cover car. They receive a V.I.P. car pack, including the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport and Noble M600; a 10-car American Muscle Car Pack, including the Plymouth GTX 426 HEMI and Chevrolet Nova SS, (also available on Xbox Live on launch day); a pre-order exclusive Ship Bonus Car Pack, including the Koenigsegg Agera and Tesla Roadster Sport; a five-car BMW Designer Car Pack featuring five BMWs with unique exterior designs, including a BMW M6 designed by an entrant into an M6 design competition. This pack was available on launch day, {{along with a}} free download of the 2012 BMW M5 and a BMW theme for the Xbox 360 dashboard. In addition to this, Collector's Edition owners are given a 96-page volume entitled 'Cars of Forza Motorsport 4 Presented By Top Gear, written by the editors from Top Gear magazine. This volume gives detailed information about many of the exotic cars found within the game, as well as photos (both in game and real life) of them. The description of the cars <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same that Jeremy Clarkson narrates while using the Top Gear section found within the Autovista feature.|$|E

25|$|Each NOR flash cell {{is larger}} than a NANDflash cell 10F2 vs 4F2 even when using exactly the same {{semiconductor}} device fabrication and so each transistor, contact, etc. <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same size because NORflash cells require a separate metal contact for each cell.|$|E

25|$|The alveoli {{are open}} (via the airways) to the atmosphere, {{with the result}} that {{alveolar}} air pressure <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the ambient air pressure at sea level, at altitude, or in any artificial atmosphere (e.g. a diving chamber, or decompression chamber) in which the individual is breathing freely. With expansion of the lungs (through lowering of the diaphragm and expansion of the thoracic cage) the alveolar air now occupies a larger volume, and its pressure falls proportionally, causing air to flow in from the surroundings, through the airways, till the pressure in the alveoli is once again at the ambient air pressure. The reverse obviously happens during exhalation. This process (of inhalation and exhalation) <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same at sea level, as on top of Mt. Everest, or in a diving chamber or decompression chamber.|$|E
25|$|So, for example, {{there is}} a {{polynomial}} for which the positive part of its range <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> prime numbers.

25|$|Since {{the energy}} of the photoelectrons emitted <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> energy of the {{incident}} photon minus the material's work function or binding energy, the work function of a sample can be determined by bombarding it with a monochromatic X-ray source or UV source, and measuring the kinetic energy distribution of the electrons emitted.|$|E
