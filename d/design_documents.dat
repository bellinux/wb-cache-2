5|$|Read-Only Memory is a British {{publisher}} of art books on topics of video game history and culture. Following {{a resurgence of}} interest in 1980s and '90s British video game development, the company crowdfunded and produced four art books: an oral history of that Britsoft era, two books on British developers Sensible Software and The Bitmap Brothers, and a definitive volume on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, for which the publisher became best known. Read-Only Memory's books are archival anthologies, including original <b>design</b> <b>documents</b> juxtaposed with developer interviews and high-quality prints of in-game graphics. Reviewers were particularly impressed with each book's breadth of unreleased concepts.|$|E
5|$|Cerny's {{personal}} interests changed throughout the project, {{leading to the}} inclusion of new ideas absent from the original <b>design</b> <b>documents.</b> The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to Pac-Man. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional physics model to dictate the marble's motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior. As Marble Madness neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house focus testing was positive. In retrospect, Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles {{at the time and}} could not extend the game's development period as it would have left their production factory idle.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about the similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character designer for Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the <b>design</b> <b>documents</b> on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E

25|$|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter began {{life when}} LucasArts {{was asked to}} make an Episode II-based game which {{featured}} Jango Fett. In March 2001 game <b>design</b> <b>documents</b> were presented, and development began shortly after. The PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube versions of the game have different custom in-house graphics engines, each designed specifically {{to take advantage of}} the two platforms' unique strengths and work around their unique limitations, but the core game engine is identical. In the PS2 version they took advantage of both vector unit (VU) chips to drive the graphics to maximum performance. The DMA bandwidth was taken advantage of to use a high number of textures. There is full-screen antialiasing and texture mip mapping support. They used the second VU1 chip to handle all the character skinning and VU0 to handle all the skeletal animation transforms. Which enabled dozens of characters to be on-screen without bogging down the frame rate. They had 10 individually optimized rendering loops on VU1 to speed up the rendering process. Their PS2 graphics engine could move 10,000,000 triangles per second, and adding the gameplay, collision, logic, textures, sound would go down accordingly to around 30,000 to 50,000 triangles per frame, all at an average frame rate of 30 frames per second.|$|E

30|$|The rest of {{this paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In the section “Spectrum analysis”, we briefly introduce the “Spectrum analysis for software quality requirements” technique used to analyze software quality requirements in a document. We then propose the method for validating quality requirements considerations in a <b>design</b> <b>document</b> in the section “Method”. By using our method, we assume we can apply our spectrum analysis from the section “Spectrum analysis” to a <b>design</b> <b>document.</b> To apply this analysis to a <b>design</b> <b>document</b> efficiently, a supporting tool is crucial because the size of such a document is not so small. In the section “Supporting tool”, we explain the supporting tool, and how to use it about a <b>design</b> <b>document.</b> We then confirm the assumption that the spectrum analysis can be applied to a <b>design</b> <b>document</b> in the section “Preliminary evaluation” by comparing the result of an analysis performed by an expert in commercial systems with the result obtained by the method. In the section “Evaluation”, we show an evaluation to confirm that the method works well. We finally review related works, summarize our current results, and show future problems.|$|R

Leaked documents suggested that the new console would include an improved Kinect sensor, cloud access to games and media, integration with phone and tablet devices, and technology to provide players heads-up displays on glasses worn by the player, codenamed [...] "Fortaleza"; Microsoft did not comment on these reported features. Leaked <b>design</b> <b>documents</b> also suggested that Microsoft was seeking to eliminate the ability to play used games, though Microsoft later clarified it was still reviewing the design and were [...] "thinking about what is next and how we can push the boundaries of technology like we did with Kinect", but did not comment on the validity of the information.|$|E
500|$|Paul Lipson {{served as}} audio {{director}} on Halo Wars 2. The game's soundtrack was composed by Gordy Haab, Brian Lee White and Brian Trifon.

The composers analyzed <b>design</b> <b>documents,</b> artwork, and early versions of the game {{to learn about the}} story and motivations of characters. This research helped them to determine the emotional tone and instrumental choices for the music. They wanted to incorporate the customary components of Halo scores {{such as the use of}} a large orchestra, a choir, and electronic music, while also taking the music into a new direction. With Halo Wars 2 being a spin-off to the main arc of Halo games, the composers were not as beholden to Martin O'Donnell's established sound of the series.

500|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Hitman {{franchise}} reduced to its core elements, the development team saw a Lara Croft Tomb Raider version as an obvious next step (or {{as they called}} it, a [...] "go-brainer"). The team consisted of ten people (on average) {{who were able to}} work closely and nimbly, similar to an indie development team. They fit Lara Croft in the Hitman Go setting and knew to change elements like less focus on assassinating foes, less board game aesthetic, more animations, and more emphasis on environment than enemies. The team chose the classic Tomb Raider visual design over that of the series reboot, but reconstructed that series aesthetic from memory rather than from its actual <b>design</b> <b>documents.</b> They sought to recreate the moments of being chased by a giant animal or boulder. In place of time restraints, like the quick time events from the series, the developers added floors that crack with each successive turn to give a sense of time-based urgency.|$|E

500|$|Desert Strike {{underwent}} {{few changes}} from the plans {{outlined in the}} original <b>design</b> <b>documents.</b> The initial concept involved smoothly animated vehicles on an isometric playing field. The developers also aimed to include cinematic scenes, similar to The Revenge of Shinobis introduction sequence. The game began development some time before any discussion of an American invasion of Iraq, originally based on the Lebanese Civil War and titled Beirut Breakout; this was later changed to the Persian Gulf region. John Manley recalled, [...] "We actually wrote most of Desert Strike before Desert Shield happened. We were watching CNN {{at three in the}} afternoon {{and all of a sudden}} it was like, 'Oh my god - it's happening!'" [...] A special point system intended to punish players was omitted; the system would have deducted points from the player's score if they destroyed objects that resulted in negative economic and political results. The control scheme was not well received at internal reviews of the game's early versions, and Posehn had to alter his original design to obtain approval for further development.|$|E
500|$|Ion Storm {{announced}} Anachronox in April 1997, {{and planned}} for a third-quarter 1998 release. Tom Hall, veteran designer {{and one of}} the founders of Ion Storm, helmed the project and originated most of its story and design. Other founding members of the team were Todd Porter (producer), Jake Hughes (associate producer and director of cinematics), Ben Herrera (artist), Brian Eiserloh (programmer), and David Namaksy (lead mapper). Mapper Larry Herring was hired after being mentored by John Romero and submitting a custom Doom 2 map to Tom Hall. Hall first conceived Anachronox in his bathroom, prompting him to install a whiteboard and sound-recorder in his shower, as well as several notepads around his house for future ideas; he had conceived the character Sly Boots years earlier in college. He wrote a 460-page design document (completed in May 1997) outlining the universe of Anachronox, beyond the game's scope; other game <b>design</b> <b>documents</b> of the period, he noted, were usually only 125 pages in size. He then condensed the story, leaving a third beyond the scheduled game. The game's design phase lasted three months. Hall made plans for two expansion packs from the outset of development, owing to the huge story. Developers told Next Generation the story would be [...] "Campbellian" [...] and feature immense environments. Hall noted in mid-1997, [...] "Not since Keen has a universe been so clear in my head." ...|$|E
500|$|Their later games {{would only}} take a few months each, in comparison. They {{abandoned}} the use of <b>design</b> <b>documents</b> after Dinowaurs, and instead chose to refine and experiment in process. Intuition released Effing Hail and Gray around April 2009. Players in action game Effing Hail control hail and wind to destroy the most buildings and midair objects within a time limit. The game was published through Kongregate. In Gray, players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in the crowd. The game was featured at IndieCade in 2009. In the case of Fig. 8., Wohlwend thought of the idea based on a college art project. In the project, Wohlwend followed a bike trail in the snow, metaphorically related it to the tribulations of romantic relationship, and made an art installation involving a bike spray-painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on the floor. The concept went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea, whereupon Boxleiter added game mechanics to the visuals. In their next game, Liferaft, the player-character is a young woman set to escape [...] "a post-apocalyptic sci-fi ... test chamber", with core gameplay that revolves around a [...] "Bionic Commando-style grappling hook". Wohlwend used a 16-bit era graphics style. They sought crowdfunding from Kickstarter, but later canceled and put the project on hiatus in October 2009.|$|E
