5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements <b>in</b> <b>technology,</b> including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1980s, {{improvements}} <b>in</b> <b>technology</b> led to {{a greatly}} increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented to the user sequentially, became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech.|$|E

5|$|Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site {{along the}} River Derwent in Derbyshire, England, {{designated}} in December 2001. It {{is administered by}} the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. The modern factory, or 'mill', system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. With advancements <b>in</b> <b>technology,</b> it became possible to produce cotton continuously. The system was adopted throughout the valley, and later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200Arkwright-type mills in Britain. Arkwright's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States.|$|E
