40|$|Scurvy is the {{nutritional}} deficiency state associated with lowered levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Lack of ascorbic acid leads to suppression of collagen synthesis and {{the synthesis of}} defective collagen among other metabolic derangements. Weakening of vascular walls results in signs and symptoms mimicking other diseases such as bleeding diatheses and deep vein thrombosis. Scurvy is rarely encountered in Western countries {{where there is a}} broad community understanding of the importance of nutritional requirements and where foods containing ascorbic acid are readily available. As a result of these factors early diagnosis may be hampered where it is not considered in the differential diagnosis, and consequently, prolonged suffering of the patient. Scurvy is easily treated with high doses of oral ascorbic acid, although recurrences may occur. Education of health care providers in recognizing the signs and symptoms of scurvy therefore cannot be over emphasized, particularly in societies in which nutritional deficiencies are considered uncommon. A case of scurvy presenting primarily with oral manifestations is reported here. Key words: Ascorbic acid, case report, gingivitis, oral medicine, scurvy, vitamin C. (Received for publication May 2000. Accepted for publication June 2000.) of ascorbic acid containing foods was essential, the prevalence of scurvy has been very low. A small number of individuals in any community develop scurvy and clinicians should still be aware of this disease and investigate and manage appropriately. Symptoms of scurvy include haemorrhage related symptoms (including epistaxis, <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> <b>joints,</b> muscles and deeper tissues), hyperkeratosis of hair follicles and anaemia. In order to highlight this, a case is presented here in which the primary symptom leading to diagnosis and management was gingival haemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|Congenital {{fibrinogen}} {{disorders are}} caused by mutations {{in one of the}} three fibrinogen genes that affect the synthesis, assembly, intracellular processing, stability or secretion of fibrinogen. Functional studies of mutant Bβ-chains revealed the importance of individual residues as well as three-dimensional structures for fibrinogen assembly and secretion. This study describes two novel homozygous fibrinogen Bβ chain mutations in two Slovak families with afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all subjects with the aim of identifying the causative mutation. Coagulation-related tests and rotational thromboelastometry were performed. All exons and exon–intron boundaries of the fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB and FGG) were amplified by PCR followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analysis of the three fibrinogen genes allowed us to identify two novel homozygous mutations in the FGB gene. A novel Bβ chain truncation (BβGln 180 Stop) was detected in a 28 -year-old afibrinogenemic man with bleeding episodes including repeated <b>haemorrhaging</b> <b>into</b> muscles, <b>joints,</b> and soft tissues, and mucocutaneous bleeding and a novel Bβ missense mutation (BβTyr 368 His) was found in a 62 -year-old hypofibrinogenemic man with recurrent deep and superficial venous thromboses of the lower extremities. The novel missense mutation was confirmed by molecular modelling. Both studying the molecular anomalies and the modelling of fibrinogenic mutants help us to understand the extremely complex machinery of fibrinogen biosynthesis and finally better assess its correlation with the patient’s clinical course...|$|R

40|$|Haemophilia A is a {{congenital}} {{bleeding disorder}} characterised by recurrent <b>haemorrhages</b> <b>into</b> the major <b>joints.</b> Haemophilic arthropathy is a well-established outcome of recurrent joint bleeding; however, {{it is clear}} that multiple factors determine the extent and severity of its occurrence. We sought to identify genetic factors related to abnormalities in range of motion (ROM) in the knees, ankles and elbows in a cohort of children and adolescents with haemophilia A not treated primarily with regular prophylaxis. Using data from the Haemophilia Growth and Development Study, we examined associations between 13, 342 genetic markers and ROM scores measured at six-month intervals for up to seven years. As a first step, ordered logistic regression models were fit for each joint separately. A subset of SNP markers showing significant effects (p < 0. 01) on the right and left sides for at least two joints were included in a full model fit using a multivariate generalised linear mixed model assuming an ordinal response. The models contained all ROM scores obtained at all visits. Twenty-five markers analysed in the full model showed either increased or decreased risk of ROM abnormalities at the p< 0. 001 level. Several genes identified at either the first or second stage of the analysis have been associated with arthritis in a variety of large studies. Our results support the likelihood that risk for haemophilic arthropathy is associated with genetic factors, the identification of which holds promise for further advancing the individualisation of treatment...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> a {{parathyroid}} adenoma is a {{rare and}} potentially life-threatening presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report {{the case of a}} 45 year old female recently diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism who presented with chest discomfort and acute airway compromise due to spontaneous extracapsular <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> a parathyroid adenoma. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a hypopharyngeal haematoma extending 10 cm into the superior mediastinum. Surgical decompression of the cyst followed by enbloc resection of the parathyroid tumour was performed after elective intubation. Calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels had fallen prior to surgery and remain normal post-operatively. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous parathyroid haemorrhage should be considered in any patient with unexplained spontaneous cervical haemorrhage, particularly if there is a history of hyperparathyroidism. Initial evaluation of such patients should include serum calcium and PTH as well as imaging...|$|R

40|$|A 65 -year-old man {{collapsed}} suddenly, {{while on}} an escalator. Despite intensive cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, the subject died 1. h later. Post-mortem {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and post-mortem computed tomography angiography demonstrated rupture of an ascending aortic aneurysm, with <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> the pericardial cavity and the uncommon associated finding of <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> the left hemi-thorax through a small left-sided pericardial defect. The {{cause of death was}} thus attributed to the rupture of thoracic aortic aneurysm, and traditional autopsy was not performed. The circumstances of the case will be discussed, followed by a discussion of the imaging findings, mechanism of death, and explanation of the findings in this case. Finally, {{on the basis of this}} case report, we suggest that in selected cases, post-mortem imaging can be used as a screening tool for conducting hypotheses on the cause and mechanism of death before autopsy...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{highlight}} the clinical presentation, investigation {{and treatment of}} <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> the pancreatic duct. DESIGN: Retrospective study and review of publications. SETTING: University hospital, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: All 4 cases from 1972 to 1993. INTERVENTIONS: 2 Whipple procedures, 1 resection of the pancreatic head, 1 exploratory laparotomy. Radiological embolisation in one case. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cessation of haemorrhage and survival. RESULTS: The diagnosis was made preoperatively in three cases by gastroduodenoscopy and arteriography. Operation was the primary treatment in all patients and was effective with low morbidity and no mortality in three of them. Embolisation stopped the haemorrhage in the fourth patient, who was alcoholic and died of progressive liver insufficiency and variceal haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: There is no specific indication for <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> the pancreatic duct. The diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy (absence of a more common cause, or blood {{in the second part}} of the duodenum). Arteriography is essential to confirm the site of the bleeding and to attempt embolization. Operation is usually the definitive treatment...|$|R

Ultrasound of <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> a thyroid nodule revealed a large cystic mass in all 31 patients containing internal debris (22), septations (three), or a combination of both (six). The malignant causes of a large rapidly growing mass were lymphoma (two), anaplastic carcinoma (four) and metastasis (five). Ultrasound of these thyroid malignancies revealed a mass with a smooth, well-defined margin and strikingly low homogeneous echogenicity in all cases. Patients with thyroid metastases had evidence of widespread metastatic disease elsewhere. Lymphoma was differentiated from anaplastic carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration cytology or surgical biopsy. Ultrasound was of value in differentiating between a benign haemorrhagic nodule and a malignant tumour. The various malignant tumours had similar appearances, however, and could not be distinguished on ultrasound...|$|R
40|$|IT {{has been}} shown {{previously}} (Hartveit, 1961) that the adult mice used at this Institute show either a short survival time and a very haemorrhagic tumour or a long survival time and a relatively asanguinous tumour, following the intraperitoneal injection of Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma. This negative correlation between the survival time and the blood content of the tumour is not dependent on the sex or weight of the mouse. As this tumour is said to grow progressively in almost all strains of mice (Karnofsky, 1953) {{it was decided to}} investigate the causeof this difference in survival time and blood content found in our mice. In 1934 Apitz tested the theory that <b>haemorrhage</b> <b>into</b> the solid Ehrlich carcinoma might be due to anaphylaxis, but he failed to produce haemorrhage by this means. He also failed to produce haemorrhage as the result of treatment withi histamine. Later Barrett (1942) investigated the relationship between anaphylaxis and sarcoma 37.
