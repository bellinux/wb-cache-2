5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} she is not good at {{business}} as she is not organised enough, and <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday. Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|We {{should be}} candid about the {{interests}} surrounding Indian gaming. The issue <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> {{been one of}} crime control, morality, or economic fairness...At issue is economics...Ironically, the strongest opponents of tribal authority over gaming on Indian lands are from States whose liberal gaming policies {{would allow them to}} compete on an equal basis with the tribes...We must not impose greater moral restraints on Indians than we do on the rest of our citizenry. - Daniel Inouye, Senior United States Senator from Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{begins as}} life is {{seemingly}} returning to normal for the Jarretts of Lake Forest, Illinois, in September 1975. It is {{slightly more than}} a year since their elder son Buck was killed when a sudden storm came up while he and their other son Conrad were sailing on Lake Michigan. Six months later, a severely depressed Conrad attempted suicide by slashing his wrists with a razor in the bathroom. His parents committed him to a psychiatric hospital from which he has only recently returned after four months of treatment. He is attending school and trying to resume his life, but knows he still has unresolved issues, particularly with his mother, Beth, who <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> recovered from Buck's death and keeps an almost maniacally perfect household and family.|$|E

He tried to see what I wanted to know. Yes, he said--but uncertainly. I {{could see that he}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been <b>really</b> homesick. It had been very wretched on the ship going from Havre to New York. That he told me about. And he told me about the gold-mines, the galleries, the valley, the huts in the valley. But he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> fretted for San Gaudenzio whilst he was in California.|$|R

500|$|Noel Murray, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, graded the two-part premiere an 'A-', praising it as [...] "retro-cool pulp thrills in fabulous outfits. Think The Rocketeer or Raiders of the Lost Ark, {{but with a}} dame instead of a dude." [...] In his conclusion, Murray stated that [...] "'s {{greatest}} asset is Atwell, who takes a character that Marvel Comics <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> done much with before and makes it her own." [...] Oliver Sava, also from The A.V. Club, graded [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] an 'A-' as well, calling the series a gamble, but deciding that the first episode [...] "surpasses expectations with its dynamic direction and fight choreography, clever writing, and hugely charismatic lead." [...] Apart from Atwell's performance, which he called [...] "confident, strong, and sassy", Sava was also positive about the involvements of D'Esposito, Markus, and McFeely, and overall he found the episode, along with the next one, to be superior to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|New York {{magazine}} {{wrote of}} the character: [...] "There's probably no woman on TV right now more single-mindedly dedicated to her career than Cristina. It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established {{that she would have}} an abortion in this circumstance." [...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous. [...] made sense for the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> done anything particularly special {{for the last}} episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete story in this episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family Guy can be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E

500|$|In May 2012, when {{speculation}} arose that a male star {{would be}} exiting the soap opera, Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote {{that it could}} be Tucker, saying: [...] "Who despite being played by one of daytime’s most popular [...] <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> gelled with the audience. His recent one night stand with Harmony leaves him hated by pretty much everyone in Genoa City." [...] Of the possible pairing between Tucker and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), Luke Kerr (also of Zap2it) wrote: [...] "Billionaire Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols) is the latest white knight to ride in and save Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) from herself on The Young and the Restless. Granted, Genoa City's answer to Sir Richard Branson has ulterior motives, but there's no denying the two share at least a little chemistry." [...] During a storyline in which Tucker attempted to take over Newman Enterprises, Jamey Giddens (also of Zap2it) wrote, [...] "You know, I'm starting to dig ol' Tucker." [...] When Nichols was let go from the soap opera, Giddens wrote, [...] "Daytime television's answer to Richard Branson is no more." [...] Bibel wrote: [...] "The billionaire {{who turned out to be}} Katherine’s long lost son and Devon’s father suffered from inconsistent writing throughout his three year tenure on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "after {{three months of}} strike-enforced exile, [...] 30 Rock {{generated}} the expectations and excitement normally reserved for a season premiere," [...] also saying that [...] "the show [...] in midseason form." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that he would}} [...] "be lying if [...] said this was a super-great episode." [...] Webb Mitovich {{went on to say that}} [...] " [...] did like, though — and thought they should have done a lot more with — the [...] "parallels" [...] between the MILF events and the strategizing staff." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] "It's almost as if this was the season opener" [...] and that this episode was [...] "ambitious." [...] Michael N of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a grade of B. Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "the overall story arc was less than what we had anticipated from this critical favorite making its post-writers-strike return, the episode was still pretty damn funny." [...] Canning also said that this was [...] "an episode that was divided between a less-than-average story and many hilarious moments." [...] Canning criticized how [...] "30 Rock <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> given [...] (the character or the actor) the showcase that he deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the play}} years later, Regiels said [...] "I was embarrassed when I {{realized}} what I had done. I wanted a hole {{to open in the}} ground so I could jump in it. But that soon passed, and I reached a stage when mention of it would cause me to bristle. Soon that passed and it <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was reminded of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E

2500|$|While noise rock <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> had any {{mainstream}} popularity, the raw, distorted and feedback-intensive {{sound of}} some noise rock bands had {{an influence on}} grunge.

The Butthole Surfers' mix of punk, heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence, particularly on the early work of Soundgarden.|$|E

2500|$|Because tax {{benefits}} for charitable donations {{are limited in}} Japan, a culture of charity donations <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>really</b> taken root. [...] For example, the ratio of charitable donations by individuals in Japan is 52.5%, compared with 82.7% for the US. [...] Also, Japanese culture emphasizes modesty, which means that Japanese people are generally reluctant to do good deeds in public view. [...] Therefore, the Tiger Mask movement assuages both cultural inhibitions towards charitable deeds; it gives people in Japan a reason to donate while allowing {{them to do so}} anonymously.|$|E
