50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> are nocturnal omnivores that do {{not need}} to drink water, as they get all the {{moisture}} they need from their food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals. Most food is found by digging or scratching in the soil, and using their very long tongues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> have a {{very short}} {{gestation}} period of about 12-14 days, one of the shortest among mammals. The young are only 0.25 in long and very underdeveloped when they are born. They must crawl to the mother’s pouch and latch onto one of her eight teats. They leave the pouch after 70-75 days and remain in the natal burrow {{for two to three}} weeks before becoming independent. Litters usually consist of one to three joeys and females can have up to four litters per year in favourable conditions.|$|R

40|$|Reintroduction {{programs}} for threatened species often include elaborate release strategies {{designed to improve}} success, but their advantages are rarely tested scientifically. We used a set of four experiments {{to demonstrate that the}} influence of release strategies on short-term reintroduction outcomes is related to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We compared different reintroduction strategies for three mammal species in an arid environment where exotic mammalian predators were removed. Wild greater stick-nest rats selected vegetation shelter sites with greater structural density than captive-bred rats, travelled further from the release site and experienced lower rates of mortality. In comparison, {{there was no difference in}} mortality or movement between wild and captive-bred <b>greater</b> <b>bilbies.</b> Burrowing bettongs and <b>greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> were also subjected to immediate and delayed release strategies and whilst no difference was detected in bilbies, bettongs that were subjected to delayed releases lost less weight and took less time to establish burrows than those that were immediately released. Interspecific differences in treatment response were attributed to predation risk, the nature of the release site, and behavioural traits such as shelter investment and sociality. Our varied results highlight the inadequacies of review articles focusing on optimum release protocols due to their attempt to generalise across species and release sites. We provide an example of a predictive model to guide future release strategy experimentation that recognises the range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing reintroduction outcomes.

50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> {{are slowly}} {{becoming}} endangered because of habitat loss and change {{as well as}} the competition with other animals. Introduced feral cats and foxes pose a major threat to the bilby's survival, and there is some competition between bilbies and rabbits for food. There is a national recovery plan being developed for saving these animals: this program includes breeding in captivity, monitoring populations, and reestablishing bilbies where they once lived. There have been reasonably successful moves to popularise the bilby as a native alternative to the Easter Bunny by selling chocolate Easter Bilbies (sometimes with a portion of the profits going to bilby protection and research). Reintroduction efforts have also begun, with a successful reintroduction into the Arid Recovery Reserve in South Australia in 2000, and plans underway for a reintroduction into Currawinya National Park in Queensland, with a recent success with six bilbies released into the feral-free sanctuary in early February 2006.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> are {{generally}} solitary marsupials; however, {{there are some}} cases in which they travel in pairs. These pairs usually consist of two females, and these females are the sole caregivers of their offspring. The female bilby mates iteroparously. [...] Much of the plant diet of the bilby is facilitated by fires that occasionally run through Australian regions and facilitate the regrowth of plants that the bilby prefers. They are also a highly motile species {{when it comes to}} foraging, with females traveling on average 1.5 km between burrows and male traveling up to 5 km. The difference in male and female motility is most likely {{due to the fact that}} males are often in search of mates and need to only care for themselves, while females are responsible for their offspring and must work to support them. [...] Communication remains difficult between bilbies due to poor eyesight, but since these marsupials usually live alone or in very small groups, this obstacle is not incredibly formidable. Any communication that does occur is mostly olfactory between males or auditory. The scent markings implemented by male bilbies primarily function as a mode of communication between members of the same sex, since female bilbies rarely take heed of such signals and males are never aggressive towards their female counterparts.|$|R
40|$|Browsing by {{introduced}} cattle (Bos taurus) {{and rabbits}} (Oryctolagus cuniculus) can limit {{the recruitment of}} some arid zone tree and shrub species. In a study conducted at the Arid Recovery Reserve, Roxby Downs, SA, we aimed to quantify initial recruitment changes in shrubs after the removal of cattle and rabbits and the re-introduction of locally extinct fauna. The presence and abundance of seedlings was measured at groves of seven native perennial shrubs over 6 years under four browsing treatments: (1) ‘reserve-reintroductions’ [re-introduced greater stick-nest rats (Leporillus conditor), burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur) and <b>greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> (Macrotis lagotis) ], (2) ‘reserve-no browsers’, (3) ‘pastoral-stocked’ (rabbits and cattle), and (4) ‘pastoral-destocked’ (rabbits). Recruitment of mulga (Acacia aneura F. Muell. ex Benth.), silver cassia (Senna artemisioides subsp. petiolaris Randell) and sandhill wattle (Acacia ligulata A. Cunn. ex Benth.) was significantly greater in the two browsing regimes inside the Reserve than in the two pastoral regimes. The number of recruits of these three species declined at ‘pastoral-destocked’ and ‘pastoral-stocked’ sites but increased at ‘reserve-reintroductions’ and ‘reserve-no browsers’ sites from 2001 to 2006. Narrow-leaf hopbush (Dodonaea viscose (L.) Jacq.) showed a trend towards increased recruitment at sites in both browsing regimes inside the Reserve, but decreased recruitment at sites in both pastoral regimes. Native plum (Santalum lanceolatum R. Br.), native apricot (Pittosporum phylliraeoides orth. var. DC.) and bullock bush (Alectryon oleifolius (Desf.) S. T. Reynolds) exhibited {{no significant difference in}} recruitment between the four browsing regimes within the study timeframe. These results suggest that excluding rabbits and stock may benefit the germination and survival of mulga, silver cassia and sandhill wattle. To date, re-introduced native herbivores at low numbers have not been found to negatively affect the recruitment or growth rate of the seven perennial plant species studied. Nicola T.

As all bandicoot species were then placed in a broadly circumscribed Perameles, Reid placed the bilby there too. However, noting how different it was from other members of the genus, he added that [...] "should more of the same form be discovered, the above characters would constitute a subgenus to which the name of Macrotis might be applied".

40|$|Leaf litter is an {{important}} resource and a fundamental component of all terrestrial ecosystems. The senescence and decay of leaves, bark and other organic material provides a mechanism for carbon, nitrogen and other critical elements to be transported and incorporated into the soil. This process is particularly important in arid and semi-arid ecosystems where resources are limited and unevenly distributed spatially and temporally. There are many drivers that modulate surface litter accumulation, litter fall rates and litter decay rates. This thesis examines how these aspects of litter dynamics are moderated by abiotic (e. g. soil, landform, fire, rainfall) and biotic (e. g. vegetation communities, individual species) factors in semi-arid woodlands and shrublands in eastern Australia. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} the importance of litter in semi-arid woodlands, describing previous research on leaf litter dynamics in arid and semi&# 150;arid ecosystems. Chapter 2 examines litter fall rates in response to abiotic conditions, with a focus on the fall rates of reproductive structures (seeds, flowers and fruits) from three species that differ in their life histories. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on the accumulation and spatial arrangement of surface litter. Chapter 3 describes the shift in litter bed size and composition under two Eucalypt Mallee species (Eucalyptus socialis, E. dumosa) along a 42 year chronosequence of fire histories. Chapter 4 examines properties of spatial self-organisation exhibited by litter patches, assessing litter patch cover, size and degree of spatial association between surface litter and perennial vegetation across four different landscapes. Chapters 5 and 6 focus on aspects and implications of litter decomposition in the foraging pits of mammals. Chapter 5 examines the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors during the decomposition process of substrates in the foraging pits of short-beaked echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), <b>greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> (Macrotis lagotis) and burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur). Chapter 6 examines the conditions under which litter decomposition in echidna foraging pits facilitates seedling growth by assessing water stress and the proximity of foraging pits to large trees.

40|$|Arid Recovery, a fenced reserve free of feral predators in arid South Australia, has {{successfully}} reintroduced two critical weight range (CWR) mammals, <b>greater</b> <b>bilbies</b> (Macrotis lagotis) and burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur) {{to facilitate the}} restoration of arid Australian ecosystems. This thesis evaluates the ecological roles of these reintroduced species {{and their relationship to}} ecosystem functioning and the restoration of these ecosystems. Surveys of foraging diggings and soil seed banks, and dietary analysis were used to measure impacts of these species on three main habitats within the Reserve. The results showed that bilbies and bettongs have three major roles in ecosystem functioning: consumers, ecosystem engineers, and dispersers of seeds and fungi. Both bilbies and bettongs were omnivorous, though their diets were distinctly different, with the bilbies focused more on invertebrates and seeds, while the bettongs consumed a greater proportion of coarser plant materials. The seed portion of the diets of both species during 2003 - 04 differed from a similar study three years previously, shortly after the animals had been reintroduced to Arid Recovery in 2000 - 01. During 2003 - 04, the bilbies consumed a lower proportion of seeds of species of grasses and more of forbs, while seed consumption by bettongs narrowed to be almost exclusively the seeds of shrubs. The number of bilby and bettong diggings varied significantly both spatially and temporally, with averages of 7, 530 ± 820 diggings ha- 1 in Dunes, 10, 560 ± 980 diggings ha- 1 in Mulga, and 7, 120 ± 610 diggings ha- 1 in Swale. This resulted in an average of 2 to 3 % disturbance of soil surface area, which is similar to or higher than reported for other Australian or overseas semi-fossorial species. The temporal variation in rates of digging was correlated with minimum daily temperatures and rainfall but not moonlight. This variation was also correlated with counts of bilby but not bettong tracks, suggesting that the temporal variability of diggings was related to levels of bilby activity. The persistence of bilby and bettong diggings differed between the three habitat types, with the majority of the diggings in the Mulga (94 %) and Swale (87 %) persisting for over 12 months, while Dune diggings filled much faster, with only 15 % persisting over 12 months. These diggings were shown to accumulate and bury seeds and litter, and, under some conditions, enhance germination. The seeds of two plant species, the annual grass, Dactyloctenium radulans, and the shrub, Enchylaena tomentosa, germinated from bilby faecal pellets, and over a third of bilby faecal pellets contained fungal spores. Therefore bilbies have the potential to be dispersers of both seeds and fungi. All three major roles of the bilbies and bettongs in ecosystem functioning (consumers, ecosystem engineers, and dispersers of seeds and fungi) have the potential to affect the flows of organic, soil and water resources, and therefore vegetation structure and overall productivity. Soil seed bank densities differed between areas with and without bilbies and bettongs. However, the heterogeneity of the system made it difficult to confidently relate these differences to any particular effects of the bilbies and bettongs. Both bilbies and bettongs were able to locate and dig seeds buried 20 cm deep, and the caches of seed-harvester ants. Experiments showed that in areas of high digging density, 71 to 94 % of seed rain accumulated and became buried in diggings. Since bilbies and bettongs have the potential to use buried seed resources, they have the potential to significantly affect soil seed banks through their consumption of seeds, redistribution of seeds through their digging activities and their interactions with other granivorous species. This study is a first step towards understanding the roles of reintroducing CWR mammals to arid ecosystems. Possible longer term effects of these reintroductions will depend on suitable regulation of animal numbers, and climatic patterns, as restorative effects of diggings would be greatest during periods of good rainfall, whereas droughts would slow restorative processes. Although the results of this research are unique for Arid Recovery, the principles of evaluating all major ecological roles of reintroduced species and their interactions with their environment could provide guidance for other reintroductions. These interactions are complex and would require longer-term studies over a range of conditions and locations to further understand the role of reintroducing CWR mammals to ecological restoration.

40|$|Habitat {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} has created metapopulations {{where there were}} once continuous populations. Ecologists and conservation biologists have become interested in the optimal way to manage and conserve such metapopulations. Several authors have considered the effect of patch disturbance and recovery on metapopulation persistence, but almost all such studies assume that every patch is equally susceptible to disturbance. We investigated the influence of protecting patches from disturbance on metapopulation persistence, and used a stochastic metapopulation model to answer the question: How can we optimally trade off returns from protection of patches vs. creation of patches? We considered the problem of finding, under budgetary constraints, the optimal combination of {{increasing the number of}} patches in the metapopulation network vs. increasing the number of protected patches in the network. We discovered that the optimal trade-off is dependent upon all of the properties of the system: the species dynamics, the dynamics of the landscape, and the relative costs of each action. A stochastic model and accompanying methodology are provided allowing a manager to determine the optimal policy for small metapopulations. We also provide two approximations, including a rule of thumb, for determining the optimal policy for larger metapopulations. The method is illustrated with an example inspired by information for the <b>greater</b> <b>bilby,</b> Macrotis lagotis, inhabiting southwestern Queensland, Australia. We found that given realistic costs for each action, protection of patches should be prioritized over patch creation for improving the persistence of the <b>greater</b> <b>bilby</b> during the next 20 years.

40|$|Rapid and {{reliable}} physiological evaluation of stress {{is necessary for}} understanding the potential impacts of environmental changes on managed populations of threatened mammals. In situ populations of Australia's iconic marsupial, the <b>greater</b> <b>bilby</b> (Macrotis lagotis), are nearing extinction due to the impacts of competition and predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events (summer heat waves). In this study, we focussed our aim to identify a non-invasive method to measure adrenal activity in the species and also to identify potential factors {{that should be considered}} when comparing physiological stress in semi-free ranging populations of the species. We validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) from fresh fecal pellets taken from bilbies within four captive sites and two semi-free ranging populations around Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Our FCM EIA successfully detected the 'raise and fall' pattern of FCM levels within 3 days of exogenous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Mean FCM levels differed significantly between the captive sites and between sexes. All male bilbies grouped outdoor in captivity expressed the highest mean FCM level in comparison to all captive males that were housed individually or as groups indoors. Also, semi-free ranging bilbies expressed higher mean FCM levels than the captive bilbies. Overall, our study successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in the <b>greater</b> <b>bilby.</b> In the future, it will be worthwhile to consider factors such as housing conditions, sex and location when comparing the adrenal sensitivity to environmental changes, to help evaluate the success of management interventions (such as predator free enclosures) and support the survival of the species.

40|$|Endocrinology of the oestrous cycle, {{pregnancy}} and early lactation {{was investigated in}} captive Western Australian greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis). Initially, six females were monitored for changes in urogenital cytology, plasma progestogen, pericloacal and pouch morphology {{in the absence of}} a male. This was followed by the introduction of a male and a reproductive assessment through mating, gestation and early lactation. In the absence of a male, there was no cyclical pattern of urogenital cytology, pericloacal or pouch development, and progestogen concentrations remained basal. Within 5 days of the introduction of a male, all females had a karyopycnotic index of 100 %. Spermatozoa were present in the urogenital smear within 3 days of male introduction in all five females that gave birth. Five to 9 days after the introduction of a male, there was an increase in plasma progestogen concentration that remained elevated for 14 - 19 days. Six of the seven females gave birth approximately 3 days after reaching peak plasma progestogen concentrations. Gestation length ranged between 14 and 17 days. Plasma progestogen concentrations of the postpartum and early lactation period were lower (P < 0. 0001) than during gestation, but greater (P < 0. 0001) than those recorded before the introduction of a male. One female that gave birth early in the study that was examined until weaning of the pouch young showed a cyclical pattern of plasma progestogen secretion that ended at weaning.

40|$|Since European settlement, the {{distribution}} of the <b>greater</b> <b>bilby</b> (Macrotis lagotis), an omnivorous peramelid marsupial, has contracted into the driest and least fertile parts of its former range. A review of the dietary, metabolic and digestive strategies used by M. lagotis provides the basis for an explanation of its ability to persist in the arid regions where it is now restricted. M. lagotis utilises an opportunistic feeding strategy, selecting dietary items in accordance with their abundance. Termites, ants and seeds, that form a concentrated food source, are prevalent in their diet. In captivity, M. lagotis exhibits a flexible digestive strategy that enables them to use diets of varying nutritional value. However, the absence of a colonic separation mechanism in the hindgut suggests that they are limited to relatively low-fibre diets, and this is reflected in their diet in the field. The low water and maintenance nitrogen requirements of M. lagotis are consistent with arid habitation, but the field metabolic rate is higher than expected for an arid-zone mammal, which suggests that water rather than energy conservation is a priority for this species...|$|E

Scats were collected during five sampling periods over 15 months and dietary items were usually identified to species or genus level using macro and micro-histological techniques. Both species consumed {{a wide variety of}} food items but M. lagotis exhibited a greater use of invertebrate material and B. lesueur consumed more roots and perennial vegetation. Both species consumed a variety of seeds. There was high seasonal variation in the diets of both species and they appeared to be opportunistic dietary generalists, a condition beneficial for survival in the unpredictable arid zone climate. Although both species consumed items from the same broad dietary categories there was little dietary overlap of specific food items. Where overlap existed it was either temporally separated or comprised less than 19 % of the total dietary volume suggesting a degree of resource partitioning between the two species. Whilst M. lagotis appears to have adapted to arid conditions by moving to follow ephemeral growth, B. lesueur is more sedentary and relies more on perennial vegetation. Within re-introduced confined populations where species movement is limited, M. lagotis may be more susceptible to population decline when conditions are dry, whereas B. lesueur may cause significant damage to perennial vegetation before experiencing population decline.

Subsequently, we froze one faecal pellet every 24 h for 19 days. FCM levels in bilby faeces were quantified using an enzyme-immunoassay. Mean FCM levels showed variation (daily mean coefficients of variation [CV %]) of 56. 83 - 171. 65 % over 19 days. Overall, FCM levels were affected by exposure time; however, multiple comparisons showed that no significant change in FCM occurred after environmental exposure (no significant difference in mean FCM between control (Day 1) {{with any of the}} exposure days (Days 2 - 19). Individuals and sex also affected FCM levels. We found no correlation between mean daily CVs with daily minimum-maximum temperatures or rainfall. Our results indicate that FCM in bilby faeces is fairly stable to long-term environmental exposure (19 days). In future, freshly excreted bilby faeces (where the sample maintains a distinct odour for 9 - 13 days) should be used to study FCM levels in wild bilbies.

40|$|Population {{viability}} {{analysis of}} the <b>greater</b> <b>bilby</b> Macrotis lagotis was conducted using the metapopulation model ALEX. ALEX {{was used to examine}} the effect of reintro-duction configurations and potential manipulations on the extinction risk of the metapopulation. More specifically, the impact of patch separation, sporadic big rains and fire on population survival was investigated. Estimates of population parameters, including survival and fecundity, dispersal rate and home range size, were derived from a bilby reintroduction programme con-ducted in central Australia, as were parameters describ-ing environmental quality and the impact of fire, drought and sporadic large rainfa,!l events. The modelling results indicated that local segregation of a population to achieve replication did not change extinc-tion risk dramatically and that an experiment for a 2 -year duration (equivalent to a generation time) could be achieved at low risk with a small population. Adult mor-tality was of key importance in determining population survival. With the release of 12 individuals, drought and sporadic high rainfall events limited the life of the reintro-duced population to a median of 8 years. In the absence of these events, median extinction time was extended to 26 years. The modelling indicated that there was little scope to reduce nvironmental variation (and improve the popula-tion survival prospects) through manipulation or manage-ment of the environment. However, spatially subdividing subpopulations so that they should experience appreciably different big rainfall and drought events has potential to reduce metapopulation ex,!inction risk...|$|E
40|$|Bandicoots and bilbies (order Peramelemorphia) {{represent}} the principle group of omnivorous marsupials {{from a range}} of habitats across Australia and New Guinea. Bandicoots and bilbies most commonly use quadrupedal, asymmetrical half-bounding or bounding gaits and present an unusual assortment of hind limb morphological features, including an ossified patella, a modified tibiofibular joint, and syndactylous morphology of the pes. Comparative dissections of the hind limb of the southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus fusciventer (n = 8) and <b>greater</b> <b>bilby</b> Macrotis lagotis (n= 4) provide an interesting study in the adaptation of soft-tissues in the Peramelemorphia. Bilby hind limb muscle anatomy appeared relatively unspecialised; the arrangement and development of muscles was as expected for a syndactylous marsupial with moderately long, slender limb bones, a semi-flexed stance and an unspecialised digitigrade gait. In contrast, I. obesulus displayed significant modification of the muscular anatomy and associated connective tissues of the hind limb, which appear to reflect adaptation for rapid acceleration and locomotion, including strongly flexed limb posture, long muscle bellies with very short tendons, and extreme development of fascial structures. Differences between the hind limb anatomy of the bandicoot and bilby appear likely to reflect the different ecological and environmental pressures on their locomotor strategy. On one hand, bilbies inhabit open, arid country and retreat a relatively short distance to the shelter of their burrow when threatened. On the other hand, southern brown bandicoots inhabit much more closed environments and use explosive acceleration through dense cover to flee from potential threats...|$|E
40|$|Bandicoots and bilbies (Peramelemorphia) {{represent}} a distinct lineage within the marsupial adaptive radiation, which despite several curious anatomical traits has received little morphological attention. Many bandicoot species (family Peramelidae) dig for subterranean food, while bilbies (family Thylacomyidae) employ their forelimbs to dig extensive burrow systems for shelter. In the current study, dissections {{of the southern}} brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) (n≤ 7) and <b>greater</b> <b>bilby</b> (Macrotis lagotis) (n≤ 4) provide the first anatomical descriptions of forelimb musculature in these species. The anatomical arrangement of forelimb muscles in I. obesulus and M. lagotis {{differs from that of}} other marsupials and corresponds to the aclaviculate pectoral girdle and modified arrangement of digits in the study species. Comparative and functional interpretations indicate that the forelimb of I. obesulus is well equipped for scratch digging and demonstrates muscular modifications in order to generate large out-forces. The bones of the forelimb, and in particular the antebrachium, are relatively short, stout bones, improving both their resistance to mechanical forces and providing a mechanical advantage via a reduced out-lever length. There has been an increase in the absolute volume of muscles employed during digging, thereby increasing the magnitude of the in-force. Increased in-lever lengths have been achieved via the migration of muscle insertions, including the elongate olecranon for the insertion of the m. triceps brachii, and the distal migration of the humeral attachments of the teres major, latissimus dorsi and superficial pectoral muscles...|$|E
