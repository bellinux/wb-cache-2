5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The mission of the laboratory was to develop the electromagnetic isotope separation process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs.|$|E
5|$|The filmmakers <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled {{that they were}} prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|Thompson auditioned in 2006 for {{the role}} of Cameron McIntyre in the long-standing British soap opera Coronation Street. The part would have had him be {{on-screen}} friends with Chesney Brown, played by Sam Aston, who Thompson already <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Carol Godby Theatre Workshop. Producers for Coronation Street, however, were so impressed by Thompson that they asked him to audition for a different role. His try-out was successful and he was given a six-month contract, along with the option to extend it for up to a year. He was cast as Ryan Connor, a boy who moves to Weatherfield—the fictional Greater Manchester setting of Coronation Street—with his mother, Michelle (played by actress and former Hear'Say band member Kym Marsh), and her brothers, Liam (Rob James-Collier) and Paul (Sean Gallagher). The Bolton News reported that Thompson would spend between one and two days in front of the camera, and that he would be given an on-set tutor to help complete his school work.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of Austria-Hungary <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{early days of}} the First World War that it could not count on advances from its principal banking institutions to meet the growing costs of the war. Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany: in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued. As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest bond denomination available was 100 kronen.|$|E
25|$|According to Robert Giroux,"Even {{though the}} police decided, after severe questioning, that Peavey {{was not the}} murderer, the Hollywood {{correspondent}} of the New York Daily News, Florabel Muir, came to a private conclusion that Peavey was the murderer. In that era of ingenious women reporters, Muir thought she could engineer a scoop by tricking Peavey into a confession. She <b>knew</b> (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> movies) that blacks were deathly afraid of ghosts. With the help of two confederates, Frank Carson and Al Weinshank, she offered Peavey ten dollars if he would identify Taylor's grave in the Hollywood Park Cemetery (which she had already visited).|$|E

25|$|After the Battle of Cold Harbor in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign, the Union Army of the Potomac {{slipped away}} from Gen. Robert E. Lee and began {{crossing}} the James River. Although the Overland Campaign's objective {{had been to}} defeat Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in a decisive battle, Grant changed his objective to be the city of Petersburg, an important rail junction that controlled the supplies leading to the Confederate capital of Richmond. Grant knew that Lee could not protect Richmond if Petersburg fell {{and he would be}} forced to battle Grant in the open. He also <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> unsuccessful first assaults on June 9 how weak the Petersburg defenses actually were. Speed was essential to Grant's plan, requiring success before Lee realized Grant's objective and could reinforce Petersburg. Lee was not in fact fully cognizant of Grant's moves until June 18, assuming until then that Grant would target Richmond. Beauregard, however, had been loudly warning of the danger to Petersburg since June 9.|$|E
25|$|The {{first five}} series were {{presented}} by Angela Groothuizen, {{the sixth and}} the seventh by Karel van de Graaf, the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh by Pieter Jan Hagens and the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth series are presented by the winner of 2011: Art Rooijakkers. In the first four seasons, Groothuizen was informed from the beginning who the Mole was, but in her last series (the first celebrity edition), she was not told. Van de Graaf and Bousema (Junior series) chose not to know. Before the final episode of the 2006 version aired, in which Frédérique Huydts was revealed as the winner, she died of cancer. Huydts chose to donate her money to the WWF and KiKa, a fund for children with cancer. She also expressed her wish for the show to be aired normally. When Hagens hosted the eighth season, he didn't know the Mole starting out, but was informed for the fifth episode. In the ninth series he didn't know the Mole at all, but in the tenth and eleventh series he <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start.

500|$|The soundtrack started being {{composed}} before production {{had even}} begun, {{and is a}} notable departure from the band's previous works, as Daft Punk put more emphasis on orchestral elements rather than relying solely on synthesizers. [...] "Synths are a very low level of artificial intelligence," [...] explained member Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, [...] "whereas you have a Stradivarius that will live for a thousand years. We <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start {{that there was no}} way that we were going to do this film score with two synthesizers and a drum machine." ...|$|E
500|$|Due {{to their}} {{decision}} to continue The X-Files television series and try {{to appeal to a}} new generation of viewers, the production personnel <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning of season 8 {{that they were going to}} introduce another female character who would be a believer, as departing character Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) had been a believer. However, the writers wanted a different kind of believer character to contrast with the sceptical nature of John Doggett, who had already been established. The writers were required to create a character who was unlike any of the preconceived main characters that were a part of the series. This female character was initially named Karen Miller and then Jane Jones before the name [...] "Monica Reyes" [...] was decided upon, named after a friend of series creator Chris Carter's acquaintance who had an art gallery in Vancouver.|$|E

500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} {{that she wanted to}} write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit.

500|$|... "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and the {{previous}} episode, [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, and both were directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first Doctor Who credits. Much of the episode was filmed around the desert area of Almería, Spain, where studios have built Wild West-style streets {{that have been used}} in the making of over 100 Western-set films, such as A Fistful of Dollars. Filming the episode in Spain was cheaper than constructing a set in the UK. Moffat stated, [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> start we need some serious location shooting for this one, and given the most iconic American setting imaginable, there was only one place to go– Spain." [...] They reportedly filmed there from 8 March to 17 March 2012. Filming took place at Oasys/Mini Hollywood, and Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood. While Smith was allowed to try riding the horse, most of the action shown in the episode was done by his stuntman. Composer Murray Gold mimicked Western-style scores when creating the music for the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Mecha-Streisand" [...] parodies Kaiju {{films such}} as Godzilla, Gamera, Mothra, and Ultraman. Parker and Stone watched many [...] Godzilla films during their childhoods, and Parker said he <b>knew</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of South Park that he would base an episode around the films. Streisand is based on Mechagodzilla, the mechanical doppelgänger of Godzilla. Smith is based on Mothra, the giant moth-like monster from the 1961 film Mothra and also one of Godzilla's rivals, which Parker described as his favorite of the Kaiju films. The scene in which six-inch-tall twins appear and ask actor Sidney Poitier to fight Mecha-Streisand are based on similar scenes and characters from the Mothra film. Poitier portrays a monster similar to Gamera, a flying turtle monster, and film critic Leonard Maltin transforms into a giant mechanical superhero resembling that of Japanese television superhero Ultraman. During the fights sequence, Stan shouts for Smith to [...] "use robot punch", a line frequently used in Ultraman television shows. The Diamond of Pantheos, on the other hand, closely resembles the pendant worn by a major character in the anime Galaxy Express 999.|$|E
