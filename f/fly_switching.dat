40|$|LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) {{codes are}} among the most {{powerful}} and widely adopted modern error correcting codes. The iterative decoding algorithms required for these codes involve high computational complexity and high processing throughput is achieved by allocating a sufficient number of processing elements (PEs). Supporting multiple heterogeneous LDPC codes on a parallel decoder poses serious problems {{in the design of the}} interconnect structure for such PEs. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of NoC (Network on Chip) based decoders, where full flexibility in terms of supported LDPC codes is obtained resorting to an NoC to connect PEs. NoC based LDPC decoders have been previously considered unfeasible because of the cost overhead associated to packet management and routing. On the contrary, the designed NoC adopts a low complexity routing, which introduces a very limited cost overhead with respect to architectures dedicated to specific classes of codes. Moreover the paper proposes an efficient configuration technique, which allows for fast on [...] the [...] <b>fly</b> <b>switching</b> among different codes. The decoder architecture is scalable and VLSI synthesis results are presented for several cases of study, including the whole set of WiMAX LDPC codes, WiFi codes and DVB-S 2 standard...|$|E

In the fruit <b>fly</b> Drosophila, <b>switching</b> <b>flies</b> between temperatures alters {{the rate at}} which mortality subsequently increases with age but does not reverse mortality rate.

40|$|Dietary {{restriction}} (DR) {{has been}} shown {{in a wide variety of}} model organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, to increase lifespan and health span. It is unclear how much of this effect is due to a DR-induced increase in physical activity. β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation {{has been shown}} in improve health span in Drosophila. The exact mechanism of this effect has not yet been elucidated but it is possible that, like DR, HMB increases health span through increased physical activity. In this study, the spontaneous flight activity (SFA) and spontaneous walking (activity) was measured at one and five weeks after eclosion for flies raised on low yeast, HMB-supplemented, and normal laboratory diet. To see if any effects of diet were immediate or occurred from life-long consumption, <b>flies</b> were <b>switched</b> to a new diet and their SWA and SFA was measured. Also, to see if age had any effects on the association between diet and physical activity, SFA and SWA were measured in flies one week (young) and five weeks (old) after eclosion. We hypothesized that (i) HMB and dietary restriction will increase SFA and SWA activity compared to a standard laboratory diet in young flies and that the effect of dietary restriction would be immediate; and (ii) HMB and dietary restriction will increase SFA and SWA compared to a standard laboratory diet in old flies and that this effect would be more pronounced than that in younger flies. No association between spontaneous activity and diet was found, either in young flies or in older <b>flies.</b> In <b>switching</b> experiments, no significant change in spontaneous activity was found, concluding that there was no immediate or long-term effect of diet on physical activity. From this, we concluded that DR-induced increased lifespan and HMB-induced increased health span are likely not due to increased physical activity...|$|R

However, only about 30 % of flies from puparia deposited in female roosts and 57 % of flies from puparia deposited in male roosts emerged in the presence of Bechstein's bats and were thus able to survive. The significantly higher emergence success of bat flies in male roosts was caused by the higher roost fidelity of the solitary males compared with the social females.

40|$|International audienceAdaptive Metropolis (AM) is a {{powerful}} recent algorithmic tool in numerical Bayesian data analysis. AM builds on a well-known Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm but optimizes the rate of convergence to the target distribution by automatically tuning the design parameters of the algorithm on the <b>fly.</b> Label <b>switching</b> {{is a major problem}} in inference on mixture models because of the invariance to symmetries.

In this paper we describe an online relabeling procedure which can be incorporated into the AM algorithm.

40|$|Animals {{that have}} a long pre-reproductive adult stage often employ {{mechanisms}} that minimize aging over this period {{in order to preserve}} reproductive lifespan. In a remarkable exception, one tephritid fruit fly exhibits substantial pre-reproductive aging but then mitigates this aging during a diet-dependent transition to the reproductive stage, after which life expectancy matches that of newly emerged flies. Here, we ascertain the role of nutrients, sexual maturation and mating in mitigation of previous aging in female Queensland fruit flies. Flies were provided one of three diets: ‘sugar’, ‘essential’, or ‘yeast-sugar’. Essential diet contained sugar and micronutrients found in yeast but lacked maturation-enabling protein. At days 20 and 30, a subset of flies on the sugar diet were switched to essential or yeast-sugar diet, and some yeast-sugar fed flies were mated 10 days later.

40|$|Natural {{images are}} often modeled through piecewise-smooth regions. Region edges, which {{correspond}} to {{the contours of the}} objects, become, in this model, the main information of the signal. Contours have the property of being smooth functions along the direction of the edge, and irregularities on the perpendicular direction. Modeling edges with the minimum possible number of terms is of key importance for numerous applications, such as image coding, segmentation or denoising. Standard separable basis fail to provide sparse enough representation of contours, {{due to the fact that}} this kind of basis do not see the regularity of edges. In order to be able to detect this regularity, a new method based on (possibly redundant) sets of basis functions able to capture the geometry of images is needed. This thesis presents, in a first stage, a study about the features that basis functions should have in order to provide sparse representations of a piecewise-smooth image. This study emphasizes the need for edge-adapted basis functions, capable to accurately capture local orientation and anisotropic scaling of image structures. The need of different anisotropy degrees and orientations in the basis function set leads to the use of redundant dictionaries. However, redundant dictionaries have the inconvenience of giving no unique sparse image decompositions, and from all the possible decompositions of a signal in a redundant dictionary, just the sparsest is needed. There are several algorithms that allow to find sparse decompositions over redundant dictionaries, but most of these algorithms do not always guarantee that the optimal approximation has been recovered. To cope with this problem, a mathematical study about the properties of sparse approximations is performed. From this, a test to check whether a given sparse approximation is the sparsest is provided. The second part of this thesis presents a novel image approximation scheme, based on the use of a redundant dictionary. This scheme allows to have a good approximation of an image with a number of terms much smaller than the dimension of the signal. This novel approximation scheme is based on a dictionary formed by a combination of anisotropically refined and rotated wavelet-like mother functions and Gaussians. An efficient Full Search Matching Pursuit algorithm to perform the image decomposition in such a dictionary is designed. Finally, a geometric image coding scheme based on the image approximated over the anisotropic and rotated dictionary of basis functions is designed. The coding performances of this dictionary are studied. Coefficient quantization appears to be of crucial importance in the design of a Matching Pursuit based coding scheme. Thus, a quantization scheme for the MP coefficients has been designed, based on the theoretical energy upper bound of the MP algorithm and the empirical observations of the coefficient distribution and evolution. Thanks to this quantization, our image coder provides low to medium bit-rate image approximations, while it allows for on the <b>fly</b> resolution <b>switching</b> and several other affine image transformations to be performed directly in the transformed domain...|$|R
