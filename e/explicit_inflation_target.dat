50|$|In a {{historic}} shift on 25 January 2012, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke set a 2% target inflation rate, bringing the Fed {{in line with}} many of the world's other major central banks. Until then, the Fed's policy committee, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), did not have an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target</b> but regularly announced a desired target range for inflation (usually between 1.7% and 2%) measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index.|$|E
50|$|An <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target</b> {{was first}} set in October 1992 by Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, {{following}} the UK's {{departure from the}} Exchange Rate Mechanism. Initially, the target {{was based on the}} RPIX, which is the RPI calculated excluding mortgage interest payments. This was felt to be a better measure of the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy. It was argued that if interest rates are used to curb inflation, then including mortgage payments in the inflation measure would be misleading. Until 1997, interest rates were set by the Treasury.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{main reason}} for fear of {{floating}} arises from the combination of lack of credibility, a high pass-through from exchange rates to prices and inflation targeting. This is also motivated {{by the fact that}} there is trend in emerging markets to couple floating with <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target.</b> Calvo and Reinhart present a simple model to show [...] "fear of floating" [...] is attributed to lack of credibility and inflation targeting. The main idea is that large exchange rate volatility may lead to inflation volatility, which reduces the credibility of monetary policymakers for inflation targeting. This high inflation volatility is very costly due to higher risk premia, hedging costs and unforeseen redistribution of wealth.|$|E
40|$|Johnson’s paper {{addresses}} one of {{the main}} issues of central banking: How successful have monetary authorities been in acquiring credibility for their inflation objectives? Johnson’s approach is both simple and elegant. For countries with <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targets,</b> he examines whether inflation expectations are consistent with those targets. Since not all central banks have <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targets,</b> he also asks whether inflation has been easily predictable, since this is viewed as one indicator of the successful implementation of monetary policy. The results, though mixed, are not particularly favourable for those countries with <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targets.</b> Most countries that tried to establish “credible ” <b>inflation</b> <b>targets</b> over the sample period failed, and inflation was in general no easier to predict in countries with targets than in those without. <b>Inflation</b> and <b>Inflation</b> <b>Targets</b> It is useful to place this study {{in the context of the}} remarkable inflation environment that existed during the sample period: global inflation, having accelerated in the late 1980 s, then fell to its lowest level in decades.

40|$|The {{possible}} short-run trade-off {{between the}} inflation (gap) and the output (gap) remains a critical policy issue for any emerging economy; particularly when an implicit or an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targeting</b> monetary policy is considered. The New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) has recently {{set up a}} framework on the trade-off between the inflation (gap) {{and the difference between}} the actual output and potential (efficient) output under the assumption of real wage rigidities. In this paper, we estimate the NKPC based on this framework for the Turkish economy over a period of implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targeting</b> monetary policy.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{measure of}} inflation in the UK {{for many years}} was the Retail Prices Index (the RPI), which was first calculated in the early 20th Century to evaluate {{the extent to which}} workers were affected by price changes during the first world war. An <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target</b> was first set in October 1992 by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont following the departure of the UK from the Exchange Rate Mechanism.

40|$|The paper {{incorporates}} three institutional {{design features}} into a Kydland-Prescott, Barro-Gordon monetary policy game. It shows that goal-independence and goal-transparency (an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target)</b> {{at the central}} bank are substitute ‘commitment technologies’ that reduce inflation and build credibility. In addition, goal-transparency is shown to be socially superior as it also lowers public’s monitoring cost. Nevertheless, independent central bankers {{are less likely to}} embrace it if they perceive public scrutiny (accountability) as intrusive. Combining these findings implies that both goal-transparency and accountability will be negatively related to goal-independence for which we present empirical support using established indices. Our analysis further suggests that, to avoid an inferior equilibrium with opaque objectives and a ‘democratic deficit’, institutional reforms should follow the Bank of England scenario, in which an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target</b> is first legislated and only then instrument (but not goal) independence granted. accountability; central bank independence; inflation targeting; monitoring; transparency...|$|E

40|$|The {{implications}} of uncertain policy preferences for the targeting and contracting approaches to monetary policy are investigated. It is shown that, {{in the presence}} of uncertain preferences, a linear incentive contract in the sense of Walsh performs better than an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target</b> as proposed by Svensson. The reason is that an inflation target produces a higher variance of inflation. It is also shown that itis optimal to offer a linear inflation contract that does not depend on the degree of preference uncertainty. ...|$|E

40|$|Inflation-targeting regimes (like {{those of}} New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Sweden) are {{interpreted}} as having <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>targets</b> and implicit employment targets. Without employment persistence, an 'inflation-target-conservative' central bank eliminates the inflation bias, mimics an optimal inflation contract, and dominates a Rogoff 'weight-conservative' central bank.

Our findings suggest that determinacy under rational expectations may {{not be sufficient to}} reach the target. Instead, monetary policy should be fine-tuned to correct agents' biased beliefs...|$|E

40|$|Is {{inflation}} targeting {{suitable for}} the United States? Given that the Federal Reserve has not announced an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target,</b> how does one answer that question? If {{the answer is that}} inflation targeting is not {{suitable for the}} United States, what follows? Does the central bank not control inflation? Alternatively, if the central bank does control inflation, is there no need in a democracy for the central bank to make public its intentions with respect to inflation? Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) who have opposed an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target</b> have also answered {{the question of whether the}} central bank controls inflation in the affirmative. So there is something too simplistic about the follow-up question about central bank accountability. Surely, there is something more to the opposition than a desire to avoid accountability. Laurence Meyer (2001 : 12), when a Federal Reserve governor, explained the complication as follows: The most important question that has to be addressed in order to assess the costs and benefits of a move in this direction [announcement of an explicit numerical inflation target] is whether it could be accomplished without reducing the flexibility the Fed now has to pursue a dual mandate. The Fed’s Dual Mandate What is the dual mandate?

40|$|Inflation Targeting (IT) is a macro-monetary policy tool, {{originally}} {{introduced in}} New Zealand and now adopted by several countries, {{that can lead}} to relatively stable and low inflation rates through the adoption of an <b>explicit</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>target,</b> one that can, if successful, lead to enhanced credibility, transparency, and accountability. While noting some of the pros and cons, evidence reveals considerable success in various less-developed countries (LDCs) with this approach, though results with respect to DCs are rather mixed.

In countries where, {{for a variety of}} reasons, the determinants of inflation could lead it to follow a non-stationary process, the adoption of an inflation targeting framework should therefore induce a fundamental change in the stochastic process governing inflation. This paper studies the time series properties of Mexican inflation during 1995 - 2006, using recently developed techniques to detect a change in the persistence of economic time series. Consistent with the adoption of an inflation-targeting framework, the results suggest that inflation in Mexico seems to have switched from a nonstationary to a stationary process around the end of year 2000 or the beginning of 2001.
