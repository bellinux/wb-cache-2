5|$|The new {{development}} team was mostly recruited {{on the game}} developers website Gamasutra and worked in a small studio in Lazur's apartment, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

5|$|The {{game has}} the player {{controlling}} the main character, Amaterasu, in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, {{which looks like}} an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as ink wash painting, sumi-e) with other styles of art. The gameplay style {{is a mix of}} action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to The Legend of Zelda series, an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, <b>has</b> <b>admitted</b> has influenced his general game design. The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace. By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.|$|E
