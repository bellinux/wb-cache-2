40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{assesses the}} {{possible}} use of Korat clays, deposited at Suranaree University of Technology (SUT), {{for the production}} of lightweight aggregates. The SUT clays were collected and divided into 2 groups, i. e. white clay and reddish brown clay, to study their heat-treatment behavior. The SUT clay mixtures in various ratios were investigated to find the suitable compositions and heat-treatment (between 1000 and 1250 °C) {{for the production of}} lightweight aggregates. After firing at 1250 °C, the SUT clays expanded 21. 05 and 5. 70 % for the white and reddish brown clays, respectively. <b>Firing</b> <b>expansion</b> was mainly dependent on the amount of SiO 2, fluxing oxides and water of the raw materials. These aggregates are highly impervious to water and exhibit considerable <b>firing</b> <b>expansion,</b> low bulk density (1. 29 - 1. 76 g/cm 3) and fair technical properties (unit weight and bending strength) for lightweight concrete. These results encourage the use of these clays for the production of lightweight aggregates...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} use of zeolitic rocks {{for the production}} of lightweight aggregates was assessed, investigating both the expansion at high temperature and the technological features of fired products. Eighteen zeolite-bearing rocks from Sardinia, Campania and Tuscany (Italy) were taken into account. The <b>firing</b> <b>expansion</b> depends mainly on the chemical composition (especially silica and fluxing oxides) and the water content (largely related to the zeolite amount). Other relevant parameters are the temperature of maximum expansion (1350 - 1500 °C, without additives) and soaking time (2 - 5 minutes). Some products are highly impervious (water absorption 100 % vol.), a low bulk density (0. 5 - 0. 7 g-cm 3) and fair technical properties (loose weight and strength of particles). These encouraging results make some of the investigated tuffs interesting raw materials {{for the production of}} lightweight aggregates...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assess the possible use of Italian zeolitic rocks for the production of lightweight aggregates. In particular, both the expansion at high temperature and the technological features of fired products were investigated. Fifteen zeolite-bearing volcanoclastites from Northern Sardinia and three zeolitized tuffs from Campania and Tuscany (Sorano and Campanian ignimbrites and Neapolitan Yellow Tuff) were taken into account. The <b>firing</b> <b>expansion</b> turned out to be mainly dependent on the chemical composition (especially SiO 2 and fluxing oxides such as Fe 2 O 3, Na 2 O, K 2 O, MgO and CaO) and the water content (largely related to the zeolite amount) of the raw materials. Other relevant parameters were the temperature of maximum expansion (ranging between 1350 and 1500 °C, without additives) and soaking time (between 2 and 5 min).

40|$|California shrubland {{wildfires}} {{are increasingly}} destructive, {{and it is}} widely held that {{the problem has been}} intensified by fire suppression, leading to larger, more intense wildfires. However, analysis of the California Statewide Fire History Database shows that, since 1910, fire frequency and area burned have not declined, and fire size has not increased. Fire rotation intervals have declined, and fire season has not changed, implying that fire intensity has not increased. Fire frequency and population density were correlated, and it is suggested that fire suppression plays a critical role in offsetting potential impacts of increased ignitions. Large fires were not dependent on old age classes of fuels, and it is thus unlikely that age class manipulation of fuels can prevent large <b>fires.</b> <b>Expansion</b> of the urban-wildland interface is a key factor in wildland fire destruction.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that {{information}} technology {{plays an important role}} in facilitating disaster management and in allowing planners for a more efficient disaster handling. Today distributed architectures have been proposed in the area of environmental engineering which presents several advantages compared to the centralized frameworks. However, the current systems lack of methods that allow experts to dynamically construct, retrieve and exchange disaster management plans, stimulate orchestration between several simulation models according to the workflow (plan) constraints and recommends the most appropriate management plans according to the past experiences. This gap is addressed in this paper by proposing a novel architectural design framework, using the design principles of the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that allows interoperably description and construction of disaster management plans, easy service orchestration and execution as well as dynamic decision making and disaster management plan ranking.

In this article we describe {{the results of a}} field survey and literature review study to characterise and describe the current condition of peatlands in the Toledo Mountains in terms of their typology, the representation of habitat types protected by European (EU) designations, threats, endangered plant species, and conservation status. Our results suggest that the principal threats are overgrazing by domestic animals and ungulates (red deer and wild boar), <b>fire,</b> <b>expansion</b> of cereal crops, drying-out and erosion.

40|$|A {{case study}} of a real forest fire {{incident}} is presented, where field measurements held out near the flame-front in smoky, hostile conditions.

40|$|In 2004, many {{large-scale}} fires {{occurred in}} Alaska and the burned area encompassed about 26, 700 km 2. This {{was the largest}} burned area since 1956, and combined with an additional 19, 000 km 2 burned in 2005 (third-largest fire year), the total burned area comprised about 10 % of the Alaskan boreal forest in just two years. To clarify {{the background of the}} many large-scale fires in 2004, spatial and temporal analyses using various data were performed in this paper. The derived results allow the following conclusion. Dry and warm weather conditions with strong persistent winds are crucial for fires. In 2004, easterly winds from Canada caused two daily hotspot peaks in late June and late August; one daily hotspot peak in mid-July was caused by southwesterly winds from Bethel or the Bristol Bay. These persistent winds lasted for about one week and promoted <b>fire</b> <b>expansion.</b> The above wind conditions in June and August were caused by the development of a high-pressure system over the Beaufort Sea under a persistent blocking ridge over Alaska...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, ship’s {{engine room}} is fire {{protected}} by automatic fire fighting systems, usually controlled {{from a place}} located outside the engine room. In order to activate the water mist extinguishing system automatically, at least two different fire detectors have to be activated.

As a consequence, the automatic water mist extinguishing system is also delayed, allowing for <b>fire</b> <b>expansion</b> and its transfer to surrounding rooms. In addition to reliability of the ship’s fire detection system as one of the crucial safety features for the ship, cargo, crew and passengers, using a systematic approach in this research the emphasis is placed on the application of new methods in smoke detection such as the computer image processing and analysis, in order to achieve this goal.

40|$|ABSTRACT] Recently, big {{forest fires}} were {{reported}} in Indonesia every several years. According to {{the information from the}} Ministry of Forestry of Republic of Indonesia, the attacked areas were about 300 thousand, 162 thousand and 19 thousand hectors in 1997, 1994 and 1991, respectively. Early detection of forest fires and early attack to them are considered important for preventing such big fires and a new satellite observation system coupled with NOAA and HIMAWARI (GMS) was installed in Bogor in July 1997 by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The early detection system was developed and is being used in practical way for the project. The hot spots derived from NOAA data taken in midnight are overlayed on HIMAWARI images for observing smoke plumes and on TM with GIS information for identifying the ground conditions around the fires. Estimation of danger of <b>fire</b> <b>expansion,</b> however, is required when we have to put priorities for attacking them.

For this reason an urgent need for environmental protection and preservation has been raised in the last years. This paper, presents a new approach dedicated to forest fire detection and based on wireless sensor network and fuzzy logic that performs a real-time monitoring system in order to detect forest fires and avoid considerable damages. Wireless sensor networks are used in many fields and have been deployed in a variety of applications ranging from monitoring a small room to large forests. The use of wireless sensor networks in forest fire detection applications becomes an efficient approach to early detect fires in order to minimize damages and save human life. The proposed system consists of several sensor nodes having the architecture of the System-on-Chip (SoC), CC 2430. Each sensor node acquires the appropriate information and sends it to the base station node connected to a personal computer. All the nodes in the monitoring area are alimented by a PV cell, collect the information of temperature, humidity and wind speed. The collected information is the input variables of the fuzzy logic of the system applied to detect forest fires. So, it will send real-time alarm messages and deliver the forest fire risk level to the monitoring authorities in order to undertake immediate actions...|$|R
