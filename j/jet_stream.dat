5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical jet streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> in these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar <b>jet</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Climate {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> will gradually weaken {{as a result of}} global warming. Trends such as Arctic sea ice decline, reduced snow cover, evapotranspiration patterns, and other weather anomalies are expected to make the Arctic heat up faster than other parts of the globe. This in turn reduces the temperature gradient that drives <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> winds, causing the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> to become weaker and more variable in its course.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|Upper-level <b>jet</b> <b>streams.</b> Associated with {{upper level}} <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the <b>jet</b> <b>streams.</b> The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} <b>jet</b> <b>streams,</b> {{caused by the}} convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating. The factors that control the number of <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> decreases.|$|R
5|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>streams</b> {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. <b>Jet</b> <b>streams</b> may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the jet.|$|R
5|$|Scientists are {{investigating}} ways {{to harness the}} wind energy within the <b>jet</b> <b>stream.</b> According to one estimate, of the potential wind energy in the <b>jet</b> <b>stream,</b> only 1 percent {{would be needed to}} meet the world's current energy needs. The required technology would reportedly take 10–20 years to develop.|$|E
5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and <b>jet</b> <b>stream.</b> The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar <b>jet</b> <b>stream.</b> Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E

5|$|It is {{different}} for places with a Mediterranean climate. In the western United States, {{during the cold}} season from September–May, extratropical cyclones from the Pacific Ocean move inland into the region due to a southward migration of the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> during the cold season. This shift in the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> brings much of the annual precipitation to the region, and sometimes also brings heavy rain and strong low pressure systems. The peninsula of Italy has weather {{very similar to the}} western United States in this regard.|$|E
5|$|The mid-level African easterly jet {{occurs during}} the Northern Hemisphere summer between 10°N and 20°N above West Africa, and the nocturnal poleward {{low-level}} jet {{occurs in the}} Great Plains of east and South Africa. The low-level easterly African <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> is considered to {{play a crucial role}} in the southwest monsoon of Africa, and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season. The formation of the thermal low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> from June into October.|$|E

40|$|Although few weather {{phenomena}} {{have the}} ability to affect weather on a global scale, the <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> are one such phenomenon. These bands of high-speed wind roar through the atmosphere 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 10 miles) above Earth's surface.

5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E
5|$|The {{southwest}} summer monsoon, {{a four-month}} period when massive convective thunderstorms dominate India's weather, is Earth's most productive wet season. A product of southeast trade winds originating from a high-pressure mass centred over the southern Indian Ocean, the monsoonal torrents supply over 80% of India's annual rainfall. Attracted by a low-pressure region centred over South Asia, the mass spawns surface winds that ferry humid air into India from the southwest. These inflows ultimately {{result from a}} northward shift of the local <b>jet</b> <b>stream,</b> which itself results from rising summer temperatures over Tibet and the Indian subcontinent. The void left by the <b>jet</b> <b>stream,</b> which switches from a route {{just south of the}} Himalayas to one tracking north of Tibet, then attracts warm, humid air.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} basically {{describes the}} existence of the <b>jet</b> <b>stream,</b> a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the tropopause which is (even though other factors are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.|$|E

40|$|The {{high-speed}} {{winds of}} <b>jet</b> <b>streams,</b> found {{near the top}} of the troposphere, play a major role in guiding weather systems. Many factors, including Earth's rotation and the Sun's uneven heating of Earth's surface, contribute to the formation of the powerful eastward flows of the <b>jet</b> <b>streams.</b> This interactive slide show from NOVA Online provides an overview of the factors that create these powerful meteorological forces.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the mean {{latitude}} of the sub-tropical <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> in both hemispheres have shifted toward the poles over the last few decades. This paper presents a study of the movement of both the subtropical and Polar fronts, the location of the respective <b>jet</b> <b>streams,</b> between 1979 and 2010 at mid-latitudes, using total ozone measurements to identify the sharp horizontal boundary that occurs at the position of the fronts. Previous {{studies have shown}} that the two fronts are the boundaries of three distinct regimes in the stratosphere, corresponding to the Hadley, Ferrel, and polar meridionally overturning circulation cells in the troposphere. Over the period of study the horizontal area of the Hadley cell has increased at latitudes between 20 and 60 degrees while the area of the Polar cell has decreased. A linear regression analysis was performed to identify the major factors associated with the movement of the subtropical <b>jet</b> <b>streams.</b> These were: (1) changes in the Tropical land plus ocean temperature, (2) direct radiative forcing from greenhouse gases in the troposphere, (3) changes in the temperature of the lower tropical stratosphere, (4) the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, and (5) volcanic eruptions. The dominant mechanism was the direct radiative forcing from greenhouse gases. Between 1979 and 2010 the poleward movement of the subtropical <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> was 3. 7 ± 0. 3 degrees in the Northern Hemisphere and 6. 5 ± 0. 2 degrees in the Southern Hemisphere. Previous {{studies have shown that}} weather systems tend to follow the <b>jet</b> <b>streams.</b> The observed poleward movement in both hemispheres over the past thirty years represents a significant change in the position of the sub-tropical <b>jet</b> <b>streams,</b> which should lead to significant latitudinal shifts in the global weather patterns and the hydrologic cycle...|$|R
5|$|El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{influences}} the average location of upper-level jet streams, {{and leads to}} cyclical variations in precipitation and temperature across North America, as well as affecting tropical cyclone development across the eastern Pacific and Atlantic basins. Combined with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, ENSO can also impact cold season rainfall in Europe. Changes in ENSO also change {{the location of the}} <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> over South America, which partially affects precipitation distribution over the continent.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II the Japanese {{fire balloon}} was {{designed}} as a cheap weapon intended {{to make use of the}} <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> over the Pacific Ocean to reach the west coast of Canada and the United States. They were relatively ineffective as weapons, but they were used in one of the few attacks on North America during World War II, causing six deaths and a small amount of damage.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperatures}} and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area. CAPE values, a {{measurement of the}} level of tropospheric instability, were over 1000J/kg, and helicity levels, a measurement of the potential for rotating winds, reached over 200m²/s². The upper level <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> also contributed a large amount of wind shear. These factors were all indicative of a high potential for severe weather.|$|E
5|$|Associated with <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by <b>jet</b> <b>streams.</b> The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two major}} but {{divergent}} scientific articles about <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> power.

However, Miller, Gans, & Kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 TW and that the climatic impact would be catastrophic.|$|E
