40|$|The {{effect of}} binary aqueous {{mixtures}} of ethylene glycol (EG), formamide (FA), N-methylformamide (NMF), dimethylformamide (DMF), and their pure phase on the apparent molar volume ϕV of the bolaamphiphile <b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (C 10 Me 6) {{has been investigated}} at 298. 15 K. The behavior of standard molar volumes and transfer volumes ΔtϕV of C 10 Me 6 from water to solvent/water (S/W) binary mixtures, shows different minima and maxima depending on {{the composition of the}} solvent. This behavior is influenced {{by the nature of the}} cosolvent and on the type of the solute and more or less corresponds to volumetric changes in the S/W mixture. The investigation of the transfer volumes in different fixed concentrations reveals an inversion of ΔtϕV values between the compositions, which suggests a differentiation of the effects of different volume contributions on the partial molar volume of ions...|$|E
40|$|A RECENT SURVEY of the {{literature}} 1 revealed little information {{on the influence of}} exercise on the course of the neuromuscular block induced in man by quaternary ammonium-type relaxants. Consequently, observations on the effects of the rate of exercise on the partial jneunpmuscular block were included in a comparative study 2 carried out with fiv|e relaxants in unanaesthetized human subjects. MATERIAL A. ND METHODS This investigation was carried out in five male and five female healthy, adult volunteers. The relaxants studied wete d-tubocurarine chlorine (d-Tc), toxiferine chloride (toxiferine), { 3 gallamine fliethiodide (gallamine), <b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (CIO), and succinylcholine (S h). In preliminary studies, the dose of each drug which produced a 90 to 95 per cent decrease of the grip strength, or a 50 to 55 per cent decrease of vital capac:ity, whichever was greater, was selected. The enzymatic hydrolysis of SCh was prevented by the intravenous administra- 4 tion of 0. 3 mg. /kg. of hexafluorenium a selective inhibitor of plasma cholinesterase.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} further {{the effects of}} paralysis on skeletal development in the chick embryo, paralysis was induced at 6 days of incubation by dropping 0. 2 % solution of <b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> onto the chorioallantoic membrane and maintaining paralysis through to 20 days of incubation. General effects of paralysis included lower body weight, marked subcutaneous oedema, twisting of the neck to the right with marked rigidity, and protrusion of the lower beak beyond the upper. Skeletal abnormalities included cartilaginous and later bony fusion between cervical vertebrae and distortion of scapula and pubis. Long bones were normal in their general form but showed marked reductions in full length and in length of the calcified diaphysis. The patella occasionally underwent chondrification, unlike the tibial cartilage at the tarsus. Reduction in length of the bones of both jaws occurred but was substantially greater in the upper, resulting in the protrusion of the lower. Ossification times of most skeletal elements were little affected by paralysis but some centres appearing nearer the end of incubation showed slight delay in their times of appearance...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{appreciated}} that studying the embryonic chick in ovo provides a variety of advantages, including the potential to control the embryo’s environment and its movement independently of maternal influences. This allowed early workers to identify movement as a pivotal factor {{in the development of}} the locomotor apparatus. With an increasing focus on the earliest detectable movements, we have exploited this system by developing novel models and schemes to examine the influence of defined periods of movement during musculoskeletal develop-ment. Utilizing drugs with known neuromuscular actions to provoke hyperactivity (4 -aminopyridine, AP) and either rigid (<b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> DMB) or flaccid (pancuronium bromide, PB) paralysis, we have examined the role of movement in joint, osteochondral and muscle development. Our initial studies focusing on the joint showed that AP-induced hyperactivity had little, if any, effect on the timing or scope of joint cavity elaboration, suggesting that endogenous activity levels provide sufficient stimulus, and additional mobilization is without effect. By contrast, imposition of either rigid or flaccid paralysis prior to cavity formation completely blocked this process and, with time, produced fusion of cartilaginous elements and formation of continuous single cartilaginous rods across loca...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, Qams, are an {{important}} class of chemicals which present interesting challenges to analysts. This thesis reports results of investigations on uses of ion-pairing techniques for separations and detection of Qams. Special apparatus for post-column solvent extraction of liquid chromatographic eluates was developed {{as part of this}} work. Analyses for Qams were developed using ion-pair extraction techniques with bromophenol blue, anthraquinone sulfate and naphthyl sulfate as ion-pair extraction reagents. Bulk extraction experiments were executed to evaluate the dependance of the ion-pair reagent concentration on the extraction efficiency of Qam ion pairs. The pH dependance on extraction efficiency for gallamine triethiodide and <b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide,</b> bromophenol blue ion pairs was also evaluated. A solvent segmented flow injection analysis system was designed and assembled for the rapid evaluation of ion-pair extraction efficiency of several different Qams with bromophenol blue as the ion-pair extraction reagent. Separations of Qams using ion-pair liquid chromatography were developed using reverse phase columns and both alkyl sulfonic acid and tetramethylammonium salts in the mobile phase as ion-pair liquid chromatography reagents. A continuous post-column solvent extraction system was developed for the detection of Qam bromophenol blue ion pairs with bromophenol blue being added directly to the mobile phase eluents. Both isochratic and gradient separations were developed for several Qams which have medical importance...|$|E
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{regulation}} of morphogenesis in synovial joints. Mechanical forces generated from muscle contractions are required for normal development of several aspects of normal skeletogenesis. Here we show that biophysical stimuli generated by muscle contractions impact multiple events during chick knee joint morphogenesis influencing differential growth of the skeletal rudiment epiphyses and patterning of the emerging tissues in the joint interzone. Immobilisation of chick embryos was achieved through treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent <b>Decamethonium</b> <b>Bromide.</b> The effects on development of the knee joint were examined using a combination of computational modelling to predict alterations in biophysical stimuli, detailed morphometric analysis of 3 D digital representations, cell proliferation assays and in situ hybridisation to examine the expression of a selected panel of genes known to regulate joint development. This work revealed the precise changes to shape, particularly in the distal femur, that occur in an altered mechanical environment, corresponding to predicted changes in the spatial and dynamic patterns of mechanical stimuli and region specific changes in cell proliferation rates. In addition, we show altered patterning of the emerging tissues of the joint interzone with the loss of clearly defined and organised cell territories revealed by loss of characteristic interzone gene expression and abnormal expression of cartilage markers. This work shows that local dynamic patterns of biophysical stimuli generated from muscle contractions in the embryo act as a source of positional informatio...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor of the alpha 4 /non-alpha (alpha 4 /n alpha) type was reconstituted in Xenopus oocytes after nuclear injection of cDNA expression vectors. Functional neuronal receptor was only formed when the two subunits alpha 4 and n alpha were coinjected, neither alpha 4 nor n alpha alone being effective. Responses to bath application of acetylcholine (AcCho) have been measured in voltage clamp. AcCho doses as low as 10 nM induce currents of up to 50 nA. Dose-response studies indicate a Kd of about 0. 77 x 10 (- 6) M and a Hill coefficient of 1. 5, thus predicting more than one AcCho binding site per receptor molecule. The current-voltage relationship of AcCho-induced currents presents a strong inward rectification. Responses to AcCho were compared to those of three other agonists: L-nicotine, carbachol, and 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). Sensitivities to AcCho, nicotine, and DMPP are quite similar. Sensitivity to carbachol is much lower, but the currents are otherwise indistinguishable from those induced by AcCho. Five AcCho antagonists [...] neuronal bungarotoxin (kappa-bungarotoxin), tubocurarine (TC), hexamethonium bromide (Hex), <b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Dec), and mecamylamine (Mec) [...] have been tested. Neuronal bungarotoxin {{has no effect on}} the alpha 4 /n alpha channel, whereas 2. 5 microM TC reduces by half the current peak evoked by 1 microM AcCho. The block by TC is independent of membrane voltage. By contrast, the block of AcCho-induced currents by Hex or Dec is strongly voltage dependent, suggesting that these substances enter the channel. The block by Mec is detectable at concentrations as low as 100 nM when applied together with 1 microM AcCho and is voltage independent. Hex, Dec, and Mec are effective only when AcCho is present. While the effects of all other agents are fully reversible, the Mec block is persistent...|$|E
40|$|Clubfoot is a {{developmental}} defect {{of the lower}} limb that affects as many as 1 in 500 births across Scotland (Miedzybrodzka., 2003). How the clubfoot defect arises during embryonic development is not known, although a number of tissue abnormalities have been postulated {{to be the primary}} abnormality {{in the development of the}} clubfoot defect. A chick model of clubfoot was created to investigate the developmental basis of clubfoot. Using a method modified from previous work carried out by Germiller and co-workers (1998), clubfoot was induced in the chick embryo using the pharmacological agent <b>decamethonium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The defect was confirmed to be clubfoot by comparing the features observed in the chick hindlimb with characteristic features observed in human clubfoot. By analysing the development of the hindlimb muscle, nerves, skeleton, tendons and vasculature the primary defect was found to be a loss of muscle in the hindlimb resulting from both an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in muscle differentiation. This resulted in a loss of muscle-nerve branches, which were found to regress in the absence of muscle, and tendons which were either missing or abnormally positioned. The vasculature in the clubfoot limb appeared grossly normal. A number of environmental causes of clubfoot cause a compression of the developing embryo, for example a reduction in the volume of amniotic fluid surrounding the embryo, physically compresses and immobilises the embryo. To investigate this, the amniotic fluid was removed from around chick embryos and was found to cause clubfoot. The primary abnormality was found to be a loss of muscle in the hindlimb. Thus, it has been demonstrated that clubfoot, induced both pharmacologically and physically, results primarily from a loss of muscle in the hindlimb. During embryonic development, the hindlimbs are required to rotate. It was found that this process was disrupted in chick clubfoot providing evidence for the long-standing theory (Bohm., 1929) that disrupted hindlimb rotation may underlie clubfoot. It is suggested from the data in this study, that a loss of hindlimb muscle disrupts the process of rotation and thus the feet remain unrotated, resulting in clubfoot.

By contrast, imposition of either rigid or flaccid paralysis prior to cavity formation completely blocked this process and, with time, produced fusion of cartilaginous elements and formation of continuous single cartilaginous rods across locations where joints would ordinarily form. The effect of these distinct forms of paralysis differed, however, when treatment was initiated after formation of an overt cavity; rigid, but not flaccid, paralysis partly conserved precavitated joints. This observation suggests that ‘static’ loading derived from ‘spastic’ rigidity can act to preserve joint cavities. Another facet of these studies was the observation that DMB-induced rigid paralysis produces a uniform and specific pattern of limb deformity whereas PB generated a diverse range of fixed positional deformities. Both also reduced limb growth, with different developmental periods preferentially modifying specific osteochondral components. Changes in cartilage and bone growth induced by 3 -day periods of flaccid immobilization, imposed at distinct developmental phases, provides support for a diminution in cartilage elaboration at an early phase and for a relatively delayed influence of movement on osteogenesis, invoking critical periods during which the developing skeleton becomes receptive to the impact of movement. Immobilization also exerts differential impact along the proximo-distal axis of the limb. Finally, our preliminary results support the possibility that embryonic hyperactivity influences the potential for postnatal muscle growth...|$|E
