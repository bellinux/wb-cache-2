Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) of face gear drives associated with pinion <b>dedendum</b> fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face gear drives, and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of face gear drives is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case of face gear drives associated with pinion <b>dedendum</b> fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies of face gear drives would be decreased with pinion <b>dedendum</b> fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities of face gear drives, dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion <b>dedendum</b> fatigue cracks of face gear drives are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion <b>dedendum</b> fatigue cracks of face gear drives is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion <b>dedendum</b> fatigue cracks of face gear drives.

This is because it negatively affects the dimensional stability and accuracy of the involute profile, {{as well as the}} concentricity, roundness, tooth spacing uniformity, and size of the gear.

The results revealed that the optimal combination of the processing parameters of the molded gear to achieve minimum shrinkage is melt temperature of 260 °C, packing pressure of 60 %, packing time of 5 [*]s, and cooling time of 30 [*]s. The melt temperature showed the highest comparability sequence among the four key process parameters examined, followed by packing pressure, cooling time, and packing time.

To improve the surface property of a spline, an involute spline is selected as the object of this study.

A plastic gear is used to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed hybrid optimization method in controlling all influential injection moulding processing parameters during plastic gear manufacturing. To minimize the shrinkage behaviour in tooth thickness, addendum circle, and <b>dedendum</b> circle of moulded gear, the optimal combination of different process parameters is determined. The case study demonstrates that the proposed optimization method can produce plastic-moulded gear with minimum shrinkage behaviour of 1. 8 %, 1. 53 %, and 2. 42 % in tooth thickness, addendum circle, and <b>dedendum</b> circle, respectively; these values are less than the values in the main experiment.

40|$|Micropitting {{damage is}} one of the failure modes {{commonly}} observed in gears leading to destructive failures, which in turn results in unplanned shutdown and expensive replacement, such as those observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This study investigates gear micropitting initiation and propagation when subjected to varying torque loads under a constant rotational speed. The study employs both experimental gear testing and analytical evaluation based on the ISO Technical Report of Gear Micropitting, ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010 and the recently revised ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2014. Initiation and propagation of micropitting are assessed in testing by quantifying the development of micropits and their progressive rate after specific numbers of running cycles at step-up torque levels. The analytical study is conducted to validate the prediction of micropitting using the ISO/TR recommended procedures by comparing the results with the occurrence of micropits in the tested gears. The gear test results show that micropitting initiates at the pinion <b>dedendum</b> but escalates at the addendum, because of the greater severity of progressive micropitting at the <b>dedendum</b> of the mating wheel where the tip relief area first comes into mesh. The analytical results, based on varying surface roughness measurements obtained from the tested gears, confirm that the maximum contact stresses and minimum specific lubricant film thicknesses occur in these regions. The specific lubricant film thickness varies considerably because of changes of surface roughness after gears are subjected to various running cycles under varying torque levels. It has found that the excessive loading, gear tooth micro-geometry, surface roughness and lubricant film thickness are the main factors affecting micropitting...|$|E

40|$|The RH and LH pinions of {{main gearbox}} {{pertaining}} to a helicopter {{were sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Examination showed spalling on the loading flank of two teeth of the LH pinion. Detailed study carried out on the samples from the damaged teeth discovered that the spalling initiated {{at the bottom of the}} <b>dedendum,</b> and that the subsurface cracks propagated progressively upward. Initiation of spalling was observed all along the bottom of the <b>dedendum</b> in all the teeth. This was found to be due to excessive contact stresses resulting from tip biting. In general, the evidences on the flank surface suggested considerable sliding of the pinion instead of rolling. The meshing of the pinion did not appear to be healthy. It encompassed the entire tooth height right up to the top land. It may, however, be noted that no gear/pinion is designed to have such contact patterns. Hence, it is imperative that the elastic deformation of the tooth under full load was more than that of the anticipated design value. Also, when the load on the flank is excessively high, it would promote sliding rather than rolling, as seen in the present case. The RH pinion did not have any observable damage though it also showed meshing and contact patterns similar to that seen in case of LH pinion. However, metallographic study conducted on the cross section of the teeth indicated initiation of subsurface cracks on the loading flank of this pinion as well. The microstructure, composition and the surface hardness of the teeth were found to be satisfactory. The case depth on the loading flank was found to be in the range 0. 78 to 0. 89 mm for LH pinion and 0. 78 to 0. 87 mm for RH pinion. In summary, it is stated that the LH pinion has failed by spalling. Study also showed evidences of initiation of spalling in the RH pinion. Investigation revealed that all factors required for spalling were present, namely, unfavourable meshing, high load, and tip biting. From the analysis, it appears that deficiencies other than metallurgical factors were responsible for the premature spalling in the pinions...|$|E

A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report. It may be noted that a number of failed collector pinions of another helicopter were investigated in this laboratory in the past (refer NAL Report Nos.

At the nominal centre distance, this leaves a radial clearance, which is in itself redundant from a functional point of view. However, the intrinsic geometry of the cutting process always results in a non-involute root profile (the trochoid), which is even more pronounced {{in the case of}} using a rounded cutter tip in order to increase the strength of the cutting edge. Larger tip radii produce stronger tooth fillets, potentially increasing the bending strength, but reducing the involute part of the tooth. Thereby, they increase the risk of interference with mating gears. This paper performs a parametric investigation of the combined effect of the cutter radius and the <b>dedendum</b> on the clearance and the resulting tooth bending strength using analytical calculations, computerised generation and finite element simulations to determine the exact tooth geometry in search of stronger tooth forms.

Compari-sons between the two models of load which are, respectively, based on minimum elastic potential energy (MEPE) criterion and dynamic motion equations built up in this paper are discussed. The results show that at low speed the loads calculated by the two models are similar. However, with increasing speed, the load exhibits dynamic characteristics gradually and reaches the highest value at resonant speed. Besides, the effects of the helix angle and the lubricant viscosity are also analyzed. Increasing the ambient viscosity could intensify the film stiffness and viscous damping. Gear with larger helix angle could weaken the impact phenomenon at the shift points where one tooth-pair disengages. Moreover, it is symmetric with regard to the pressure and film thickness across the face width for spur gear. Differently, the pressure for helical gear has a higher value at the <b>dedendum</b> of pinion where the film becomes thinner.

The use of high power density transmission systems such as epicyclic gear trains {{is the way to}} achieve the goal reducing the overall volume and mass compared with traditional configurations. Gears are the main component of the transmissions because they play the crucial role of transmitting the power from the input to the output with a defined ratio. In terms of gear performances, tooth geometry has a direct influence on load carrying capacity: increase the pressure angle modifies the tooth profile with a direct influence on bending and contact stress. To test the benefits of high pressure angles gears in epicyclic transmissions, four different epicyclic systems with same boundary design conditions have been modelled. The reference pressure angle have been varied from 20 ° to 35 ° and other gear parameters such as profile shift coefficient, addendum and <b>dedendum</b> length have been modified consequently to match the design requirements. The results show that increasing the pressure angle has a reductive effect on contact and bending stresses. Using high pressure angle gears in epicyclic transmissions has a beneficial effect on tensile stresses but is unfavourable for the compressive ones. Moreover, it has been seen that pressure angle effect might be enhanced or nullified if other modifications such as profile shift are used concurrently...|$|E

In this study, by utilizing the flow-relief-hole method, a billet design with different initial diameters of the relief-hole is developed to improve the dimensional accuracy of cold forging gears.

40|$|Wind turbine gearbox {{operates}} under a {{wide array}} of highly fluctuating and dynamic load conditions caused by the stochastic nature of wind and operational wind turbine controls. Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and lubricant film thickness along the line of action of gear tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and lubricant film thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The lubricant film thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The lubricant film thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum of driving gear and the <b>dedendum</b> of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of lubricant film thickness thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturers of wind {{turbines}} have observed {{a new phenomenon}} that appears in high power {{wind turbines}}: excessive wear in the teeth located at 0 º in the pitch bearing. In order to design more efficient wind turbines, manufacturers are increasing the rotor diameter to capture more kinetic energy from the wind to generate more energy, therefore the stress in the joints/unions is increased, {{which leads to the}} elastic deformation of the system. These stresses and deformations increase {{in all parts of the}} wind turbine, the foundations and the tower, yaw, nacelle, drive train and blade unions. All these cases are mainly static unions, except the drive train that transmits torque, the yaw system that turns the nacelle and the pitch system that turns each blade around its axis. The weight of the blades under movement, always working in the most efficient position, causes micro-movements allowed by the elastic deformations and the backlash of the gear transmission that induce an excessive wear at the zero degree position. The same phenomenon is observed in the yaw system, though to a lesser extent. Despite the manufacturer's efforts, a solution that could be implemented in the near future or easily retrofitted in the wind turbines does not yet exist. The aim of this PhD project is to improve the lubrication of the pitch and yaw gear systems of wind turbines through the use of a novel lubrication system based on an array of micro-fabricated channels fitted at the gears' root (<b>dedendum).</b> A micro-nozzle to continuously inject fresh grease in between the teeth in contact has been designed, manufactured and installed in a test bench of a 2 MW wind turbine pitch system. The test bench has been used to characterize the fatigue behavior of the gear surface using conventional wind turbine greases under real cyclic loads, showing a delay of 2 x 10 ^ 4 cycles in the appearance of wear. The proposed micro-nozzle is expected to be compatible with and easily implemented into both newly designed and in-market models.

40|$|A {{systematic}} methodology combining an optimization technique, three dimensional analytical {{rigid body}} dynamics and a novel method for non linear stiffness analysis, namely Pseudo-Interference Stiffness Estimation method (PISE), is proposed to aid engineers and gear designers to dramatically reduce gear design time {{and improve the}} existing spur gear system performance. One of the major concerns in gear design is the reduction of gear dynamic load. Minimizing gear dynamic load will decrease gear noise, increase efficiency, improve pitting fatigue life, and help prevent gear tooth fracture. Therefore, the proposed method is aimed at minimizing this force by utilizing tooth profile modification techniques, tooth crowning and shaving. The main aim of this methodology is {{to search for the}} optimum profiles of tooth crowning and shaving that eventually lead to the optimum dynamic tooth load in the gear mesh. Additionally, this method is easy to implement and computationally inexpensive. To validate the proposed method, a detailed design study is numerically investigated and compared with experimental data from NASA and other sources as reported in the literature. The results have shown that the dynamic tooth load can be reduced up to 50 percent of its original value. However, this reduction is only valid at the operating ranges of the design load and design speed When the optimized gear system is operated at of design speed and off-design torque, its dynamic load may change significantly. It is also found that the effect of profile modification on the dynamic response of the gear system was mostly observed to be a reduction in the peak dynamic tooth load at the resonance speed. ^ Later, the investigation of gear tooth durability was conducted to validate an improvement of gear life. The rating factors given in AGMA publication, Hertzian contact stress, bending fatigue stress, flash temperature and PV index are employed in gear durability determination. The values of these quantities along the line of action were evaluated and plotted to illustrate their distribution. The results show that, with the reduction of 50 percent in dynamic tooth load, the reductions in PV index, bending fatigue, Hertzian contact stress, and flash temperature can be achieved up to 64, 58, 28 and 39 percent, respectively. Thus, this guarantees that the risks of pitting failure, scoring failure and tooth fracture are greatly improved. Besides, the variation of these quantities along the line of action explicitly indicates that pitting failure is likely to occur around pitch point and points in tip and <b>dedendum</b> zones are prone to scoring failure. ...|$|E
40|$|A gearbox with gears of {{different}} sizes {{is part of a}} vehicle transmission system that plays an important part in transmitting the engine power to the wheels. The efficient energy transmission highly relies on the performance of gears. Together, the mesh efficiency and durability determines the gear performance. It has been reported that the final smoothening of surface by running-in process has increased the mesh efficiency of ground gears. This is not the case for superfinished gears. However, in comparison to ground, superfinished gears produced a higher overall efficiency but only at higher speeds. Micropitting is a surface contact fatigue failure which occurs in all type of gears and for all heat treatments. Depending on the initial surface micro-geometry and contact conditions used, the micropitting can initiate after a relatively short running time. Further progression of micropitting due to continuous operation leads to degradation of profile and thereby gears fail in the form of pitting, spalling or tooth breakage. The hard finishing of gear surface by different manufacturing methods, for example grinding, honing and superfinishing etc., produces a unique characteristic surfaces in terms of roughness, surface lay and residual stresses. These topographical characteristics of tooth flank affects the efficiency and durability of gears. In addition, contribution of microstructure and surface chemistry should not be neglected. Running-in process is known to alter the aforementioned surface characteristics via smoothening the surface asperities. This creates an interest to understand the initial running period with the purpose to improve efficiency and longevity of gears. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of running-in load on the surface characteristics of gears set by generating grinding. Secondly, to follow how these characteristics influence and further develop during the initial usage. To characterize the surface layers of gears a methodology is developed by combining analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed that running-in process smoothened the surface asperities through plastic deformation and the severity of deformation increased with the magnitude of the load. On the other hand, higher load produced more micropits and this trend continued for in-line efficiency testing as well. It has been found that on one side of the as-ground teeth the stresses were rather uniform while there were stress gradients from tip to <b>dedendum</b> and in axial direction on the other side. The deformation created by running-in increased the compressive residual stresses but only at the surface confined to 5 µm. It has also been found that surface conditioned by higher running-in load gave subsurface cracks during efficiency testing. High atomic concentration of phosphorous-containing extreme pressure additive (EP) was also observed after efficiency test that ran at high load.
