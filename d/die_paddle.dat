50|$|MicroLeadFrame (MLF) is a near CSP plastic {{encapsulated}} {{package with}} a copper leadframe substrate. This package uses perimeter {{lands on the}} bottom of the package to provide electrical contact to the printed circuit board. The <b>die</b> attach <b>paddle</b> is exposed {{on the bottom of}} the package surface to provide an efficient heat path when soldered directly to the circuit board. This also enables stable ground by use of down bonds or by electrical connection through a conductive die attach material.|$|R

The return echoes were gated on the depth where the {{backside}} mold compound interfaces with {{the back side of}} the <b>die</b> <b>paddle.</b> The small black dots in the acoustic image above are small voids (trapped bubbles) in the mold compound.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{important}} parameters, including processing conditions, package geometry and materials, are specifically studied on {{the occurrence of}} warpage and coplanarity for a plastic package. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the evaluation of moulding compound properties and optimal processing conditions that can effectively minimize warpage. It is found that moulding compounds requiring a low moulding temperature and having a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) can significantly reduce warpage. The elastic modulus was found to be inversely proportional to warpage, indicating the modulus should be kept as high as possible. The post-mould curing is essential to reducing warpage as it increases the glass transition temperature, but lowers the thermal shrinkage. A cross-shaped <b>die</b> <b>paddle</b> against a full square paddle, a thick die attach and a large die size are also favorable to reducing warpage...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of QFN {{package to}} delamination, {{particularly in the}} area between the Ni/Pd/Au leadframe die pad and mold compound, {{has been a major}} concern to many IC manufacturers. The presence of a Ni/Pd/Au oxide layer on the leadframe of QFN packages was found to cause delamination at the die pad or mold compound interface. Delamination refers to the disbonding between a surface of the mold compound and that of another material such as leadframe, die, <b>die</b> <b>paddle</b> or die attach material. It also means the loss of adhesion between the mold compound and {{one or more of the}} other materials. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of delamination between 3 different types of compound and Ni/Pd/Au leadframe die pad. Some of the parameters are adjusted in the molding process in order to investigate the effects of delamination. In these studies the delamination of the QFN package measured by C-mode Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (C-SAM). The delamination is initiated under moisture condition if the maximum-shear-stress for the package exceeds the measured. The result shows that different mold compound properties will result in differen...|$|E

According to MƒÅori legend, a chief on the island named Te Rakitamau was married to a young woman who became terminally ill and implored him to marry her cousin after she <b>died.</b> Te Rakitamau <b>paddled</b> across Te Moana Tapokopoko a Tawhiki (Foveaux Strait) to the South Island where the cousin lived, only to discover she had recently married.

40|$|Xilinx Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN) {{package is}} a robust and low profile leadframe-based plastic package that has several {{advantages}} over traditional leadframe packages. The exposed <b>die</b> attach <b>paddle</b> enables efficient thermal dissipation when directly soldered to the PCB. Additionally, this near {{chip scale package}} offers improved electrical performance, smaller package size, and an absence of external leads. Since the package has no external leads, coplanarity and bent leads {{are no longer a}} concern. For QFN package to perform at the peak, special considerations are required to properly assemble the package and design the PCB. For optimal thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad on the package should be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board. Also, for proper heat conduction through the board, the thermal pad region of the PCB should contain thermal vias. The following factors have major effect on the quality and reliability of assembling QFN packages: PCB pad pattern design, amount of solder paste in thermal pad region, stencil design, type of solder paste, and reflow profile. This application note provides a good guideline on PCB pad pattern design and assembling of QFN packages for optimal reliability and quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronics}} {{industry is}} concerned about the delamination of plastic-encapsulated IC packages to assure high quality of products. Much effort has been invested by the electronics industry to evaluate and optimize the most popcorn free conditions during the process of packaging and assembly. However, it may be interesting to know the degree of delamination of IC packages that are already mounted on boards. A delamination survey of various IC packages from several used electronic products including cellular phones, VCR, discman, display card, graphic card and motherboard for desktop computer is conducted and presented in this paper. C-mode Scanning Acoustic Microscope (C-SAM) and X-ray Microscope is used to investigate delamination and possibly other defects like wire-sweep or cracking. IC packages under survey included Thin Small Outline Package (TSOP), Small Outline Integrated Circuit (SOIC), Small Outline J-Lead Package (SOJ), Pall Grid Array (BGA), Quad Flat Package (QFP), Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC), Chip-on-Flex (COF), Dual-in-line Package (DIP), Single in-line Package (SIP) as well as Flip Chip. Some packages were found to have delamination. The most common type of delamination seem to be on the <b>die</b> <b>paddle,</b> both front and backside. One chip showed a topside delamination of about 35 % together with 26 % on backside of package. However, it is still considered acceptable according to JEDEC criteria. X-ray survey for other defects such as wiresweep was not found...|$|E
