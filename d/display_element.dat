CROs were later largely superseded by digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) with thin panel displays, fast analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors. DSOs without integrated displays (sometimes known as digitisers) are available at lower cost and use a general-purpose digital computer to process and display waveforms.|$|E

50|$|Wide {{field of}} view and high {{resolution}} initially seemed to be contradictory requirements: if a single <b>display</b> <b>element</b> is used, {{it needs to be}} magnified to show a wide {{field of view}}, but this same magnification reduces the pixel density and makes it seem of lower resolution. The solution was to optically tile multiple displays. Conceptually similar to how multiple desktop PCs can be networked together to form a powerful computer, the team realized the multiple micro-displays can be blended together into a display that has much higher resolution. The project was successful: a prototype model was indeed delivered to that company and was used in the design process of a major family sedan.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo versions of an analog display program have been assembled for the analog display of digitally derived graph plot information. Input to the analog display {{system is the}} magnetic tape output by the "DRAW" subroutine used at the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School Computer Facility. The fast version of the program, driving an oscilloscope as the <b>display</b> <b>element,</b> provides a clear and accurate display of the graph points, but is of limited usefulness due to {{the small size of}} the standard scope face and the flicker in the presentation. The slow version, employing an x-y plotter as the <b>display</b> <b>element,</b> also yields an adequate display, and at a slightly faster rate than the existing digital plotter currently used by the Computer Facility for graphical output. A linear interpolation routine has been implemented in the slow version, so that plotter response is not affected by coarseness in the data points. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
