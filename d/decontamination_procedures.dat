25|$|PD {{damages the}} eyes, lungs, throat and nasal membranes. PD {{immediately}} affects {{the eyes and}} blindness can result, though it requires high doses. It also induces nausea and vomiting, an inhalation of as little as 5-50 milligrams can induce severe vomiting. Long-term exposure to PD can cause systemic damage by replacing calcium with arsenic, extensive bone marrow damage can also result. Due to PD being easily recognized {{in the field and}} a relatively fast rate for <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedures</b> to become effective, the chemical is not as useful as other blister agents. The blistering resultant from PD exposure may also be delayed, for as little as 30 minutes, or as long as 32 hours depending upon the concentration of the dose.|$|E
25|$|West Palm Beach Fire Rescue {{responded to}} the call and found 53-year-old Jorge Barahona {{on the ground and}} 10-year-old Victor Barahona in the cab of the truck. Both were {{conscious}} by the time rescuers arrived, but Victor was convulsing with seizures. One fireman was overcome by a strong smell when approaching the truck, and <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedures</b> were started. The bed of the truck was full of plastic containers of chemicals; some unlabeled. The truck was branded with the name of Jorge's pest extermination business, CJ Pest Control, causing investigators to believe the chemicals were pesticides. One unlabeled container held some form of acid, causing firefighters to wonder why an exterminator would have such a chemical. State Troopers were sent to the address of CJ Pest Control, but were unable to contact anyone.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1942, 16 Red Cross {{nurses were}} sent from Zagreb to the Stara Gradiška {{concentration}} camp to collect 650 children {{and bring them}} to Jastrebarsko. The journey of [...] from Stara Gradiška to Zagreb took 24 hours, during which 17 children died. During <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedures</b> in Zagreb another 30 children died. Another 37 very ill children were placed in a Zagreb hospital, but they also died soon after. The remaining 566 children made it to Jastrebarsko alive, and the camp opened on 12July 1942.

Although the study was “a priori” not powered to detect clinical differences, no trend was observed for superior results of one <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedure</b> over the other.|$|R
500|$|The cleanup was {{hampered}} by two significant factors: the unexpected base surge {{and the lack}} of a viable cleanup plan. [...] It was understood that if the water column fell back into the lagoon, which it did, any ships that were drenched by falling water might be contaminated beyond redemption. Nobody expected that to happen to almost the entire target fleet. [...] No <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedures</b> had been tested in advance to see if they would work and to measure the potential risk to personnel. [...] In the absence of a decontamination protocol, the ships were cleaned using traditional deck-scrubbing methods: hoses, mops, and brushes, with water, soap, and lye. The sailors had no protective clothing.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{parts of}} the Gowanus canal are {{effectively}} microclimates which may have very different conditions and types of contamination. [...] Overall, Gowanus water is considered unsafe to drink or swim in, and contact with it is not encouraged. The Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club encourages people to canoe on the canal, in part as an incentive to revitalization in the area. The Urban Divers Estuary Conservancy does very careful diving using full-encapsulation suits, followed by rigorous <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedures.</b> Anything caught from the canal should be assumed to be toxic and not safe to eat. Nonetheless, there are some indications that the water quality of the Gowanus Canal is improving in response to recent initiatives.|$|E
2500|$|TEPCO {{has been}} criticized in its {{provision}} of safety equipment for its workers. After NISA warned TEPCO that workers were sharing dosimeters, {{since most of the}} devices were lost in the disaster, the utility sent more to the plant. Japanese media has reported that workers indicate that standard <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedures</b> are not being observed. Others reports suggest that contract workers are given more dangerous work than TEPCO employees. TEPCO is also seeking workers willing to risk high radiation levels for short periods of time in exchange for high pay. Confidential documents acquired by the Japanese Asahi newspaper suggest that TEPCO hid high levels of radioactive contamination from employees in the days following the incident. In particular, the Asahi reported that radiation levels of 300mSv/h were detected at least twice on 13 March, but that [...] "the workers who were trying to bring the disaster under control at the plant were not informed of the levels." ...|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedure</b> as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.

5000|$|Another {{possible}} {{nuclear terrorism}} threat are devices designed to disperse radioactive materials {{over a large}} area using conventional explosives, called dirty bombs.

40|$|Silica-based columns {{are largely}} used in RNA purification, {{allowing}} fast extractions and good yields {{of high quality}} nucleic acid, but their major limitation is the high cost. The reuse of such columns, although desirable, is not recommended because of residual amounts of material from the previous sample trapped in the column matrix, which might be released during further purification. Thus, recycling does need previous complete removal of any detectable RNA trace, but to date no protocol which allows decontamination and reuse is available. We report a very rapid <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedure,</b> based on treatment with warm alkaline solution containing Triton X- 100, which ensures no RNA carry-over, and allows the recycling of columns without impairment of their efficiency in high-quality RNA purification even after several regeneration rounds...|$|R

Methods : All suspected cases were confirmed by checking the drug susceptibility and DNA fingerprints using spoligotyping as well as restriction fragment length polymorphism.

40|$|Antibiotic cocktails are {{frequently}} used as secondary decontaminants {{prior to the}} culture of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). This study investigated whether secondary incubation with an antibiotic cocktail containing vancomycin, nalidixic acid, and amphotericin B after primary exposure to N-acetyl-L-cysteine- 1. 5 % sodium hydroxide affected the recovery of viable MAP from milkexperimentally spiked with 102 to 106 cfu/ml. Results indicated that incubation with this antibiotic cocktail did decrease the incidence of contamination in culture media but it was also highly detrimental to the recovery of viableMAP. This effect was not advantageous given the low numbers of MAP naturally shed into milk and colostrum of infected cows. These results demonstrate that secondary incubation with antibiotics during the <b>decontamination</b> <b>procedure</b> could potentially lead to false-negative culture results because of their detrimental effect on the viability of MAP...|$|R
