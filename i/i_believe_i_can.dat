500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E
2500|$|One thing <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> assure you: that of my works, {{the second}} act of Guglielmo Tell, the third act of Otello, and all of il Barbiere di Siviglia will {{certainly}} endure. ("") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he continued, [...] "I shall {{like this}} better, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> keep {{this all the}} time, with my wedges. And besides, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> drive it better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{give you}} that comfort. The fact is, your acting is not much admired among the girls here, but they think you are {{unexpectedly}} nice as a private person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Children," [...] said Old Pipes, [...] "I'm {{very tired}} tonight, and <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> climb up this steep path to my home. I think I {{shall have to}} ask you to help me." ...|$|R
2500|$|George W. Bush {{joined the}} 147th Fighter Interceptor Group of the Texas Air National Guard on May 27, 1968, during the Vietnam War. He {{committed}} to serve until May 26, 1974, with {{two years on}} active duty while training to fly and four years on part-time duty. In his 1968 Statement of Intent (undated), he wrote, [...] "I have applied for pilot training {{with the goal of}} making flying a lifetime pursuit and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> best accomplish this to my own satisfaction by serving {{as a member of the}} Air National Guard as long as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack," [...] I said, trembling, [...] "in {{spite of}} this shock, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do it now. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember. The scales are falling from my eyes. I'm {{becoming}} myself again. What you've said and what you've shown me seems to have broken down a veil. I feel as if I could reconstruct all now, when once the key's suggested to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Destruction by--love--seems such {{a terrible}} thing! Now show me your favourites. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{tell you what they}} are, though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel terribly shaky and dizzy," [...] Arthur said, as {{he stood}} leaning on Adam's arm; [...] "that blow of yours must have come against me like a battering-ram. <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> walk alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Valentin {{shook his}} head with a fine smile. [...] "I don't think you quite understand, and <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make you. She {{understood}} the situation; she knew what was in the air; she was watching us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And nowadays," [...] Maraton continued, [...] "life {{has become}} {{like a huge}} and complex piece of machinery. Humanity {{has given way to}} mechanics. Aaron, <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> help this people by any other way save by laws." ...|$|R
60|$|The next {{question}} is, {{what is the}} best time for seeing Fairies? <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you all about that.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you," [...] said Herbert. [...] "But the blow has fallen, and as for myself, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> bear it. <b>I</b> do not care so very much about the property." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2015, Midler {{stated in}} a Facebook Q&A that [...] "after {{all these years}} and all the fan demand, <b>I</b> do <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stand and firmly say an unequivocal no" [...] in {{response}} to a question about a sequel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll have {{to leave}} my good-bye for her with you. <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> come back again." [...] He looked round {{as if he were}} dizzy. [...] "Good-bye," [...] he said, and offered his hand. It was cold as clay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{a pretty}} strong push in my forehead," [...] said Quox, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> break down that door, even though it's made of solid gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly tell you. He talked such horrid {{stuff that}} you never heard the like: about religion, and heaven, and love. Oh, dear--he is such a nasty man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘It is {{a pretty}} thought,’ said she, ‘and, as far as regards Ronald and myself, a true one. Come, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> show you the very smoke out of our chimney.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> hurt anything, Dave. But {{of course}} I can't be sure until I {{try to run}} the car," [...] {{answered}} Ben.

6000|$|... "There are a {{good many}} people," [...] she said, [...] "who would agree with you. There are {{a great many people}} in the world who have cause to regret having {{offended}} him. Let us talk of something else. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see the sea!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He had a motive, of course. Borrowdean is one {{of those}} men who do nothing without a motive. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> even guess what it is. Don't let this thing {{distress}} you too much, Hester. I do not think that we have anything to worry about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I can get it. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make Mr. Peck {{see that}} it's a duty. I shall {{ask him to}} regard it as a charity to me--as a mercy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They won't hurt you. Come along, now. This is great. When I grow up I ain't {{going to}} bother {{going to church}} at all. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get to heaven by myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a pretty}} thought," [...] said she, [...] "and, as far as regards Ronald and myself, a true one. Come, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> show you the very smoke out of our chimney." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And yet,' he added, 'Mas'r Davy, I {{have felt}} so sure {{as she was}} living--I have know'd, awake and sleeping, as it was so trew that I should find her--I have been so led on by it, and held up by it--that <b>I</b> doen't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> have been deceived. No! Em'ly's alive!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose {{one must}} expect to fight one's way: {{there is hardly}} {{anything}} to be done without it. And the ignorance of people about here is stupendous. I don't lay claim to anything else than having used some opportunities which have not come within everybody's reach; {{but there is no}} stifling the offence of being young, and a new-comer, and happening to know something more than the old inhabitants. Still, if <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> set going a better method of treatment--if <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> pursue certain observations and inquiries which may be a lasting benefit to medical practice, I should be a base truckler if I allowed any consideration of personal comfort to hinder me. And the course is all the clearer from there being no salary in question to put my persistence in an equivocal light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{ought to}} be. There is, on my side.

6000|$|He {{took refuge}} in repeating {{something}} he had already said {{and that she had}} made nothing of. [...] "There's something <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still do." [...] And he put his hand out for good-bye.|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so!" [...] Von Aert exclaimed, beaming with {{satisfaction}} {{at his own}} perspicacity. [...] "I thought there was something suspicious about the fellow. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> almost smell out a heretic or a traitor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shouldn't wonder," [...] rejoined Pan. [...] "And it's darned {{good luck}} for us. The boys ran across a valley full of wild horses over here about twenty miles. Dad, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> trap several {{thousand}} wild horses." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "As #1 is {{no longer}} limited to 'software', and as this {{decision}} was made by developers after and during discussion of how we should consider non-software content such as documentation and firmware, <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> justify the policy decisions to exempt documentation, firmware, or content any longer, as the Social Contract has been amended to cover all these areas." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Second Lady: [...] "Oh, I {{have quite}} finished, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly realize anything, and I {{was afraid of}} going away and forgetting something, for I am {{on my way to}} the station.
