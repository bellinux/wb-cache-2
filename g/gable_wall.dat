5|$|The {{effects of}} the fire that {{destroyed}} the priory in 1289 {{can be seen in}} scorched paving between the surviving pillars. It was thought the church had been completely rebuilt, but excavations in the 1980s show that a substantial amount of the less damaged west end was reused which resulted in a distinct inconsistency between the two ends, which were constructed in different architectural styles. Rebuilding was a major task that took several generations and was probably not completed {{until the end of the}} 14th century. It is unclear how much of the second priory survived the fire. Where the priory was rebuilt, its builders reused as much as possible; the core of the surviving eastern <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> is full of fragments from the destroyed second priory.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{earthquake}} loads on roof <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> and the behaviours of these roof <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> are investigated. In preparation of the study, two experiments on cradle roof system which gets and does not get any loads off the roof members were carried out in all. The experiments were performed on the shaking table in Earthquake Research Department of General Directorate of Disaster Affairs. Through the experiments, some considerable results were obtained on the behaviours of roof <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> under {{the effect of}} horizontal dynamic loads. The results obtained {{at the end of}} these examinations are given and discussed. Furthermore, suggestions to make the brick <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> more reliable against the loads of earthquake are given. When the results of the experiments were generally taken into consideration, it was realized that the <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> in both roof systems would partly or completely collapse even under the effect of a little horizontal dynamic load...|$|R

25|$|Subsequent {{commissions}} of enquiry {{set up by}} {{the local}} Bishop and the Catholic hierarchy in Ireland formally approved the apparitions as worthy of devotion, and they were officially recognised by the Catholic church, culminating in the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1979, which he called the ultimate goal of his pastoral visit to Ireland. Only a fragment of the original <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> remains of the old church. A purpose-built Basilica was designed and built to cater for pilgrims and is served by an international airport, Knock Airport.|$|E

The pumping station is located in a pump house built of Bath Stone, located at river level and {{separated}} from the canal by the Wessex Main Line. It was designed by John Rennie and built by Fox of Bristol. The pump house has a slate hipped roof. The wheelhouse projects to the west of the pump house and has weatherboard sides. The east <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> has three doors allowing access to the wheel itself.|$|E

50|$|The Mortuary Chapel at Tubrid, {{reportedly}} {{built in}} 1644, {{in what is}} now the modern Catholic parish of Ballylooby, is long roofless. The structure shows some evidence of restoration work, notably steel tie-rods securing the <b>gable</b> <b>walls.</b> This work was carried out in 1911-12, due mainly to the efforts of the historian Fr. Patrick Power.|$|R
500|$|Free Derry (...) was a self-declared {{autonomous}} nationalist area of Derry, Northern Ireland, {{that existed}} between 1969 and 1972. Its name {{was taken from}} a sign painted on a <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> in the Bogside in January 1969 which read, [...] "You are now entering Free Derry". The area, which included the Bogside and Creggan neighbourhoods, was secured by community activists {{for the first time}} on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into the Bogside by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the RUC from entering. After six days the residents took down the barricades and RUC patrols resumed, but tensions remained high over the following months.|$|E
500|$|The {{rectangular}} five bay barn is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide, {{although it was}} previously larger. The middle bay is slightly longer than the others because of the central porches. The barn is built of local Blue Lias stone with some better quality oolitic ashlar used for the quoins on the corners and the porches which provided cover for gfoods being loaded and unloaded at the doors. It is supported by two-stage buttresses reaching to {{three quarters of the}} height of the walls. Each of the side walls has ventilation slits, or breathers, with those in the end walls being {{in the shape of a}} cross pommee. The barn originally had an attached dovecote on the western end, and still has niches for birds inside the barn and on the east <b>gable</b> <b>wall.</b> The dovecote was adapted into a calf shed.|$|E
500|$|That {{afternoon}} over 1,500 Bogside residents built barricades, armed {{themselves with}} steel bars, wooden clubs and hurleys, {{and told the}} police {{that they would not}} be allowed into the area. DCAC chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no-one was to come in. [...] Groups of men wearing armbands patrolled the streets in shifts. [...] A local activist painted [...] "You are now entering Free Derry" [...] in light-coloured paint on the blackened <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> of a house on the corner of Lecky Road and Fahan Street. For many years, it was believed that it was John 'Caker' Casey that painted it, but after Casey's death it emerged that it might have been another young activist, Liam Hillen. The corner where the slogan was painted, which was a popular venue for meetings, later became known as [...] "Free Derry Corner". On 7 January, the barricaded area was extended to include the Creggan, another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the Bogside. [...] A clandestine radio station calling itself [...] "Radio Free Derry" [...] began broadcasting to residents, playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance. [...] On a small number of occasions law-breakers attempted crimes, but were dealt with by the patrols. Despite all this, the Irish Times reported that [...] "the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols." [...] Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week, members of the DCAC including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday, 10 January and called on them to dismantle the barricades. The barricades were taken down the following morning.|$|E
2500|$|Protestants, on {{the other}} hand, portrayed the Williamite victory as a triumph for {{religious}} and civil liberty where triumphant murals of King William still controversially adorn the <b>gable</b> <b>walls</b> in Ulster.

2500|$|The {{name was}} first {{published}} in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 1840–44, as a local name for a carving once present on a church <b>gable</b> <b>wall</b> in Rochestown, County Tipperary, Ireland; the name also was recorded in 1840 by John O'Donovan, an official of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, referring to a figure on Kiltinan Castle, County Tipperary. Scholars disagree about the origin and meaning of the name in Ireland, as it is not directly translatable into Irish. Alternative spellings of [...] "Sheela" [...] may sometimes be encountered; they include Sheila, Síle and Síla. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it is derived from Irish, Síle na gcíoch, meaning [...] "Julia of the breasts".|$|E
