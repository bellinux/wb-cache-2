She had repeated her earlier criticisms, which were not of cross-training in itself but merely the way Davis had implemented it. A specific concern of hers was the hospital's requirement that obstetric nurses who had reassigned to another department shower and change before returning to obstetrics, in an apparent effort to circumvent a regulatory requirement that nurses assigned to obstetrics remain there for an entire shift or not return if they were temporarily assigned elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{favourable}} {{findings of}} Schutz, Kranich and Agnello, the hornblende ore from Baffin Island contained no gold, {{and it was}} later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> to the Privy Council by Michael Lok; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand {{in the presence of}} Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions.|$|E
25|$|Apart of {{the court}} order, NBC News also {{reported}} one former Penn State assistant coach witnessed an incident in the late 1970s, and three other coaches —who {{have gone on to}} work in pro level and other colleges— allegedly saw inappropriate conduct between Sandusky and boys in the early and mid-1990s. Risk management expert Raymond Williams identified both the three incidents with some of the assistant coaches on the Penn State staff at the time, and three others that were reported to university officials; and whether key university officials should have had knowledge about child sex-assault allegations involving Sandusky in each of the six different cases dating to 1976. Mike McQueary claimed former fellow Penn State assistant coaches Greg Schiano and Tom Bradley also knew about Sandusky’s transgressions in a key testimony <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> among the documents related to the insurance coverage case, in which he claims that when he told Bradley about what he had seen, Bradley was not shocked, and that Bradley went on to tell him a story about a time Schiano had witnessed Sandusky abusing a child some time during the ‘90s.

25|$|In 1577 Kranich was {{involved}} in assaying the tons of black ore brought from Baffin Island during Sir Martin Frobisher's voyages to the Canadian Arctic {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage. Between 1 November 1577 and 6 March 1578 another German metallurgist working in England, Christopher Schutz, performed three 'great proofes' of the ore. Kranich and a Venetian metallurgist working in England, Giovanni Battista Agnello, were also brought in to assay the ore. Kranich and Schutz were soon at odds, with Schutz accusing Kranich, who was favoured by Martin Frobisher, of 'evil manners and ignorance'. Numerous documents survive showing Kranich's involvement in the assaying of the ore, including a letter of 26 November 1577 in which Kranich reported to Sir Francis Walsingham on the amount of gold found in his tests. Amid growing doubts about the value of the ore, Kranich insisted that it contained a significant amount of gold, and asked for £200 and a daily wage of £1 to refine it. He also designed a furnace for smelting the ore. However the ore eventually turned out to be worthless iron pyrite, and it was later alleged by Robert Denham, who had assisted Kranich with his tests, that Kranich had added gold and silver coins of his own to bring the projected value of the refined ore to £50 per ton. The story that Kranich allegedly doctored the assay tests is found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> to the Privy Council by Michael Lok, one of the principal proponents of the Frobisher expeditions; in the deposition Lok claims that the evidence of Kranich's fraud was presented to Lord Burghley at his house in the Strand in the presence of Lok, Sir Walter Mildmay, and all the Commissioners involved in supervising the Frobisher expeditions.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} of the scandals reveals the many powers at Grant's disposal as the President of the United States. His confidants knew this and in many situations took advantage of Grant's presidential authority. Having the ability to pardon, accept resignations, and even vouch for an associate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition,</b> created an environment difficult, though not impossible, for reformers in {{and outside of the}} Grant Administration. [...] Grant himself, far from being politically naive, had played a shrewd hand at times in the protection of cabinet and appointees. Examples include not allowing Benjamin Bristow to move the Tax Revenue Supervisors and relinquishing immunity in the Whiskey Ring cases, made Grant a protector of political patronage. In fairness, Grant did appoint cabinet reformers and special prosecutors that were able to clean up the Treasury, Interior, War, and Justice departments. Grant, himself, personally participated in reforming the Department of Indian Affairs, by firing all the corrupt clerks. [...] No reforming cabinet member, however, was installed in the Department of Navy.|$|E
500|$|The stress {{fracture}} theory {{was supported by}} the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on Fitzgerald in 1972 and 1973, testified that [...] "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after somebody has jumped off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of Fitzgerald was caused by hull failure, [...] "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress." [...] George H. [...] "Red" [...] Burgner, Fitzgeralds steward for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> that a [...] "loose keel" [...] contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that [...] "the keel and sister kelsons were only 'tack welded'" [...] and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken.

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> of 1598, Barley {{refers to}} his age as [...] "xxxiii yeeres or thereabowt", placing his {{date of birth}} around 1565. Evidence {{suggests}} that Barley may have been born in Warwickshire. Little else is known about his early life. Barley was in London by 1587, having completed an apprenticeship with the Drapers' Company in that year. He trained as a bookseller under Yarath James, a small-time publisher. James operated out of a shop in Newgate Market, near Christ Church Gate, in the 1580s. His interest in ballads was shared by Barley, who published {{a number of them}} during his lifetime. By 1592, Barley had opened his own shop in the parish of St Peter upon Cornhill, whose register recorded his marriage to a Mary Harper on 15 June 1603 and christenings and burials of people associated with his family. He conducted business out of this shop for the next twenty years.|$|E
500|$|On 16 May 2011, Judge Mendes sentenced the two {{pilots to}} four years and four months of prison in a [...] "semi-open" [...] {{facility}} for {{their role in the}} collision, but he commuted the sentences to community service to be served in the United States. Brazilian authorities accused the pilots of turning off the Legacy's transponder moments before the accident and turning it on again only after the crash, but it was denied by the crew <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition</b> via videoconference. Mendes said in his sentence that pilots had failed to verify the functioning of equipment for more than an hour, a length of time he called [...] "an eternity" [...] in aviation. On 9 October 2012, Brazilian federal prosecutors announced that they had successfully appealed the sentence of the pilots, asking to increase their sentences by 17 months (a total of 5 years and 9 months). The new trial was scheduled for 15 October, with the pilots again facing trial in absentia. On that date, the court upheld the prior convictions, but modified the sentences to 37 months for each, requiring that the pilots [...] "report regularly to authorities and stay home at night." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the {{settlement}} of the Chandler's lawsuit was announced on January 25, 1994, L.A. District Attorney Gil Garcetti announced he supported amending a law that prohibits forcing {{people who say they}} have been sexually assaulted to testify in criminal proceedings. The amendment introduced into the state assembly the week of February 7 would have immediately allowed Garcetti to compel Jordan to testify. Around that time, Santa Barbara police interviewed the 13-year-old son of one of Jackson's former maids (who had told them her son had spent time with Jackson) and then arranged for him to see a therapist after he repeatedly denied being abused. [...] <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>deposition,</b> his mother stated when she asked the police about who she could speak to about her concerns about their meetings and phone conversations with her son without her present, they arranged for her and her son to see separate therapists. On April 11, 1994, the grand jury session in Santa Barbara was extended for an additional 90-day term to allow Sneddon to gather more evidence and prosecution sources admitted to being frustrated in their grand jury probe, failing to find direct evidence of the molestation charges. The final grand jury ultimately disbanded without ever returning an indictment against Jackson.|$|E
