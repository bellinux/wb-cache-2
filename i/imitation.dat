40|$|A retarded {{child was}} taught to imitate diverse demonstrations made by an experimenter, until new demonstrations were imitated {{correctly}} upon first presentation without direct training. These <b>imitations</b> could be maintained without reinforcement, when they were distributed among other reinforced <b>imitations.</b> Factors responsible for the continued performance of these unreinforced <b>imitations</b> were examined. When subjected to massed extinction trials, unreinforced <b>imitations</b> eventually disappeared; they reappeared when again interspersed among reinforced <b>imitations.</b> In addition, the stimulus function of “similarity of response between subject and experimenter” was examined. The subject was taught a set of non-imitative responses, through discriminative stimuli controlled by the experimenter, and a comparable imitative set. Unreinforced non-imitations, like reinforced <b>imitations,</b> were maintained only when interspersed among reinforced <b>imitations.</b> When all reinforcement was discontinued, all responses extinguished similarly, indicating that reinforcement was necessary to maintain the response-class organization, but not confirming an essential role for “similarity” as such...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSounds are notably {{difficult}} to describe. It is thus {{not surprising that}} human speakers often use many imitative vocalizations to communicate about sounds. In practice,vocal <b>imitations</b> of non-speech everyday sounds (e. g. {{the sound of a}} car passing by) arevery effective: listeners identify sounds better with vocal <b>imitations</b> than with verbal descriptions, despite the fact that vocal <b>imitations</b> are often inaccurate, constrained by the human vocal apparatus. The present study investigated the semantic representations evoked by vocal <b>imitations</b> by experimentally quantifying how well listeners could match sounds to category labels. Itcompared two different types of sounds: human vocal <b>imitations,</b> and computational auditory sketches (created by algorithmic computations), both based on easily identifiable sounds (sounds of human actions and manufactured products). The results show that performance with the best vocal <b>imitations</b> was similar to the best auditory sketches for most categories of sounds. More detailed analyses showed that the acoustic distance between vocal <b>imitations</b> and referent sounds is not sufficient to account for such performance. They suggested that instead of reproducing the acoustic properties of the referent sound as accurately as vocally possible, vocal <b>imitations</b> focus on a few important features dependent on each particular sound category...|$|R

5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with <b>imitation</b> and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for <b>imitation</b> in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDescribing complex sounds {{with words}} is a {{difficult}} task. In fact, previous {{studies have shown that}} vocal <b>imitations</b> of sounds are more effective than verbal descriptions [Lemaitre and Rocchesso (2014). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 135, 862 – 873]. The current study investigated how vocal <b>imitations</b> of sounds enable their recognition by studying how two expert and two lay participants reproduced four basic auditory features: pitch, tempo, sharpness, and onset. It used 4 sets of 16 referent sounds (modulated narrowband noises and pure tones), based on 1 feature or crossing 2 of the 4 features. Dissimilarity rating experiments and multidimensional scaling analyses confirmed that listeners could accurately perceive the four features composing the four sets of referent sounds. The four participants recorded vocal <b>imitations</b> of the four sets of sounds. Analyses identified three strategies: (1) Vocal <b>imitations</b> of pitch and tempo reproduced faithfully the absolute value of the feature; (2) Vocal <b>imitations</b> of sharpness transposed the feature into the participants' registers; (3) Vocal <b>imitations</b> of onsets categorized the continuum of onset values into two discrete morphological profiles. Overall, these results highlight that vocal <b>imitations</b> do not simply mimic the referent sounds, but seek to emphasize the characteristic features of the referent sounds within the constraints of human vocal production...|$|R
