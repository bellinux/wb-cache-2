40|$|The {{so-called}} “Green Revolution” has marginalized and depopulated {{many rural}} areas, but economic diversification has emerged since the 1980 s. Consumer appreciation for organic farming and proximity sourcing has increased, and farmers {{have responded to}} this market. Since 2008 the economic crisis has led to importation of low-quality food products at an unsustainable level of energy costs, {{and the lack of}} employment opportunity has led people to seek economic opportunities in the countryside, producing foods with ecological criteria for short food supply chains. Within this scenario, Social Farming (SF) has appeared as a multifunctional innovative strategy. It gives a return to society through the production and processing of agricultural products by incorporating <b>direct</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> in employment, training, and therapy or rehabilitation of groups at risk of social exclusion. SF offers social cohesion, empowerment of vulnerable groups, local development in rural and peri-urban settings, and an equitable balance between revenues and costs to society...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:. In {{our opinion}} {{the study of}} poverty has to be {{considered}} essential for social psychologists today; their efforts should be devoted to obtain fast and <b>direct</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefits.</b> We think that the main theoretical problem {{is represented by the}} "re-definition " of the object "poverty". The pilot phase of this research is based on three separate studies carried out with different samples. The aim of the research is to get acquainted with attitudes, perceptions and the social representation of poverty. In order to get data as "pure " as possible, only children entered the study. So the obtained results will set up the basis for a wider research project. Social psychologists must face strongly the problem of poverty. Their aim has to be devoted to obtain results characterized by an immediate heuristic value and quick social effects. Nevertheless, social studies on poverty have not yet reached a realistic phase in Italy. The European Community approached the theoretical aspect seriously, and an Italian "ad hoc " committee provided appropriate data. In spite of that, the "poverty problem " has still to be defined more precisely and its psycho-social meaning better understood...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of {{stratification}} of health and income in the social cost of healthrelated early retirement, as evidenced in the German Socio-economic Panel (GSOEP). We interpret early retirement as a mechanism to limit work-related declines in health that allows poorer and less healthy workers to maximize the total discounted value of annuities received from Germany’s pay-as-you-go pension system. Investments in new medical technology and better access to existing health services may help to curb the need for early retirement and thus improve efficiency, especially amid population ageing. To value the potential gains, we calibrate an intertemporal model based on ex post predictions from stratified duration regressions for individual retirement timing. We conclude that eliminating the correlation between income and health decline would delay {{the average age of}} retirement by approximately half a year, while keeping all workers in the highest of five categories of self assessed health would yield a further delay of up to three years. Had this scenario been realized during our 1992 – 2005 sample period, we estimate the social costs of early retirement would have been more than 20 percent lower, even without counting the <b>direct</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> from better health...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} {{two methods}} of controlling rent-seeking {{costs associated with}} opportunistic and anti-competitive intellectual property lawsuits. One method discourages rent-seeking costs by reducing the credibility of weak lawsuits. This can he accomplished by restricting preliminary injunctions, encouraging declaratory judgment suits, adjusting the substantive law to encourage summary judgment for defendants, and shifting attorney fees from rent-seeking plaintiffs to prevailing defendants. In addition, antitrust suits have a limited role in deterring the most egregious anti-competitive conduct. A more extreme method eliminates rent-seeking costs by restricting or eliminating certain intellectual property rights. Such an extreme measure is justified if a right generates relatively little <b>direct</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefit,</b> and pre- and post-trial control measures are not effective in containing rent-seeking costs...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} essay we examine optimal {{investment}} in public infrastructure when used to attract {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI). We model a monopolistic multinational firm that wants to establish its production plant {{in one of two}} prospective host countries with segmented markets, hence there is no arbitrage between the markets. Preceding the firm 2 ̆ 7 s location decision, the government of one of the prospective host countries invests in public infrastructure, while the other prospective host government is policy inactive. We identify country characteristics that make a government more likely to use investment in public infrastructure to attract FDI. We find that countries with a large market size, low social cost of public funds, large <b>direct</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> and high effectiveness of public infrastructure {{are most likely to be}} successful in attracting FDI into their jurisdiction by investing in public infrastructure. We also examine the effect of trade liberalisation between the two markets on optimal investment in public infrastructure. We find that a non-monotonic relationship exists between trade costs and optimal investment in public infrastructure. In the second essay we use a similar set-up as in the first essay. However, we now explicitly introduce domestic firms into the model. Simultaneously to the MNE 2 ̆ 7 s location decision, these firms, also benefiting from the investment in public infrastructure, decide whether to remain producers for the domestic market only or to become exporters instead. We show that, under certain conditions, a government that invests in public infrastructure to attract foreign direct investment through manipulation, may at the same time turn its domestic firms into exporters. The third essay models a competition - for - FDI game between governments that use different policy instruments: one government invests in public infrastructure, while the other uses its corporate tax rate to entice foreign firms. We model a monopolistic multinational firm, considering to set up a plant in one of two prospective host countries with segmented markets. Governments set policies before the multinational chooses its production location. Also, the government that invests in public infrastructure determines its policy prior to the other government setting its corporate tax rate. When governments compete, there is likely to be a race to the bottom" in taxes and a race to the top" in public infrastructure investment. In the final essay we set up a two-stage game in which two governments, competing for FDI, both invest in public infrastructure and set corporate tax rates. We investigate how public infrastructural investment affects tax competition. We assume that investment in public infrastructure by one country may generate spillovers - positive or negative - for the other country. When the infrastructure investment implies significantly negative spillovers for competing host countries, the investing government will strategically under-invest to ease tax competition, while it will strategically over-invest when the spillovers are negative but small or when these are positive. We also examine how two different forms of tax harmonisation affect investment in public infrastructure. Tax harmonisation in the form of a minimum tax can eliminate strategic investment in public infrastructure. While tax harmonisation in the form of a cooperative tax will result in higher taxes. Furthermore, the level of investment in public infrastructure will also be higher...|$|E

40|$|Across Australia {{urban renewal}} and {{regeneration}} programs, generally run through departments of housing, seek to redress {{economic and social}} marginalisation in the nation’s most disadvantaged areas. From earlier programs that focussed primarily on the physical aspects of redevelopment, recent efforts {{are concerned with the}} economic and social challenges. With the shift in emphasis it is timely to reflect on the representation of marginalisation and disadvantage that characterises these programs, how this knowledge is produced and resultant avenues for intervention. In this paper we use discourse analysis of state government program documents to argue that areas are identified and stereotyped {{in such a way that}} they are singled out from the rest of the nation or state as highly dysfunctional areas that require renormalising. We argue that the representation of marginalisation thus further marginalises these areas. As a result the state is placed in the role of the expert who devises and implements intervention programs, while those who live in these areas are expected to voluntarily cooperate in the “treatment”. We ask might these areas be represented in very different terms thereby prompting very different types of interventions? For example, might residents be positioned as already active and expert practitioners of activities that hold the seeds for an improved future? What types of intervention might flow from such a representation? We explore these questions by drawing on research into the diversity of economic practices that exist within our so-called capitalist economy and we highlight how those in marginalised areas can be portrayed as economically active citizens, contributing in diverse ways to economic activities that produce <b>direct</b> <b>social</b> <b>benefit.</b> We elaborate how this representation results in policies and programs which recognise and build on the current economic activities and social contributions of those in marginalised areas.

40|$|International {{comparisons}} {{have long}} shown that income inequality {{and the proportion}} of people at risk of relative poverty in the Czech Republic are among the lowest both in the EU and across the world's most developed countries (OECD). Data from representative surveys on household incomes and expenditures show that the Czech tax and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> system has rather little effect on income equality and the risk of poverty. Relatively low variation in gross income, for which the old-age pension system plays a key role, plays a greater part in maintaining the low rates of both measures. If besides <b>direct</b> taxes and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> we also take into account the effects of indirect taxation (value added tax and consumer taxes), then we find that the current system reduces income inequality relatively little, and in fact slightly increases the relative poverty risk. 80 % of those in relative poverty and 33 % of other individuals are in receipt of at least one <b>social</b> <b>benefit.</b> Only 38 % of total expenditures on state social support are spent on people who are at risk of relative income poverty.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{are present in}} the microeconomic models of fertility. One of them considers children as durable consumer goods, so the child is a value per se for his/her parents. The alternative approach looks at them as capital goods. Parents consider the returns from transfers and services, child labor and old age care, as well as the benefits from the increased risk community. It is likely that both motivations can be observed when looking at real fertil-ity decisions. However, theoretical models set aside one of the images, in order to simplify the otherwise complicated structure of decisions. We set out, basing our analysis on the capital good theory, that replac-ing the flow of intergenerational transfers in family with one between gen-erations of society has several positive effects. Yet negative consequences also can be observed, from which we consider fertility effects only.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the conditions under which}} social policy would be constrained by European economic integration and assesses whether a Social Charter is needed.

The completion of the single European market after 1992 could have implications for the conduct of social policy in member countries of the European Com-munity (EC).

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper was to examine the <b>direct</b> {{economic}} and <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> accruing from the Birdsville Races. The paper also explores how strategic place marketing has been used to shape the image of the destination, and how this has provided a boost to tourism visitation to periods outside of the event. Design/methodology/approach - This study was based around a textual analysis of online discourse, interviews with local residents and business owners and a survey of visitors. Findings - The data indicate that the Races make a solid contribution to the local, regional and state economy; however the local economic benefits are relatively limited due to the high level of leakages. It is also clear that the Races provide important <b>social</b> <b>benefits</b> by generating a strong sense of history, togetherness and engagement among the local community. Another important benefit is the national and international exposure the event receives, enabling the generation of additional economic benefits. Research limitations/implications - The practical implications of this study are that regardless of its size and/or location, the staging of a high-quality event or festival can help a destination to market itself effectively, both nationally and internationally. This exposure will generate additional benefits to the destination, region, state and nation. A successful event can also enable a destination attract substantial government funding that can further enhance the event experience. Originality/value - This paper illustrates that an event hosted in a very remote destination in outback Australia can provide direct benefits as well as indirect benefits.
