Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with <b>foul</b> <b>air</b> and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Because Taihōs hangars were {{completely}} enclosed, mechanical ventilation {{was the only}} means of exhausting <b>fouled</b> <b>air</b> and replacing it with fresh. Ventilation duct gates were opened on either side of hangar sections No. 1 and No. 2 and, for a time, the carrier's aft elevator was lowered to try to increase the draught. But even this failed to have any appreciable effect and, in any case, air operations were resumed about noon, requiring the elevator to be periodically raised as aircraft were brought up to the flight deck. In desperation, damage control parties used hammers to smash out the glass in the ship's portholes.|$|R
25|$|Although a {{precursor}} to the flush toilet system which is widely used nowadays was designed in 1596 by John Harington, such systems did not come into widespread use until the late nineteenth century. With {{the onset of the}} industrial revolution and related advances in technology, the flush toilet began to emerge into its modern form. A crucial advance in plumbing, was the S-trap, invented by the Scottish mechanic Alexander Cummings in 1775, and still in use today. This device uses the standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of <b>foul</b> <b>air</b> from the sewer. It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention. This period coincided with the dramatic growth in the sewage system, especially in London, which made the flush toilet particularly attractive for health and sanitation reasons.|$|E
25|$|Champneys {{suggested}} that, {{in order}} to protect the books and manuscripts, 'it will be very desirable to keep the air in the interior of the building as clear and free from smoke and chemical matter (both of which are held in the air of Manchester) as may be possible'. The ground floor was built with numerous air inlets and, although his client felt it would prove impossible to exclude <b>foul</b> <b>air,</b> Champneys installed jute or hessian screens to trap the soot, with water sprays to catch the sulphur and other chemicals, which was a very advanced system for the period. Internal screen doors were employed in the entrance hall to prevent the air being 'fouled by the opening of the outer doors' with internal swing doors between the circulation areas and the main library to 'preserve the valuable books from injury'. By 1900 the ventilation system had evolved to include electric fans to draw in air at pavement level through coke screens sprayed with water.|$|E
25|$|Diseases such as typhus or cholera {{appeared}} very quickly. The close confinement of {{the accommodations}} {{and the number}} of prisoners per barrack, on average 250, partly explains the phenomenon, as the <b>foul</b> <b>air</b> circulated very little. An official policy of integration of different nationalities mean that typhus tended to spread rapidly from Russian troops, among whom it was endemic, to the French and British who had little immunity to it. In February 1915, the camp at Chemnitz was placed under quarantine; one prisoner wrote that the only vehicles approaching the camp were those transporting coffins. Serious outbreaks of typhus occurred at the camps at Wittenberg, Gardelegen, Cassel and Cottbus, among others: at Cassel, for example, of 18,300 prisoners, there were 7,218 cases of typhus, with a mortality rate of 11 per cent. In November 1915, a circular from the war ministry was sent to the various camps to put in place rules of hygiene. The fight against lice was at the centre of measures to be taken by using hair-removing creams and disinfecting rooms. Vaccines were also ordered, and a vaccination frenzy ensued. For instance, Charles Gueugnier was vaccinated against typhus on 28 September 1915, only to be re-vaccinated on 2 and 7 October. At Merseburg camp, the blankets were de-loused {{for the first time on}} 5 June 1915.|$|E

40|$|Cooling towers are {{considered}} {{as the main}} method of cooling {{in most of the}} electric power generation, because they are relatively inexpensive and dependable means of removing low-grade heat from cooling water. The study is concerned with the problems that occur in cooling towers at Dr. Mahmoud Sharif Power Station and their effects on the towers efficiency and to the maintenance cost. These problems include scale deposition, corrosion, microbiological growth, <b>fouling,</b> <b>air</b> suspended particles, clogged spray nozzles and cooling tower fan system problems. The objectives of this study are to investigate the above-mentioned problems and to study their effects on the cooling towers performance and to propose solution for these problems, in order to improve the performance of cooling towers and consequently achieve low maintenance cost and high plant efficiency with longer equipments life. Many solutions have been suggested to solve or reduce these problems, the solutions include installation of sidestream filter, air intake filters, conductivity control instrument, covering the distribution basins, use of better chemical treatment and introduction of cooling tower vacuum pump...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a review on the fouling mechanism {{and its effect}} onto the performance of finned tube heat exchangers in HVAC systems. Fouling tends to degrade the performance of heat exchangers by decreasing the heat transfer coefficient and increasing the air-side pressure drop across the heat exchangers. <b>Air</b> side <b>fouling</b> depends {{on a number of}} factors on the air side, including type and concentration of fouling matter, size of particles in the <b>fouling</b> matter, and <b>air</b> velocity. Additionally, it depends on the heat exchanger design, e. g. heat exchanger geometry, fin geometry, and fin spacing. Â Various studies indicate that the effect of <b>fouling</b> on <b>air</b> pressure drop is higher than its degrading effect on heat transfer coefficient. Studies on heat exchanger fouling in HVAC systems indicate that the actual effect of the fouling onto system efficiency additionally depends on the employed refrigerant. ...|$|R

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers {{as a means of}} controlling sulfuric acid emissions. The coincident removal of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid will also be determined, as will the removal of arsenic, a known poison for NOX selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts. EPRI, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), First Energy Corporation, and the Dravo Lime Company are project co-funders. URS Corporation is the prime contractor. This is the second reporting period for the subject Cooperative Agreement. During this period, the first of four short-term sorbent injection tests were conducted at the First Energy Bruce Mansfield Plant. This test determined the effectiveness of dolomite injection through out-of-service burners as a means of controlling sulfuric acid emissions from this unit. The tests showed that dolomite injection could achieve up to 95 % sulfuric acid removal. Balance of plant impacts on furnace slagging and <b>fouling,</b> <b>air</b> heater <b>fouling,</b> ash loss-on-ignition, and the flue gas desulfurization system were also determined.

Faced with opposition and conflict from various political factions, including property owners whose private deeds conflicted with the property lines of the Magnin-Goerck, and the reality that any plan the Council came up with could be overturned by a subsequent Council, the city asked the state legislature for help.

40|$|A 2. 4 -m³ {{pilot plant}} MBR for {{wastewater}} treatment {{was designed and}} constructed for membrane biofouling studies. Three categories of membrane fouling study were carried out with this MBR pilot plant {{in order to obtain}} a better understanding of MBR performance and fouling. Firstly, critical flux assessment based on various defining concepts and influencing parameters was examined. The results showed small variations of critical flux values obtained from different defining concepts. Decline of critical flux as the step change of <b>fouling</b> <b>air</b> flow rate increased was observed, while step length had no obvious effects on the critical flux. A positive relationship between aeration rate and critical flux is observed, while higher sludge concentration caused lower critical flux. Secondly, fouling mechanisms under different sludge composition and different flux regimes were tested. Under supra-critical flux operation, cake resistance accounted for the main fouling contribution, while pore fouling was marginal in both supra-critical flux and sub-critical flux regimes. EPS carbohydrate in soluble and bound forms has greater impact on both pore fouling and cake fouling than protein. Finally, optimization of the MBR pilot plant was carried out. Based on equivalent permeate yield and equivalent energy consumption for each experimental run, three operational variables showed significant influence in membrane fouling rate increase. They were, in the order of importance, filtration mode > scouring frequency > regular aeration intensity. The optimum operating conditions determined by the proposed methodology were 11 L/m². min air intensity with continuous filtration and scouring 24 times per day for the pilot plant MBR...|$|R
