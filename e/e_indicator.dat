However, the smoothed location model is infeasible in estimating parameters when a large number of binary variables involved in the study. To handle this issue, the combination of two variable extraction techniques namely principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) are carried out before the construction of the smoothed location model. In fact, there are four types of MCA but only Indicator MCA and joint correspondence analysis (JCA) will be discussed in this article. Thus, the performance of the smoothed location model together with combination of PCA and two types of MCA, i. <b>e.</b> <b>Indicator</b> MCA and JCA, will be compared and evaluated. The overall results from simulation study show that the smoothed location model performed better when the binary extraction is done by JCA rather than the Indicator MCA in terms of misclassification rate and computational efficiency...|$|E

The upstream increasing pollution and decreasing salinity levels along the Western Scheldt estuary (Fig. 1) are reflected in the dry/wet weight ratio and lipid content of the periwinkles. Compared to the Eastern Scheldt, female intersex (i. <b>e.</b> <b>indicator</b> of TBT pollution) and sterility occurred more frequently in the Western Scheldt estuary, while male penis shedding was even restricted to the latter estuary. The highest population intersex and sterility incidence was found near the harbour of Vlissingen and reflects potential nautical activities. The number of trematode infested periwinkles did not differ between both estuaries, although local sampling site differences were detected within each estuary, reflecting the complex interactions that exist among parasites, hosts and the local environment. Finally, both estuaries were maximally discriminated from each other based on the shell weight of the periwinkles using a canonical discriminant analysis. Periwinkles with the heaviest shells were found in the Western Scheldt estuary and may reflect growth rate or structural population differences caused by the less favourable living conditions in the Western Scheldt estuary...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the forest}} sector, the {{sustainability}} concept {{has evolved from}} a narrow focus on sustainable wood production to a much broader evaluation of environmental, social, and economic sustainability for whole value chains. A new software tool – ToSIA – has been developed for assessing sustainability impacts of Forest-Wood-Chains (FWCs). In the approach, FWCs are defined as chains of production processes (e. g. harvesting–transport–industrial processing), which are linked with products (e. g. a timber frame house). Sustainability is determined by analysing environmental, economic, and social sustainability indicators for all the production processes along the FWC. The tool calculates sustainability values as products of the relative indicator values (i. <b>e.</b> <b>indicator</b> value expressed per unit of material flow) multiplied with the material flow entering the process. Calculated sustainability values are then aggregated for the segments of the FWC or for the complete chain. The sustainability impact assessment requires carefully specified system boundaries. ToSIA uses a data-oriented approach that is very flexible in {{the focus of the}} analysis and the selection of indicators of sustainability. An example of alternative Norway spruce management systems in Southern Germany and their effects on six sustainability indicators is presented. The less intensive management system with natural regeneration and motor–manual harvesting shows higher carbon storage and slightly less energy use. It creates more employment and higher labour costs, but the average rate of accidents is also higher. ToSIA offers a transparent and consistent methodological framework to assess sustainability impacts in the forest-based sector as affected, e. g. by changes in policies, market conditions, or technology. The paper discusses strengths and limitations of the approach and provides an outlook on further development perspectives of the methodology...|$|E

40|$|Current drought {{monitoring}} and early warning systems use different indicators for monitoring drought conditions and apply different indicator thresholds and rules for assigning drought intensity classes or issue warnings or alerts. Nevertheless, {{there is little}} knowledge {{on the meaning of}} different hydro-meteorologic indicators for impact occurrence on the ground. To date, there have been very few attempts to systematically characterize the indicator–impact relationship owing to sparse and patchy data on drought impacts. The newly established European Drought Impact report Inventory (EDII) offers the possibility to investigate this linkage. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the link between hydro-meteorologic indicators and drought impacts for the case study area Germany and thus to test the potential of qualitative impact data for evaluating the performance of drought indicators. As drought indicators two climatological drought indices – the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) – as well as streamflow and groundwater level percentiles were selected. Linkage was assessed though data visualization, extraction of indicator values concurrent with impact onset, and correlation analysis between monthly time series of indicator and impact data at the federal state level, and between spatial patterns for selected drought events. The analysis clearly revealed a significant moderate to strong correlation for some states and drought events allowing for an intercomparison of the performance of different drought indicators. Important findings were strongest correlation for intermediate accumulation periods of SPI and SPEI, a slightly better performance of SPEI versus SPI, and a similar performance of streamflow percentiles to SPI in many cases. Apart from these commonalities, the analysis also exposed differences among federal states and drought events, suggesting that the linkage is time variant and region specific to some degree. Concerning "thresholds" for drought impact onset, i. <b>e.</b> <b>indicator</b> values concurrent with past impact onsets, we found that no single "best" threshold value can be identified but impacts occur within a range of indicator values. Nevertheless, the median of the threshold distributions showed differences between northern/northeastern versus southern/southwestern federal states, and among drought events. While the findings strongly depend on data and may change with a growing number of EDII entries in the future, this study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of evaluating hydro-meteorologic variables with text-based impact reports and highlights the value of impact reporting as a tool for monitoring drought conditions...|$|E
40|$|Aim of the study: This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} whether displacement activities {{had an effect on}} preschool children’s internalization of a rule, that is, on the ability to comply with an adult’s demands even without surveillance. Displacement activities are commonly recognized as behavioral patterns, mostly including self-directed actions (e. g. scratching, self-touching), which often occur in situations involving conflicting motivational tendencies. In ethology, several researchers have suggested that displacement activities could facilitate individuals in dealing with the stress experienced in a frustrating context. In child developmental research, some authors have assessed whether distraction strategies could help children to inhibit a dominant response during delay of gratification tasks (i. e., tasks in which they need to postpone a pleasant activity). However, {{little is known about the}} role played by the displacement activities displayed by young children in such situations, especially when children are required to comply with an adult’s request without surveillance. In this study, we hypothesized that displacement activities would have helped children to cope with the stress experienced during the delay to play with an attractive stimulus, thus functioning as regulators of their emotional state and facilitating children to wait longer in the task. We also hypothesized that playing with an alternative toy would have functioned as distractor and led children to be better able to tolerate the delay. Method: To this end, we administered 143 2 -to- 4 -year-olds with a delay maintenance task and related their performance with the displacement activities they showed during the delay and with different types of actions (i. e., literal, conventional, and symbolic actions) produced with an alternative object (i. e., four rubber ducks). Results: Children’s latency to touch the musical box (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>indicator</b> of internalization) was positively related with the rate of displacement activities. However, the rate of displacement activities increased progressively as long as children were able to inhibit the interaction with the musical box. In addition, the rate of displacement activities during the first minute of test did not predict the ability of children to inhibit the interaction with the box. Furthermore, none of the different types of action with the rubber ducks had an effect on children’s delay tolerance. Conclusion: These results suggest that displacement activities represented a functionless by-product of motivational conflict rather than a strategy that children used to inhibit a response toward an attractive stimulus in a delay maintenance task without adult’s surveillance. Moreover, distraction with an alternative object did not help children to perform better in the task...|$|E

Some 1 % of the UK {{population}} derives their {{potable water}} from 140, 000 private water supplies (PWSs) regulated by Local Authorities. The {{overwhelming majority of}} these are very small domestic supplies serving a single property or {{a small number of}} properties. Treatment for such supplies is rudimentary or non-existent and their microbiological quality {{has been shown to be}} poor in every published study to date. Private water supplies serving commercial enterprises such as hotels, restaurants, food production premises and factories are more frequently treated and subject to closer regulation in the United Kingdom. As a result, it has been assumed that these larger commercial supplies are less likely to experience elevated faecal indicator and pathogen concentrations at the consumer tap which have been observed at small domestic supplies. This paper reports on intensive monitoring at seven commercial private water supplies (six of which were treated) spread throughout the UK serving hotels, holiday parks and food production enterprises. Daily sampling of ?potable? water, both at the consumer tap and using large volume filtration for Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. was conducted over two six week periods in the spring and autumn of 2000. This allowed the effects of short term episodic peaks in faecal indicator and pathogen concentration to be quantified. All the supplies experienced intermittent pathogen presence and only one, a chlorinated deep borehole supply, fully complied with UK water quality regulations during both periods of sampling. Poor microbiological water quality typically followed periods of heavy rainfall. This suggests that the design and installation of such systems should be undertaken only after the likely range of raw water quality has been characterised, which requires a thorough understanding of the effects of flow and seasonality on raw water quality. There is no reason to suspect that the monitored sites are uncharacteristic of other commercial supplies and the results reinforce public health concerns related to domestic supplies. Furthermore, the pattern of contamination is highly episodic, commonly lasting only a few days. Thus, the relatively infrequent regulatory monitoring of such supplies would be unlikely to identify the poor water quality episodes and does not provide the data necessary for public health protection. Although some statistical relationship was found between faecal indicator organisms and the presence of pathogens, the use of FIOs in assessments of regulatory compliance may not always provide a reliable measure of public health risk, i. <b>e.</b> <b>indicator</b> absence does not preclude pathogen presence. The results of this study suggest that a risk assessment system similar to the WHO ?Water Safety Planning? approach might offer a more appropriate regulatory paradigm for private water supplies.

40|$|South Africa {{is one of}} the {{countries}} hardest hit with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. In response to the epidemic, the South African government adopted the Comprehensive HIV & AIDS Care, Management and Treatment programme strategic plan (CCMT) in 2000 (1) and developed the Operational Plan for CCMT for antiretroviral therapy rollout in 2003 (2). In order to monitor the progress of the implementation of CCMT, the National Department of Health (NDOH) adopted the Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E) framework in 2004 (3). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the HIV & AIDS programme in Grahamstown‘s public sector health care system by using the national M & <b>E</b> <b>indicators</b> of the HIV & AIDS programme. The national M & E framework was used as the data collection tool and available information was collected from various sources such as the District Health Office (DHO), Primary Health Care (PHC) office, accredited antiretroviral sites and the provincial pharmaceutical depot. Group interviews were conducted with key stakeholder health care professionals at the District Health Office, Primary Health Care office, Settlers Hospital and the provincial Department of Health personnel. A one-on-one interview was conducted with the Deputy Director of HIV & AIDS Directorate, monitoring and evaluation in the National Department of Health. Available indicators such as budget and expenditure including antiretroviral procurement; human resources; nutrition-related indicators; prevention care and treatment indicators were collected. A group interview was conducted to document current practices, or where there was a lack of documentation, for indicators such as traditional medicines and pharmacovigilance. Most of the national M & <b>E</b> <b>indicators</b> are not required to be collected or collated by the district because the reporting format designed by the provincial Department of Health is different. Facilities, districts and provinces in South Africa are at different levels of implementation of the antiretroviral programme and hence a common format of the M & <b>E</b> <b>indicators</b> is not used by all provinces. Uniform data collection is not achieved due to human resources‘ constraints and other challenges such as continued use of manual reporting systems by the clinics. Districts are expected to report according to the formats drawn up by the provincial Department of Health (DOH) and there is a lack of awareness regarding the national M & E document amongst the Grahamstown Health Care Professionals. There is a need for training on the use of the M & E national framework so that the HCPs at the primary and secondary levels of the health care system are proficient with the process of M & E, and can provide inputs as well as take ownership of the process. The establishment of an M & E unit in Grahamstown is essential so that data collection and submission of the HIV & AIDS programme in the public sector according to the National M & E framework is addressed. However, despite all constraints and challenges in the public sector health care system in Grahamstown, available human and financial resources are being used effectively to maintain the HIV & AIDS programme. ...|$|R

A woman’s physical attractiveness is a cardinal component of women’s mate value. We correlated observer-assessed physical attractiveness (face, body, and overall) with expressed preferences for four clusters of mate characteristics (N = 214) : (1) hypothesized good-gene <b>indicators</b> (<b>e.</b> g., masculinity, sexiness); (2) hypothesized good investment <b>indicators</b> (<b>e.</b> g., potential income); (3) good parenting <b>indicators</b> (<b>e.</b> g., desire for home and children), and (4) good partner <b>indicators</b> (<b>e.</b> g., being a loving partner). Results supported the hypothesis that high mate value women, as indexed by observer-judged physical attractiveness, expressed elevated standards for all four clusters of mate characteristics. Discussion focuses on potential design features of the hypothesized mate-value calibration adaptation, and suggests an important modification of the trade-off model of women’s mating. A minority of women— notably those low in mate value who are able to escape male mate guarding and the manifold costs of an exposed infidelity—will pursue a mixed mating strategy, obtaining investment from one man and good genes from an extra-pair copulation partner (as the trade-off model predicts). Since the vast majority of women secure genes and direct benefits from the same man, however, most women will attempt to secure the best combination of all desired qualities from the same man...|$|R

Our interpretation is that the standard deviation, the skewness and the kurtosis of the risk-neutral densities are significantly higher than the central moments of subjective densities. Finally, we show that the higher moments of risk-neutral densities are able to explain a significant part of the variability in the estimated risk premium.

40|$|The {{connection}} between environmental public health regulations, regulatory science, {{and public health}} gains can, at times, be difficult to elucidate. Why? Some challenges are raised by the complex mosaic {{of federal and state}} regulatory decisions, differences in the implementation of those decisions at more local levels, the multiple determinants of disease, and temporal lags between exposure and ultimate health outcomes (National Research Council 2007). This difficulty in making linkages between regulations and health outcomes often necessitates the choice of indirect measurements of success such as process <b>indicators</b> (<b>e.</b> g., number of facilities inspected) or emissions <b>indicators</b> (<b>e.</b> g., tonnage of pollutants captured). Such indirect indicators fail to make the necessary connection to human exposure or health outcomes. The challenge remains to make these linkages at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales to bolster the evidence base for environmental decisionmaking [U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2008 b]...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{implementation}} of PINDU (Center for Information Services and Complaint) Program Policy Innovation in Pinrang District. This study is a study of innovation implementation using factor structure indicators, namely rules and communication, incentive, openness, and balance. This research is qualitative. Data collection is done through observation, interview, and literature. Data from observations and interviews are presented {{in the form of}} documentation of the research object. Data from the literature results are presented in the form of quotations to reinforce the research findings. The data obtained are analyzed and processed using phenomenology technique. The results show that the rules in PINDU are very clear which is seen from Regulation of Regent Number 25 of 2014 about PINDU Formation of Pinrang District Government and from Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) of PINDU. The rules have been well implemented by PINDU officers as well as by PINDU users. By complying with existing rules, then the exchange of information is very smooth and clear. Completeness of facilities and infrastructure in PINDU indicates the existence of incentives in PINDU. In addition, openness between structures is also very open so that officers are able to balance between professionalism in working with the influence of interested groups. Thus, the implementation of PINDU program policy innovation can be said to run in accordance with existing indicators. However, there are still some indicators that need to be improved, i. <b>e.</b> <b>indicators</b> of communication and openness to the public...|$|R
