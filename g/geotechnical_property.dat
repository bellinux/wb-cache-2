The survey associated the geotechnical engineering and the sedimentary geology of the late Pleistocene–Holocene deposits at five sites and also undifferentiated Pleistocene sediments. A cross-section which was rebuilt in the delta progradation-direction and between the Mekong and Bassac rivers represents the stratigraphy. Each sedimentary unit was formed under a different delta formation mechanism and revealed a typical <b>geotechnical</b> <b>property</b> sequence. The mechanical behaviors of the sediment succession in the tide-dominated delta with significant fluvial-activity and material source tend to be more cohesionless soils and strengths than those in the tide- and wave-dominated delta and even the coast. The particular tendency of the mechanical behavior of the deposit succession can be reasonably estimated from the delta formation mechanism. The characteristics of the clay minerals from the Mekong River produced the argillaceous soil which does not have extremely high plasticity. The microstructure development-levels are low to very high indicating how to choose hydraulic conductivity value, k, for estimating overconsolidation ratio, OCR, by the piezocone penetration tests (CPTU). The OCR of sediments in the delta types strangely change with depth but none less than 1.

Their basic design methods and construction techniques have undergone some changes with the development of modern engineered products as per end use requirements. Out of these the development of geotextiles in the past three decades had provided the strategies for enhancing the overall performance of the paved roadways. Several varieties of Geotextiles either in the form of woven or non-woven have since been developed for a number of end uses mainly as underlay in road construction for strengthening the pavement structure by increasing the soil compactness apart from the other end uses.

We also performed engineering property tests (compaction, California bearing ratio (CBR) and triaxial) both at the stabilized and unstabilized states with the addition of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % coconut shell and husk ash (CSHA) contents. The results showed that the soil samples were well graded sand with good to excellent rating as subgrade material for pavement construction. However, the engineering properties of the samples were further improved with the addition of 4 % CSHA contents. This caused reductions in the PI of samples A and C from 20. 43 to 16. 74 % and 29. 51 to 15. 67 % respectively and reduction at 2 % of CSHA in sample B. We obtained optimum values of maximum dry densities (MDD) and shear strengths at 4 % CSHA stabilization. The addition of CSHA increased the values of shear strengths to 136. 32, 146. 91 and 127. 96 kN/m 2 whereas MDD increased to 1939. 00, 1749. 86 and 2080. 25 kg/m 3 respectively in samples A, B and C.

Geotechnical analyses included index-property and sediment characterization, and consolidation, permeability, and triaxial testing. Excellent agreement exists between test data generated in this multilaboratory effort. Sediment characterization and index-property data delineate three well-defined units that conform with major lithologic divisions. Within Subunit IA these data appear inconsistent with accepted geotechnical relationships, showing water content, plasticity, and grain size increasing over similar intervals. These unusual relationships are attributed, in part, to silt-sized bonded clay aggregates. Within Subunit IB geotechnical properties become more uniform, and a marked increase in X-ray amorphous material occurs below 28 m sub-bottom. A pronounced change in the geotechnical behavior of Hole 576 A sediments occurs in Unit II and corresponds {{to the presence of}} calcareous oozes. Consolidation test results show overconsolidated sediments in the upper 28 m and normally consolidated sediments between 28 and 55 m sub-bottom. Mechanisms to explain the state of overconsolidation that are consistent with the geological history of the area include cementation and interparticle bonding, the release of high hydrostatic pressures during core recovery, and artifacts resulting from the consolidation test process. Additionally, the relevance of the preconsolidation stress determined using consolidation test results may be limited. Variations in the shear strength gradient with depth are consistent with the consolidation test results. The gradient for the overconsolidated interval (0 and 28 m sub-bottom) is significantly higher than between 28 and 55 m sub-bottom, where the sediments become normally consolidated...|$|E
40|$|The {{document}} attached {{has been}} archived {{with permission from}} the copyright holder. The reliability of foundations is greatly influenced by uncertainties associated with the geotechnical model on which their design is based. In turn, the geotechnical model is derived from a site investigation whose scope is largely dictated by financial constraints, rather than the variability of the ground. This paper seeks to quantify {{the influence of the}} scope of site investigations on the design of pad footings. This is achieved by simulating geotechnical profiles, where the soil properties vary from location to location in a random yet continuous and realistic fashion. The simulated soil profiles are generated using random field theory, which makes use of three statistical parameters: the mean, variance and the scale of fluctuation – which {{is a measure of the}} randomness of the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>property</b> in question. The methodology involves generating a geotechnical profile by simulating a 3 D random field to know soil properties at each point in detail. A site investigation is then simulated by sampling from the 3 D random field. By using the sampled values, a pad footing is designed to conform to a serviceability criterion, as would be achieved in practice. A benchmark design is also undertaken making use of the complete knowledge of the soil profile. This design is achieved using a numerical process involving a 3 D finite element analysis. Both designs are undertaken on numerous different simulated soil profiles in a Monte Carlo analysis. A comparison of the two designs provides failure and over-design probabilities for a series of site investigation plans. It was observed that the probability of failure and overdesign decreased with an increasing site investigation scope, as expected. The results provide information to estimate the relative benefit of conducting various scopes of site investigations...|$|E

One of the bridges is a two-span two-column-bent bridge with seat-type skew abutment {{and the other}} is a three-span three-column-bent bridge with seat-type skew abutment. A set of 40 pulse-like ground motions is applied to the bridges for nonlinear time-history analysis. In the transverse direction, two force-deformation models, which are based on strut-and-tie and sliding shear friction mechanisms, are used. The analytical models are based on the extensive experimental research previously conducted. A hyperbolic force-deformation model (General Hyperbolic Force Deformation) is used to represent the passive lateral resistance of the abutment backfill. For considering the possible variation in the backfill <b>geotechnical</b> <b>property,</b> three typical abutment backfill is chosen from the exciting data that was collected from multiple highway bridges in California. Two alternative methods are used to account for the effect of the abutment skew angle on the backfill reaction. The methods include an empirical relationship derived from experimental data, and an analytical method developed based on assumed log-spiral soil failure mechanism. A comparison parameter is proposed in this study, which is a representative of ductility demand of a skewed bridge to the same non-skewed bridge. For each case, the parameter is computed using the data derived from the nonlinear time-history analysis to investigate the seismic performance of bridges and compare the ductility demand of the specimen bridges. The outcome of this research reveals the significance of shear keys and abutment backfill on the global response of bridges. The sensitivity of the comparison parameter to the specimen bridges’ geometry is also discussed in detail in this study...|$|E

Through a combination of XRF and X-ray imagery, <b>geotechnical</b> <b>property</b> investigation, ice rafted debris counts, grain size analysis, foraminiferal counts and isotopic analysis; {{it is possible to}} investigate the claims put forward so far. Here we build on others work in combination with data from HH 13 - 100 GC in order to resolve some of the questions surrounding the process of Heinrich event initiation and evolution. HH 13 - 100 GC offers a comprehensive record of climate fluctuations of the past 130, 000 cal. BP. Not only Heinrich events are represented, but also a very clear record of marine isotope stage 5, including the last interglacial, the Eemian. Six Heinrich events spanning several thousand years were found within the 130, 000 cal. BP record of HH 13 - 100 GC. Lithological investigation of ice rafted debris grains, suggests that each Heinrich event has its own IRD signature, meaning differing source regions for each event. The defining sequence of features for every Heinrich event investigated was a warm sub-surface prior to the event, indicated by a prevalence of temperate foraminifera, followed by a collapse in foraminiferal fluxes and a reduction in the efficiency of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, as indicated by fining of sortable silt.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three different studies of geophysical imaging: (1) inference of plume moments from tomograms with cross-hole radar; (2) simulated annealing inversion for near-surface shear-wave velocity structure with microtremor measurements; and (3) time-lapse GPR imaging of water {{movement in the}} vadose zone. Although these studies involve different geophysical approaches, they are linked by a common theme—using geophysical imaging to understand hydrologic phenomena or subsurface structure. ^ My first study in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} identification of plume moments from geophysical tomograms. Previously geophysical imaging has been applied to characterize contaminant plume migration in groundwater, and to determine plume mass, extent, velocity, and shape. Although tomograms have been used for quantitative inference of plume moments, the reliability of these inferred moments is poorly understood. In general, tomograms represent blurry and blunted images of subsurface properties, as a consequence of limited data acquisition geometry, measurement error, and the effects of regularization. In this thesis, I investigated the effect of tomographic resolution on the inference of plume moments from tomograms. I presented a new approach to quantify the resolution of inferred moments, drawing on concepts from conventional geophysical image appraisal, and also image reconstruction from orthogonal moments. This new approach is demonstrated by synthetic examples in radar tomography. My results indicated that moments calculated from tomograms are subject to substantial error and bias. For example, for many practical survey geometries, crosshole radar tomography (1) is incapable of resolving the lateral center of mass, and (2) severely underpredicts total mass. The degree of bias and error varies spatially over the tomogram, in a complicated manner, as a result of spatially variable resolution. These findings have important implications for the quantitative use of tomograms to interpret plume morphology. ^ In my second study I developed a passive-seismic method to image shear-wave velocity, which is an important <b>geotechnical</b> <b>property</b> commonly correlated with soil type or lithology. I inverted shear-wave velocity profiles from the phase velocity dispersion of Rayleigh waves based on passive seismic observations (microtremors). I used several sets of microtremor data which were collected at different sites. I obtained the phase velocity dispersion curve by the Extended Spatial Autocorrelation (ESPAC) method. I used simulated annealing method is used to invert the subsurface shear-wave velocity profile from the fundamental phase velocity dispersion curve. The field-experimental and synthetic results indicated that the microtremor approach can provide valuable information for quantitative geotechnical and hydrologic characterization. ^ In my third study I developed a method to image vadose-zone dynamics using GPR. Flow in the unsaturated zone is important for predicting groundwater recharge, contaminant migration, and chemical/microbiological processes. However, it is difficult to characterize or monitor with conventional hydrologic measurements, which provide information at sparse locations. The {{purpose of this study was}} to image changes in moisture content, as well as aquifer structure based on the relation between dielectric constant and water content. The objective was to calibrate a flow model to field-experimental, time-lapse GPR data collected during an infiltration experiment. To this end, (1) I constructed a VS 2 DT model based on aquifer structure interpreted from static GPR reflection profiles; (2) I manually calibrated the model to reproduce observed changes in GPR data during infiltration; and (3) I used a time-domain electromagnetic finite-difference model to simulate experimental observations for comparison. The results of this work indicate that time-lapse GPR can monitor changes in water content on the order of a few percent. ^ Keywords. geophysical imaging, hydrogeologic characterization, geometric moments, orthogonal moments, central mass, regularization, measurement errors, unsaturated zone, moisture content, water infiltration, VS 2 DT, GPR, EM forward model, simulated-annealing, shear wave velocity, microtremor, Rayleigh wave, Extended Spatial Autocorrelation (ESPAC) method. ...|$|E

The fine dredged sediments (DS) are usually associated with high water content, low shear strength, high compressibility and presence of contaminants. However, these unfavorable properties do not exclude the suitability of fined dredged sediments for use in geotechnical applications. Stabilization-solidification technology provides a comprehensive treatment method for improving strength, reducing the compressibility and mobilizing the contaminants to be less mobile. These properties make the stabilized fine dredged material (SDM) suitable for use in civil engineering applications (e. g. road embankment or structural backfill in land reclamation). However, stabilization-solidification is not a magic wand by which every <b>geotechnical</b> <b>property</b> is improved for better. In cold region climates, repetitive freeze–thaw cycles have detrimental effects to the strength and hydraulic properties of the SDM. Consequently, the applications and long term performance of the SDM under repetitive freeze-thaw cycles are still uncertain. Successful stabilization–solidification of the DS {{and the performance of}} the SDM depend on stabilization methods and materials. Process stabilization-solidification (PSS) is convenient technology for amending high water content DS with binders. The use of composite binders for stabilization–solidification of the DS is increasing due to increased artificial pozzolanas that can be used as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). Primary binders such as cement can be supplemented with SCM (e. g. fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag). Cement hydration is a complex process with a complex series of unknown chemical reactions. The hydration of cement incorporating SCM is more complicated due to the co–existence of cement hydration and the pozzolanic reactions of the SCM. The fabric of dredged sediments formed under different physicochemical environments affects the reactivity of binders. The physic ochemical interactions between binders and the DS that influences the strength, compressibility and durability of high water content stabilized dredged sediment are examined and presented in this thesis. The findings of this study show that the use of fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) delays strength development of composite binder (CB) -treated DS. Irrespective of the amounts of CB, the improved strength depends on the amount of cement in the blend. The unconfined compressive strength increases with increasing the cement quantity Three phases of hydration mechanisms determine the compressibility behaviour of the SDM during curing. These are induction phase (IP), nucleation and crystallization phase (NCP), andhardening phase (HP). The IP occurs immediately after mixing. A protective layer is formed on the particle surface of binders, which prevent further penetration of water and then increases resistance to deformations. The evaluated tangent modulus increases to maximum value followed by abrupt drop to lower values at effective vertical stress, which is equals topreconsolidation stress. NCP follows when the protective layer changes to a more permeable membrane, which permits inward flow of water molecules, and outward migration of calcium ion and silicate ions. The tangent modulus of the SDM in NCP is small and increases linearly with effective vertical stress. The SDM in NCP is characterized by loss in apparent preconsolidation stress and tangent modulus. HP occurs as a result of increased thickness and stiffness of the protective layer. The compressibility of the SDM in HP is reduced significantly due to increased apparent preconsolidation pressure and tangent modulus. It is concluded that the maximum tangent modulus of untreated DS determines the maximum deformation of the SDM in all phases of hydration processes. Healing of the damaged SDM due to repetitive freeze-thaw action depend on the type of binder. The inclusion of SCM on one hand increases the healing of the SDM with reduced strength. This occurs during thaw consolidation. On the other hand, inclusion of SCM causes increased HC of the SDM. Considering healing potential on the damaged SDM with reduced strength, increased hydraulic conductivity causes increased rate of dissipation of excess pore pressure, reducedundrained conditions, and improved strength (enhanced outcome). In order to maintain its strength and hydraulic conductivity, the SDM requires protection from severe damage of repetitive freeze–thaw cycles. It can be beneficial to place the SDM below frost depth or use protective cover of geosythetic clay liners (GCL) Godkänd; 2015; 20151001 (makusa); Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.

In the area, clay deposits, so-called Pusan clays, are unusually thick, varying from 20 m to 70 m in thickness. For this study, reclaimed land along the Nakdong river deltaic plain, which is called as “Hwajeon site” has been considered and an attempt has been made to characterize the Pusan clay in terms of both geotechnical and geological, furthermore dependency of <b>geotechnical</b> <b>properties</b> on geological depositional environment was also studied. In this study, a comprehensive geotechnical investigation was carried out with sophisticated sampling techniques, in situ and laboratory tests as well as geological analyses at an additional three locations. As a result of the investigations, it was found that depositional environments are closely related to the relative changes in sea level and have different features depending on location and depth. The clays consist of soft and stiff clays in the upper and the lower layers, respectively, which are classified as normally consolidated and cemented clay. Moreover, most of the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>properties</b> undergo changes due to their depositional environment.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{technical}} note {{provides an overview}} of selected uncertainties involved in estimating or characterizing pre-dredged sediment and dredged material <b>geotechnical</b> <b>properties.</b> Variations in <b>geotechnical</b> <b>properties</b> of dredged materials and sediments are expected to be similar to those found in typical geotechnical materials, but this {{technical note}} addresses some of the unique aspects of identifying and evaluating the variability of selected material properties before, during, and after dredging operations. BACKGROUND: Characterizing dredged material sediment properties is a basic requirement for any proposed dredging operation, and the basic geotechnical parameters need to be measured or predicted in many cases. The most basic parameter is the material’s physical property classification based on the grain size distribution of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Other physical properties include water content, density, specific gravity, and percent solids. Engineering behavior properties such as shear strength and consolidation are also measured or predicted. Technical Note DOER-N 13 (www. wes. army. mil/el/dots/doer/) includes a list of the most common <b>geotechnical</b> <b>properties</b> used in characterizing dredged materials. The dredging process often involves radical manipulation of in situ sediments. Undisturbed (o...|$|R
