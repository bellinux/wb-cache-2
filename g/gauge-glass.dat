40|$|The {{stability}} of the three-dimensional vortex-glass order in random type-II superconductors with point disorder is investigated by equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations based on a lattice XY model with a uniform field threading the system. It is found that the vortex-glass order, which stably exists {{in the absence of}} screening, is destroyed by the screenng effect, corroborating the previous finding based on the spatially isotropic <b>gauge-glass</b> model. Estimated critical exponents, however, deviate considerably from the values reported for the <b>gauge-glass</b> model. Comment: Minor modifications made, a few referenced added; to appear in J. Phys.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{classical}} n-vector (n # 3) spin glass with anisotropic quenched random Dzyaloshinskii [...] Moriya (DM) interaction. A random DM interaction with m independent and separated couplings defines a generalized <b>gauge-glass</b> {{model with a}} O(n - 2 m) # m O(2) rotational symmetry and a broken global reflection invariance. It is shown that this model {{is in the same}} universality class as the random-gauge XY (`gauge glass') model. With an additional uniaxial anisotropy, a crossover from Ising-like to <b>gauge-glass</b> critical behaviour is found for a sufficiently large variance of the DM interaction.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{behavior of}} the <b>gauge-glass</b> and the XY spin-glass models in three dimensions is studied by analyzing their nonequilibrium aging dynamics. A new numerical method, which relies on the calculation of the two-time correlation and integrated response functions, is used to determine both the critical temperature and the nonequilibrium scaling exponents, both for spin and chiral degrees of freedom. First, the ferromagnetic XY model is studied to validate this nonequilibirum aging method (NAM), since for this nondisordered system we can compare with known results obtained with standard equilibrium and nonequilibrium techniques. When applied {{to the case of}} the <b>gauge-glass</b> model, we show that the NAM allows us to obtain precise and reliable values of its critical quantities, improving previous estimates. The XY spin-glass model with both Gaussian and bimodal bond distributions, is analyzed in more detail. The spin and the chiral two-time correlation and integrated response functions are calculated in our simulations. The results obtained mainly for Gaussian and, to a lesser extent, for bimodal interactions, support the existence of a spin-chiral decoupling scenario, where the chiral order occurs at a finite temperature while the spin degrees of freedom order at very low or zero temperature.

We find three phases: a quantized Hall state with pseudospin superfluidity, a quantized Hall state with pseudospin ???<b>gauge-glass???</b> order, and a decoupled composite Fermi liquid. Comparison with experiments provides a consistent explanation of the observed quantum Hall plateau, Hall drag plateau, and vanishing Hall drag resistance, {{as well as the}} zero-bias conductance peak effect, and suggests some interesting points to pursue experimentally...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the magnetic and glassy transitions of the square-lattice XY {{model in the}} presence of random phase shifts. We consider two different random-shift distributions: the Gaussian distribution and a slightly different distribution (cosine distribution) which allows the exact determination of the Nishimori line where magnetic and overlap correlation functions are equal. We perform Monte Carlo simulations for several values of the temperature and of the variance of the disorder distribution, in the paramagnetic phase close to the magnetic and glassy transition lines. We find that, along the transition line separating the paramagnetic and the quasi-long-range order phases, magnetic correlation functions show a universal Kosterlitz-Thouless behavior as in the pure XY model, while overlap correlations show a disorder-dependent critical behavior. This behavior is observed up to a multicritical point which, in the cosine model, lies on the Nishimori line. Finally, for large values of the disorder variance, we observe a universal zero-temperature glassy critical transition, which is in the same universality class as that occurring in the <b>gauge-glass</b> model.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the temperature-disorder (T-S) phase diagram of a three-dimensional gauge glass model, {{which is a}} cubic-lattice nearest-neighbor XY model with quenched random phase shifts A_xy at the bonds, by numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We consider the uncorrelated phase-shift distribution P(A_xy) ∼[(cos A_xy) /S], which has the pure XY model and the uniform distribution of random shifts as extreme cases at S= 0 and S->infty respectively, and which gives rise to equal magnetic and overlap correlation functions when T=S. While the high-temperature phase is always paramagnetic, at low temperatures there is a ferromagnetic phase for weak disorder (small S) and a glassy phase at large disorder (large S). These three phases are separated by transition lines with different magnetic and glassy critical behaviors. The disorder induced by the random shifts {{turns out to be}} irrelevant at the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition line, where the critical behavior belongs to the 3 D XY universality class of pure systems; disorder gives only rise to very slowly decaying scaling corrections. The glassy critical behavior along the finite-temperature paramagnetic-glassy transition line belongs to the <b>gauge-glass</b> universality class, with a quite large critical exponent nu= 3. 2 (4). These transition lines meet at a multicritical point M, located at T=S= 0. 7840 (2). The low-temperature ferromagnetic and glassy phases are separated by a third transition line, from M down to the T= 0 axis, which is slightly reentrant. ...|$|E
40|$|Li [1] has {{computed}} the current-voltage characteristics (CVC) of a disordered two-dimensional (2 D) Josephson-junction array {{and claimed}} that his data, presented in Fig. 1 of Ref. [1], gives evidence for a finite-temperature phase transition in the 2 D <b>gauge-glass</b> model in contradiction to the result of equilibrium simulations [2]. His conclusion {{is based on the}} observation that the CVC is nonlinear for temperatures T < 0. 2. I have computed a CVC of a resistively shunted single Josephson junction in the same current and temperature range as Li [1] did for the array, using the equation V/RIc = T/π[2 /π ∫ π/ 2 0 dφcosh(2 φI/IcT) I 0 (2 cosφ/T) ] − 1 sinh(πI/IcT), (1) which is an analitical solution for the Langevin equation for resistively shunted Josephson junction [3]. Here V is the voltage I is the current, R is the shunt resistance, Ic is the critical current of the junction, and I 0 is zero order modified Bessel function. Results are presented in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1 (a) part of the data of Fig. 1 (b) is plotted, corresponding to the region of resistivities and currents studied by Li [1]. One can easily notice a remarkable resemblance between Fig. 1 (a) and Fig. 1 of Ref. [1]: the CVC for T < 0. 2 is als...|$|E
