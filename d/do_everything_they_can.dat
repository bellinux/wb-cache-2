In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988 she {{had a role in}} Julia Sweeney's play Mea's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character.

Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E

At the same time, he also underscored two problems associated with fulfilling this obligation: shared responsibility and progressive realisation (i. e., the obligation is not immediate but takes time to fulfil) [1].
