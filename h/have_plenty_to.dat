2500|$|Chief Flying Hawk and {{his family}} did not enjoy the {{benefits}} of white men. His son Felix Flying Hawk, and later his grandson David Flying Hawk, had been cheated and jailed by the white man for stealing their own horses. Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, his family and friends, had been assassinated. He had been placed on public exhibition as a specimen of the vanishing race to escape the poverty and constraints an Indian reservation. [...] "He stroked his breast {{to show that he}} was poorly dressed. He was still wearing a coat and vest which had been given to him by the host on a previous visit. He said that if he had what was due him from the Government he could dress like other people, and <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> eat all the time, much of the time he was hungry and could not buy medicine or go to the doctor when sick." [...] On March 5, 1929, at age seventy-five, Flying Hawk made his last visit to The Wigwam in Du Bois, Pennsylvania. He had been traveling with the circus, and the pony riding, war dances and inclement weather were weighing on his health. The Wigwam was good medicine. [...] At The Wigwam he would could have fresh air, good food, rest and home comforts. Chief Flying Hawk died at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, December 24, 1931, at the age of 77 in want. He had written that during the previous winter of 1930-31 his little band was saved from starvation only through contributions from Gutzon Borglum and the American Red Cross. Sadly, it was rumored that Chief Flying Hawk died of starvation.|$|E
2500|$|On May 8, 1942, Wallace {{delivered}} {{what became}} {{his most famous}} speech, to the Free World Association in New York City. The speech, delivered during the darkest days of the war, was formally titled [...] "The Price of Free World Victory" [...] but came to be identified by its phrase [...] "the century of the common man". This was Wallace's answer to Republican publisher Henry Luce's call for an [...] "American Century" [...] after the war. For Wallace the war was a conflict between the slave states and the free world."The concept of freedom," [...] Wallace explained, was rooted in the Bible, with its [...] "extraordinary emphasis on {{the dignity of the}} individual," [...] but only recently had it become a reality for large numbers of people. [...] "Democracy is the only true political expression of Christianity," [...] he declared, adding that with freedom must come abundance. [...] "Men and women can never be really free until they <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>to</b> eat, and time and ability to read and think and talk things over." [...] For Wallace the outcome of the war had {{to be more than a}} restoration of the status quo. He wished to see the ideals of New Deal liberalism continuing at home and spreading throughout a world in which colonialism had been abolished and where labor would be represented by unions. [...] "Most of all," [...] write Culver and Hyde, [...] "He wanted to end the deadly cycle of economic warfare followed by military combat followed by isolationism and more economic warfare and more conflict.” For millions Wallace's speech defined America's mission in the war and the vision of a peaceful and more equitable world to follow. Nevertheless, it roused the ire of more conservative Democrats, business leaders and conservatives, not to mention Winston Churchill, who was strongly committed to preserving Britain's colonial empire.|$|E
