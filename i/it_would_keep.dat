5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{pressure}} from commercial {{interests in the}} Maritimes and New England who wanted a rail connection closer to the border, the Chaleur Bay routing was chosen, amid {{the backdrop of the}} American Civil War, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> the Intercolonial far from the boundary with Maine.|$|E

In August that year it had another change of tenders, 3280, its old tender, going to 34065 Hurricane, while 34051 gained tender number 3316 (which 34067 Tangmere had had from new). <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> this tender for the rest of its British Railways service.|$|E

25|$|Another {{creative}} idea {{to create}} more revenue, was the establishment of Graakalbanens Isforretning A/S. By building a branch line from Ugla to the lake Kyvannet, the company could freight ice down to its offices in Sandgata 2. There, it packed the ice into sawdust, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> as long as August. It was sold in blocks and crushed to restaurants, ships, fish exporters and private households. This remained in service until the 1940s, after which the branch line was removed.|$|E

In April, Telecom announced that despite the issue, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> Yahoo! on as an email provider.

His father supported his choice as he felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> Donaire off the streets. During their younger years, Donaire and his older brother, Glenn, would spar. Donaire also watched videos of his hero, Alexis Argüello, and from them he learned to throw a powerful left hook.|$|E

25|$|To back up {{the impact}} of the price shocks, the {{government}} declared that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> its own expenditure within the limit of current revenue and stop the other two large streams of Central Bank credit creation: Central Bank financing for agricultural credit and for the system of subsidies supporting differential exchange rates. The multiple exchange rates in effect under García were to be unified, and the unified rate was to be determined by market forces. Further, competition from imports to restrain inflation and access to imported supplies for production would both be improved by taking away quantitative restrictions and reducing tariff rates.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{university}} was organized into schools of agriculture, engineering (mechanical, civil, and electrical), and pharmacy, and former U.S. President Benjamin Harrison was serving on the board of trustees. Purdue’s engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive and a Corliss steam engine, one of the most efficient engines of the time. The School of Agriculture was sharing its research with farmers throughout the state with its cooperative extension services and would undergo a period of growth over the following two decades. Programs in education and home economics were soon established, as well as a short-lived school of medicine. By 1925 Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country, a status <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> for half a century.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its Chapter 11 filing, Blockbuster said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> its 3,300 stores open; In December 2010, Blockbuster {{announced}} it would close an additional 182 stores by the end of April 2011 in attempts to emerge from bankruptcy. It was reported in February 2011 that Blockbuster and its creditors had not come up with a Chapter 11 exit plan and that the company would be sold for $300 million or more, along with taking over debts and leases. Blockbuster has admitted that it {{may not be able to}} meet financial obligations required under its Chapter 11 filing, a circumstance which could mandate conversion of the bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 (liquidation). On March 1, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a claim disclosing that Blockbuster did not have the funds to continue reorganizing and should liquidate.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, CBS asked Ball to take My Favorite Husband to {{television}} with co-star Richard Denning. She, however, saw {{a television show}} as {{a great opportunity to}} work with Desi as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> them both in Hollywood, and perhaps save their shaky marriage. Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much to the dismay of CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they took on the road with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.|$|E

The ground wasn't developed any further, apart from compulsory seating being added, till 1993 when work began on the new Carling Stand. The stand was impressive {{while the rest of}} the ground was untouched since at least the 1920s; this led manager Martin O'Neill to say he used to [...] "lead new signings out backwards" [...] so they only saw the Carling Stand.|$|E

500|$|Homeworlds single-player plot {{received}} mixed reviews; Lopez claimed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> players [...] "rapt with attention", Samuel summized it as a [...] "superb story", and Levine {{said that}} it was [...] "the first computer game to capture the grandeur and epic feel of the Star Wars movies". The Eurogamer review, however, considered it only [...] "(mostly) engaging", and Keefer said that [...] "although the story line is fluid and intriguing", for each mission [...] "the overall theme is the same: Kill the enemy", while Ryan criticized the length for such a [...] "meager single-player game". The multiplayer gameplay was praised, especially against human opponents: Levine stated that [...] "multiplayer in Homeworld is a joy", while the Eurogamer review called it the game's strongest part. The Eurogamer review, along with Samuel, also called the multiplayer mode more difficult and engaging than the single-player game.|$|E

[...] He also noted its Euro influences. When he finished working on the material, da Don felt it fit for Usher, hoping that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> female listeners interested in Usher's music, as his popularity had declined among women since his marriage to stylist Tameka Foster in July 2007. Da Don and Usher wrote the track with rapper Young Jeezy, Darnell Dalton, Ryon Lovett, Lamar Taylor and Keith Thomas, and it was recorded at Zac Recording, Atlanta and Hitland Studios, Alpharetta.|$|E

500|$|After the construction, Sir Richard Long and Michael Stanhope {{were placed}} {{in command of the}} castle and blockhouses; the initial {{garrison}} may have been substantial, costing around £1,000 a year, but this was mostly demobilised at the end of 1542. Nonetheless, the castle and blockhouses still proved expensive to maintain. As a result, in 1553, an agreement was reached with the corporation of Hull, under which the town would take over responsibility for their maintenance, in exchange for an annual grant of £50 from various local manors. The town provided a bond of £2,000 as a commitment that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> its commitments. The mayor of Hull also took over the role of the Governor of Hull, with [...] "keepers" [...] were appointed by the town to run each of the buildings; the pasture land behind the fortifications was rented out to bring in income.|$|E
500|$|The {{energetic}} legislators {{finally reached}} school reform with Chapter CCCXXXV of the Public Laws of 1894. [...] That act, passed on May 25, provided that [...] "the several {{school districts in}} each township shall be consolidated into one school district". The legislature's intent was to equalize funding between wealthier districts and poorer ones. Had the legislature done no more, according to former New Jersey General Assembly Speaker Alan Karcher, [...] "New Jersey might have had fewer than 500 municipalities today". However, the legislature further enacted in the bill, [...] "that each city, borough, and incorporated town, shall be a school district, separate and distinct from the township school district". Thus, if a community seceded from its township to form a borough, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> control of its school. The new township school districts {{would be responsible for}} the debts of their predecessors, meaning that some communities faced the prospect of paying off, in part, the debts of others, and seeing some of their tax dollars going to fund others' schools. Under the law, by becoming an incorporated borough, they could avoid these things.|$|E
