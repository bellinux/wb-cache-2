50|$|An <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> is {{a future}} interest, {{held by a}} third party {{transferee}} (i.e. someone other than the grantee), which either cuts off another's interest or begins some time after the natural termination of a preceding estate. An <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> vests upon any condition subsequent except the natural termination of the original grantee's rights. In other words, an <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> is any future interest held by a third party that isn't a remainder.|$|E
5000|$|A has a possessory {{interest}} in life estate subject to executory limitation (B's <b>executory</b> <b>interest).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{shifting}} <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> cuts short {{someone other}} than the grantor. For example, if O conveys property [...] "To A, but if B returns from Florida within the next year, to B"; here, B has a shifting <b>executory</b> <b>interest,</b> and A has a fee simple subject to this shifting <b>executory</b> <b>interest.</b> A shifting <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> may be premised on any event, irrespective of whether that event is {{under the control of}} one party or the other, or if it is an external event under the control of neither party. For example, a conveyance [...] "To A, but if the property is ever used as a commercial dairy, to B" [...] would leave A in control of the condition; so long as A does not use the property in the proscribed manner it will remain hers. Conversely, a conveyance [...] "To A, but if B receives a law degree, to B" [...] places B entirely in control of the dispensation of the property; if B is able to fulfill the condition, B will get the property irrespective of what A does. Finally, the interest may shift based on a wholly external event, for example, [...] "To A, but if the Cleveland Browns win the Superbowl, to B".|$|E
50|$|<b>Executory</b> <b>interests</b> usually {{arise when}} a grantor gives {{property}} to one person, provided {{that they use}} it a certain way. If the person fails to use it properly, the property transfers to a third party. There are {{two different types of}} executory interests: shifting and springing. Executory limitations transferring ownership from the grantor to a third party are called springing <b>executory</b> <b>interests,</b> and those that transfer from the grantee to a third party are called shifting <b>executory</b> <b>interests.</b>|$|R

50|$|Third party {{beneficiaries}} of <b>executory</b> <b>interests</b> cannot alienate them, since the interests are contingent upon a condition subsequent, so the interest is not guaranteed to vest.|$|R
50|$|If the {{conveyance}} to A is for {{a limited}} time, or {{for the life of}} A, then the condition triggering the <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> must occur within that time, or the property will return to the grantor.|$|E
50|$|A {{springing}} <b>executory</b> <b>interest</b> cuts short the grantor's own interest, {{in favor}} of the grantee. For example, O conveys to A for life, and one year after A’s death to B and his heirs. O will have a one-year interest, that will spring/be cut short one year after A's death, and will go to B, the grantee.|$|E
5000|$|B has an <b>executory</b> <b>{{interest}},</b> {{because his}} interest does not vest unless A's life estate terminates {{due to the}} 'unnatural' condition subsequent. The interest is shifting, because if A drinks, then the property [...] "shifts" [...] from one grantee to another. If A never drinks, then A will retain ownership, and on A's death the property will go to O, or the heirs of O.|$|E
5000|$|Stated more formally, {{the common}} law rule against perpetuities forbids some future {{interests}} (traditionally contingent remainders and <b>executory</b> <b>interests)</b> that may not vest within the time permitted; the rule [...] "limits {{the ability of a}} decedent to exercise dead hand control over property, which the state wishes to be alienable. [...] In essence, the rule prevents a person from putting qualifications and criteria in his/her will that will continue to control or affect the distribution of assets long after he or she has died, a concept often referred to as control by the [...] "dead hand" [...] or [...] "mortmain".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Executory</b> <b>{{interest}}s</b> {{are subject}} to the rule against perpetuities, which disqualifies any interest that can vest more than twenty-one years after the death of every party who was living at the time the interest was created. However, if all of the potential vesting beneficiaries are named, the rule will never be violated. Thus, a property can not be conveyed [...] "to A and her heirs, but if alcohol is consumed on the property, to B and his heirs". Because A's heirs may hew to the condition for generations, causing a violation centuries after the condition was set down and creating chaos in efforts to shift title to the appropriate heirs of B.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalent}} criticism {{seems to}} be that the Rule Against Perpetuities, as presently applied, does not further the best interests of society and therefore should be changed to make it work better. To determine how well the Rule is operating, a critical examination will be made of Georgia statutory law and decisions involving its application to class gifts, private trusts, charitable gifts, commercial transactions, powers of appointment, and to various types of future interests including reverters, rights of entry, and <b>executory</b> <b>interests.</b> This Article will also explore techniques for avoiding the lethal effect of the Rule through draftsmanship, judicial construction, and statutory reform. The liability of the attorney who draws an instrument that offends the Rule lurks as an ominous shadow in the background, and the impact of this developing phenomenon will be examined. Suggestions will be made for revamping Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s perpetuities statute to make the Rule a more effective device in curbing dead-hand control and in eliminating many of the hidden difficulties it now poses for the draftsman...|$|R
50|$|Dissents {{were rare}} on the Marshall Court; Justice William Johnson dissented more {{frequently}} than most, but still quite rarely by modern standards. First, although Johnson agreed that the Georgia legislature could not revoke its land grant, he located such a prohibition in natural law, rather than the Contract Clause. More substantively, Johnson's opinion advocated the older view (from the state courts and colonial custom) that Indians held fee simple to their land, and that state land grants constituted a future <b>executory</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{fee simple}} determinable is an estate that will end {{automatically}} when the stated event or condition occurs. The interest will revert to the grantor or the heirs of the grantor. Normally, a possibility of reverter follows a {{fee simple determinable}}. However a possibility of reverter does not follow a fee simple determinable subject to an <b>executory</b> <b>interest.</b> Durational language such as [...] "to A {{as long as the}} property is used for a park" [...] creates a fee simple determinable and a possibility of reverter.|$|E
50|$|Waste is a {{term used}} in the law of real {{property}} to describe a cause of action that can be brought in court to address a change in condition of real property brought about by a current tenant that damages or destroys the value of that property. A lawsuit for waste can be brought against a life tenant or lessee of a leasehold estate, either by a current landlord or by {{the owner of a}} vested future interest. The holder of an <b>executory</b> <b>interest,</b> however, has no standing to enforce an action for waste, since his future interest is not vested. There are several different kinds of waste under the law.|$|E
5000|$|The rule is {{notoriously}} difficult to properly apply, {{as pointed out}} by a 1961 decision of the Supreme Court of California which held {{that it was not}} legal malpractice for an attorney to draft a will that inadvertently violated the rule against perpetuities. Therefore, in the United States it has been abolished by statute in Alaska, Idaho, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and South Dakota. [...] The Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities validates non-vested interests that would otherwise be void as violating the common law rule if that interest actually vests within 90 years of its creation; it has been enacted in 29 states (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and is currently under consideration in New York. Other jurisdictions apply the [...] "wait and see" [...] or [...] "cy-près doctrine" [...] that validates contingent remainders and <b>executory</b> <b>interests</b> that would be void under the traditional rule in certain circumstances. [...] These doctrines have also been codified in the United Kingdom by the 1964 statute.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "first known American case {{to address}} the issue" [...] of the {{validity}} of state land grands to land over which the aboriginal title had not been extinguished was Marshall v. Clark (Va. 1791), decided by the Virginia Supreme Court. The plaintiff was John Marshall's father, Thomas Marshall, challenging (on behalf of the state militia's claim to the same land) the validity of a land grant to Revolutionary War veteran George Rogers Clark. Marshall argued that the grant could not be valid because the aboriginal title was not extinguished; the Virginia Supreme Court disagreed:The Indian title did not impede [...] [...] [...] the power of the legislature to grant the land. grantee must risque the event of the Indian claim, and yield to it, if finally established, or have the benefit of a former or future extinction thereof.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and Tennessee Supreme Court soon issued opinions to the same effect, holding that states could grant land that the federal government had not yet purchased from Indians. Such transactions, already common, increased in the wake of these decisions; the assumption was that the Indians held fee simple to their land, but that future <b>executory</b> <b>interests</b> could be sold, representing a promise of the state to transfer the land should it ever come into their possession.|$|R
5000|$|A {{defeasible estate}} is created when a grantor {{transfers}} land conditionally. Upon the happening {{of the event}} or condition stated by the grantor, the transfer may be void or at least subject to annulment. (An estate not subject to such conditions is called an indefeasible estate.) Historically, the common law has frowned {{on the use of}} defeasible estates as it interferes with the owners' enjoyment of their property and as such has made it difficult to create a valid future interest. Unless a defeasible estate is clearly intended, modern courts will construe the language against this type of estate. Three types of defeasible estates are the fee simple determinable, fee simple subject to an <b>executory</b> limitation or <b>interest,</b> and the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.|$|R
