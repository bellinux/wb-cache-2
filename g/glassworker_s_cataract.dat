40|$|Induction of {{cataracts}} by {{occupational exposure}} in flight crew {{has been an}} important topic of interest in aerospace medicine in the past five years, in association with numerous reports of flight-associated disease incidences. Due to numerous confounding variables, it has been difficult to determine if there is increased cataract risk directly caused by interaction with the flight environment, specifically associated with added radiation exposure during flight. Military aviator records from the United States Air Force (USAF) and Navy (USN) and US astronauts at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) /Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) were evaluated for the presence, location and age of diagnosis of cataracts. Military aviators were found to have a statistically significant younger average age of onset of their cataracts compared with astronauts, however the incidence density of cataracts was found to be statistically higher in astronauts than in military aviators. USAF and USN aviator <b>s</b> <b>cataracts</b> were most commonly located in the posterior subcapsular region of the lens while astronauts cataracts were most likely to originate generally in the cortical zone. A prospective clinical trial which controls for confounding variables in examination technique, cataract classification, diet, exposure, and pharmacological intervention is needed to determine what percentage of the risk for cataracts are due to radiation, and how to best develop countermeasures to protect flight crews from radiation bioeffects in the future...|$|R

For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that {{have been shown to be}} beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated.

40|$|An in vivo {{exposure}} to 197 W/cm 2 1090 nm infrared radiation (IRR) requires a minimum 8 <b>s</b> for <b>cataract</b> induction. The present study aims {{to determine the}} ocular temperature evolution and the associated heat flow at the same exposure conditions. Two groups of 12 rats were unilaterally exposed within the dilated pupil with a close to collimated beam between lens and retina. Temperature was recorded with thermocouples. Within 5 min after exposure, the lens light scattering was measured. In one group, the temperature rise in the exposed eye, expressed as CI(0. 95), was 11 ± 3 ºC at the limbus, 16 ± 6 ºC in the vitreous behind lens and 16 ± 7 ºC on the sclera next to the optic nerve, respectively. In the other group, the temperature rise in the exposed eye was 9 ± 1 ºC at the limbus and 26 ± 11 ºC on the sclera next to the optic nerve, respectively. The difference of forward light scattering between exposed and contralateral not exposed eye was 0. 01 ± 0. 09 tEDC. An {{exposure to}} 197 W/cm 2 1090 nm IRR for 8 s induces a temperature increase of 10 °C at the limbus and 26 °C close to the retina. IRR cataract is probably of thermal origin...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to astronauts {{could be}} a {{significant}} obstacle for long duration manned space exploration because of current uncertainties regarding the extent of biological effects. Furthermore, concepts for protective shielding also pose a technically challenging issue {{due to the nature}} of cosmic radiation and current mass and power constraints with modern exploration technology. As biological damage from exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress, it would be enabling to mitigate and/or prevent stress prior to the development of clinical symptoms and disease. This paper hypothesizes a "systems biology" approach in which a combination of chemical and biological mitigation techniques are used conjunctively. It proposes using new, therapeutic, medical gases as both chemical radioprotectors for radical scavenging and biological promoters for management of the body s response to exposure. From reviewing radiochemistry of water, biological effects of CO, H 2, NO, and H 2 S gas, and mechanisms of radiation biology, it is concluded that this approach may have great therapeutic potential for exposure. Furthermore, it also appears to have potential for curtailing the pathogenesis of other diseases in which oxidative stress has been implicated including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammatory disease, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, Parkinson s and Alzheimer <b>s</b> disease, <b>cataracts,</b> and aging...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCataract is {{a common}} cause of {{childhood}} blindness worldwide. α-crystallin, which is comprised of two homologous subunits, αA- and αB-crystallin, {{plays a key role}} in the maintenance of lens transparency. Recently, we have identified a missense mutation in αB-crystallin that changes the proline residue at codon 20 to a serine residue (P 20 S) in a large Chinese family with autosomal dominant posterior polar congenital cataract. To explore the molecular mechanism by which the P 20 <b>S</b> mutation causes <b>cataract,</b> we examined the quaternary structure, subunit exchange and chaperone activity of the reconstituted heteroaggregates of α-crystallins containing wild type (WT) αA in combination with either WT-αB- or mutant αB-crystallin, respectively. Compared with heteroaggregates of WT-αA and WT-αB, heteroaggregates containing WT-αA and mutant αB showed nearly the same molecular mass, but the subunit-exchange rate and chaperone activity were decreased markedly. In human lens epithelial cells, unlike WT-αB-crystallin, the P 20 S mutant protein showed abnormal nuclear localization, and unusual ability to trigger apoptosis. These results suggest that the changes in the structure and function of the α-crystallin complex and cytotoxicity are vital factors in the pathogenesis of congenital cataract linked to the P 20 S mutation in the αB-crystallin...|$|R
40|$|The {{eye lens}} {{is packed with}} soluble crystallin proteins, {{providing}} a lifetime of transparency and light refraction. γ-Crystallins are major components of the dense, high refractive index central regions of the lens and generally have high solubility, high stability {{and high levels of}} cysteine residues. Human γC belongs to a group of γ-crystallins with a pair of cysteine residues at positions 78 and 79. Unlike other γ-crystallins it has relatively low solubility, whereas mouse γC, which has the exposed C 79 replaced with arginine, and a novel mouse splice variant, γCins, are both highly soluble. Furthermore, human γC is extremely stable, while the mouse orthologs are less stable. Evolutionary pressure may have favoured stability over solubility for human γC and the reverse for the orthologs in the mouse. Mutation of C 79 to R 79, in human γC, greatly increased solubility, however, neither form produced crystals. Remarkably, when the human γD R 36 <b>S</b> crystallization <b>cataract</b> mutation was mimicked in human γC-crystallin, the solubility of γC was dramatically increased, although it still did not crystallize. The highly soluble mouse γC-crystallin did crystallize. Its X-ray structure was solved and used in homology modelling of human γC, and its mutants C 79 R and R 36 S. The human γD R 36 S mutant was also modelled from human γD coordinates. Molecular dynamics simulation of the six molecules in the solution state showed that the human γCs differed from γDs in domain pairing, behaviour that correlates with interface sequence changes. When the fluctuations of the calculated molecular dipoles, for the six structures, over time were analysed, characteristic patterns for soluble γC and γD proteins were observed. Individual sequence changes that increase or decrease solubility correlated well with changes in the magnitude and direction of these dipoles. It is suggested that changes in surface residues have allowed adaptation for the differing needs of human and mouse lenses...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: 1) To {{estimate}} the threshold dose {{and the time}} evolution for cataract induction by near infrared radiation (IRR) in seconds exposure time domain; 2) to determine the ocular temperature development during the threshold exposure; 3) to investigate if near IRR induces cumulative lens damage considering irradiance exposure time reciprocity; 4) to experimentally {{estimate the}} temperature in the lens indirectly from the measurement of temperature-induced light scattering increase. Methods: Before exposure, 6 -weeks-old albino rats were anesthetized and the pupils of both eyes were dilated. Then the animals were unilaterally exposed to 1090 nm IRR within the pupil area. Temperature was recorded with thermocouples placed in the selected positions of the eye. At the planned post-exposure time, the animal was sacrificed and the lenses were extracted for measurements of forward light scattering and macroscopic imaging (Paper I-III). In Paper IV, the lens was extracted from six-weeks-old albino Sprague-Dawley female rats and put into a temperature-controlled cuvette filled with balanced salt solution. Altogether, 80 lenses were equally divided on four temperature groups, 37, 40, 43 and 46 ºC. Each lens was exposed for 5 minutes to temperature depending on group belonging while the intensity of forward light scattering was recorded. Results: The in vivo exposure to 197 W/cm 2 1090 nm IRR required a minimum 8 <b>s</b> for <b>cataract</b> induction. There was approximately 16 h delay between exposure and light scattering development in the lens. The same radiant exposure was found to cause a temperature increase of 10 °C at the limbus and 26 °C close to the retina. The in vivo exposure to 96 W/cm 2 1090 nm IRR with exposure time up to 1 h resulted in an average temperature elevation of 7 °C at the limbus with the cornea humidified and no significant light scattering was induced one week after exposure. Arrhenius equation implies that the natural logarithm of the inclination coefficient for light scattering increase is linearly dependent on the inverse of the temperature. The proportionality constant and the intercept, estimated as CI(0. 95) s, were 9. 6 ± 2. 4  x 103  K and 22. 8 ± 7. 7. Further, it implies that if averaging 20 measurements of inclination coefficients in a new experiment at constant heat load, the confidence limits for prediction of temperature correspond to ± 1. 9  °C. Conclusions: It is indicated that IRR at 1090 nm produces thermal but not cumulatively photochemical cataract, probably by indirect heat conduction from absorption in tissues surrounding the lens. Applying the Arrhenius equation the in vivo temperature in the lens can be determined retrospectively with sufficient resolution...|$|R

It is a rare source of endophthalmitis, often {{in the setting of}} trauma, but has been reported following cataract extraction. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate antimicrobial sensitivities, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes in patients with endophthalmitis caused by <b>S.</b> maltophilia following <b>cataract</b> extraction. Methods: A retrospective case review of records from January 1, 1990 to June 30, 2010 was performed at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. Results: Eight cases of S. maltophilia endophthalmitis were identified following cataract surgery. Initial visual acuity ranged from 20 / 200 to light perception. Time to diagnosis with cultures was 2 – 118 days. Patients received either intravitreal tap and inject (n = 5) or pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotic injections (n = 3). All patients had vitreous or anterior chamber cultures positive for S. maltophilia. Seven of seven isolates tested were found to be sensitive to ceftazidime. Seven of eight isolates were sensitive to polymyxin B, six of eight isolates were sensitive to amikacin, and five of the seven isolates tested were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Two of four tested isolates were sensitive to trimethoprim-sulbactam. All eight isolates were resistant to gentamicin and seven of the seven tested isolates were resistant to imipenem. All patients received intravitreal ceftazidime as part of the initial treatment regimen. Final visual acuity ranged from 20 / 25 to 4 / 200. Conclusion: S. maltophilia endophthalmitis is a rare source of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. A case series of eight independent patients is reported, along with antibiotic resistance profiles and clinical outcomes. Isolates showed sensitivity to ceftazidime, amikacin, and polymyxin, with variable sensitivity to other antibiotics, therefore differing from previous reports.

40|$|Occupational {{radiation}} exposure {{from the space}} environment may result in non-cancer or non-CNS degenerative tissue diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cataracts, and respiratory or digestive diseases. However, the magnitude of influence and mechanisms of action of radiation leading to these diseases are not well characterized. Radiation and synergistic effects of radiation cause DNA damage, persistent oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and accelerated tissue aging and degeneration, which may lead to acute or chronic disease of susceptible organ tissues. In particular, cardiovascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis are of major concern following gamma-ray exposure. This provides evidence for possible degenerative tissue effects following exposures to ionizing radiation {{in the form of}} the GCR or SPEs expected during long-duration spaceflight. However, the existence of low dose thresholds and dose-rate and radiation quality effects, as well as mechanisms and major risk pathways, are not well-characterized. Degenerative disease risks are difficult to assess because multiple factors, including radiation, are believed to play a role in the etiology of the diseases. As additional evidence is pointing to lower, space-relevant thresholds for these degenerative effects, particularly for cardiovascular disease, additional research with cell and animal studies is required to quantify the magnitude of this risk, understand mechanisms, and determine if additional protection strategies are required. The NASA PEL (Permissive Exposure Limit) <b>s</b> for <b>cataract</b> and cardiovascular risks are based on existing human epidemiology data. Although animal and clinical astronaut data show a significant increase in cataracts following exposure and a reassessment of atomic bomb (A-bomb) data suggests an increase in cardiovascular disease from {{radiation exposure}}, additional research is required to fully understand and quantify these adverse outcomes at lower doses (less than 0. 5 gray (SI unit for ionizing radiation dosage, i. e. one joule of radiation energy per one kilogram of matter)) to facilitate risk prediction. This risk has considerable uncertainty associated with it, and no acceptable model for projecting degenerative tissue risk is currently available. In particular, risk factors such as obesity, alcohol, and tobacco use can act as confounding factors that contribute to the large uncertainties. The PELs could be violated under certain scenarios, including following a large SPE (solar proton event) or long-term GCR (galactic cosmic ray) exposure. Specifically, for a Mars mission, the accumulated dose is sufficiently high that epidemiology data and preliminary risk estimates suggest a significant risk for cardiovascular disease. Ongoing research in this area is intended to provide the evidence base for accurate risk quantification to determine criticality for extended duration missions. Data specific to the space radiation environment must be compiled to quantify the magnitude of this risk to decrease the uncertainty in current PELs and to determine if additional protection strategies are required. New research results could lead to estimates of cumulative radiation risk from CNS and degenerative tissue diseases that, when combined with the cancer risk, may have major negative impacts on mission design, costs, schedule, and crew selection. The current report amends an earlier report (Human Research Program Requirements Document, HRP- 47052, Rev. C, dated Jan 2009) in order to provide an update of evidence since 2009...|$|R
