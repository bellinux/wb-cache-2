40|$|A partir da mistura de óleos e gorduras e de {{posterior}} interesterificação podem ser obtidos lipídios estruturados, que são compostos que apresentam características físicas, químicas e nutricionais diferentes daquelas dos lipídios que lhes deram origem. As principais propriedades físicas destes lipídios, como consistência e plasticidade, podem ser influenciadas por sua estrutura cristalina. O objetivo deste trabalho foi observar modificações na estrutura cristalina de lipídios estruturados obtidos a partir de gordura do leite e óleo de milho. As curvas de cinética de cristalização foram construídas a partir do conteúdo de gordura sólida das amostras em função do tempo. A utilização do cálculo dos parâmetros de Avrami permitiu determinar a velocidade de cristalização e os tipos de nucleação e dos cristais formados. A microscopia sob luz polarizada forneceu imagens dos cristais formados pelos métodos de resfriamento lento e rápido, a partir das quais foram determinados os seguintes itens: número de cristais, área cristalizada e dimensões fractais das amostras. A correlação obtida entre os resultados indicou que a adição de óleo de milho não provocou mudanças substanciais na estrutura da rede cristalina da gordura do leite, apenas diminuiu a quantidade de gordura cristalizada. As reações de interesterificação e a adição de óleo de milho não alteraram o tamanho e a forma dos cristais.

Polarized light microscopy provided images of crystals obtained by high and low cooling rate methods, from which the number of crystals, crystallized area and fractal dimension of the samples were determined. The correlation between the results indicated that the addition of corn oil did not cause substantial changes in the crystal network structure, but only decreased the content of crystallized fat.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Tecnologia dos Produtos Vegetais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThere {{has been}} a great {{interest}} in the production of structured lipids over the last decade due to their significant potential application in cocoa butter equivalents, conventional oils enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids, lowcaloric structured lipids, infant formulas, and other products. Structured lipids (SLs) consist of TAG that have been (i) modified by the incorporation of new fatty acids (FA), (ii) restructured to change the positions of FA or FA profile, from the natural state, or synthesized to yield novel TAG, either chemically or enzymatically. These modified fats with novel properties present important medical, nutraceutical and food applications. Currently, chemical processes are used in the Food Industry for fat and oil modification and for SLs production. These reactions are carried out at high temperature and under extreme pressure conditions and catalyzed by non-selective inorganic catalysts. The heat sensitivity of some fatty acids and the requirement for lipids with specific structures and compositions has {{led to the development of}} lipase-catalyzed methods of production. The replacement of the inorganic catalysts by enzymes (lipases) is highly desirable in this area. Lipases are versatile catalysts. Traditionally, lipases are considered as hydrolases that catalyse the hydrolysis of water insoluble esters (e. g. TAG) in water/oil interfaces, exhibiting, most of them, an interfacial catalytic kinetics. In addition, lipases are also able to catalyse different reactions, namely esterification and interesterification reactions when in nonaqueous media at low water activity (aw). Moreover, lipases accept a wide variety of substrates while maintaining their regioselectivity and stereoselectivity, conversely to the inorganic catalysts. Enzymatic interesterification with sn- 1, 3 specific lipases has also been used by the industry for the production of cocoa butter-like fats and human milk fat substitutes. The demand for specific-structured triacylglycerols, produced by exploiting the sn- 1, 3 regiospecificity of the lipases, are currently increasing. In this study, the Aspergillus niger lipase was immobilized in different supports (AlPO 4 - Sepiolite, Eupergit® C and Eupergit® C 250 L) and used as catalyst for the <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> rich in Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega- 3 PUFA), at 60 ºC, in solvent-free media. Different enzyme loads and water activity (aw) values of the biocatalyst were tested on the interesterification kinetics. Reaction media consisted of blends of palm stearin, palmkernel oil and a concentrate of triacylglycerols rich in omega- 3 PUFA (“EPAX 4510 TG”). The interesterification reaction was evaluated by the reduction of the solid fat content at 35 ºC (SFC 35 ºC). Also, free fatty acids (FFA), coming from hydrolysis of triacylglycerols and/or from the first interesterification step, and first and final oxidation products were quantified. Thermal oxidation showed to be negligible under the reactions conditions followed. FFA content increased with lipase load. No significant increase in interesterification activity was observed for loadings higher than 10 % in AlPO 4 -Sepiolite. The enzyme load in Eupergit® C and Eupergit® C 250 L was 20 % (w/w) in all the experiments. For all the biocatalysts tested, the catalytic activity increased with the aw. A 100 %, 43 % and 26 % of SFC 35 ºC reduction was observed after 6 hours of reaction, respectively when the lipase was immobilized in AlPO 4 -Sepiolite, Eupergit® C and Eupergit® C 250 L, at aw of 1. However, a low operational stability of the lipase in AlPO 4 -Sepiolite was observed. When this biocatalyst was reused in 8 consecutive batches of 23 hours duration each, a half-life time of only about 2, 2 days, when used in consecutive batches. RESUMO - A lipase de Aspergillus niger foi imobilizada em diferentes suportes (AlPO 4 -Sepiolite, Eupergit® C e Eupergit® C 250 L). Testaram-se diferentes concentrações de lipase e valores de actividade da água (aw) do biocatalisador, na cinética da interesterificação de gorduras ricas em ácidos gordos polinsaturados ómega- 3 (ómega- 3 PUFA), a 60 ºC. O meio reaccional foi constituído por estearina de palma, óleo de palmiste e um concentrado de triacilgliceróis ricos em ómega- 3 PUFA. A reacção de interesterificação foi avaliada pela redução do teor de gordura sólida a 35 ºC (SFC 35 ºC). Quantificaram-se ainda os ácidos gordos livres (AGL) provenientes da hidrólise e/ou do primeiro passo da interesterificação, e os produtos de oxidação. A termoxidação dos lípidos foi desprezável e os AGL aumentaram com a carga de biocatalisador. Cargas lipásicas em AlPO 4 -Sepiolite superiores a 10 % não conduziram a aumento na actividade catalítica. Para todos os biocatalisadores testados, a actividade catalítica aumentou com a aw.

40|$|The {{potential}} of the lipase from Rhizopus oryzae immobilised on SiO(2) -PVA to catalyse the <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> the milkfat with soybean oil in a packed bed reactor running on continuous mode was evaluated. The reactor operated continuously for 35 days at 45 degrees C, and during 12 days, no significant decrease in the initial lipase activity was verified. Interesterification yields were {{in the range from}} 35 to 38 % wt, which gave an interesterified product having 59 % lower consistency in relation to non-interesterified blend. Results showed the {{potential of}} the lipase from Rhizopus oryzae to mediate the <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> milkfat with soybean oil in packed bed reactor, attaining a more spreadable product under a cool temperature. The biocatalyst operational stability was assessed and an inactivation profile was found to follow the Arrhenius model, revealing values of 34 days and 0. 034 day(- 1), for half-life and a deactivation coefficient, respectively.

40|$|Background: Polyphenols {{are thought}} to play {{important}} roles in human nutrition and health but these health effects are dependent on their bioavailability. This study {{is one of a}} series with the aim of determining possible effects of food matrices on caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) bioavailability using ileostomy volunteers. Methods: After a CQA-free diet, ileostomists consumed coffee (746 μmol total CQA), and CQAs in excreted ileal fluid were subsequently identified and quantified with HPLC-diode array detection and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. In our previous studies, other food sources such as cloudy apple juice (CAJ) (358 μmol CQA) and apple smoothie (AS) (335 μmol CQA) were investigated with the same model. Results: <b>Interesterification</b> <b>of</b> CQA from both apple matrices was observed during gastrointestinal passage, whereas CQA consumed in coffee was not influenced by interesterification reactions. In total, 74. 3, 22. 4, and 23. 8 % of the CQA from CAJ, AS, and coffee, respectively, were absorbed or degraded. Conclusion: Our results show that variations in food matrices and variations in phenolic composition have a major influence on intestinal bioavailability and <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> the investigated subclass of polyphenols, the CQAs...|$|R

40|$|The {{esterification}} process causes some desirable {{changes in}} physicochemical properties <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> by exchanging the acyl groups in triglyceride molecules. The {{aim of this}} study was to produce a suitable edible fat for industrial and home uses. In this study a mixture of 60 percent soybean oil and 40 percent edible tallow were inter-esterified, using 0. 5 percent sodium methylate or ethylate as catalyst. The results obtained for solid fat contents and melting points indicated that the process of inter-esterification was accomplished in 30 minutes at 90 °C. It was also observed that sodium methylate and. ethylate had similar effects on physical and chemical characteristics of the esterified blend. Iodine and saponification values indicated that the esterification process did not have any considerable effect on the degree of unsaturation or molecular weight of fatty acids. The peroxide values showed that the processing condition did not produce any peroxide. The esterified blend contained 1. 10 percent trans fatty acids, which were originally present in the tallow. It is concluded that <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> soybean oil and edible beef tallow can be used as an alternative method to hydrogenation to produce a suitable plastic fat with low levels of trans fatty acids for the manufacture of different types <b>of</b> margarines and <b>fats</b> for home uses...|$|R

Crisco and similar low-trans-fat products are formed by the <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> a mixture of fully hydrogenated oils and partially hydrogenated oils. The composition of the resultant triglycerides is random, and may contain combinations of fatty acids not commonly found in nature.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the antimicrobial potential of emulsions formulated with interesterified Amazonian oils. The {{results indicated that}} the antimicrobial activity of these emulsions are directly related to the characteristics of the emulsion, and these characteristics are influenced by the <b>interesterification</b> process <b>of</b> these oils. When the antimicrobial emulsion was produced with interesterified Amazonian oils (2 mL/ 100 mL), the oil droplet presented smaller size, and resulted in the complete inhibition of pathogens growth, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, after 24 h (bactericidal effect). When the antimicrobial emulsion was produced with non-interesterified oils (only physical mixing), the oil droplets were larger and the emulsions did not completely inhibit the growth of the pathogens after 24 h (bacteriostatic effect). The results suggest that the <b>interesterification</b> <b>of</b> these oils may be responsible for changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the emulsions, producing droplets with smaller size and greater antimicrobial activity.
