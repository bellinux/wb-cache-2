Supporting evidence {{for the existence of}} these mutations {{comes from the fact that}} a large number affect the identity of floral organs. For example, some organs develop in a location where others should develop. This is called <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation,</b> which is analogous to HOX gene mutations found in Drosophila. In Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, the two taxa on which models are based, these mutations always affect adjacent verticils.

Lewis and Eric Wieschaus. Their research on genetic screening for embryo patterning mutants revealed {{the role played}} in early embryologic development by homeobox genes like bicoid. An example of a <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> is the so-called Antennapedia mutation. In Drosophila, antennae and legs are created by the same basic [...] "program", they only differ in a single transcription factor. If this transcription factor is damaged, the fly grows legs on its head instead of antennae. See images of this [...] "antennapedia" [...] mutant and others, at FlyBase. Another example is in the bithorax complex. If nonlethal mutations occur in this complex, it can cause the fly to have two sets of wings, instead of one pair of wings and one pair of halteres, which aid in balance in flight.|$|E
40|$|Ovules are the {{developmental}} precursors of seeds. In angiosperms the ovules are enclosed within the central floral organs, the carpels. We {{have identified a}} <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> in Arabidopsis, "bell" (bel 1), which causes transformation of ovule integuments into carpels. In situ hybridization analysis shows that this mutation leads to increased expression of the carpel-determining homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) in the mutant ovules. Introduction of a constitutively expressed AG transgene into wild-type plants causes the ovules to resemble those of bel 1 mutants. We propose that the BEL 1 gene product directs normal integument development, in part by suppressing AG expression in this structure. Our results allow expansion of the current model of floral organ identity to include regulation of ovule integument identity...|$|E
50|$|<b>Homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> work by {{changing}} segment identity during development. For example, the Ultrabithorax genotype gives a phenotype wherein metathoracic and first abdominal segments become mesothoracic segments.

40|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} {{of the order}} Strepsiptera are unclear. Affiliation to Coleoptera has been proposed, however this implies that dipteran halteres and strep-sipteran haltere-like organs evolved convergently. An alternative is a sister group relationship with Diptera. In this case, halteres could be homologous but a radical <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> may have switched their position to the Strepsipteran mesothorax. Ribosomal DNA sequence analysis {{has been used to}} support Dipteran affiliation, although this is controversial. Here we investigate the potential of an intron insertion site as a phylogenetic character. We find that the en homeobox gene of the strepsipteran Stichotrema dallatorreanum lacks a derived intron insertion shared by representatives of Diptera and Lepidoptera. We argue against a close affiliation between Strepsiptera and Diptera...|$|E

The species are shown to form a well-supported clade which warrants taxonomic recognition as a distinct genus. The name Fenerivia is adopted, considerably expanding the application of this formerly monotypic name, with nine new nomenclatural combinations validated.

40|$|Abstract As {{a result}} of the {{integration}} of molecular and morphological approaches for the reconstruction of phylogenies, and of the intertwining of developmental and evolutionary biology, further prospects are open for a fruitful interaction between these two fields in what we may call a phylo-evo-devo approach. Wiegmann et al. 's molecular phylogeny of the holometabolous insect orders, recently published in BMC Biology, offers a good opportunity to revisit the inverted positions of wings and halteres in the Diptera and the Strepsiptera in terms of a putative <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> in the Hox gene Ultrabithorax. The main finding of this paper is that Strepsiptera are closely related to the Coleoptera rather than Diptera, as recently claimed. Through this exemplary case, the paper demonstrates the value of the reciprocal illumination we can expect from the integration of a good phylogeny and a sound knowledge of the evolvability of developmental mechanisms. </p...|$|E
25|$|Observations of <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> {{led to the}} {{formulation}} of the ABC model of flower development by E. Coen and E. Meyerowitz. According to this model, floral organ identity genes are divided into three classes: class A genes (which affect sepals and petals), class B genes (which affect petals and stamens), and class C genes (which affect stamens and carpels). These genes code for transcription factors that combine to cause tissue specification in their respective regions during development. Although developed through study of A. thaliana flowers, this model is generally applicable to other flowering plants.|$|R
25|$|A. thaliana {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied {{as a model for}} flower development. The developing flower has four basic organs: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels (which go on to form pistils). These organs are arranged in a series of whorls: four sepals on the outer whorl, followed by four petals inside this, six stamens, and a central carpel region. <b>Homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> in A. thaliana result in the change of one organ to another — {{in the case of the}} agamous mutation, for example, stamens become petals and carpels are replaced with a new flower, resulting in a recursively repeated sepal-petal-petal pattern.|$|R

Most flowers consist of four organ types that {{are present in}} a specific order from the periphery to {{the centre of the}} flower. Reviewed here are studies on flower development in two model species: Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus that focus on the molecular genetic analysis of <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> affecting pattern formation in the flower. Based on these studies a model was proposed that explains how three classes of regulatory genes can together control the development of the correct pattern of organs in the flower. The universality of the basic tenets of the model is apparent from the analysis of the homologues of the Arabidopsis genes from other plant species...|$|R
40|$|Fenerivia species (Annonaceae) are {{characterized}} by a prominent flange immediately below the perianth, which has been interpreted as synapomorphic for the genus. The homology of this flange is controversial: previous studies of Fenerivia heteropetala (an aberrant species, with 12 perianth parts in three whorls) {{have suggested that the}} flange may represent a vestigial calyx resulting from a disruption to the homeotic control of organ identity during floral development. Comparative data on floral vasculature in Fenerivia capuronii are presented to elucidate the homology of the flange in other Fenerivia species (which possess nine perianth parts in three whorls, typical of most Annonaceae). The flange in F. capuronii differs from that in F.  heteropetala as it is unvascularized. It is nevertheless suggested that the flange is likely to be homologous, and that a <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> in the F. heteropetala lineage resulted in the formation of a vestigial but vascularized calyx that fused with the otherwise unvascularized flange...|$|E
40|$|The brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus has a haploid–diploid {{life cycle}} that {{involves}} an alternation between two distinct generations, the sporophyte and the gametophyte. We describe a mutant, ouroboros (oro), {{in which the}} sporophyte generation is converted into a functional, gamete-producing gametophyte. The life history of the mutant thus consists of a continuous reiteration of the gametophyte generation. The oro mutant exhibited morphological features typical of the gametophyte generation and accumulated transcripts of gametophyte generation marker genes. Genetic analysis showed that oro behaved as a single, recessive, Mendelian locus that was unlinked to the IMMEDIATE UPRIGHT locus, which {{has been shown to}} be necessary for full expression of the sporophyte developmental program. The data presented here indicate that ORO is a master regulator of the gametophyte-to-sporophyte life cycle transition and, moreover, that oro represents a unique class of <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> that results in switching between two developmental programs that operate at the level of the whole organism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Forward genetic {{screens in}} mice provide an {{unbiased}} means to identify genes and other functional genetic {{elements in the}} genome. Previously, a large scale ENU mutagenesis screen was conducted to query the functional content of a ~ 50 Mb region of the mouse genome on proximal Chr 5. The majority of phenotypic mutants recovered were embryonic lethals. Results We report the high resolution genetic mapping, complementation analyses, and positional cloning of mutations in the target region. The collection of identified alleles include several with known or presumed functions for which no mutant models have been reported (Tbc 1 d 14, Nol 14, Tyms, Cad, Fbxl 5, Haus 3), and mutations in genes we or others previously reported (Tapt 1, Rest, Ugdh, Paxip 1, Hmx 1, Otoe, Nsun 7). We also confirmed the causative nature of a <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> with a targeted allele, mapped a lethal mutation to a large gene desert, and localized a spermiogenesis mutation to a region in which no annotated genes have coding mutations. The mutation in Tbc 1 d 14 provides the first implication of a critical developmental role for RAB-GAP-mediated protein transport in early embryogenesis. Conclusion This collection of alleles contributes {{to the goal of}} assigning biological functions to all known genes, as well as identifying novel functional elements that would be missed by reverse genetic approaches. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introgression of <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> into {{wild-type}} genetic backgrounds {{results in}} a wide variety of phenotypes and implies that major effect modifiers of extreme phenotypes are not uncommon in natural populations of Drosophila. A composite interval mapping procedure was used to demonstrate that one major effect locus accounts for three-quarters of the variance for haltere to wing margin transformation in Ultrabithorax flies, yet has no obvious effect on wild-type development. Several other genetic backgrounds result in enlargement of the haltere significantly beyond the normal range of haploinsufficient phenotypes, suggesting genetic variation in cofactors that mediate homeotic protein function. Introgression of Antennapedia produces lines with heritable phenotypes ranging from almost complete suppression to perfect antennal leg formation, as well as transformations that are restricted to either the distal or proximal portion of the appendage. It is argued that the existence of "potential" variance, which is genetic variation whose effects are not observable in wild-type individuals, is a prerequisite for the uncoupling of genetic from phenotypic divergence...|$|R
40|$|Flowers of Arabidopsis thaliana {{consist of}} a precise pattern of organs {{arranged}} in four concentric whorls, with each whorl containing {{a different type of}} floral organ in characteristic positions and numbers. Arabidopsis flowers begin their development as small outgrowths of cells on the flank of the inflorescence meristem. Cells within each flower primordium must somehow assess their position relative to others and subsequently differentiate accordingly. <b>Homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> at four loci (AGAMOUS, APETALA 2, APETALA 3, PISTILLATA) identified in Arabidopsis appear to cause cells in two adjacent whorls of the developing flower primordium to misinterpret their position and differentiate inappropriately. The development of wild-type flowers and that of several alleles of each locus is analyzed as well as the development of double and triple mutant combinations between the <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations.</b> Based on this genetic data, a model is proposed for how this limited number of floral homeotic genes, by being expressed in overlapping fields of cells in the meristem of the developing flower primordium, and acting alone and in combination, could specify the identity of each of the whorls. AGAMOUS and APETALA 2 are proposed to negatively regulate each other's activity with the result that they are expressed in mutually exclusive domains, APETALA 2 in the outer two whorls of the flower and AGAMOUS in the inner two whorls. The activities of APETALA 3 and PISTILLATA are proposed to be localized to the second and third whorls, with another gene, SUPERMAN, negatively regulating their activities in the fourth whorl. By protein sequence homology to known transcriptions factors, SRF of humans and MCM 1 of yeast, AGAMOUS encodes a putative transcription factor. In support of the proposed model, RNA tissue in situ hybridizations to developing flowers show that AGAMOUS RNA is spatially localized to the inner two whorls in developing floral buds. Furthermore, in apetala 2 mutant flowers, AGAMOUS RNA is detected in all floral whorls suggesting that APETALA 2 negatively regulates AGAMOUS expression in the outer two whorls at the trancriptional level. Expression patterns of AGAMOUS late during flower development suggest that AGAMOUS may also play a role in cell fate specification during cellular differentiation of stamens and carpels...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study genes {{controlling}} flower development, we have carried out an extensive transposon-mutagenesis experiment in Antirrhinum majus. More than 15 independent <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> were obtained, allowing {{three categories of}} genes to be defined. The first includes floricaula (flo), a primary gene required for the initiation of the floral developmental pathway. In {{the absence of the}} wild-type flo product, proliferating inflorescence meristems arise in place of flowers. The flo gene has been isolated and shown to be expressed transiently in a subset of organ primordia in the floral meristem. The second category includes genes that affect the identity, and also sometimes the number, of whorls of organs in the flower. These genes act in overlapping domains so that each whorl has a distinct combination of gene functions, suggesting a model for the genetic control of whorl identity and number. Genes of the third category control differences between organs in the same whorl and hence the overall symmetry of the flower. We discuss how the basic plan of the flower and inflorescence may arise through the interactions between the three categories of genes...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{based on}} DNA restriction-site and {{sequence}} variation {{have shown that}} the Hawaiian lobeliads are monophyletic and that the two largest genera, Cyanea and Clermontia, diverged from each other ca. 9. 7 Mya. Sequence divergence among species of Clermontia is quite limited, however, and extensive hybridization is suspected, which has interfered with production of a well-resolved molecular phylogeny for the genus. Clermontia is of considerable interest because several species posses petal-like sepals, raising the question of whether such a <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> has arisen once or several times. In addition, morphological and molecular studies have implied different patterns of inter-island dispersal within the genus. Here we use nuclear ISSRs (inter-simple sequence repeat polymorphisms) and five plastid non-coding sequences to derive biparental and maternal phylogenies for Clermontia. Our findings imply that (1) Clermontia is not monophyletic, with Cl. pyrularia nested within Cyanea and apparently an intergeneric hybrid; (2) the earliest divergent clades within Clermontia are native to Kauài, then Òahu, then Maui, supporting the progression rule of dispersal down the chain toward progressively younger islands, although that rule is violated in later-evolving taxa in the ISSR tree; (3) almost no sequence divergence among several Clermontia species in 4. 5 kb of rapidly evolving plastid DNA; (4) several apparent cases of hybridization/introgression or incomplete lineage sorting (i. e., Cl. oblongifolia, peleana, persicifolia, pyrularia, samuelii, tuberculata), based on extensive conflict between the ISSR and plastid phylogenies; and (5) two origins and tw...|$|E
40|$|An {{activation}} tagging {{screen in}} which the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S enhancer was inserted randomly into an Arabidopsis genome homozygous for the floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> apetala 2 - 1 (ap 2 - 1) resulted in a line (28 - 5) with extraordinarily wide, heart-shaped ovaries. The ovary of the 28 - 5 ap 2 - 1 mutant shows an oval shape because of increased numbers of enlarged cells. When the ap 2 - 1 mutation is crossed out of the genetic background, more elongated rather than wider fruits are obtained. Normally, Arabidopsis fruits will develop to a normal size only when the ovules are present and fertilized. In the 28 - 5 single mutant, the siliques keep growing despite failure of fertilization and can reach nearly normal size. When wild-type pollen was used to pollinate the mutant pistil, the pollinated 28 - 5 silique became � 10 % longer and 40 % wider than a wild-type silique, although producing very few seeds. The enhancer insertion in line 28 - 5 acts by hyperactivating a cytochrome P 450 gene, CYP 78 A 9. The pistil of 28 - 5 ap 2 - 1 mutant flowers shows a structure {{similar to that of}} Capsella bursa-pastoris, a distant mustard relative of Arabidopsis, suggesting that the processes regulated by the CYP 78 A 9 -encoded protein may be involved in evolutionary control of carpel shape...|$|E

Although double-flowered mutants have been characterized in several plants, their study in dioecious species {{is of particular interest}} due to influences of the <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> on the different floral whorl configurations in males and females. We have analysed four double-flowered varieties of Silene dioica: Flore Pleno and Rosea Plena date back to the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, Thelma Kay and Firefly were recognized {{in the latter part of}} the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. We have analysed the floral structure of the four varieties, which have distinct floral architectures. Based on Y chromosome-specific PCR analysis we show that Firefly is male and that the other three varieties are female: Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses suggested a common origin for the three female varieties. The double-flowered phenotype in all four varieties is caused by mutation of the C-function MADS-box transcription factor gene SDM 1. We show that Firefly carries a unique 44 bp insertion into SDM 1, revealing an independent origin for this variety. Comparative analysis of SDM 1 cDNA and genomic sequences in Flore Pleno, Rosea Plena and Thelma Kay shows that all three are caused by the same 7 bp insertion within SDM 1 and therefore share a common origin. The three alleles also differ by several single nucleotide polymorphisms, which represent somatic mutations accumulated over four centuries of asexual propagation...|$|E
40|$|The {{homeobox}} gene extradenticle (exd) {{acts as a}} cofactor of the homeotic genes in the specification of larval patterns during embryogenesis. To study its role in adult patterns, we have generated clones of mutant exd- cells and examined their effect on the different body parts. In some regions, exd- clones exhibit homeotic transformations similar to those produced by known <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> such as Ultrabithorax (Ubx), labial (lab), spineless-aristapedia (ssa) or Antennapedia (Antp). In other regions, the lack of exd causes novel homeotic transformations producing ectopic eyes and legs. Moreover, exd is also required for functions normally not associated with homeosis, such as {{the maintenance of the}} dorsoventral pattern, the specification of subpatterns in adult appendages or the arrangement of bristles in the mesonotum and genitalia. Our findings indicate that exd is critically involved in adult morphogenesis, not only in the homeotic function but also in several other developmental processes.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the effects of}} four recessive <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> that specifically disrupt the development of flowers in Arabidopsis thaliana. Each of the recessive mutations affects the outcome of organ development, but not the location of organ primordia. Homeotic transformations observed are as follows. In agamous- 1, stamens to petals; in apetala 2 - 1, sepals to leaves and petals to staminoid petals; in apefala 3 - 1, petals to sepals and stamens to carpels; in pistillata- 1, petals to sepals. In addition, two of these mutations (ap 2 - 1 and pi- 1) result in loss of organs, and ag- 1 causes the cells that would ordinarily form the gynoecium to differentiate as a flower. Two of the mutations are temperature-sensitive. Temperature shift experiments indicate that the wild-type AP 2 gene product acts {{at the time of}} primordium initiation; the AP 3 product is active later. It seems that the wild-type alleles of these four genes allow cells to determine their place in the developing flower and thus to differentiate appropriately. We propose that these genes may be involved in setting up or responding to concentric, overlapping fields within the flower primordium...|$|R
40|$|Background: Arabidopsis {{mutations}} causing genome-wide hypomethylation are viable but {{display a}} number of specific developmental abnormalities, including some that resemble known floral <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations.</b> We previously showed {{that one of the}} developmental abnormalities present in an antisense-METHYLTRANSFERASEI (METI) transgenic line resulted from ectopic hypermethylation of the SUPERMAN gene. Results: Here, we investigate the extent to which hypermethylation of SUPERMAN occurs in several hypomethylation mutants, and describe methylation effects at a second gene, AGAMOUS. SUPERMAN gene hypermethylation occurred at a high frequency in several mutants that cause overall decreases in genomic DNA methylation. The hypermethylation pattern was largely similar in the different mutant backgrounds. Genetic analysis suggests that hypermethylation most likely arose either during meiosis or somatically in small sectors of the plant. A second floral development gene, AGAMOUS, also became hypermethylated and silenced in an Arabidopsis antisense-METI line. Conclusions: These results suggest that ectopic hypermethylation of specific genes in mutant backgrounds that show overall decreases in methylation may be a widespread phenomenon that could explain many of the developmental defects seen in Arabidopsis methylation mutants. This resembles a phenomenon seen in cancer cells, which can simultaneously show genome-wide hypomethylation and hypermethylation of specific genes. Comparison of the methylated sequences in SUPERMAN and AGAMOUS suggests that hypermethylation could involve DNA secondary structures formed by pyrimidine-rich sequences...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} a genetic and developmental analysis of genes within the 2 C-D {{area of the}} X chromosome. Phenotypes of 33 mutations representing nine adjacent complementation groups including eight recessive lethals and one visible <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> (polyhomeotic) are described. Germline clonal analysis of the eight zygotic lethals has revealed three types of gene requirements: (1) normal activity at two pupal lethal loci (corkscrew and C 204) and one larval lethal locus (ultraspiracle) is required for normal embryogenesis; (2) normal activity at three larval lethal loci (DF 967, VE 651 and Pgd) is required for normal oogenesis; and (3) activity at only one locus (EA 82), a larval lethal, appears to have no maternal requirement. Ambiguous results were obtained for the GF 316 lethal complementation group. Analysis of mitotic figures of the pupal lethals indicates that C 204 disrupts an essential mitotic function. This result correlates with the preblastoderm arrest observed among embryos derived from germline clones of C 204. Embryos derived from germline clones of corkscrew (csw) exhibit a "twisted" phenotype. The recessive lethal ultraspiracle (usp) disrupts {{the organization of the}} posterior tip of the larva both zygotically and maternally: second instar usp/Y larvae derived from heterozygous usp/+ mothers possess an extra set of spiracles, whereas usp/Y embryos derived from females possessing a germline clone (usp/usp) exhibit a localized ventral defect in the ninth or posterior eighth abdominal segment. Analysis of the phenotypes of deficiency-hemizygous embryos indicates the presence of an embryonic zygotic lethal locus, as yet unidentified, which produces central nervous system and ventral hypoderm degeneration. Additional information on the genetic organization of loci within the adjacent 2 E area are also described. The implications of this analysis {{to our understanding of the}} maternal of zygotic lethal loci in development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In the {{evolution}} of floral structures a number of examples exist where homeotic changes in flower organisation probably occurred {{at the base of}} taxonomic groups. It is, however, not known how exactly natural morphological diversity is generated, especially how homeotic changes which originated spontaneously in the wild get fixed in a population. A plant model system in which the role of a spontaneous <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> can be studied in a multidisciplinary approach combining morphological, genetic, molecular and ecological methods was not available so far. In this thesis I established the natural floral homeotic Spe (Stamenoid petals) variety of Capsella bursa-pastoris, in which petals are completely transformed into stamens, as such a model system. In a concomitant review article known facts about the role of homeosis were compiled to demonstrate the potential of C. bursa-pastoris as a model species and for introduction of the Spe variant. A hypothesis on the underlying molecular mechanism based on ectopic expression of a class C organ identity gene as well as an experimental program to study this phenomenon with ecological and evolutionary methods was developed in the review article. With my experimental results I demonstrated that the Spe variety shows a complete homeotic shift from petals to stamens that is driven by an allele of a single co-dominant locus in two different Spe variety lines without pleiotropic effects. The co-dominant mode of inheritance of the Spe phenotype suggested a gain-of-function mutation in a regulatory region of the same gene in two independent Spe variety lines. I also showed that ectopic expression of two AG-like genes, CbpAG and CbpSTK, correlate with organ transformation, of which very likely the CbpAG ectopic expression is directly responsible for the changed organ identity. Results of parallel PhD work of J. Ziermann demonstrated that exclusively the class C gene CbpAGa co-segregates with the mutant phenotype and that likely a change in a candidate cis-regulatory region of the CbpAGa gene is responsible for the deviating expression patterns of this gene.

40|$|Many Baculites {{specimens}} {{from the}} Upper Cretaceous of the United States Western Interior show exceptional {{preservation of the}} original aragonitic shell and its fine-scale surface ornamentation. Growth lines are ubiquitous, with two orders of these structures represented on some shells, and reflect the incremental addition of new shell at the apertural margin. Growth line interruption {{in the form of}} repair of minor shell damage at the aperture, commonplace in contemporary Nautilus, is essentially absent in Baculites, suggesting that its members fed on small prey in the water column. As typical of Mesozoic ammonites in general, and in striking contrast to contemporary Nautilus, no in vivo epizoans have been recognized on specimens of Baculites. It is inferred that the shell of Baculites was covered in periostracum to eliminate epizoic colonization. By analogy with Nautilus, a distinctive micro-ornament oriented at right angles to growth lines and visible on parts of some specimens was probably associated with periostracal attachment. A small proportion of Baculites specimens show abnormalities in shell growth categorized as v-shaped indentations of growth lines, shell grooves, fine-scale folds on the surface of growth lines and feather structures. We view this entire set of structures as due to abnormalities in mantle growth induced at the leading edge, impressed into the periostracum during its fabrication, and then in turn into the shell surface. As many of the Baculites with shell abnormalities are smooth, the proposal by Checa linking homologous structures recognized on other ammonites to the formation of comarginal ribs is rejected. A case of sutural inversion, in which the form of minor divisions of the major saddles and lobes are transposed, is recognized in a specimen of Baculites codyensis Reeside. We consider sutural pattern in ammonites, an expression of septal fluting, as replicating the genetically specified standing form of an elastic adapical visceral mass. The inverted sutural pattern, and by implication the style of septal fluting, was transcribed exactly in the three successive septa preserved on the specimen. The abnormality appears to be a case of <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> in which the plan for one body region becomes translocated to another. The conservatism of major elements of sutural (=septal) patterns for Mesozoic ammonites in their evolutionary spectrum suggests that a homeobox of conserved DNA sequence, with the transcription factors encoded in homeotic genes, is likely to have been involved.

40|$|In chironomid midges, the {{development}} of head and thorax in the embryo requires the function of cytoplasmic determinants localized near the anterior pole of the egg. Experimental inactivation of these determinants causes a dramatic switch in {{the development}}al program of the embryo. Instead of the normal segment pattern, the aberrant pattern "double abdomen" is formed. Head, thorax, and anterior abdominal segments are then replaced by an additional set of posterior abdominal segments joined in mirror image symmetry to the original abdomen. Such double abdomens have been produced, with a maximum yield of 29 %, by application of RNase (ribonuclease I, ribonucleate 3 '-pyrimidino-oligonucleotidohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 4. 22) to the anterior pole region of the egg. This was achieved by microinjection or puncturing the eggs during submersion in RNase. Control experiments with inactive RNase S fragments reliably proved that double abdomen formation resulted from RNase activity. Neither application of other enzymes to the anterior pole region nor application of RNase to other egg regions produced double abdomens in significant yields. The effects of RNase concentration and stage of development were determined. The data from these and earlier experiments are compatible {{with the idea that}} stored cytoplasmic RNP particles act as anterior determinants.

40|$|In Drosophila, <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> {{lead to the}} {{transformation}} of structures of one body segment into the corresponding structures of another segment. These mutations identify master regulator genes which specify segmental identity along the antero-posterior body axis. Dominant gain and recessive loss-of-function mutations generate to opposite segmental transformations. The cloning of the homeotic Antennapedia (Antp) gene led {{to the discovery of}} the homeobox, a 180 -bp DNA segment characteristic for homeotic genes. It encodes the DNA-binding domain of the respective proteins which was designated as the homeodomain. Homeodomain proteins are transcriptional regulators which specify the body plan by controlling the transcription of their subordinate target genes. By inserting the Antp cDNA into a heat-inducible expression vector, the body plan can be altered in a predictable way. Using the homeobox as a probe, homologous Hox genes from vertebrates have been cloned. In the mouse, dominant gain and recessive loss-of-function mutations result in segmental transformations of opposite direction, as in Drosophila. Also, the mouse Hox genes can partially substitute the homologous Drosophila genes in transgenic flies. Therefore, the genetic control of the body plan is much more universal than anticipated. The three-dimensional structure of the Antp homeodomain and its complex with a consensus DNA-binding site was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The homeodomain essentially consists of four alpha-helices, a helix-turn-helix motif, and a flexible N-terminal arm.

Double mutant combinations between a PcG gene and a trxG gene suppress the homeotic transformations seen with either mutation alone, suggesting that PcG and trxG genes act antagonistically. The PcG gene Additional sex combs (Asx) is interesting because one mutant allele, AsxP 1, causes both anterior and posterior homeotic transformations. AsxP 1 and other Asx mutations were crossed to mutations in the PcG gene Polycomb (Pc) and the trxG gene trithorax (trx). Asx alleles enhance both PcG and trxG homeotic transformations, showing that Asx is required for both the activation and the repression of homeotic loci. Asx also shows strong allele-specific interactions with the PcG genes Pc and super sex combs (sxc). Together, these data indicate that there are functional interactions between Asx, Pc and sxc in vivo. ASX may interact with a PcG complex containing PC and SXC and mediate activation versus repression at target loci, perhaps by interacting directly with the TRX protein...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Hawaiian endemic genus Clermonti a (Campanulaceae) {{includes}} 22 species, 15 of which, the double-corolla species, {{are characterized}} by an extra whorl of organs {{that appear to be}} true petals occupying what is normally the sepal whorl. Previous research has shown that the presence of homeotic petaloid organs in some other plant groups correlates with ectopic expression of B-function MADS box genes, but similar core eudicot examples of apparent groundplan divergence remain unstudied. B-function genes, which are not normally expressed in the sepal whorl, are required for determination and maintenance of petal identity. Here, we investigate the potential role of altered B-function gene expression contributing to the morphological diversity of this island genus. Results We examined the morphology and developmental genetics of two different species of Clermontia, one of which, C. arborescens, has normal sepals while the other, C. parviflora, has two whorls of petal-like organs. Scanning electron microscopy of cell surface morphologies of first and second whorl organs in the double-corolla species C. parviflora revealed conical epidermal cells on the adaxial surfaces of both first and second whorl petaloid organs, strongly suggesting a homeotic conversion in the former. Phylogenetic analysis of Clermontia species based on 5 S ribosomal DNA non-transcribed spacer sequences indicated a probable single and geologically recent origin of the double-corolla trait within the genus, with numerous potential reversals to the standard sepal-petal format. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of homologs of the B-function genes PISTILLATA (PI), APETALA 3 and TOMATO MADS 6 indicated ectopic expression of two PI paralogs in the first whorl of C. parviflora; no such homeotic expression was observed for the other two genes, nor for several other MADS box genes involved in various floral and non-floral functions. In the standard sepal-petal species C. arborescens, ectopic expression of PI homologs was not observed. In C. parviflora, the upregulation of PI homologs was precisely restricted to the perianth and stamen whorls, excluding a simple overexpression phenotype. In situ hybridization analysis of C. parviflora material similarly showed first and second whorl PI homolog expression in developing flower buds. Conclusions Our morphological and gene expression data strongly suggest that a drastic and heritable phenotypic change, at the level of floral groundplan, can originate from a <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutation</b> that is likely regulatory, being under precise spatiotemporal control as opposed to having pleiotropic characteristics. The uniqueness of this trait among core eudicots could be linked to increased ecological viability in an unstable island environment, a chance event which need not have posed any immediate adaptive benefit. We argue that the evolutionarily young morphological radiation of Clermontia may form a model system for general understanding of mechanisms of larger-scale angiosperm diversification in past, similarly unstable environments, in which small regulatory changes may have been responsible for modern-day groundplan differences. Trial registration Clinical Trials. gov- NCT 01710735 Significance and Innovations The present investigation {{is one of the first}} to examine the hypothesis of grossmuscle contractile inhibition due to the presence of diagnostically relevant MFTrPs. Individuals suffering from clinically relevant levels of self-reported pain are able to tolerate maximum voluntary contraction testing, but delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is a likely side-effect irrespective of symptom status. As a consequence, its confounding effect during subsequent testing must be taken into account. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{diversity of}} form in arthropods reflects flexible genetic programs deploying many conserved genes. In the insect model Drosophila melanogaster, diversity of form {{can be observed}} between serially homologous appendages or when a single appendage is transformed by <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations,</b> such as the adult labial mouthparts that can present alternative antennal, prothoracic, or maxillary identities. We have examined {{the roles of the}} Hox selector genes proboscipedia (pb) and Sex combs reduced (Scr), and the antennal selectors homothorax (hth) and spineless (ss) in labial specification, by tissue-directed mitotic recombination. Whereas loss of pb function transforms labium to prothoracic leg, loss of Scr, hth, or ss functions results in little or no change in labial specification. Results of analysis of single and multiple mutant combinations support a genetic hierarchy in which the homeotic pb gene possesses a primary role. It is surprising to note that while loss of ss activity alone had no detected effect, all mutant combinations lacking both pb and ss yielded the most severe phenotype observed: stunted, apparently tripartite legs that may correspond to a default state. The roles of the four selector genes are functionally linked to a cell nonautonomous mechanism involving the coupled activities of the decapentaplegic (dpp) /TGF-beta and wingless (wg) /Wnt signaling pathways. Accordingly, several mutant combinations impaired in dpp signaling were seen to reorient labial-to-leg transformations toward antennal aristae. A crucial aspect of selector function in development and evolution may be in regulating diffusible signals, including those emitted by dpp and wg...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a locus, SUPERMAN, mutations in which result in extra stamens developing {{at the expense}} of the central carpels in the Arabidopsis thaliana flower. The development of superman flowers, from initial primordium to mature flower, is described by scanning electron microscopy. The development of doubly and triply mutant strains, constructed with superman alleles and previously identified <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> that cause alterations in floral organ identity, is also described. Essentially additive phenotypes are observed in superman agamous and superman apetala 2 double mutants. The epistatic relationships observed between either apetala 3 or pistillata and superman alleles suggest that the SUPERMAN gene product could be a regulator of these floral homeotic genes. To test this, the expression patterns of AGAMOUS and APETALA 3 were examined in superman flowers. In wild-type flowers, APETALA 3 expression is restricted to the second and third whorls where it is required for the specification of petals and stamens. In contrast, in superman flowers, APETALA 3 expression expands to include most of the cells that would normally constitute the fourth whorl. This ectopic APETALA 3 expression is proposed to be one of the causes of the development of the extra stamens in superman flowers. The spatial pattern of AGAMOUS expression remains unaltered in superman flowers as compared to wild-type flowers. Taken together these data indicate that one of the functions of the wild-type SUPERMAN gene product is to negatively regulate APETALA 3 in the fourth whorl of the flower. In addition, superman mutants exhibit a loss of determinacy of the floral meristem, an effect that appears to be mediated by the APETALA 3 and PISTILLATA gene products...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{systems are}} highly {{variable}} in flowering plants {{and an important}} contributor floral diversity. The ranunculid genus Thalictrum is especially well suited to study evolutionary transitions in sexual systems. Homeotic transformation of sexual organs (stamens and carpels) is a plausible mechanism for the transition from hermaphroditic to unisexual flowers in this lineage because flowers of dioecious species develop unisexually from inception. The single-copy gene PISTILLATA (PI), constitutes a likely candidate for rapid switches between stamen and carpel identity. Here, we first characterized the expression pattern of all B class genes in the dioecious species T. dioicum. As expected, all B class orthologs are expressed in stamens from the earliest stages. Certain AP 3 lineages were also expressed late in sepal development. We then tested whether orthologs of PI could potentially control sexual system transitions in Thalictrum, by knocking-down their expression in T. dioicum and the hermaphroditic species T. thalictroides. In T. dioicum, we found that ThdPI- 1 / 2 silencing caused stamen primordia to develop into carpels, resulting in male to female flower conversions. In T. thalictroides, we found that ThtPI silencing caused stamen primordia to develop into supernumerary carpels, resulting in hermaphroditic to female flower conversions. These phenotypes illustrate the ability for <b>homeotic</b> <b>mutations</b> to bring about sudden and potentially adaptive changes by altering the function of a single gene. We propose a two-step evolutionary model where transitions from hermaphroditic to unisexual plants in Thalictrum result from two independent mutations at a B class gene locus. Our PI knockdown experiments in T. thalictroides recapitulate the second step in this model: the evolution of female plants {{as a result of}} a loss-of-function mutation in a B class gene...|$|R
40|$|We have {{screened}} the Drosophila X chromosome for genes whose dosage {{affects the}} function of the homeotic gene Deformed. One of these genes, extradenticle, encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that heterodimerizes with Deformed and other <b>homeotic</b> Hox proteins. <b>Mutations</b> in the nejire gene, which encodes a transcriptional adaptor protein belonging to the CBP/p 300 family, also interact with Deformed. The other previously characterized gene identified as a Deformed interactor is Notch, which encodes a transmembrane receptor. These three genes underscore the importance of transcriptional regulation and cell-cell signaling in Hox function. Four novel genes were also identified in the screen. One of these, rancor, is required for appropriate embryonic expression of Deformed and another homeotic gene, labial. Both Notch and nejire affect {{the function of}} another Hox gene, Ultrabithorax, indicating they may be required for homeotic activity in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} conserved SET domain {{is present}} in many eukaryotic chromatin-associated proteins, including {{some members of the}} trithorax (TrxG) group and the polycomb (PcG) group of epigenetic transcriptional regulators and modifiers of position effect variegation. All SET domains examined exhibited histone lysine methyltransferase activity, implicating these proteins in the generation of epigenetic marks. However, the mode of the initial recruitment of SET proteins to target genes and the way that their association with the genes is maintained after replication are not known. We found that SET-containing proteins of the SET 1 and SET 2 families contain motifs in the pre-SET region or at the pre-SET–SET and SET–post-SET boundaries which very tightly bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA. These motifs also bind stretches of ssDNA generated by superhelical tension or during the in vitro transcription of duplex DNA. Importantly, such binding withstands nucleosome assembly, interfering with the formation of regular nucleosomal arrays. Two representatives of the SUV 39 SET family, SU(VAR) 3 - 9 and G 9 a, did not bind ssDNA. The trx Z 11 <b>homeotic</b> point <b>mutation,</b> which is located within TRX SET and disrupts embryonic development, impairs the ssDNA binding capacity of the protein. We suggest that the motifs described here may be directly involved in the biological function(s) of SET-containing proteins. The binding of single-stranded nucleic acids might {{play a role in the}} initial recruitment of the proteins to target genes, in the maintenance of their association after DNA replication...|$|R
