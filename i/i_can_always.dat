I get [...] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I {{realize that this is}} what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible ... I just know the way [...] plays so well at this point that I always know kind of what he's going to do. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> sense where he's going with things just by the mood he's in or the attitude or how the song is going. Once in a while, he throws me for a loop, but I can usually keep him where I want him." ...|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak {{noted that}} Beyoncé [...] "ecstatically and hyperactively" [...] changes keys four {{times during the}} entire song. As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush, she {{constantly}} sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past, this being illustrated in lyrics such as, [...] "after fighting through my fears [...] finally you've put me first." [...] The chorus, complimented with sweet backing harmonies, then arrives, with Beyoncé chanting, [...] "Baby it's you, you're the one I love / You're the one I need / You're the only one I see / Come on baby it's you / You're the one that gives your all / You're the one <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> call / When I need you make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top." [...] The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes, proceeding to D♭, then to D, E♭ and finally to [...] E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that [...] "the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder-reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes." [...] In this way, the word [...] "baby" [...] is said about 24 times throughout the song. As soon as the synthesizers drop out, the song fades out almost instantaneously.|$|E

In {{the morning}} I hear my master invoking {{the protection of}} the Tree Treasures in the evening I hear his wife reciting the noble scriptures. To be a dog and have to accept the whole realm of impurities is {{a small price to pay}} for never so much as hearing the word 'Hell' said in my ear." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} save money by {{eliminating}} the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that [...] "Sparey would execute them beautifully." [...] Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out {{to the rest of the}} crew. The film was produced almost entirely without pencil tests. According to Bakshi, [...] "We pencil tested I'd say a thousand feet , tops. [...] We do a major feature without pencil tests—that's tough. The timing falls off. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> tell an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see." [...] Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen. Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.|$|E

5000|$|Did {{anyone else}} see the {{conclusion}} of the case ahead of time? I was at a total loss. I had written off the baby's mother as soon as they spoke with her.
