5|$|<b>Herpes</b> simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} <b>herpes</b> simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral <b>herpes</b> involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital <b>herpes,</b> often simply known as <b>herpes,</b> may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. <b>Herpes</b> cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by <b>herpes</b> simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, <b>herpes</b> of the eye, <b>herpes</b> infection of the brain, and neonatal <b>herpes</b> when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5|$|Genital <b>herpes</b> {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral <b>herpes,</b> since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital <b>herpes,</b> including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital <b>herpes.</b> Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 study, 1900 people (25% {{of which}} had <b>herpes)</b> ranked genital <b>herpes</b> second for social stigma, out of all sexually {{transmitted}} diseases (HIV took the top spot for STD stigma).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} topical antivirals are {{effective}} for <b>herpes</b> labialis, including acyclovir, penciclovir, and docosanol.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{the use of}} acyclovir and valacyclovir {{in the treatment of}} <b>herpes</b> labialis as well as <b>herpes</b> infections in people with cancer. The evidence to support the use of acyclovir in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is weaker.|$|E
5|$|Herpetic sycosis is a {{recurrent}} or initial <b>herpes</b> simplex infection affecting primarily the hair follicle.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>herpes</b> simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 more {{commonly}} causes infections around the mouth while HSV-2 more commonly causes genital infections. They are transmitted by direct contact with body fluids or lesions of an infected individual. Transmission may still occur when symptoms are not present. Genital <b>herpes</b> is classified as a sexually transmitted infection. It may be spread to an infant during childbirth. After infection, the viruses are transported along sensory nerves to the nerve cell bodies, where they reside lifelong. Causes of recurrence may include: decreased immune function, stress, and sunlight exposure. Oral and genital <b>herpes</b> is usually diagnosed based on the presenting symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by viral culture or detecting <b>herpes</b> DNA in fluid from blisters. Testing the blood for antibodies against the virus can confirm a previous infection but will be negative in new infections.|$|E
5|$|A genomic {{study of}} the <b>herpes</b> simplex type 1 virus {{confirmed}} the human migration pattern theory known as the out-of-Africa hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Herpes</b> {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated <b>herpes</b> zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of <b>herpes</b> simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for <b>herpes</b> treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal <b>herpes</b> included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E
5|$|Many people {{infected}} with HSV-2 display no physical symptoms—individuals with no symptoms {{are described as}} asymptomatic or as having subclinical <b>herpes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it is a cold sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has <b>herpes.</b> With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has <b>herpes,</b> despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the <b>herpes.</b> Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital <b>herpes.</b> A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (<b>herpes</b> simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among {{men who have sex}} with men, reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, with the possible exception of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{incidence}} in Canada of genital <b>herpes</b> due to HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection {{is not known}} (for a review of HSV-1/HSV-2 prevalence and incidence studies worldwide, see Smith and Robinson 2002). As many as one in seven Canadians aged 14 to 59 may be infected with <b>herpes</b> simplex type 2 virus and more than 90 per cent of them may be unaware of their status, a new study suggests. In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} about 1,640,000 HSV-2 seroconversions occur yearly (730,000 men and 910,000 women, or 8.4 per 1,000 persons).|$|E
5|$|The <b>herpes</b> simplex virus HSV-1 {{has been}} found in the same areas as amyloid plaques. This {{suggested}} the possibility that AD could be treated or prevented with antiviral medication. Studies of antivirals in cell cultures have shown promising results.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the <b>herpes</b> virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who said {{at the news conference}} on 8 August 2017 that one of her three clients had contracted genital <b>herpes</b> allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday. The other two accusers, one male, one female, preferred to remain anonymous plaintiffs. Sharpton admitted she tested negative for <b>herpes</b> and Bloom stated she didn't know if the singer had the disease.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} <b>herpes</b> simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the <b>herpes</b> viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of <b>herpes</b> virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with <b>herpes</b> simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by <b>herpes</b> viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|It {{should not}} be {{confused}} with conditions caused by other viruses in the herpesviridae family such as <b>herpes</b> zoster, which is caused by varicella zoster virus. The differential diagnosis includes hand, foot and mouth disease due to similar lesions on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Maillard et al. and Li et al. provide {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a functional antiviral RNAi pathway in mammalian cells. Other functions for RNAi in mammalian viruses also exist, such as miRNAs expressed by the <b>herpes</b> virus that may act as heterochromatin organization triggers to mediate viral latency.|$|E
5|$|Research {{has gone}} into {{vaccines}} for both prevention and treatment of <b>herpes</b> infections. Unsuccessful clinical trials have been conducted for glycoprotein subunit vaccines. For therapy, only a single replication-competent HSV vaccine has undergone human testing. As of 2011, the future pipeline includes several promising replication-incompetent vaccine proposals while two replication-competent vaccine proposals require further animal testing.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective for treating <b>herpes,</b> including acyclovir, valaciclovir (valacyclovir), famciclovir, and penciclovir. Acyclovir {{was the first}} discovered and is now available in generic. Valacyclovir is also available as a generic and is slightly more effective than aciclovir for reducing lesion healing time.|$|E
5|$|Shingles, {{also known}} as <b>herpes</b> zoster, {{is a viral disease}} {{characterized}} by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide stripe either on the left or right of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with <b>herpes</b> viruses.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns. There is no {{good evidence}} that topical application of aloe vera is effective for treating genital <b>herpes</b> or psoriasis. A 2014 Cochrane review found no strong evidence {{for the value of}} topical application of aloe vera to treat or prevent phlebitis caused by intravenous infusion.|$|E
5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of <b>herpes</b> simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of <b>herpes</b> and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis {{is mostly}} {{based on the}} {{clinical}} appearance and the medical history. The most important diagnostic feature {{is a history of}} recurrent, self healing ulcers at fairly regular intervals. Although there are many causes of oral ulceration, recurrent oral ulceration has relatively few causes, most commonly aphthous stomatitis, but rarely Behçet's disease, erythema multiforme, ulceration associated with gastrointestinal disease, and recurrent intra-oral <b>herpes</b> simplex infection. A systemic cause is more likely in adults who suddenly develop recurrent oral ulceration with no prior history.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital <b>herpes</b> and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, <b>herpes</b> simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, <b>herpes</b> simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has <b>herpes.</b> He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for <b>herpes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show <b>herpes</b> virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has no effect on aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Potential {{antiviral}} therapies include topical microbicide {{treatments that}} use RNAi to treat infection (at Harvard Medical School; in mice, so far) by <b>herpes</b> simplex virus type 2 and the inhibition of viral gene expression in cancerous cells, knockdown of host receptors and coreceptors for HIV, the silencing of hepatitis A and hepatitis B genes, silencing of influenza gene expression, and inhibition of measles viral replication. Potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases {{have also been}} proposed, with particular attention to polyglutamine diseases such as Huntington's disease.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and <b>herpes</b> simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a higher risk of acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with <b>herpes</b> viruses. Some viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, can cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy, while others, such as papillomaviruses, are established causes of cancer.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) comes to work thinking he has a pimple, but it turns out to actually be a cold sore. When he is told that it is a form of <b>herpes,</b> Michael contacts all his ex-girlfriends—Jan, Holly, Helene, Donna, and Carol. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) holds a sex education meeting in the office hoping to learn if Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is having sex with her boyfriend, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods).|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human <b>herpes</b> viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
