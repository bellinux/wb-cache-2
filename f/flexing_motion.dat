40|$|The {{vibroseis}} method must {{be extended}} to its limits as the search {{for oil and gas}} continues on land. To successfully improve vibroseis data quality, it is crucial to evaluate each element in the vibroseis data acquisition system and ensure that the contribution from each element is successful. Vibroseis systems depend greatly upon the ability of vibrators to generate synchronous, repeatable ground-force sweeps over a broad frequency range. This requires that the reaction mass and the baseplate of the vibrator move as rigid bodies. However, rigid-body motion is not completely true for high- frequency vibrations, especially for the vibrator baseplate. In order to accurately understand the motion of the vibrator baseplate, a finite element analysis model of the vibrator baseplate and the coupled ground has been developed. This model is useful for simulating the vibrator baseplate dynamics, evaluating the impact of the baseplate on the coupled ground and vibrator baseplate design. Model data demonstrate that the vibrator baseplate and its stilt structure are subject to six significant resonant frequencies in the range of 10 – 80 Hz. Due to the low rigidity of the baseplate, the baseplate stilt structure experiences severe rocking motions at lower frequencies and the baseplate pad experiences severe <b>flexing</b> <b>motions</b> at higher frequencies. <b>Flexing</b> <b>motions</b> cause partial decoupling, which gives rise to increased levels of harmonic distortion and less useable signal energy. In general, the baseplate pad suffers more bending and <b>flexing</b> <b>motions</b> at high frequencies than low frequencies, leading less efficiency in transmitting the useable energy into the ground...|$|R

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} for strong epaxial muscles along {{the base of}} the raised neural spines in both Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon, likely helping to stiffen and strengthen the backbone for walking and for lunging at prey by restricting side-to-side <b>flexing</b> <b>motion.</b> A recent study [...] {{of the structure of the}} neural spines on Sphenacodon confirms that the upper parts were not encased in a thick muscular hump and instead protruded above a layer of muscle to form a low dorsal crest. Finds of sphenacodontid specimens in which postmortem distortion of the body caused the dorsal spines to overlap suggests that the spines were not connected by hard or particularly tough tissue. The possible function of a low, skin-covered crest in Sphenacodon is debated. A thermoregulatory role seems unlikely, although the taller crest in Sphenacodon ferocior is allometrically larger than in S. ferox. Recent research has favored a display role for the tall sails in Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus.Both Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon have been depicted with their short limbs splayed outward at 90 degrees from the body in a wide pushup position and with the tail (and even belly) dragging on the ground, similar to modern lizards and crocodiles. A sprawling stance is also typical for Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon skeletons as currently mounted in museums. However, trackways called Dimetropus (“Dimetrodon foot”) that match the foot configuration of large sphenacodontids show animals walking with their limbs brought under the body for a narrow, semi-erect gait without tail or belly drag marks. Such clear evidence for a more efficient upright posture suggests that important details about the anatomy and locomotion of Sphenacodon and Dimetrodon may not be fully understood. Some well preserved narrow Dimetropus tracks found in parts of the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument in New Mexico match the smaller size of Sphenacodon, a genus known from skeletal fossils in the state, but could also come from a small Dimetrodon.|$|E

POPC and ST-PC were deuterated at the lipid headgroup, DOPC at the cis-double bonds. The influence of the three sterols on the motion and conformation of the lipid headgroups and the hydrocarbon chains was monitored with 2 H- and 31 P-NMR. All three sterols were freely miscible with the lipid matrix in concentrations of up to 50 mol% without inducing phase separations or nonbilayer structures. However, the molecules exert quite different effects on the phospholipid bilayer. Cholesterol and stigmastanol are largely buried in the hydrocarbon part of the membrane, distinctly restricting the <b>flexing</b> <b>motions</b> of the fatty acyl chains whereas the conformation of the phospholipid headgroups is little affected. In contrast, ST-PC is anchored with its headgroup in the layer of phospholipid dipoles, preventing an extensive penetration of the sterol ring into the hydrocarbon layer. Hence ST-PC has almost {{no effect on the}} hydrocarbon chains but induces a characteristic conformational change of the phospholipid headgroups. The 2 H- and 31 P-NMR spectra of mixed phospholipid/ST-PC membranes further demonstrate that the PC headgroup of ST-PC has a similar orientation as the surrounding phosphatidylcholine headgroups. For both types of molecules the -P-N+ dipole is essentially parallel to the membrane surface. Addition of ST-PC induces a small rotation of the POPC headgroup towards the water phase...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthetic}} lipid 1, 2 -dimyristoyl-sn- 3 -phosphoglycerol (DMPG), when dispersed in water/NaCl {{exhibits a}} complex phase behavior caused by its almost unlimited swelling in excess water. Using deuterium ((2) H) - and phosphorus ((31) P) -NMR we {{have studied the}} molecular properties of DMPG/water/NaCl dispersions {{as a function of}} lipid and NaCl concentration. We have measured the order profile of the hydrophobic part of the lipid bilayer with deuterated DMPG while the orientation of the phosphoglycerol headgroup was deduced from the (31) P NMR chemical shielding anisotropy. At temperatures > 30 degrees C we observe well-resolved (2) H- and (31) P NMR spectra not much different from other liquid crystalline bilayers. From the order profiles it is possible to deduce the average length of the flexible fatty acyl chain. Unusual spectra are obtained in the temperature interval of 20 - 25 degrees C, indicating one or several phase transitions. The most dramatic changes are seen at low lipid concentration and low ionic strength. Under these conditions and at 25 degrees C, the phosphoglycerol headgroup rotates into the hydrocarbon layer and the hydrocarbon chains show larger <b>flexing</b> <b>motions</b> than at higher temperatures. The orientation of the phosphoglycerol headgroup depends on the bilayer surface charge and correlates with the degree of dissociation of DMPG-Na(+).

Two dynamic processes were examined: ring inversion and bridge flexing. H- 1 NMR lineshape analysis was used to obtain ring inversion barriers for 2 - 4. These studies yielded energy barriers of 14. 3, 16. 7, and 15. 7 +/- 0. 6 kcal/mol for the hydrochloride salts of doxepin, dothiepin, and amitriptyline, respectively. The barriers for the corresponding free bases were lower by 0. 6 kcal/mol on average. (CT 1) -C- 13 relaxation measurements were used to determine the degree of bridge flexing associated with the central seven-membered ring for all four compounds. By fitting the T- 1 data to a two-state jump model, lifetimes and amplitudes of rapid bridge <b>flexing</b> <b>motions</b> were determined. The results show that imipramine has the fastest rate of bridge flexing, followed by amitriptyline, doxepin, and dothiepin. The pharmacological profiles of the TCAs are complex and they interact with many receptor sites, resulting in numerous side effects and a general lack of understanding of their precise mode of action in different anxiety-related disorders. They all have similar three-dimensional structures, which makes it difficult to rationalize their differing relative potency in different assays/clinical settings. However, the clear finding here that there are significantly different degrees of internal mobility suggests that molecular dynamics should be an additional factor considered when trying to understand the mode of action of this clinically important family of molecules.

40|$|Biological macromolecules do not {{function}} as static molecules. A variety of biological functions {{are the result}} of fluctuations in protein and nucleic acid structure. The method of X-ray diffuse scattering analysis has been extended to provide information about intermolecular and intramolecular disorder in protein and nucleic acid crystals. Yeast initiator transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) carries the initial methionine to the ribosome during translation initiation. Results from analysis of the yeast initiator tRNA crystal diffuse scattering indicate that anisotropic, lattice-coupled motions contribute to the overall disorder in the crystals. The lattice-coupled disorder implies a <b>flexing</b> <b>motion</b> between the anti-codon and acceptor arms. This type of flexing has been implicated in tRNA's role in protein synthesis on the ribosome. Diffuse scattering analysis also shows that the distal half of the anti-codon arm of tRNA undergoes isotropic short-range motion correlated over a distance of approximately 3 A. This distance corresponds well with the base-pair stacking distance in RNA helices. These results are consistent with nearest-neighbor base pairs moving isotropically and as coherent units in the tRNA anti-codon arm. Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) is an important enzyme in the catabolism of amino acids and catalyzes the removal of their amino groups. Crystallographic evidence suggests that the small domain of one of the subunits in the biologically active dimer of AspAT in acetate buffer is disordered. Analysis of the X-ray diffuse scattering from AspAT crystals shows that the small domain moves isotropically and as a rigid body with an amplitude consistent with the crystallographically determined average B-value for the small domain. A preliminary attempt has been made to map the three-dimensional diffuse scattering from a set of simulated still diffraction photographs. This technique has been applied to actual diffraction data from AspAT crystals. The results show that an important diffuse scattering feature is weak but discernible in the reconstructed 3 -D volume. X-ray diffuse scattering analysis provides unique experimental evidence for motions in biological macromolecules in crystals. Information obtained about global as well as local intramolecular motion is useful in understanding the role of molecular flexibility in biological function...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{state power}} modules are {{subjected}} to harsh environmental and operational loads. Identifying the potential design weakness and dominant failure mechanisms associated with the application is very critical to designing such power modules. Failure of the wedge-bonded wires {{is one of the}} most commonly identified causes of failures in power modules. This can occur when wires flex in response to a thermal cycling load. Since the heel of the wire is already weakened due to the ultrasonic bonding process, the <b>flexing</b> <b>motion</b> is enough to initiate a crack in the heel of the wire. Owing to the prevalence of this failure mechanism in power modules, a generalized first-order physics-of-failure based model has been developed to quantify these flexural/bending stresses. A variational calculus approach has been employed to determine the minimum energy wire profiles. The difference in curvatures corresponding to the wire profiles before and after thermal cycling provide the flexural stresses. The stresses/strains determined from the load transformation model are then used in a damage model to determine the cycles to failure. The model has been validated against temperature cycling test results. The effects of residual stresses, that are introduced during the loop formation, (on the thermal cycling life) of these wires also has been studied. It is believed that the ultrasonic wirebonding process renders the wires weaker at the heel. Efforts have been made to simulate the wirebonding mechanism using Finite element analysis. The key parameters that influence the wirebonding process are identified. Flexural stresses are determined for various heel cross-sectional profiles that correspond to different bond forces. Additional design constraints may prevent some of the wedge-bonded wires from being aligned parallel to the bond pads. The influence of having the bond pads with a non-zero width offset has been studied through finite element simulations. The 3 D minimum energy wire profiles used in the modeling has been obtained through a new energy minimization based model...|$|E

Front-loading HE washers represent about 90 % of the HE washing machine market in the US (Healthy House Institute 2010). Front-loading HE washers require less water for washing because the tub is typically filled only one-third or one-half full of water. These washers use the horizontal axis to create a tumbling action, rotating clockwise and counterclockwise to tumble the laundry items back and forth through a small pool of water. The rotating <b>motion</b> <b>flexes</b> the weave of the fabrics and forces water and detergent through each garment, removing soils with the use of less mechanical agitation than that used by conventional washers. Top-loading HE washers differ from the conventional top-loading type in that there is an agitating plate {{at the bottom of the}} tub instead of a vertical agitator midway between the top and bottom of the tub. The cleaning action occurs as the plate bounces the clothes in a small amount of water.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A novel {{physiological}} sensor {{which combines}} elec-trical and mechanical modalities is introduced. The electrical component behaves {{as a standard}} electrode and detects changes in bioelectrical potential, whereas the mechanical component comprises an electret condenser microphone with a thin and light diaphragm, making it sensitive to local mechanical activity but immune to global body movements. A key feature of the proposed sensor is that the microphone is positioned directly {{on top of the}} electrode component (co-location). In conjunction with co-located electromechanical sensing, the ability of the electrode to <b>flex</b> allows for <b>motion</b> to be detected at the same location where it corrupts the electrical physiological response. Thus, the output of the mechanical sensor can be used to reject motion-induced artifacts in physiological signals, offering improved recording quality in wearable health applications. We also show that the co-located electrical and mechanical modalities provide derived information beyond unimodal sensing, such as pulse arrival time and breathing, thus enhancing the utility of the proposed device and highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool.

40|$|Cervical {{misalignment}} after upper cervical fusion {{including the}} occipital bone may cause trismus or dysphagia, because the occipito-atlanto joint {{is associated with}} most of the <b>flex</b> and extended <b>motion</b> of the cervical spine. There are no reports of dysphagia and trismus after C 1 - 2 fusion. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate the potential risk of dysphagia and trismus even after upper cervical short fusion without the occipital bone. The patient was a 69 -year-old man with myelopathy caused by os odontoideum and Klippel-Feil syndrome, who developed dysphagia and trismus immediately after C 1 - 2 fusion and C 3 - 6 laminoplasty. Radiographs and CT revealed that his neck posture was extended, but his symptoms still existed a week after surgery. The fixation angle was hyperextended 12 days after the first surgery. His symptoms disappeared immediately after revision surgery. The fixation in the neck-flexed position is thought to be the main cause of the patientʼs post-operative dysphagia and trismus. Dysphagia and trismus may occur even after short upper cervical fusion without the occipital bone or cervical fusion in the neck-extended position. The pre-operative cervical alignment and range of motion of each segment should be thoroughly evaluated...|$|R
