25|$|Physician, anthropologist, {{historian}} Rudolph Carl Virchow’s {{attempt to}} control an outbreak of typhus in Upper Silesia and his subsequent 190 page report included the observation that {{the solution to the}} outbreak did not lie in <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> or small changes in housing, food or clothing provided, but rather in widespread structural changes that directly addressed the issue of poverty. Virchow’s experience in Upper Silesia led to the observation that “Medicine is a social science”. His report led to changes in German public health policy.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} options for {{treating}} balance disorders. One option includes {{treatment for a}} disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, neuromuscular conditions, acquired brain injury, cerebellar dysfunctions and/or ataxia, or some tumors, such as acoustic neuroma. <b>Individual</b> <b>treatment</b> will vary and will be based upon assessment results including symptoms, medical history, general health, {{and the results of}} medical tests.

25|$|The villa {{contained}} {{at least}} one substantial bath house, in the north-western wing. This included the latrine, which formed an L-shape around a dressing room (apodyterium). The dressing room led to the cold room (frigidarium) which contained a cold plunge bath and whose mosaic floor, decorated with a design of fish and sea creatures, is still well preserved under a modern protective building. This mosaic suggests an <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> of the standard sea animal and fish designs that circulated in copy books. The frigidarium had {{at least one}}, possibly two, plunge pools – {{one of these is}} now detached from the building owing to landslides.|$|E
25|$|Millais {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{respected}} of British ornithologists and bird artists, producing between 1890 and 1914 a series of books on birds and other natural history subjects. In the study of ornithology he was renowned for his portraiture of wildfowl and game birds, the subjects of his three most famous works: Natural History of British Feeding Ducks; British Diving Ducks and British Game Birds. They rank amongst the finest work on wildfowl ever published. Each bird receives <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> in text and detailed chromolithographs, some of which are by his friend and pre-eminent bird artist of the day Archibald Thorburn (1860–1935). Each species is represented by two or three individuals on a plate drawn in attitudes of feeding, resting and courtship.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the interaction of glibenclamide with methanolic extract of bark of Ficus glomerata Roxb. (FBME). Methods: The interaction was evaluated in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats using the parameters such as glucose tolerance test, acute and subacute levels of antidiabetic study and body weight estimations at various intervals. Glibenclamide was administered orally at two different doses of 300 µg/kg (low dose) and 600 µg/kg (high dose) and FBME was co-administered at the dose of 200 mg/kg. <b>Individual</b> <b>treatments</b> of above drugs were also carried out. Results: The combination therapy of glibenclamide and FBME showed significant (P< 0. 01) hypoglycemic effect compared to their <b>individual</b> <b>treatments</b> in the parameters studied and it also showed more percentage increase in body weight than the <b>individual</b> <b>treatments.</b> Conclusion: The present herb-drug interaction {{was found to be}} beneficial as it was observed that FBME showed synergistic effect with glibenclamide. This could provide an opportunity to reduce the dose of glibenclamide to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect with minimal side effects...|$|R
25|$|First-line {{treatments}} {{currently used}} include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference. Treatment initiation {{is guided by}} recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) {{and is based on}} detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable. Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> with entecavir or tenofovir.|$|E

60|$|We have {{to follow}} our reason as our sole guide in our <b>individual</b> <b>treatment</b> of all such things as food and health and sex. God is {{the king of the}} whole world, he is the owner of our souls and bodies and all things. He is not {{particularly}} concerned about any aspect, because he is concerned about every aspect. We have to make the best use of ourselves for his kingdom; that is our rule of life. That rule means neither painful nor frantic abstinences nor any forced way of living. Purity, cleanliness, health, none of these things are for themselves, they are for use; none are magic, all are means. The sword must be sharp and clean. That {{does not mean that we}} are perpetually to sharpen and clean it--which would weaken and waste the blade. The sword must neither be drawn constantly nor always rusting in its sheath. Those who have had the wits and soul to come to God, will have the wits and soul to find out and know what is waste, what is vanity, what is the happiness that begets strength of body and spirit, what is error, where vice begins, and to avoid and repent and recoil from all those things that degrade. These are matters not of the rule of life but of the application of life. They must neither be neglected nor made disproportionally important.|$|E
