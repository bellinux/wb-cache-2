In the territo-ries where the cadastral survey was completed (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, etc.) the outcomes were exploited for the military survey. Reduced and generalised planimetric content from the cadastral maps and cadastral triangulation was used to outline the planimetric content of the Second Military Survey. This assured an improved positional accuracy and better work econ-omy. The territory of Bohemia was surveyed between 1842 and 1853 (267 handwritten colour sections 1 : 28 800), Moravia and Silesia between 1836 and 1840 (146 handwritten colour sec-tions 1 : 28 800). Currently, the map originals are stored in the Vienna Military archive depart-ment of the Austrian State Archives. The aim of this contribution is to describe the methodology of altimetry and determination of heights displayed on the Second Military Survey maps of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia.

40|$|This paper investigates whether, {{and through}} which channel, the active use of credit {{derivatives}} changes bank {{behavior in the}} credit market, and how this channel was affected by the crisis of 2007 – 2009. Our principal finding is that banks with larger <b>gross</b> <b>positions</b> in credit derivatives charge significantly lower corporate loan spreads, while banks׳ net positions are not consistently related to loan pricing. We argue that {{this is consistent with}} banks passing on risk management benefits to corporate borrowers but not with alternative channels through which credit derivative use may affect loan pricing. We also find that the magnitude of the risk management effect remained unchanged during the crisis period of 2007 – 2009. In addition, banks with larger <b>gross</b> <b>positions</b> in credit derivatives cut their lending by less than other banks during the crisis and have consistently lower loan charge-offs.

40|$|The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has {{proposed}} methods for incorporating consideration of market risks [...] exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks [...] into risk-based capital standards for banks. This paper {{shows that the}} separate and seemingly different proposed approaches to the three sources of risk are consistent with one another, reflecting a single unifying theme. That theme is the measurement of risk through a weighting of two different measures of portfolio size, the <b>gross</b> <b>position</b> and the net position. A simple theoretical model demonstrates that such an approach {{can be viewed as}} a simple (specifically, an affine) approximation to a portfolio variance calculation based on the full variance-covariance matrix of market returns, and thus provides a reasonable basis for a practical approach to capital standards. An empirical test of one part of the framework, the proposal for exchange rate risk, shows that the approximation may be very accurate: the proposed Basle approach captures over 95 percent of the variation in foreign exchange risk across a sample of banks from the Twelfth Federal Reserve District.

Specifically, a telerobotic workstation is being designed for an Extravehicular Activity (EVA) anthropomorphic space station telerobot called Robonaut. Previous researchers have designed telerobotic workstations based upon performance of discrete subsets of tasks (for example, peg-in-hole, tracking, etc.) without regard for transitions that operators go through between tasks performed sequentially in the context of larger integrated tasks. The experiments presented here took an integrated approach to describing teleoperator performance and assessed how subjects operating a full-immersion telerobot perform during fine position and <b>gross</b> <b>position</b> tasks. In addition, a Robonaut simulation was also developed as part of this research effort, and experimentally tested against Robonaut itself to determine its utility.

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} international monetary evolution {{over the past}} two decades is that gross international asset positions have skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. The phenomenon is most evident for the high-income industrial countries, but even gross private foreign asset positions for emerging countries are on a generally rising trend. The best-known data on the phenomenon are those assembled by Philip Lane and Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, illustrated for a few countries in Chart 1. The chart shows the sum of gross foreign assets and liabilities divided by GDP. My thesis is that these ballooning gross positions, which of course reflect ballooning gross financial flows, have important implications for the functioning of the international monetary system. Some of these implications became painfully evident in the course of the global financial crises of 2007 - 10, but it has also become evident that economists’ knowledge of the determinants of gross financial flows and their repercussions is exceedingly slim. Relative to output, gross positions appear nonstationary based on the evidence to date, and most plausibly this is an artifact of rapid structural change. But we cannot predict with confidence when (or if) a stationary distribution of <b>gross</b> <b>position</b> ratios will emerge. Here is another area where mainstream macroeconomics has abstracted from real-world phenomena that are of first-order importance for economic stability and welfare. Falling political and technological barriers to international asset trade are of course consistent with the general trend, but we have few clues to explain asset positions that have quickly grown to multiples of GDP – far beyond what simple homogeneous-agent models of international risk sharing woul...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{navigation}} {{has been}} revolutionised {{with the advent}} of the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the deployment of differential GPS (DGPS) systems. While most of the precision requirements for marine navigation can now be met with DGPS, the reliability of the user's position is often ignored. The question that is usually unanswered when it comes to marine navigation is "What is the typical marine blunder behaviour?" This question is answered through marine multipath simulations. The wide correlator simulations had a 99. 9 % blunder limit of 43 m, while the narrow correlator was only 11 m. Double blunders also occurred during the simulations, however, the second blunder was less than 4 m (99. 9 % of the time). This suggests that significant blunders can occur. Software simulations were conducted to evaluate the availability and reliability improvements when DGPS is augmented with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), Galileo, geostationary satellites, and height, clock, and dynamic constraints under various masking environments. These simulations clearly demonstrated the advantage of augmenting DGPS with a second full constellation of satellites, especially under moderate to extreme masking conditions. The augmentation improvements are irrelevant if the user's receiver does not employ a real time reliability algorithm. Thus the reliability performance of four representative marine user receivers were tested using a DGPS signal simulator. None of the receivers tested employed a reliability algorithm. Although the higher end receivers mitigated the multipath blunders, <b>gross</b> <b>position</b> errors still occurred. A simple reliability algorithm was run in post mission to demonstrate that the blunders could have been detected. It is not good enough to augment DGPS, the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) {{has proven}} to be {{beneficial}} in reducing recovery time, infection, and post-operative pain, but is inherently difficult due to the constraint of a single incision. The difficulties can be mitigated by using in vivo robots that can be inserted through the incision, with multiple arms and a vision system used to accomplish surgical tasks. Once the robot is inserted, it needs to be positioned so that it can focus on the target surgical site. Currently, this is accomplished manually with a table mounted support clamp. This thesis outlines the motivation, design, and evaluation of a proposed 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) <b>gross</b> <b>positioning</b> arm built to provide automated orientation control of an in vivo surgical robot, enabling it to reach any quadrant of the abdomen without having to stop the procedure and reorient the robot, while also providing enough force and torque to hold the robot steady during surgery. The proposed design is much smaller than current <b>gross</b> <b>positioning</b> arms, which reduces crowding over the patient, while also providing intuitive control to the surgeon. In particular, this thesis proposes a novel control scheme, which provides control of the system without changing control modes. Experimental results from a standard peg-transfer test show the proposed design is capable of operating in all quadrants, while maintaining the stability of the in vivo robot, providing smooth motion as the surgeon operates. Experiments performed by a surgeon at the University of Nebraska Medical Center showed the system provided intuitive control while accessing all necessary quadrants for surgery.

40|$|A {{control scheme}} for the {{coordination}} of motion in a space-craft/manipulator system is presented. It is shown how end-effector motion can be decoupled from satellite motion, satellite rotation, or total system momentum by selecting suitable gen-eralized speeds for the satellite. The schemes are based on recursive calculation of kinematics and dynamics, and 12 degrees of freedom can be controlled without excessive com-putational effort. Feedback linearization and decoupling of end-effector motion and total system momentum are discussed in detail. The satellite controller can then be developed in-dependently of the manipulator controller, and reaction jets and momentum wheels are used only to reposition the satel-lite. The end effector can be controlled accurately with a high bandwidth, while a slow, <b>gross</b> <b>positioning</b> {{can be used for}} the satellite.

40|$|The {{secreted}} ligand Reelin {{is thought}} to regulate the translocation and positioning of prospective layer 6 (L 6) neurons into the preplate, a plexus of neurons overlying the ventricular zone. We examined wild type and Reelin-deficient cortices and found that L 6 neurons were equivalently positioned beneath the pia {{during the period of}} preplate splitting and initial cortical plate (CP) formation. The absence of detectable L 6 ectopia in “reeler” cortices at this developmental time point indicates that Reelin-signaling might not regulate L 6 neuron migration or <b>gross</b> <b>positioning</b> during preplate splitting. To explore the acute response of L 6 neurons to Reelin, subpial injections of Reelin were made into Reelin-deficient explants. Reelin injection caused L 6 neurons to orient their nuclei and polarize their Golgi toward the pia while initiating exuberant dendritic (MAP 2 +) outgrowth within 4 h. This rapid Reelin-dependent neuronal orientation and alignment created CP-like histology without any significant change in the mean position of the population of L 6 neurons. Conversely, subplate cells and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan immunoreactivity were found at significantly deeper positions from the pial surface after injection, suggesting that Reelin partially rescues preplate splitting within 4 h. Thus, Reelin has a direct role in promoting rapid morphological differentation and orientation of L 6 neurons during preplate splitting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper removes burrs and produces a consistent chamfer, even with fixture, part, and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for <b>gross</b> <b>positioning</b> of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) removes burrs by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the fixture, part, and robot errors. In the second pass, chamfer depth variations are smoothed out using chamfer control, where chamfer depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time chamfer depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded chamfer depth. The chamfer depth estimator removes repeatable fixture, part, and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on edges with burrs show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and chamfer control was able to produce a consistent chamfer depth.

40|$|Among {{the most}} vexed moral issues in {{contemporary}} conflict {{is the matter}} of whether irregular forces waging wars of national liberation should be expected to abide by the same jus in bello rules as state actors, even though these rules may prejudice their cause. Is it, in other words, reasonable to demand that irregular forces, including guerrilla groups and national liberation movements, should comport themselves like state armies, even in cases where this would stymie their capacity to effectively pursue their military goals? This article examines Michael Gross’s recent provocative response to this question. Taking Article 44 of the 1977 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions as his point of departure, Gross contends that the laws governing battlefield conduct should be revised to allow irregular forces waging an otherwise just war greater leeway to pursue their cause. Controversially, he extends this concession to the use of qualified terrorist tactics.
