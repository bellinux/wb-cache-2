5|$|The High Seas Fleet {{managed to}} punch through the British light forces without drawing the {{attention}} of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Markgraf went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large <b>floating</b> <b>dock.</b> Repair work was completed by 20 July. In {{the course of the}} battle, Markgraf had fired a total of 254 shells from her main battery and 214 rounds from her 15cm guns. She was hit by five large-caliber shells, which killed 11 men and wounded 13.|$|E
5|$|However, no {{progress}} was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from May through September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The High Seas Fleet {{managed to}} punch through the British light forces without drawing the {{attention}} of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. Off Helgoland, Grosser Kurfürst had taken in so much water that {{she was forced to}} reduce speed. She fell out of formation, but later rejoined the fleet outside the Schillig roadstead. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Grosser Kurfürst went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large <b>floating</b> <b>dock.</b> Repair work was completed by 16 July. In the course of the battle, Grosser Kurfürst fired a total of 135 shells from her main battery and 216 rounds from her 15cm guns. She was hit by eight large-caliber shells, which killed fifteen men and wounded ten.|$|E

5|$|The next raid on Singapore {{took place}} in January 1945. Following reports that Japanese {{warships}} damaged during the Philippines Campaign were being repaired at Singapore, a force of 47 Superfortresses was dispatched from India to attack the AdmiraltyIX <b>Floating</b> <b>Dock</b> {{as well as the}} King's Dock on the island's south coast. These aircraft took off at about midnight on 10January and began to arrive over Singapore at 08:20 on 11January. Only 27 of the attackers struck the docks, and due to heavy anti-aircraft fire from Japanese warships in the Straits of Johor the bombers did not cause any damage. The other aircraft bombed Penang in Malaya, Mergui in Burma and several targets of opportunity, generally without success. Two B-29s were lost during this operation.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety jetties unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a <b>floating</b> <b>dock,</b> which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, with stock prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{seaplane}} service only operated {{and carried}} out maintenance from a specially adapted <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> known as HMS Flat Iron. This <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> was able to submerge and allow two seaplanes to navigate onto it and then raise itself back up to allow for complex maintenance. During the 1930s the Royal Air Force improved RAF Pembroke Dock by the installation of two 'B' and one 'T' hangar and in 1938, the <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> was towed to Invergordon as it was redundant. In 1935, the first spillway was constructed which allowed aircraft {{to be removed from}} the water whatever the tide. During this period, Sir Arthur Travers Harris (Bomber Harris) was the Officer Commanding RAF Pembroke Dock and 210 Squadron as a Wing Commander.|$|E
25|$|In 1903 the Morse Works {{completed}} its floating dry dock. The company's principle asset, and worth {{several hundred thousand}} dollars, it was at time of completion the world's only electrically-equipped <b>floating</b> <b>dock,</b> {{as well as being}} the first fitted with centrifugal pumps, the first powered by A/C induction motors and the first with an auxiliary pumping system. The 15,000-ton capacity facility would later prove itself capable of lifting three times the annual tonnage of any other <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> in the country.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Substation Curaçao {{purchased}} Chapman {{to refurbish}} her and modify her {{for use as}} a seagoing mothership for the deep-diving scientific and tourist submarine Curasub. Modifications involved the installation of amenities for embarked scientists and tourists and of a 110-ton knuckle boom crane on Chapmans after deck to launch and retrieve both the submarine and its <b>floating</b> <b>dock,</b> both of which can be carried on Chapmans after deck. During submarine operations, the <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> is lowered over the side and secured to Chapman so that Curasubs passengers have an easy and convenient way to embark on and disembark from the submarine without the danger of launching Curasub into the water with them already aboard; Curasub also is lowered over the side and operates from the <b>floating</b> <b>dock,</b> which includes a docking cradle for the submarine. Chapmans redesign also made provision for the temporary installation of two 20-foot (6.1-meter) intermodal containers, one configured {{for use as a}} wet laboratory and the other for use as a dry laboratiory, which can be carried on her deck when needed for the support of embarked scientists and stored ashore during tourist use of Curasub.|$|E

25|$|As {{the size}} of ships still grew, the old dry dock started to be again too short. Although {{extending}} the length by another 3.5 metres helped, the dock was outdated. Neither the depth and width were sufficient any more for docking of modern icebreakers, such as Jääkarhu. In 1930 the state installed a commission which made an estimate about the required docking capacity for navy and merchant ships. The commission suggested in its report enlarging and refurbishing the docking facilities in Hietalahti and ordering a <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> with capacity of 2,750 tonnes. Politicians and businessmen of Turku lobbied the state for getting a dry dock there to the local Crichton-Vulcan yard, which also belonged to Kone ja Silta. Finally in 1933 the state gave 1,5 million marks subsidies to Crichton-Vulcan for the new dry dock and Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works got 2.4 million marks for a <b>floating</b> <b>dock,</b> which was built in Turku because of employment reasons. The <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> was delivered in December 1933 and its cost was 6,000,000 marks. The first ship to be docked in it was FÅA's Ilmatar. In August 1933 the state gave a three million mark loan for enlarging and modernising the dry dock in Hietalahti. In the meantime the company invested on new pipe and boiler workshops, machinery and 75-tonne crane, the total sum of investments reaching 20,000,000 marks.|$|E
25|$|Smaller aircraft, {{such as the}} Ju 52 and Sealands, docked as a <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> at the quay. The Sandringhams {{were too}} large for this, and docked at a buoy in the bay. The airport {{operated}} a boat which ferried passengers and cargo {{to and from the}} aircraft. There was a small terminal building on the quay, which was run by DNL. The airlines also organized bus transport to the city center.|$|E
25|$|The {{water aerodrome}} was {{physically}} located at two different {{locations in the}} bay of Nørvevika. The first was named Nørvevik and the second Sørneset. Sørneset is a headland situated {{on the island of}} Nørvøya, between the Nørvevika and Nørvesundet. The water aerodrome consisted of a buoy, a slipway, a hangar and a barracks used for offices. In addition there was a small <b>floating</b> <b>dock.</b> From 1966 the aerodrome also featured a helipad.|$|E
50|$|HYC's {{location}} on Neptune Island in New Rochelle's Lower Harbor provides the club {{with one of}} the most sheltered harbor facilities on Long Island Sound. The club has the best berthing facilities on the Sound. The channel has a twelve-foot depth, Davenport Neck and Glen Island form natural protection from all winds. The marina has slips for some sixty yachts, currently with lengths of 22 to 60 feet. The club also has a number of <b>floating</b> <b>docks.</b> The four <b>floating</b> <b>docks</b> to the west of the Glen Island Bridge have fixed pilings and water, and the two larger docks to the west have electricity. There are additional <b>floating</b> <b>docks</b> to the east of the bridge which have water. During the season the docks are reached by tender service. In addition to <b>floating</b> <b>docks,</b> there are a number of moorings to the east of the bridge that are also serviced by the Club’s tender. The Club has a 30-ton Travilift and a crane to haul yachts and step masts. The Club offers wet or dry winter storage and Club members are allowed to work on their own yachts while observing proper rules.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} route {{was taken over}} by Norwegian Air Lines. They had received a monopoly on all air services and bought a controlling stake in Widerøe. DNL introduced the eleven-passenger Junkers Ju 52 on the route, which ran from Oslo via Arendal, Kristiansand, Stavanger and Haugesund to Bergen. For this the simple buoy would no longer suffice, and the port authority commenced planning of a proper water aerodrome. As an interim solution a <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> was installed.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, Chase began {{service on}} special boards of {{engineers}} for examination of various improvements, including Florida Reef in 18441845; the Gulf frontier of Mississippi and Texas in 1845; briefly, the Atlantic Coast Defenses in 1848; the Memphis Tennessee Navy Yard in 1851; the <b>floating</b> <b>dock</b> and other improvements at the Pensacola Navy Yard in 1851; the United States Custom House at New Orleans in 1851; and the Passes of the Mississippi River and Harbor at Lake Pontchartrain in 1852.|$|E
25|$|As the {{increased}} traffic caused {{the need for}} a permanent aerodrome, Haugesund Municipality approved the construction of such a facility in 1935.
