5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success.

The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare muscle activity levels of the lumbar and rectus femoris muscle when <b>entering</b> <b>and</b> exiting RV and passenger vehicles. Background: Three varieties of RVs and two varieties of passenger vehicles were selected for this study. Method: Twenty individual(10 male and 10 female) in their twenties and thirties with no chronic back pain or any other illness participated in this study. Participants performed <b>entering</b> <b>and</b> exiting the three models of RVs and two models of passenger cars. Appropriate rest time was given to participants between <b>entering</b> <b>and</b> exiting each vehicle in order to recover from muscle fatigue while performing their tasks. Results: Results from this study show that muscle activity levels were highest for <b>entering</b> RVs <b>and</b> exiting passenger vehicles. There were no significant differences in muscle activity levels for left and right side muscles in regards to <b>entering</b> <b>and</b> exiting vehicles. Application...|$|R

5|$|The {{immediate}} {{reason why}} these ships were ordered was for local coast defence {{during the war}} scare during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, but they were chosen for several other reasons. They were small and cheap, and their shallow draft was thought to limit them to defensive operations, which appealed to economy and defence-minded Members of Parliament. The Admiralty, however, envisioned them attacking shallow-water ports that larger ironclads could not <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> operating in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|The river otter, {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.|$|E

5|$|Transmembrane {{proteins}} {{can also}} serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules to <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> exit the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for {{only one of the}} two ions.|$|E

5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to <b>enter,</b> <b>and</b> see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players are rewarded with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl.

The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their Lebanese passport to <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the Lebanese Government upon demand.|$|E
