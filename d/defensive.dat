5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma <b>defensive</b> {{coordinator}} Brent Venables made some major changes to the <b>defensive</b> depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} the <b>defensive</b> line against Washington. The starters at <b>defensive</b> tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game against Washington after a missed tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at <b>defensive</b> tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved {{off the top of the}} depth chart as well.|$|E

Replacing Tresey is Virginia <b>defensive</b> coordinator Bob Diaco.|$|E
5|$|Linebackers line {{up behind}} the <b>defensive</b> line but {{in front of the}} <b>defensive</b> backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the <b>defensive</b> leaders and call the <b>defensive</b> plays. Their diverse roles include {{defending}} the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.|$|E

5|$|The Aggies' {{defense was}} led by first-year <b>defensive</b> {{coordinator}} Mark Snyder, {{who had been a}} head coach at Marshall and <b>defensive</b> coordinator for Ohio State. Their leading tackler was junior <b>defensive</b> lineman Damontre Moore, who achieved first-team All-SEC accolades during the regular season and declared early to enter the 2013 NFL Draft, where he {{is considered one of the}} top prospects, and was the second overall pick in Todd McShay's initial mock draft.|$|E

5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never in head coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star <b>defensive</b> end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins <b>defensive</b> coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame <b>defensive</b> lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E
5|$|After the 2011 season, Edsall fired {{both his}} {{offensive}} coordinator Gary Crowton and his <b>defensive</b> coordinator Todd Bradford.

However, head coach John Blake failed to achieve a winning record for a third straight year and subsequently, the entire staff was fired. Ryan served as <b>defensive</b> coordinator at Kansas State for a month in 1999 under head coach Bill Snyder.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with <b>defensive</b> mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. <b>Defensive</b> mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in <b>defensive</b> mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In <b>defensive</b> mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E

Outside of these brief stints as a starter, Allemang served as a back-up for both the offensive and <b>defensive</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{worked for}} the NFL Network, Sky Sports NFL, and the Big Ten Network as a game-day analyst in the years {{following}} his retirement from football. He also co-hosted the radio broadcast Inside the Trenches with former NFL <b>defensive</b> linemen R-Kal Truluck and Lance Legree.

Virginia Tech's leading <b>defensive</b> player was safety Eddie Whitley, who had ninetackles and two pass breakups. Tech's Davon Morgan and Jeron Gouveia-Winslow were {{responsible}} for the only turnovers in the game; each had one interception. Gouveia-Winslow’s 24-yard interception return for a touchdown was the second such score in an ACC Championship Game. On {{the opposite side of the}} ball, Nigel Bradham's <b>defensive</b> two-point conversion was only the fifth in all of college football during the 2010 season. Florida State received no penalties during the game, and Virginia Tech received only four. The fourpenalties were the fewest in an ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of <b>defensive</b> structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use {{camouflage}} to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other <b>defensive</b> adaptations and strategies.|$|E
