25|$|Maize {{breeding}} in prehistory {{resulted in}} large plants producing large ears. Modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties {{in their fields}} and then sold seed to other farmers. James L. Reid {{was one of the}} earliest and most successful developing Reid's Yellow Dent in the 1860s. These early efforts were based on mass selection. Later breeding efforts included ear to row selection, (C. G. Hopkins ca. 1896), hybrids made from selected <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> (G. H. Shull, 1909), and the highly successful double cross hybrids using 4 <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> (D. F. Jones ca. 1918, 1922). University supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids. (Ref Jugenheimer Hybrid Maize Breeding and Seed Production pub. 1958) by the 1930s, companies such as Pioneer devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development. Internationally important seed banks such as International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the US bank at Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign maintain germplasm important for future crop development.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of mega-telomeres varies between species. For example, human chromosomes {{do not have}} mega-telomeres while mice and many species of birds do. There is also variation in their structure and location within the same species. In mice and birds, mega-telomeres regions are observed to be hypervariable, meaning {{that there is a}} high degree of polymorphism in the size and position of mega-telomeres between individuals, including those of highly <b>inbred</b> <b>lines.</b> Analysis of siblings from highly inbred chicken-lines have suggested that these ultra-long telomeric sequences are extremely heterogenous. Similar observations of heterogeneity have also been made in mice.|$|E

To reduce this competition, seed producers can switch to non-durable hybrid seed production. In a two-period model, we investigate what {{is the impact of}} crop durability on self-production, pricing strategies and switching decision. We first study the pricing decisions and switching decisions of an <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> seed monopoly. Then, we analyze how the monopoly's behavior is affected by the entry of a hybrid seed producer. We also examine how the introduction of royalties on farmers who self-produce improves efficiency. Our main finding is that, for some constellation of costs, an <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> seed monopoly has an incentive to produce technologically dominated hybrid seed in order to extract more surplus from farmers. Along the same <b>lines,</b> an <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> monopoly has an incentive to let a hybrid seed producer enters the market for discrimination purposes. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

This is due to poor resolution of QTL analysis. The solution for this problem would be production of recombinant chromosome substitution line, or stepped aligned recombinant <b>inbred</b> <b>lines.</b> Here, backcrossing is carried out until a desired level of recombination has occurred and genetic markers are used to detect desired recombinant chromosome substitution lines in the target region, which can be fixed by doubled haploidy.

In this report we describe: (a) the development of a selection system using this near isogenic line of L. gibba; (b) techniques for chemical mutation of the lines and selection for [alpha]-methyltryptophan resistance; and (c) the partial characterization of the selected lines. MTR lines contained 3 -fold higher levels of anthranilate synthase activity. The enzyme in the MTR lines required higher levels of tryptophan for feedback inhibition.

This will cause an overall decline in population and trait value, but then increase to a trait value that is equal to or greater than the trait value in the original population.

The <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> BT, rather susceptible in the field, showed a higher percentage infection, a higher sporulation density, a shorter latent period and less reduced hypocotyl length than <b>inbred</b> <b>line</b> FU, which showed a greater resistance in the field.

Dr. Beal's work led to the first published account of a field experiment demonstrating hybrid vigor in corn, by Eugene Davenport and Perry Holden, 1881. These various pioneers of botany and related fields showed that crosses of <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> made from a Southern dent and a Northern flint, respectively, showed substantial heterosis and outyielded conventional cultivars of that era. However, at that time such hybrids could not be economically made on a large scale for use by farmers. Donald F. Jones at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven invented the first practical method of producing a high-yielding hybrid maize in 1914-1917. Jones' method produced a double-cross hybrid, which requires two crossing steps working from four distinct original <b>inbred</b> <b>lines.</b> Later work by corn breeders produced <b>inbred</b> <b>lines</b> with sufficient vigor for practical production of a commercial hybrid in a single step, the single-cross hybrids. Single-cross hybrids are made from just two original parent inbreds. They are generally more vigorous and also more uniform than the earlier double-cross hybrids.
