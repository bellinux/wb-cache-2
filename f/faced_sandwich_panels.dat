40|$|Confusion, {{misleading}} terminology and classification Some {{manufacturers of}} insulation boards and sandwich panels use ill-defined terms implying fire safety to their products {{for marketing purposes}} – terms such as inflammable, fireproof, self extinguishing, equivalent to non-combustible, and recently firesafe. To the unwary specifier a term like Firesafe might suggest that the product is inorganic or non-combustible or will not contribute heat or smoke to a developing fire. PIR and phenolic foams may have better fire properties than PUR foam or polystyrene foam (expanded or extruded). However, both PIR and phenolic foams, like all plastics, are derivatives of the petrochemical industry {{and so it is}} not surprising that these materials can, in the event of a fire, contribute to fire. If materials become involved in ‘flashover ’ they can contribute significant amounts of heat, together with toxic smoke; The recently approved product standard for metal <b>faced</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> EN 14509 [1] does not make the distinction between the fire properties of panels any easier.

40|$|Sandwich panels {{comprise}} a thick, light-weight plastic foam such as polyurethane, polystyrene or mineral wool sandwiched between two relatively thin steel faces. One or both steel faces may be flat, lightly profiled or fully profiled. Until recently sandwich panel construction in Australia {{has been limited}} to cold-storage buildings {{due to the lack}} of design methods and data. However, in recent times, its use has increased significantly due to their widespread structural applications in building systems. Structural sandwich panels generally used in Australia comprise of polystyrene foam core and thinner (0. 42 mm) and high strength (minimum yield stress of 550 MPa and reduced ductility) steel faces bonded together using separate adhesives. Sandwich panels exhibit various types of buckling behaviour depending on the types of faces used. Three types of buckling modes can be observed which are local buckling of plate elements of fully profiled faces, flexural wrinkling of flat and lightly profiled faces and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled faces due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. To study the structural performance and develop appropriate design rules for sandwich panels, all these buckling failure modes have to be investigated thoroughly. A well established analytical solution exists for the design of flat <b>faced</b> <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels,</b> however, the design solutions for local buckling of fully profiled sandwich panels and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled sandwich panels are not adequate. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. The first phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses of 50 foam-supported steel plate elements to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels made of thin steel faces and polystyrene foam core covering a wide range of b/t ratios. The current European design standard recommends the use of a modified effective width approach to include the local buckling effects in design. However, the experimental and numerical results revealed that this design method can predict reasonable strength for sandwich panels with low b/t ratios (< 100), but it predicts unconservative strengths for panels with slender plates (high b/t ratios). The use of sandwich panels with high b/t ratios is very common in practical design due to the increasing use of thinner and high strength steel plates. Therefore an improved design rule was developed based on the numerical results that can be used for fully profiled sandwich panels with any practical b/t ratio up to 600. The new improved design rule was validated using six full-scale experiments of profiled sandwich panels and hence can be used to develop safe and economical design solutions. The second phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses on lightly profiled sandwich panels to study the mixed mode buckling behaviour due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. The current wrinkling formula, which is a simple modification of the methods utilized for flat panels, does not consider the possible interaction between these two buckling modes. As the rib depth and width of flat plates between the ribs increase, flat plate buckling can occur leading to the failure of the entire panel due to the interaction between local buckling and wrinkling modes. Experimental and numerical results from this research confirmed that the current wrinkling formula for lightly profiled sandwich panels based on the elastic half-space method is inadequate in its present form. Hence an improved equation was developed based on validated finite element analysis results to take into account the interaction of the two buckling modes. This new interactive buckling formula can be used to determine the true value of interactive buckling stress for safe and economical design of lightly profiled sandwich panels. This thesis presents the details of experimental investigations and finite element analyses conducted to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. It includes development and validation of suitable numerical and experimental models, and the results. Current design rules are reviewed and new improved design rules are developed based on the results from this research...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Different {{detailed}} {{finite element}} model alternatives are developed {{to come up with}} the most reliable {{finite element model}} of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel,</b> with the actual honeycomb core geometry, to evaluate the existing equivalent continuum models of aluminum honeycomb cores. Finite element models of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with effective elastic constants of the honeycomb core are generated based on the existing continuum models of the honeycomb core. The evaluation of the effective elastic constants of honeycomb cores is based on the comparison of the total reaction forces, calculated by both finite element models, on the supported <b>faces</b> of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> due to different in-plane and out-of-plane uniform input displacements applied to the faces of the panels.

40|$|Sandwich structures, {{which are}} made of metal face sheet and foam core, are widely been used in various {{industries}} due to their excellent energy absorption and impact resistance properties. Recently, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites {{have been used in}} the fabrication of <b>face</b> sheets of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> due to their high specific strength and stiffness properties. The usage of hybrid FRP composite laminate is still new and few researches were found in this area.

This research is aimed to determine the damage resistance and damage tolerance of hybrid FRP-aluminium foam <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel.</b> Damage resistance refers to the resistance of a material to damage when it is subjected to impact loading and damage tolerance is the ability of a material or structure to perform safely after damage.

The unsteady pressure generated by the explosion and acting on the <b>face</b> of the <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> includes the effect of the pressure wave transmission through the core. Its implications on the structural time-histories as corresponding to the underwater and in-air explosions are put into evidence.

In this sense, one of its major implications is the possibility to capture interactively the global and local (wrinkling) dynamic response of the panel. It is shown that implementation of the structural tailoring technique in the face sheets can constitute an important mechanism for enhancing the dynamic load-carrying capacity of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> when exposed to blast pulses. Effects of the core, the composite architecture of face sheets, orthotropy of the material of the core, geometrical nonlinearities, initial geometric imperfection, and the damping ratio are investigated, and their implications for the dynamic response are highlighted.

The main objective of this work was to study the resistance of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> with different aluminium honeycomb cores, air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> (no core between the two face sheets) and monolithic plates of equivalent mass subjected to impact from foam projectiles. The deformation and the elastic spring-back of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates have been compared and discussed. The resistance of the panels and plates has been quantified by their back-face deflection with respect to the projectile impulse. Five different types of aluminium honeycombs have been used as the core material. The front-face sheet and the back-face sheet of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are made of aluminium plate with 1 mm thickness. Cylindrical ALPORAS aluminium foams with a relative density between 9 % and 11 % are employed as the metal foam projectiles. They are fired at several hundred metres per second towards the centre of the panels and plates using a gas gun. The deflection histories of the back-face have been measured using a laser displacement sensor. From the deflection histories, the maximum deflection and the final deflection of the back-face can be distinguished. Deformation modes and failure modes of the individual component have been observed and classified into several categories. Moreover, the deflections of the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> have been compared with deflections from air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels.</b> It is found that the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> outperform both the air <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and the monolithic plates within an impulse range of 2. 25 kNsm(- 2) similar to 4. 70 kNsm(- 2). Outside this operational range, the advantages associated with employing the honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> as a protective structure upon impact of foam projectiles diminishes.

The trapezoidal sheet or roof <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> fastened to thin-walled cold-formed purlins {{can be used}} as the building envelopes. In this paper the questions of numerical analysis of thin-walled Z-purlins in the coverings made of <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> are studied. Numerical analyses are performed in the program MSC. NASTRAN. A full scale model of the roof with purlins and <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> is considered. Numerical analyses are based on the laboratory experiments. Results of described analyses are compared with the results of tests. These researches are done to investigate a behavior of the roof system consisted of Z-purlins and <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> and to develop a correct finite element model for the design of cold-formed purlins supported by <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Physical {{testing of}} {{composite}} <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> in three point bending is {{an increasingly important}} aspect of qualifying a composite monocoque for Formula SAE competition. Required stiffness and strength values have increased {{over the past three}} years, and more of the monocoque's laminates must be tested as well. As a result, {{there is a need for}} software to accurately design a <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> to meet stiffness and strength requirements on the first physical test, without requiring redesign and multiple tests. In this thesis, a method for calculating strength and stiffness of a composite <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> is presented. Extensive physical testing is performed on <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> typical of those found in a Formula SAE monocoque, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method. The Formula SAE rules are examined in depth to determine how the physical testing results are used to determine if a monocoque is legal for competition. This understanding of the rules, combined with the method developed for calculating <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel</b> performance, is used to develop a <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Panel</b> Design Tool. This tool allows the user to design a <b>sandwich</b> <b>panel,</b> predict the physical test results for that panel, and then determine if the panel will meet the rules requirements...|$|R
40|$|Investigation of {{mechanical}} property for paper honeycomb sandwich composite under different temperature and relative humidity Dong-Mei Wang 1, Jun Wang 2 and Qiang-Hua Liao 3 The influence of temperature and relative humidity on the moisture content of paper honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> was studied, and the ideal three-dimensional diagram between the moisture content of paper honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> {{and the temperature}} and relative humidity was constructed by the GAB model. The evaluation equation of critical stress and plateau stress were obtained. The {{results indicate that the}} moisture content of paper honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> rises with the increase of relative humidity and declines with the increase of temperature; as the moisture content increases, the critical stress and plateau stress of paper honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> decline linearly; with the increase of the moisture content, the energy absorption of paper honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> increased firstly and then decreased; the evaluation equation of critical stress and plateau stress can predict the mechanical properties of paper honeycomb <b>sandwich</b> <b>panels</b> in different temperatures and relative humidities...|$|R
