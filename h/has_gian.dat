60|$|He was not long, however, in {{learning}} that grounds were wanting for such fears as he <b>had</b> entertained. <b>Gian</b> Maria received him {{with even more}} than wonted welcome, for he laid much store by Francesco's judgment and was in sore need of it at present.|$|R

60|$|And yet {{greater than}} this horror they were {{preparing}} {{for him was}} the horror of losing his immortal soul by a breach of the solemn oath he <b>had</b> sworn. <b>Gian</b> Maria turned from him, at last, to his bravi, who now entered silently and with the air of men who knew the work expected of them. Martino mounted the bed, and swung for an instant from {{the framework of the}} canopy.|$|R

However, the rest of the cast had to be dubbed by other actors, including Ferzetti, who was dubbed by actor Bernard Grant (who is believed to <b>have</b> voiced <b>Gian</b> Maria Volontè and Aldo Giuffrè in the Dollars Trilogy), and Claudia Cardinale, who was voiced by Grant's wife, Joyce Gordon.|$|R

60|$|Whilst {{watching}} and directing the men, {{he kept his}} ears open for the message, and he heard the herald again recite the terms on which the garrison might surrender, and again the threat to hang every man from the castle-walls if they compelled him to reduce them by force of arms. He brought his message to an end by announcing that in his extreme clemency Gian Maria accorded them another half-hour's grace in which to resolve themselves upon their course. Should {{the end of that}} time still find them obstinate, the bombardment would commence. Such was the message that in another of his arrow-borne letters Gonzaga <b>had</b> suggested <b>Gian</b> Maria should send.|$|R

However, the Berlusconi III Cabinet, in the person of Senator Luigi Bobbio (National Alliance), introduced an amendment to the delegation of the reform of the judicial system (the so-called [...] "Reform Castelli"). According to the wording of the amendment, Caselli could no longer be appointed national anti-Mafia prosecutor for exceeding the age limit. The Constitutional Court, following the appointment of Peter Grasso as a new national anti-Mafia prosecutor, declared illegal the decision that the judge <b>had</b> ruled <b>Gian</b> Carlo Caselli from the competition.|$|R
5|$|Cosimo did {{not enjoy}} a {{harmonious}} relationship with his elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and his monthly allowance. Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, <b>had</b> no issue. <b>Gian</b> Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|R
5000|$|Basilica of San Martino, {{built in}} 1008 over the pre-Romanesque {{church of the}} Assunta. In 1482 it was remade in Lombard-Gothic style. The current façade, in the Baroque style, is from 1740. The {{interior}} <b>has</b> works by <b>Gian</b> Paolo Cavagna, Camillo Procaccini and other, but its most notable feature is the polyptych of Madonna with Saints by Bernardo Zenale and Bernardino Butinone (1485), {{considered one of the}} masterworks of 15th century Lombard art. The bell tower (a former civic tower) dates to the early 11th century. The bell tower is open and accessible every weekend.|$|R
60|$|Since {{it was the}} {{salvation}} of Babbiano that he aimed at, the Count of Aquila should <b>have</b> rejoiced at <b>Gian</b> Maria's wise resolve, and no other consideration should have tempered so encompassing a thing as that joy of his should have been. Yet, when later he left his cousin's presence, the only feeling that he carried with him was a deep and bitter resentment against the Fate that willed such things, blent with a sorrowing pity for the girl that was to wed his cousin and a growing hatred for the cousin who made him pity her.|$|R
50|$|In Florence from 1732 to 1735 Natter <b>had</b> as patron <b>Gian</b> Gastone de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, {{for whom}} he made a {{portrait}} of the Grand Duke himself, and one of Cardinal Alessandro Albani. In 1733 he made at Florence a portrait-medal of Charles Sackville, Earl of Middlesex. This is signed L. Natter F. Florent. Natter himself does not mention visiting the Netherlands, but he was patronised by William IV of Orange and his family, and made for them portraits in intaglio and portrait-medals. At this period Natter was attacked by Pierre-Jean Mariette in Traité des pierres gravées (1750), as a self-conscious forger.|$|R
60|$|The {{clouds of}} war were {{lowering}} heavily over Italy when Alexander came to St. Peter's throne, {{and it was}} his first concern to find for himself a safe position against the coming of the threatening storm. The chief menace to the general peace was Lodovico Maria Sforza, surnamed Il Moro,(1) who sat as regent for his nephew, Duke Gian Galeazzo, upon the throne of Milan. That regency he <b>had</b> usurped from <b>Gian</b> Galeazzo's mother, and he was now in a fair way to usurp the throne itself. He kept his nephew virtually a prisoner in the Castle of Pavia, together with his young bride, Isabella of Aragon, who had been sent thither by her father, the Duke of Calabria, heir to the crown of Naples.|$|R
50|$|His first {{marriage}} was to Isabelle of Valois, who brought him {{the title of}} comte de Vertus in Champagne, rendered in Italian as Conte di Virtù, the title by which he was known in his early career. A devoted father to his daughter Valentina (wife of Louis, Duke of Orleans and mother of the famous poet, Charles of Orleans), Gian Galeazzo reacted to gossip about Valentina at the French Court by threatening to declare war on France. The wife of King Charles VI of France was Isabeau of Bavaria, the granddaughter of Bernabò Visconti, and, thus, a bitter rival of Valentina and her father Gian Galeazzo Visconti.After Galeazzo's wife Isabelle died in childbirth in 1373, he married secondly, on 2 October 1380, his first cousin Caterina Visconti, daughter of Bernabò; with her he <b>had</b> two sons, <b>Gian</b> Maria and Filippo Maria.|$|R
500|$|By {{the time}} of the Spanish withdrawal, the Grand Duke was dying from [...] "an {{accumulation}} of diseases". One of his final acts was to order the erection of a statue of Galileo Galilei, who was patronised by his great-grandfather Cosimo II and his grandfather Grand Duke Ferdinando II, in the Basilica of Santa Croce. Anna Maria Luisa, the Dowager Electress Palatine, rushed to his bedside when it became apparent he would not recover. Gian Gastone could not eat anything, and his condition steadily worsened; Anna Maria Luisa subsequently had him moved to a clean bed. Worried for her brother's soul, the Dowager Electress <b>had</b> the irreligious <b>Gian</b> Gastone repent for his sins. On 9 July 1737, in the fourteenth year of his reign, the last Medicean Grand Duke expired. The Electress Anna Maria Luisa inherited all of the House of Medici's allodial possessions, but in accordance with the wishes of the great powers, Francis of Lorraine succeeded to the title Grand Duke of Tuscany.|$|R
5000|$|The poets of the Sicilian School usually {{composed}} in the Sicilian language. At {{a time when}} all the Italian languages were very similar, Tuscan copyists altered the Sicilan word endings and other orthographic conventions to produce Tuscanised texts. Stefano's canzone Pir meu cori alligrari, is the only work of the Sicilian School that is preserved in both Sicilian (which has five vowel sounds) and Tuscan (which <b>has</b> seven). <b>Gian</b> Maria Barbieri reported to have found it in a [...] "libro siciliano", probably an Occitan chansonnier from Sicily, and copied it. This copy was first printed in 1790 by Gerolamo Tiraboschi. The original has since been lost. Pir meu is written in coblas unissonans, with two feet of abC form and a sirma that is dDEeFF, followed by a tornada that is identical in structure. One of the central images in the piece is that of la dulzuri / chi fa la tigra in illu miraturi: [...] "the delight / that the tigress has in her own mirror". Stefano likens seeing his lady {{for the first time}} to this delight. This image was first employed in a canso of Rigaut de Barbezieux: the tigress is said to be enchanted by her own beautiful stripes and so be forget about the hunters that pursue her. The mirror image may also be used to structure the motifs of the poem, the second half being a motivic mirror-image of the first. While Pir meu is written in the standardised Sicilian of court poetry, the volgare (siciliano) illustre, the first stanza shows hints of the common tongue (siciliana-comune). Stefano's poem has been used, with varying degrees of liberty, to re-create Sicilian versions of the Tuscanised legacy of other Sicilian poets.|$|R
500|$|Định {{believed}} that Tự Đức would eventually realise his error and reward the insurgents. Historians {{feel that it}} is likely that Gian and Tự Đức saw Định's continued resistance as a misguided attempt to help the monarchy. In their written confrontation after the signing of the treaty, Gian did not accuse Định of being a rebel, but of excessive devotion to the emperor, which while admirable in principle, was hindering their current strategy. [...] "Monarchical loyalty is a noble quality", <b>Gian</b> <b>had</b> told the recalcitrant guerrilla leader, but [...] "t must have a limit. One cannot exceed this limit and still be faithful and pious. Too much is just as bad as not enough; when a snake begins to have legs, it is no longer a snake..." [...] Tự Đức also appeared to view Định's continued resistance as a misguided manifestation of loyalty. Although the southern insurgents' disobedience provided the French with a pretext for further aggression, thereby hindering Tự Đức's plans for regaining the lost territory, the emperor never accused them of rebelling against royal authority. Instead, he continued to refer to them as [...] "righteous recruits" [...] motivated by [...] "indignation" [...] at the actions of the Westerners.|$|R

Then Suneo can record everyday's weather and wind direction. Then Gian threatens Suneo and gets a share of his project. Nobita gets frustrated and blames Adam and Eve.|$|R
50|$|The Book of Breathing is {{the title}} of an ancient papyrus that {{revealed}} the exorcisms that enabled {{the souls of the}} dead to breathe in their crossing of the Realm of the Night. Gian, the novel’s protagonist, has undertaken the translation of this manuscript. He lives in Palo Alto, the capital of the IT corporate world, and is in love with Dalya, a woman distraught by bereavement over her older brother’s death. For the last several weeks, Dalya has been refusing herself to him. She has become the follower of a guru, J. J. Bernhard, who claims that his yoga discipline, centered on sexual abstinence, enables his pupils to stop the flow of time and suspend death. <b>Gian</b> <b>has</b> another rival in Dalya’s Japanese husband, Seto, an IT executive who dreams of immortalizing his own mind’s powers by means of some technological invention. In his frantic attempts to get Dalya back, Gian comes to realize that his actions follow one another like the tassels of a diabolic mosaic; it’s as if his willpower was dominated by the very secrets he is stealing from the Book of Breathing. In order to assuage Dalya’s mourning, he has undertaken to fit out the perfect tomb on the shores of the ocean, an empty tomb housing the ghost of her brother. It is from within this tomb that the shades of the night, invisible and inescapable, lead him to the destruction of his two rivals. In the end, Gian discovers that his struggle for Dalya’s heart and body is ruled by a ruthless and mournful love, a love that is not of this earth.|$|R
