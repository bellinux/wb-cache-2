A total of 122 Puerto Rican soldiers were among the 8,200 people listed as missing in action (MIA). This total does not include people of Puerto Rican descent who were born in the mainland of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricanes' ground {{offense was}} led by Smokey Roan, who carried the ball 16 times for 86 yards. Second to Roan for Miami was Chris Hobbs, who contributed 66 yards and a {{touchdown}} on 10 carries. Hurricanes wide receiver Larry Brodsky finished with four catches for 80 {{yards and a touchdown}}. Miami turned the ball over four times {{during the course of the}} game. Tech's 80-yard touchdown drive in the third quarter remains tied for the longest ever recorded by a Tech offense during a bowl game. Conversely, the 99-yard drive allowed to Miami remains the longest scoring drive Tech's <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> ever allowed in a bowl game.|$|E

25|$|Attorneys for Blagojevich {{appealed the}} former governor's conviction, citing issues of {{judicial}} bias by Zagel and a tainted jury pool. The <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> also long contended {{that there was}} critical evidence the jury never heard, including witness testimony and recorded phone calls that Zagel did not allow to be played during the trial. They have also argued that Blagojevich's own testimony was restricted by Zagel's rulings.|$|E

However, real military expenditures declined steadily after 1981 and the defense budget in 2011 was about 0.74% of GDP, a historical minimum, below the Latin American average.|$|E
25|$|The Detainee Treatment Act {{cited the}} U.S. Army's Field Manual on {{interrogation}} as the authoritative guide to interrogation techniques, {{but did not}} cite a specific edition of the Manual. The contents of the Manual are controlled by the Department of Defense, and thus the executive branch controls whether a given technique will be permitted or banned.

The company's history included originally making forged receivers for M14 rifles and briefly switching to investment casting. Smith stopped making receivers for a few years, but reentered the market with receivers machined from bar stock in 2002.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to continuing descriptive {{studies of the}} effects of infection by defense mutualist endophytes, there has been a sharp {{increase in the number of}} studies which delve further into the ecology of plant-fungus associations and especially their multi-trophic impacts. The processes by which endophytic fungi alter plant physiology and volatile chemical levels are virtually unknown, and limited current results show a lack of consistency under differing environmental conditions, especially differing levels of herbivory. Studies comparing the relative impacts of mutualistic endophytes on inducible defenses and tolerance show a central function of infection in determining both responses to herbivore damage. On the whole, molecular mechanisms behind endophyte-mediated plant <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> been an increasing focus of research over the past ten years.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi {{military}} blamed ISIL for {{the attack}} despite reports suggesting that its artillery may also have hit the neighborhood, saying that 61 bodies had been recovered {{at the site of}} a booby-trapped house which it described as “completely destroyed.” The statement added that “there is no hole or indication that was subjected to an air strike.” That account strongly contradicted much field reporting and the accounts of other officials. A provincial health official, for instance, told Reuters that wide swaths of the neighborhood were destroyed in fighting, “civil <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> extracted and buried 160 bodies up to this moment.” The Iraqi Civil Defense Department reported at least 137 bodies were recovered, but by 27 March, that number had risen to 531.|$|E
25|$|The <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> {{obtained}} city records {{showing that}} Moore {{was up to}} date in her rent payments. Prosecutors clarified that the dispute was not about the rent but rather a scheme by Bonie to increase those payments by coercing Moore to file false documentation that would have boosted her Section 8 subsidies. To bolster this theory, in late 2015 they subpoenaed the unedited footage from an interview Bonie gave to a local cable channel that had closely covered the case. The cable channel has vigorously opposed giving up the footage to the police. It is appealing the judge's decision requiring them to let him review footage and release relevant portions to the police. A month-long trial in July 2016 ended with the jury acquitting Bonie of murder charges but convicting him of the lesser included charge of manslaughter.|$|E

25|$|Márquez {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of being the oldest champion {{in the history of the}} lightweight division. On January 4, the WBA no longer recognized Márquez as their Super Champion due to going 18months without fighting a mandatory challenger as required by the organization's rules. Fernando Beltrán of Zanfer Promotions stated that the WBA's decision has no validity and that he would immediately send them a letter, since the deadline of May 2012 for the mandatory <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> not expired, and Márquez paid sanctioning fees to the WBA even for the last few non-lightweight fights. On January 26, Márquez was stripped of his WBO title, as he was considered to be moving up to the welterweight division. The WBO promoted Interim titleholder Ricky Burns to full champion status. The Ring magazine stripped of him of their championship on April 17.|$|E
25|$|Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was {{extended}} and modernized {{on a large}} scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the castle was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The landmark big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the Rhineland region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall. 1172 Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa visited Neuenburg Castle – the legend of the “living wall” of soldiers providing the best military <b>defense</b> <b>has</b> its roots in this legendary visit.|$|E
25|$|The Department of National Defense {{is working}} for the {{immediate}} delivery of at least 4 of the total 12 FA-50 fighter jets plans to purchase from South Korea. The Department of National <b>Defense</b> <b>has</b> begun negotiations with the Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI) while it is waiting for Malacañang's final approval of the sales agreement. It will be a government-to-government procurement that requires multi-year obligational authority from the Department of Budget and Management. After the confirmation of the sales agreement and the multi-year obligational authority from DBM, the formal negotiations can start and schedule the delivery of at least 4 fighter jets. The government is moving closer to acquiring 12 FA-50 fighter jets {{for the air force}} after the defense department’s Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) approved the terms of reference for the project. Once the terms of reference are approved with finality, the defense department could begin negotiations with the aircraft supplier, the state-run Korean Aerospace Industries (KAI). The negotiations are hoped to be finished by August. The negotiations were completed on Feb. 21, 2014. The Department of National Defense Special Bids and Awards Committee approved the offer of Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) in a meeting that was held in Camp Aguinaldo. On Mar. 28, 2014, it was announced by the state arms procurement agency of South Korea that South Korea signed a US$420 million contract Friday to export 12 FA-50 fighter jets built by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) to the Philippines under a government-to-government deal.|$|E
