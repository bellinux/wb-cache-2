50|$|<b>Seismic</b> {{reflection}} <b>exploration</b> {{grew out}} of the <b>seismic</b> refraction <b>exploration</b> method, which was used to find oil associated with salt domes. Ludger Mintrop, a German mine surveyor, devised a mechanical seismograph in 1914 that he successfully used to detect salt domes in Germany. He applied for a German patent in 1919 that was issued in 1926. In 1921 he founded the company Seismos, which was hired to conduct <b>seismic</b> <b>exploration</b> in Texas and Mexico, resulting in the first commercial discovery of oil using the refraction seismic method in 1924. The 1924 discovery of the Orchard salt dome in Texas led to a boom in <b>seismic</b> refraction <b>exploration</b> along the Gulf Coast, but by 1930 the method had led to the discovery most of the shallow Gulf Coast salt domes, and the refraction seismic method faded.|$|R

40|$|In <b>seismic</b> <b>exploration,</b> {{random noise}} deteriorates {{the quality of}} {{acquired}} data. This study analyzed existing denoising methods used in <b>seismic</b> <b>exploration</b> {{from the perspective of}} random noise. Wavelet thresholding offers a new approach to reducing random noise in simulation results, synthetic data, and real data. A modified wavelet threshold function was developed by considering the merits and demerits of conventional soft and hard thresholding schemes. A MATLAB (matrix laboratory) simulation model was used to compare the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and mean square errors (MSEs) of the soft, hard, and modified threshold functions. The results demonstrated that the modified threshold function can avoid the pseudo-Gibbs phenomenon and produce a higher SNR than the soft and hard threshold functions. A seismic convolution model was built using seismic wavelets to verify the effectiveness of different denoising methods. The model was used to demonstrate that the modified thresholding scheme can effectively reduce random noise in seismic data and retain the desired signal. The application of the proposed tool to a real raw seismogram recorded during a land <b>seismic</b> <b>exploration</b> experiment located in north China clearly demonstrated its efficiency for random noise attenuation...|$|R
