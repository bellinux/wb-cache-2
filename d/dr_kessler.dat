50|$|In 1964, the {{remainder}} of the NSSP moved to Norman, where it merged with WRL and was renamed the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). <b>Dr.</b> Edwin <b>Kessler</b> became the first director. In 1969, NSSL obtained a surplus 10-cm pulse-Doppler radar from the United States Air Force. This radar was used to scan and film the complete life cycle of a tornado in 1973. By comparing the film with velocity images from the radar, the researchers found a pattern that showed the tornado beginning to form before it could be visually detected on the film. The researchers named this phenomenon the Tornado Vortex Signature (TVS). Research using this radar led to NWS NEXRAD WSR-88D radar network during the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Gail Vance Civille, {{along with}} David Kessler, {{was interviewed by}} Ira Flatow for the NPR [...] program Science Friday in a segment {{entitled}} [...] "How Tasty Foods Change the Brain". In discussing <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kessler's</b> book [...] "The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite", Civille commented {{to the people who}} want to lose weight to take a product in the mouth and think about what the sensory properties are; what is the smell, what is the taste, what are the aromatics, what are the textural characteristics. She proposes that if they think hard and long about what they actually perceive, they will be less inclined to just go with the joy ride of the kick of the food and through thinking about what is perceived, they might actually eat less. [...] "We used to have foods that we chewed for 15, 20 or 30 times before we swallowed; it took more work to eat." [...] Today she says [...] "There is rarely a food out there, outside of a sweet chewy candy, you have to chew more than 12 times and it is gone; so, you're in for the next hit to get more pleasure." [...] She directed the radio audience to the value of the texture experience in food and the connection it has in the overall satisfaction of the consumer. In conclusion, she suggested [...] "eating fruits and vegetables in reasonable amounts because it's a good way to start losing weight; they are filling, they're satisfying and they're not going to give you the fat, sugar, salt hit over and over again." ...|$|R

Through the 1970s and 1980s, the institution continued to expand both in terms of patient capacity as well as outpatient facilities.|$|R
