25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> a seam allowance.|$|E

Suitable habitat would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> an area large enough to provide for foraging and nesting requirements, {{as well as provide}} for the microclimate (air temperature and humidity) needed by the Orthalicus reses reses. Preferences for edge or interior hammock have been observed in Liguus populations on Lignumvitae Key. Age-class differences were seen where older individuals were found in the central mature hammock, while younger individuals were found more often along the edges of the hammock. Tuskes (1981) suggested this may be an adaptation of younger snails to move to the edge to escape competition from older snails. It is not known whether Orthalicus reses reses prefer interior or edge hammock areas. Recent surveys of snails in the Key Largo populations have shown higher numbers of snails {{along the edge of the}} hammock than in the interior, but this result may be affected by the differences in visibility during surveying.|$|E

500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E
500|$|The ruling communist/military {{establishment}} {{slowly and}} gradually {{came to realize}} that a deal of some sort with the opposition would eventually be necessary and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> the leading Solidarity figures. Solidarity as such, a labor union representing workers' interests, was unable to reassert itself after the martial law and later in the 1980s was practically destroyed, but preserved in the national consciousness as a myth that facilitated social acceptance of systemic changes previously deemed unthinkable. The Solidarity organization as a mass movement, and with it its dominant social democratic element (supporters of democratic socialism), had been defeated. Solidarity's name had continuously been used, but the opposition movement split to form rival groups of different political orientations. According to a new intellectual consensus, [...] "democracy was grounded not in an active citizenry, as had been argued from the mid-1970s through 1981, but in private property and a free market". The current view no longer entailed broad political participation, emphasizing instead elite leadership and a capitalist economy. Solidarity became a symbolic entity, its activists openly assumed ideological [...] "anti-communist" [...] positions and its leadership moved to the right. Solidarity was now represented by a small number of individuals, of whom Lech Wałęsa, Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Leszek Balcerowicz were about to assume particularly decisive roles. They were proponents of unfettered free market, strongly influenced by the American and West European financial and other interests.|$|E
500|$|After {{discovery}} that Alleca and Brown would be releasing the album, Aguilera started developments {{to sue the}} pair {{in an effort to}} stop the release. Aguilera filed a suit against Warlock Records and the affiliates Platinum Recordings and JFB Music for [...] "improper use of her name and license on the upcoming album Just Be Free". Carla Christofferson, her lawyer at the time, explained that [...] "We're trying to stop them from releasing these early recordings which is not the quality she is associated with right now." [...] However, Warlock Records president Adam Levy felt that despite Aguilera disliking the material, he found it to be a look into her life at the time of recording. He stated [...] "It's a great look at what she was doing, We're pleased [...] I'm more pleased for the album's producers who wanted to get it out. I hope the fans can appreciate it." [...] Christofferson responded by alleging that Warlock Records tried to [...] "boot strap" [...] on Aguilera's success. In response to the lawsuit, Warlock Records filed their own lawsuit in an attempt to ensure the release of the record. During the proceedings, Aguilera agreed to let Warlock Records release Just Be Free after reaching a settlement with the company and its affiliates. [...] She allowed the release under the condition that the label would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> a letter written by Aguilera in each album released.

2500|$|A {{variation}} of the planar separator theorem involves edge separators, small sets of edges forming a cut between two subsets A and B of the vertices of the graph. [...] The two sets A and B must each have size at most a constant fraction of the number n of vertices of the graph (conventionally, both sets have size at most 2n/3), and each vertex of the graph belongs to exactly one of A and B. The separator consists of the edges that have one endpoint in A and one endpoint in B. Bounds {{on the size of}} an edge separator involve the degree of the vertices as well as the number of vertices in the graph: the planar graphs in which one vertex has degree n1, including the wheel graphs and star graphs, have no edge separator with a sublinear number of edges, because any edge separator would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>include</b> all the edges connecting the high degree vertex to the vertices {{on the other side of}} the cut.
