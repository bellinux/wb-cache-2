According to the most recent estimates, the basic enrolment rate was 41. 7 percent in 2002 compared with 37. 3 percent in 2001. These results are owing to the efforts of the government in recruiting volunteer teachers and building and equipping of classrooms. The government also adopted a national policy for higher education.

How do MENA countries compare with other comparable countries at similar levels of development with regard to their PFM systems and practices? What has been the substantive content and thrust of PFM reforms in MENA over the last decade? Where have these reforms done well, and where have they struggled? What were the key ingredients for success or failure? Are there lessons in how these reforms were implemented that will be of value to other countries and the donor community?

There is wide variation in scale and outcome of health care spending between African countries, with poorer countries tending to do worse than wealthier ones.

A reduction in gender inequality, especially in its more extreme forms, is also desirable from a human rights prospective. The World Bank’s Public <b>Expenditure</b> <b>Reviews</b> (PERs) offer a potentially important opportunity to further the reduction of gender inequality. The PER process might be used to advocate the desirability of making more room in the country’s budget for programs that would promote women’s employment, health, education, safety, productivity in the home and in the formal and informal economy. It might also promote a greater devotion of the country’s revenues to ostensibly gender-neutral infrastructure, such as piped clean water, that would make househol...|$|R

An initial analysis of environmental expenditures in the Indonesian government budget between FY 1994 / 95 and FY 1998 / 99 yields four basic findings. First, most spending in the nominal environmental sector, sector 10 (Environment and Spatial Planning), is on non-environmental activities, and much environmental expenditure occurs in other budget sectors. Second, environmental expenditures fell sharply in real terms during the economic crisis, to levels far below those in FY 94 / 95. Third, they also fell sharply relative to the budget and to GDP. Finally, environmental expenditures declined more in Indonesia during the economic crisis than in Malaysia, Thailand and Korea, relative to both the budget and GDP. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to project appraisal fail in practice to address two fundamental questions: whether a project {{belongs in the}} public or the private sector; and what effect any external assistance associated with the project has on the country's development. The first issue is of general interest to both national policymakers and international donors. If the government provides a good or service that {{would otherwise have been}} provided by the private sector, the net contribution of the public project could be low. The second issue is of particular concern to donors. If financial resources are fungible, the project being appraised might well have been undertaken without external financing. In this case, donor funds are actually financing some other, unappraised project. Both cases argue for a shift in the emphasis of project evaluation away from a concern with precise rate-of-return calculations and toward broader sectoral analyses and public <b>expenditure</b> <b>reviews.</b> In this context, three areas critical for proper project appraisal include a consideration of the rationale for public intervention, the fiscal impact of the project, and the fungibility of external assistance. ...|$|R
