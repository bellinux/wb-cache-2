5|$|In January 2013, {{construction}} {{added another}} 368 {{seats in the}} north endzone and two observation decks. The $11million project also includes a significantly upgraded jumbotron with a new sound system, a Spanish Renaissance-themed colonnade, and a north end zone concourse that connects the two stadium halves. Along with the other additions, 157feet of ribbon board will be added on the north end zone, more than 160 linear <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northeast and northwest corners of the stadium, and 94 lineal <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south end zone over the athletic offices. The construction was completed during the 2013 season. The stadium's capacity is 60,862, making it the third-largest on-campus stadium in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Males {{mark their}} territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes {{made by the}} <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground and twisted saplings also seem {{to be used for}} communication. Members of other rhino species have a {{peculiar}} habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} bout of the event, Jake O'Brien rebounded from two TKO losses {{in a row}} with a split-decision win over Christian Wellisch. O'Brien, a former wrestler at Purdue University, {{was able to take}} Wellisch down and control his {{opponent}} on the ground but was hurt on the <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first and second rounds. The judges saw it 29–28, 28–29 and 29–28 in favor of O'Brien. This was both fighters first fight at light heavyweight after dropping down from heavyweight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} bout, Shane Roller rebounded from three losses {{in a row}} with a {{unanimous}} decision victory over John Alessio.

5|$|After filming was {{completed}} in 1996 the commissioning network ITV shelved it for a year. It was eventually scheduled for broadcast {{on the evening of}} 30 March 1997, as part of the network's Comedy Premieres strand, but overrunning sports coverage delayed it for an hour. Ratings were low and critical reviews were minimal, but positive; critics enjoyed the comedy drama format and praised the writing and performances of the leads. Harries entered Cold <b>Feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Montreux Television Festival, where it was awarded the Rose d'Or, the festival's top prize, resulting in ITV quickly scheduling a repeat broadcast. At {{the end of the year}} it won the award for Best Comedy Drama (ITV) at the British Comedy Awards and the incoming director of channels ordered a full series, which ran for five successful years from 1998 to 2003.|$|E

50|$|One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave is {{the third}} {{independent}} studio album and fourth overall by American alternative rock musician Beck, released in June 1994 on K Records, an independent label. Like Stereopathetic Soulmanure, the album never charted; however, One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave strengthened Beck's critical reputation, arguably allowing him {{to break into the}} mainstream with Odelay <b>in</b> 1996. One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave shows a strong folk influence that is more pronounced than on his more eclectic-style albums of the time, Mellow Gold and Odelay. One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave was recorded prior to the release of his third album Mellow Gold, but was not released until after that album met with critical and commercial success.|$|R
5|$|After {{twenty years}} of career struggles and obscurity, Thelonious Monk had become a jazz star with a {{residency}} at the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. In his first stable job in years, he helped transform the small bar {{into one of the}} city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of Monk's music. His employment there was a result of an appeal by his manager Harry Colomby to the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to restore Monk's cabaret card. Monk was stripped of the card in 1951 when he was convicted of narcotics possession; he had refused to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police after they discovered Powell's glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> car of Powell's female companion.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi {{due to the}} latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi {{refused to}} touch Rama Rao's <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene in which his father drags him from the {{marriage}} hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad—the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley—to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., {{sustained}} winds remained below {{tropical storm}} force, though gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) as {{recorded by the}} National Academy of Science. Hurricane-force winds existed several hundred <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, with wind sensors {{on the top of}} tall buildings recording winds of 70 to 85mph (115 to 135km/h). Rainfall was minimal, amounting to around two inches across the district. A gauge on Wisconsin Avenue recorded a storm surge of 11.3feet (3.4m), and a gauge on a pier in the southwest portion of the district recorded a storm surge of 10.25feet (3.1m). Both observations were records, surpassing the previous observation set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane.|$|E

50|$|The {{show was}} based on the concept from the BBC series One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave, {{starring}} Richard Wilson and Annette Crosbie. David Renwick, the creator and writer of One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave, was listed as a consultant of Cosby. One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grave was notable for containing dark humor for a mainstream sitcom. The tone was significantly lightened for Cosby, although certain controversial scenes, such as a scene <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> lead character incinerates a live tortoise, albeit by accident, were recreated (though, in this version, with a turtle).|$|R
5|$|Moe's idea {{involved}} {{setting his}} bar on fire, which {{he ends up}} doing by accident as he realizes Renee has left. Meanwhile, Homer escapes jail by attacking Hans Moleman, who was delivering books to the inmates. He enters the burning bar to confront Moe, and the two start fighting. They are both soon rendered unconscious from smoke inhalation, but Barney appears and rescues them. The bar is completely destroyed, and during their reconciliation Homer promises to help Moe get back on his <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final scene, Homer has allowed Moe to relocate his bar to the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|Hughes then {{signed a}} multi-fight {{deal with the}} UFC. Hughes {{defeated}} Renzo Gracie, the 1st cousin once removed of his opponent at UFC 60, via third round TKO at , setting the record for most UFC wins with 17. Both of them seemed very comfortable fighting on their <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early going, with Gracie landing the cleaner and more effective punches and also landing a couple of kicks. Hughes started the second round with powerful leg kicks, but after that Gracie returned to his in-and-out punching style. Hughes got double underhooks and managed to take Gracie down briefly. In the final round Hughes connected with a right hook to Gracie's chin, then connected with a leg kick and another punch. With two minutes to go he knocked Gracie down with a leg kick. Gracie took {{all the time he}} could before Hughes helped him up and then dropped him with a second leg kick. Gracie stalled again, but when he finally stood up Hughes floored him with a punch, let him get up and then attacked again. Hughes knocked Gracie down again with a fourth punch, when referee Herb Dean ended it.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry. At , he was not especially large, but his speed and strength {{made him one of the}} team's featured players. John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbia’s football coach, claimed that he could always count on Payton when the team needed to score. Payton’s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia’s basketball team, leaped three-quarters of an inch short of 23 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long jump, played baseball, and continued to drum in the school band.|$|E

5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts as high as a maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E
5|$|These systems {{produced}} {{relatively large}} numbers of poorly armoured infantry, often armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill. There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of 15½ to 18½ <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later 15th century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, {{but this does not}} appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early 16th century. There were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield. Archers became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the 15th century to help counter the English superiority in this arm, becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the Garde Écossaise. Scottish men-at-arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry, with perhaps a small mounted reserve, and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English, leading to their successes in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
