2500|$|The 1930 census was {{the only}} one to cover Greater Romania. Censuses in 1948, 1956, 1966, 1977, 1992, 2002 and 2011 covered Romania's present-day territory. All but the 1948 census, which asked about mother tongue, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> on ethnicity. Moldavia and Wallachia each held a census in 1859. The Romanian Old Kingdom {{conducted}} statistical estimates in 1884, 1889 and 1894, and held censuses in 1899 and 1912. Ion Antonescu's regime also held two: a general one in April 1941, and one for those with [...] "Jewish blood" [...] in May 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Canby was {{generally}} regarded as a great administrator, but he was criticized as a soldier. Ulysses S. Grant thought him not aggressive enough. [...] At one time, Grant sent Canby an order to [...] "destroy [...] railroads, machine-shops, [...] " [...] Ten days later, Grant reprimanded him for requesting men and materials to build railroads. [...] "I wrote... urging you to... destroy railroads, machine-shops, , not to build them," [...] Grant said. Canby could be a destroyer but appeared to prefer the role of builder. Today, he might be considered a [...] "policy wonk" [...] because he was expert in policy and law. If someone <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> about army regulations or Constitutional law affecting the military, Canby was the man to see. Grant came to appreciate this in peace time, once complaining vigorously when President Andrew Johnson proposed to assign Canby away from the capital where Grant considered him irreplaceable.|$|E

He stated {{the remainder of the}} season was [...] "not going to be too different" [...] after enduring a difficult campaign over the past twelve rounds but that Ferrari was prepared [...] "It is the way at the moment but we cannot do anymore than this."

2500|$|For {{many years}} a popular myth has persisted {{that in the}} Japanese version of this film, Godzilla emerges as the winner. The myth {{originated}} {{in the pages of}} Spacemen magazine, a 1960s sister magazine to the influential publication Famous Monsters of Filmland. In an article about the film, it is incorrectly stated that there were two endings and [...] "If you see King Kong vs Godzilla in Japan, Hong Kong or some Oriental sector of the world, Godzilla wins!" [...] The article was reprinted in various issues of Famous Monsters of Filmland in the years following such as issues 51 and 114. This bit of incorrect info would be accepted as fact and persist for decades, transcending the medium and into the mainstream. For example, decades later in the 1980s the myth was still going strong. The Genus III edition of the popular board game Trivial Pursuit <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> that asked [...] "Who wins in the Japanese version of King Kong vs. Godzilla?", and states that the correct answer is [...] "Godzilla". As well, through the years, this myth has been misreported by various members of the media, and has been misreported by reputable news organizations such as the Los Angeles Times. Since seeing the original Japanese-language versions of Godzilla movies was very hard to come by from a Western standpoint during this time period, it became easily believable.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960s {{is often}} cited as being {{the golden age of}} Pakistani cinema. Many stars were {{introduced}} during this period who would go on to become cinema legends on the silver screen. As black-and-white became obsolete, Pakistan saw the introduction of first colour films. Some that share the status of being firsts are Munshi Dil's Azra in the early 1960s, Zahir Raihan's Sangam (first full-length coloured film) released on 23 April 1964, and Mala (first coloured cinema scope film). In 1962 Shaheed was released which introduced the Palestine conflict to Pakistanis in cinemas and became an instant hit. In 1962, Pakistan's most versatile actor Mohammad Ali debuted in Charagh Jalta Raha. It was premiered by Fatima Jinnah on 9 March 1962 at Nishat Cinema in Karachi. In September 1965, following the war between Pakistan and India, all Indian films were completely banned. A light ban had existed since 1952 in West Pakistan and since 1962 in East Pakistan, but was exercised rigorously after the War of 1965. Pakistani cinemas did not suffer much from the decision to remove the films and instead received better attendances. Realising the potential, Waheed Murad stepped into the industry. His persona led people to call him the [...] "chocolate hero" [...] and in essence, he became the Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley of Pakistan. In 1966, Armaan was released and {{became one of the most}} cherished Urdu films to ever release. The film is said to have given birth to Pakistani pop music, by introducing playback singing legends like composer Sohail Rana and singer Ahmed Rushdi. The film became the first to complete a 75-week screening at cinemas throughout the country attaining a platinum jubilee status. Another rising star during this period was Nadeem Baig, who received instant stardom with his debut film Chakori in 1967. The same year, he would act in another film of a different genre. Horror films were introduced with the release of Zinda Laash, making it the first Pakistani film to display an R rating tag on its posters. Meanwhile, Eastern Films Magazine, a tabloid edited by Said Haroon, became the most popular magazine for film buffs in Pakistan. The magazine <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> and answer section titled [...] "Yours Impishly" [...] which the sub-editor Asif Noorani took inspiration for from I. S. Johar's page in India's Filmfare magazine. Tabloids like these got their first controversial covers with the release of Neela Parbat on 3 January 1969, which became Pakistan's first feature-film with an adults-only tag. It ran for only three-to-four days at the box office. More controversial yet would be the offering of distribution rights in the Middle East to the Palestinian guerrilla organisation, Al Fatah, by the writer, producer, and director Riaz Shahid for his film Zarqa released on 17 October 1969. It depicted the activities of the organisation. Towards the late 1960s and early 1970s, political turmoil once again returned with the East Pakistan conflict brewing. Amidst concerns, the film Dosti, released on 7 February 1971 and turned out to be the first indigenous Urdu film to complete 101weeks of success at the box office, dubbing it the first recipient of a Diamond Jubilee. As political uncertainty took charge of the entertainment industry, filmmakers were asked to consider sociopolitical impacts of their films as evident by the fact that the makers of Tehzeeb, released on 20 November 1971, were asked to change the lyrics with a reference to Misr, Urdu for Egypt, that might prove detrimental to diplomatic relations of Egypt and Pakistan. So vulnerable was the film industry to the changing political landscape that in 1976, an angry mob set fire to cinema in Quetta just before the release of the first Balochi film, Hamalo Mah Gunj. Javed Jabbar's Beyond the Last Mountain, released on 2 December 1976, was Pakistan's first venture into English film-making. The Urdu version Musafir did not do well at the box office. Signs of trouble slowly began in the cinema industry as VCRs and piracy became an issue.|$|E
