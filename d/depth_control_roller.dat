40|$|Abstract: Small {{cylindrical}} object navigating near free-surface {{is subject}} to wave disturbance. Wave disturbance can dramatically influence the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> of the near-surface navigating object. A self-regulating fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is proposed to keep the small cylindrical object navigate at the expected depth under free-surface disturbance. The near-surface dynamic model of the cylindrical object is presented and the fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is modeled. The results obtained {{by a series of}} hardware-in-loop simulations demonstrate that the self-tuning fuzzy <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method is valid to keep the small cylindrical object navigate steadily in the expected depth under free-surface disturbances...|$|R

In the underwater vehicle industries, the thruster {{is an important part}} in <b>controlling</b> the direction, <b>depth</b> and speed of the ROV. However, there are some ROVs that cannot be maintained at the specified depth for a long time because of disturbance. This paper proposes an auto <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> using a thruster system. A prototype of a thruster with an auto <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> is developed and attached to the previously fabricated UTeM ROV. This paper presents the operation of auto <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> as well as thrusters for submerging and emerging purposes and maintaining the specified depth. The thruster system utilizes a microcontroller as its brain, a piezoresistive strain gauge pressure sensor and a DC brushless motor to run the propeller. Performance analysis of the auto <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> system is conducted to identify the sensitivity of the pressure sensor, and the accuracy and stability of the system. The results show that the thruster system performs well in maintaining a specified depth as well as stabilizing itself when a disturbanceoccurs even with a simple proportional controller used to control the thruster, where the thruster is {{an important component of the}} ROV. ...|$|R

50|$|The hydrostat is a {{mechanism}} that senses pressure; the torpedo's depth {{is proportional to}} pressure. However, with only a hydrostat <b>controlling</b> the <b>depth</b> fins, the torpedo tends to oscillate around the desired depth rather than settling to the desired depth. The addition of a pendulum allows the torpedo to sense the pitch of the torpedo. The pitch information is combined with the depth information to set the torpedo's <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> fins. The pitch information provides a damping term to the <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> response and suppresses the depth oscillations.|$|R
