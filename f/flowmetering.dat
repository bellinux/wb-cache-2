40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} numerical analysis of transient eddy-current <b>flowmetering</b> method for liquid metals. This type of flowmeter operates by tracking eddy-current markers {{excited by the}} magnetic field pulses {{in the flow of}} a conducting liquid. Using a simple mathematical model, where the fluid flow is replaced by a translating cylinder, a number possible alternative measurement schemes are considered. The velocity of the medium can be measured by tracking zero crossing points and spatial or temporal extrema of the electromotive force (emf) induced by transient eddy currents in the surrounding space. Zero crossing points and spatial extrema of the emf travel synchronously with the medium whereas temporal extrema experience an initial time delay which depends on the conductivity and velocity of the medium. Performance of transient eddy-current <b>flowmetering</b> depends crucially on the symmetry of system. Eddy current asymmetry of a few per cent makes the detection point drift with a velocity corresponding to a magnetic Reynolds number Rm∼ 0. 1. With this level of asymmetry transient eddy-current <b>flowmetering</b> can be reliably applicable only to flows with Rm≳ 0. 1. A more accurate symmetry adjustment or calibration of flowmeters may be necessary at lower velocities. Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures (revised version...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{sensitivity}} of differential-pressure flow meters {{to the quality}} of the approaching flow continues to be a cause for concern to flowmeter manufacturers and users. Distortions to the approaching velocity profiles generated by pipe fittings and installations located upstream of a flowmeter, can lead to considerable errors in <b>flowmetering.</b> This cannot be ignored because of the likely cost and process efficiency implications. This paper describes the effects of various entrance flow velocity profiles on the performance of an orifice flowmeter with and without flow conditioning. Asymmetric swirling velocity profiles were generated by a ball valve. These caused significant shifts to the meter’s calibration. The use of a vaned-plate flow conditioner, consisting of six vanes attached to a 70 % porosity plate, greatly improved the performance of the meter. Thus, the device can be used as part of a <b>flowmetering</b> package that will have considerably reduced installation lengths. The less-sophisticated NEL plate proved to be a good flow straightened, i. e. a good swirl remover, but was not an efficient flow conditioner...|$|E

Both ultrasonic <b>flowmetering</b> configurations were tested in 12 inch pipe in fully developed turbulent flow, and in the abnormal flow downstream of a 90 degree elbow. The velocity range was 5. 5 fps - 25 fps. The triple midradius chord configuration performed extremely well, with maximum errors of 1. 3, and 2. 0 percent of reading, in the normal and abnormal flows, respectively. The double tilted diameter configuration gave maximum errors of 7. 2, and 9. 3 percent of reading in the normal and abnormal flows, respectively. Recommendations for field testing of the two ultrasonic configurations are made. A numerical simulation of ultrasonic <b>flowmetering</b> in an abnormal flow using single, double, and triple midradius chords, and a double tilted diameter was conducted prior to the experimental tests. The simulation showed that the triple midradius chord and double tilted diameter were, respectively, the most accurate and second most accurate of the four trajectories. An amplitude difference between the acoustic signals received at the upstream and downstream transducers, in flowing air, was measured. This amplitude difference is believed to be caused by flow effects. A two-dimensional model was developed to explain the amplitude difference in terms of focusing of the downstream ultrasonic beam and defocusing of the upstream beam, due to velocity gradients.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 235 - 256. A {{review of}} slurry {{flowmeters}} {{leads to the}} conclusion that most are unsuited for measuring the flowrate of 	abrasive and corrosive slurries such as are found in the gold mining industry in South Africa. An alternative flowmeter based on cross-correlation techniques 	is thus proposed. Random signals generated by the flowing fluid are measured at two points a known distance apart {{in the direction of the}} flow. Assuming that 	this distance is not "too" large, the downstream signal is a time-delayed replica of the upstream signal. This delay equals the time it takes flow discontinuities 	to travel between the two measuring locations and can be obtained by cross-correlating the two flow signals and finding the position of the correlation peak. 	An analysis to establish a theoretical-basis for the method is performed and an attempt is made to model the flowmeter consisting of the two transducers a known 	distance apart. A review of transducers for converting time-varying spatial flow patterns into electrical signals is undertaken and leads to ultrasonic transducers 	being chosen as most suitable for slurry flowrate measurements. Such transducers are non-intrusive and can be of a clamp-on type. The characteristics and requirements 	of ultrasonic transducers for correlation <b>flowmetering</b> are investigated and a suitable clamp-on design is described...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic gas {{flowmeters}} typically use narrowband {{piezoelectric transducer}} arrangements for interrogating {{the flow of}} gas in a pipe. In this work, the suitability of broadband electrostatic transducers operating at frequencies of up to 1 MHz for ultrasonic measurement of gas flow has been investigated. The transit time method of ultrasonic gas flow measurement was adopted and ex-periments were carried out using a laboratory test rig capable of producing a range of gas flowrates up to 17. 5 m/s. The test rig also allowed easy interchange of different prototype <b>flowmetering</b> sections. Times of flight of ultrasonic waves interrogating the gas flow were measured using separate send/receive electrostatic transducer arrangements. Two flowmeter configurations were considered. The first interrogated the flow at 45 in contra-propagating upstream and downstream directions. The second consisted of an up-stream interrogation at 45 to the gas flow and an interrogation made normal to the flow direction. k factors correlating the fluid velocity along the ultrasonic path with the mean fluid velocity in the pipe were calculated using experimental ultrasonic data and anemometer measurements. All transducer configurations were numerically modelled using the computational fluid dynamics software package FLOTRAN (ANSYS Inc.). Theoretical gas flow velocities for both transducer arrangements were subsequently compared with experimental values and found to be in excellent agreement. A flow-dependent frequency shift of the received ul-trasonic signals was also observed simultaneously with the transit time measurement. 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{of blood}} flow to the indi-vidual {{gastrointestinal}} organs has been ham-pered by limitations of methodology. The old-est and most direct experimental technique for estimating {{blood flow to}} an organ is timed collection of its total venous outflow. Trau-matic surgical procedures are required to accomplish such collections from the stomach, intestine, or colon. This method is not appli-cable to the pancreas, gall bladder, duode-num or esophagus because these latter or-gans are drained by multiple small vessels. Placement of <b>flowmetering</b> devices on or in the major vessels also requires relatively ex-tensive operative manipulation. The complex-ity of the arterial inflow and venous outflow pathways of the gastrointestinal organs makes estimates for an individual organ by means of a flowmeter somewhat questionable. Fur-thermore, the flowmeter devices, whether based on thermal or electromagnetic princi-ples, are generally more useful for estimating relative changes in blood flow than for deter-mining absolute quantities.

40|$|Ultrasound {{covers a}} broad range of {{applications}} from underwater exploration and nondestructive evaluation of materials to medical diagnosis and treatment. The ultrasonic transducer {{plays an important role in}} determining the resolution, sensitivity, as well as other critical diagnostic capabilities of an ultrasonic detection or imaging system. Currently piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers dominate the market. The device performance of the piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer in medical applications is limited by the material properties and related electrical and acoustic impedance match issues. The fabrication of piezoelectric transducer array requires meticulous handcrafting. It is difficult and expensive to fabricate densely populated piezoelectric array. The Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Technology (CMUT) has emerged as a promising alternative. Compared to piezoelectric technology, the MEMS based CMUT has advantages such as ease of fabrication and the potential to integrate with front-end electronic circuits. CMUT could also provide broader acoustic bandwidth and higher sensitivity over its piezoelectric counterpart, which would improve the image resolution. The main goal of this dissertation work is to develop miniature CMUT devices for minimally invasive biomedical diagnosis and treatment. A two-layer poly-silicon surface micromachining process mixed with bulk micromachining process was developed. Based on this process, three prototypes of application were developed in this research: 1) a multi-looking imager, 2) a miniaturized invasive ultrasonic probe, and 3) an image-Guided Therapy (IGT) system. Primary testing results including the acoustic/electrical characterization, ultrasonic imaging and <b>flowmetering</b> have been obtained and are discussed. These results indicate that CMUT technology has great potential to become the next-generation transducer technology for the Intravascular Ultrasonic system, invasive blood-flow metering, and therapeutic treatment.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the behaviour {{of electromagnetic}} flowmeters {{in which the}} flowrate of a suitably conducting liquid is measured {{by means of the}} e. m. f. induced between two electrodes by the motion in a magnetic field. The distortion of the field by the induced currents is assumed negligible, thus excluding the more highly conducting liquid metals, but the method is well-known to be suitable for certain liquid metals, water-based liquids and blood. Attention is concentrated entirely on the <b>flowmetering</b> device itself and not on any associated electronics. The idea of the contribution of each element of fluid moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B to the total electrode e. m. f. is first put on a sound mathematical basis by the introduction of a weight vector W = B∧∇G where ∇G is a vector entirely determined by the flowmeter and electrode geometry. The contribution is W. v per unit volume. The ultimate aim of the flowmeter designer is to make the meter sensitivity (the electrode e. m. f. divided by the flowrate) entirely independent of the flow pattern, i. e. of v. The behaviour of a flowmeter is specified entirely by W and the necessary condition on W to achieve this sensitivity independence (an ideal meter) is found to be curl W= 0. It is shown that there is no magnetic field that will achieve this if point electrodes are used. The condition on W weakens progressively as more assumptions are made about the flow pattern and weight functions suitable for different types of velocity profile are defined. The effects of different types of electrode are also discussed. This basic theory is then applied, first to a class of ideal uniform field flowmeters with transverse line electrodes. These meters can, moreover, be used as valves and flowmeters simultaneously. Their performance has been experimentally checked. Secondly the theory of long flowmeters (in which all quantities are assumed invariant in the flow direction) is exhaustively discussed. Thirdly the practically important case of circular meters with non-conducting walls, point electrodes and short magnetic fields is examined. In view of the difficulty of manufacturing a magnetic field that may be mathematically desirable, this problem is by-passed by first choosing a technologically simple method of producding magnetic fields for these meters using coils specified by certain parameters and then analysing the relevant weight-function in terms of these parameters. Design tables for the case of rectilinear axisymmetric flow are presented (one specimen), and experimental tests described which check the performance of designs produced from these tables. A different method of producing the magnetic field is suggested which saves power consumption and enables the field to be more accurately designed, but to which the tables mentioned above still apply.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 27 / 08 / 2002. The dynamic response of turbine flowmeters in low pressure gas flows (i. e. where the rotational inertia of the fluid is negligible) is well understood and methods for correcting meter signals {{for a lack of}} response are available. For liquid flows there has been a limited amount of experimental work on the response of meters to step changes but no reports have been found of the response of meters to sinusoidally pulsating flows. "Small" turbine meters are expected to behave differently from "large" meters for a number of reasons: a smaller meter would generally have: (1) a larger percentage of tip clearance leakage flow; (2) less fluid momentum between the meter blading; and, (3) less fluid friction forces on the effective surface area. In this research, arbitrarily, meters up to size 25 mm were defined as small; and within this study, meters of size 6 mm to 25 mm were investigated. The aim of the research was to investigate and to understand the response of small turbine meters to pulsating liquid flows and to provide methods for correction. Three approaches were used: (1) application of an existing theoretical model of turbine meter behaviour; (2) an experimental investigation of meter performance in pulsating flows; and (3) simulation of flow behaviour through one selected meter using CFD and extending the simulation to predict the rotor dynamics and, hence, the response of this meter to specified cases of pulsating flow. A theoretical model developed by Dijstelbergen (1966) assumes frictionless behaviour and that flow is perfectly guided by meter blading through the rotor and that fluid within the rotor envelope rotates as a "solid body". Results from this theoretical model applied for pulsating flows showed that there was likely to be positive error in predicted mean flow rate (over-registration) and negative error for predicted values of the amplitude of the pulsations (amplitude attenuation). This behaviour is due to the fundamental asymmetry between flows with increasing and decreasing angle of attack relative to the meter blades, throughout a pulsation cycle. This qualitative behaviour was confirmed by experimental work with meters up to size 25 mm working with pulsation frequencies up to 300 Hz. For low frequency pulsations (below 10 Hz), the over-registration errors were within the limits of specified meter accuracy. At higher frequencies and larger pulsation amplitudes, the largest over-registration observed was 5. 5 % and amplitude attenuation could be as large as 90 %. The dependence of these errors on both the flow pulsation amplitude and frequency were investigated. The theoretical model was also used as a basis for generating correction procedures, to be applied to both the mean flow and the pulsation amplitude measurements. The results from the CFD simulation showed qualitative good agreement with the experimental data. The same kind of meter error trends were observed and it was shown to provide a better correlation with the experimental trends than the theoretical model derived from Dijstelbergen. From the CFD simulation, the causes of over-registration and amplitude attenuation in turbine <b>flowmetering</b> were understood through the investigation of rotor dynamics coupled with fluid behaviour around meter blading within the pulsation cycle. The CFD results were used to evaluate fluid angular momentum flux and to review the validity of the assumption that fluid within the rotor "envelope" rotated as a solid body. For the case investigated, whilst the assumption that flow is perfectly guided is not inappropriate, the volume of fluid assumed to rotate as a "solid body" was found to be significantly less than the rotor envelope volume...|$|E

The <b>flowmeters</b> will be labelled for the gas they are specific to. Additional color-coding may be used, for example, O2 <b>flowmeters</b> may have white and green labels, since white and green are respectively the Canadian and American colours identifying this gas. The <b>flowmeter</b> will have a safety Relief valve to relieve excess pressure.|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{tests in}} {{accordance}} with DIN EN 60068 - 2 - 6 and IEC 68 - 2 - 6 were performed on two <b>flowmeters</b> of type D 4 _F. The <b>flowmeters</b> were manufactured by ABB Automation GmbH Göttingen and are of design status C. They have a nominal diameter DN 20 and the labelling VT- 1 - 20 and VT- 3 - 20. The <b>flowmeters</b> were mounted on a uni-axial electrodynamic shaker. For each longitudinal axis of the <b>flowmeters</b> 100 cycles of sine sweep runs from 10 to 150 Hz upwards and from 150 Hz to 10 Hz downwards with a sweep velocity of 1 oct/min and a level from 2 g were performed. In each axis the <b>flowmeters</b> were exposed 13 h to the vibrations. The visual inspection of the <b>flowmeters</b> after each test run showed no visible damage. After termination of the test programme, the <b>flowmeters</b> were transported to ABB and inspected in detail. Also, the calibration was checked by ABB...|$|R

The <b>flowmeters</b> were manufactured by ABB Automation GmbH Göttingen and have both a nominal diameter of 150 mm. The design of the <b>flowmeter</b> measurement mechanisms are slightly different. The <b>flowmeters</b> were mounted on a multi-axial test facility and sine sweep runs into {{the direction of the}} three translational axes were performed. The frequency range of the sine sweep runs was 10 to 100 Hz with a maximum acceleration level of 3 g. In each axis the <b>flowmeters</b> were exposed 66 min to the vibrations. The visual inspection of the <b>flowmeters</b> after each test run showed no visible damage. After termination of the test programme, the <b>flowmeters</b> were transported to ABB and inspected in detail. Also, the calibration was checked by ABB. ...|$|R
