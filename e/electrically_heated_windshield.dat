5000|$|As {{part of the}} redesign, Lincoln {{simplified}} {{the trim}} lineup; only standard (later named [...] "Executive") and Signature Series remained. For {{the first time since}} 1981, 6-passenger seating made its return. Leather seats were standard (with velour available as a no-cost option). Major options included a compact disc player, InstaClear <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>windshield</b> (1988-1992), JBL sound system, power glass moonroof, keyless entry, anti-theft alarm system, cellular phone (starting 1990), three-position memory seat, and choice of wheels.|$|E
50|$|The EV Plus {{featured}} on-board conductive charging {{with the}} Avcon connector, passive battery balancing, regenerative braking and deceleration, AC/heat-pump climate control, HID headlights, 4 seats, and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>windshield.</b> Units deployed in cold climates also had oil-fired heaters for faster cabin heating and passenger comfort. As with virtually all vehicles, range {{was affected by}} driving style: rapid acceleration, high speeds, and fast stops lowered the all-electric range significantly. United States Environmental Protection Agency rated at 81 miles (130 km), careful driving would give it a range of just over 100 miles (160 km). The EV Plus came with a 12 V battery for running normal 12 volt accessories and lighting.|$|E
40|$|The <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> ski goggles shown {{incorporate}} technology {{similar to}} that once used in Apollo astronauts' helmet visors, and for the same reason-providing fogfree sight in an activity that demands total vision. Defogging is accomplished by applying heat to prevent moisture condensation. Electric heat is supplied by a small battery built into the h goggles' headband. Heat is spread across the lenses {{by means of an}} invisible coating of electrically conductive metallic film. The goggles were introduced to the market last fall. They were designed by Sierracin Corporation, Sylmar, California, specialists in the field of heated transparent materials. The company produces <b>heated</b> <b>windshields</b> for military planes and for such civil aircraft as the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC- 10 and Lockheed L- 1011 TriStar...|$|R

5000|$|... 1989 {{introduced}} an extensive exterior redesign {{which included a}} longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The [...] 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over — even the luggage compartment was over [...] larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors—all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the Bose compact disc player, an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>windshield,</b> {{and a set of}} four reversible carpeted floor mats.|$|E
5000|$|... 1991, {{the last}} year for this body style, was also the first year for Cadillac's new 4.9 liter V-8 engine with port fuel injection, teamed up with GM's 4T60-E {{electronically}} controlled 4-speed transmission. Cadillac set apart the GM transmission from other corporate models it was shared with by the Cadillac-exclusive viscous converter clutch, which provided even smoother shifting under hard acceleration. Engine controls were monitored by the GMP4 Powertrain Control Module (PCM), an on-board 64-kilobyte computer. A new exhaust set-up with a wider catalytic converter reduced restriction by 38% from last year, while the 0-60 mph speed went from 9 seconds in 1990 to 8.2 for '91. Revised engine mounts prevented engine noise and vibration from affecting the cabin, while the new Computer Command Ride (CCR) system, optional on most other Cadillac models, was standard on Eldorado. CCR would automatically adapt the suspension mode with regard to vehicle speed for better handling and ride comfort. A $309 <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> <b>windshield</b> was new to the option list this year, as was the available ($480 on base Eldorado, no charge on Biarritz or Touring Coupe) [...] "Security Package" [...] which now included remote keyless entry along with automatic door locks with central unlocking, and the theft-deterrent system. The Bosch II anti-lock braking system, previously a $925 option, was made standard this year, as well as a more powerful 140-amp alternator. A revised windshield washer system rounded out the changes for 1991. Base price was $31,245, almost $2,400 up from 1990, but the jump was not nearly as dramatic when considering the new powertrain and sophisticated suspension system, and that anti-lock brakes were now standard equipment, as well as other previously optional items that were now available at no-charge. In an effort to exhaust parts inventory - and to make the Eldorado appear to be a better value in its last year of current style production, several optional items were available at no-charge on the base Eldorado, including choice of full vinyl roof covering or full-cabriolet (convertible-look) roof (an otherwise $1,095 option), leather upholstery with power passenger recliner, and the Delco-Bose sound system - with choice of CD or cassette. Additionally, both the $2,050 Touring Coupe and the $3,180 Biarritz packages included the power moon roof and Delco-BOSE stereo at no additional charge. This would be {{the last year}} for the Eldorado Biarritz. Production dropped to just 16,212 (including 2,249 Touring Coupe models), the lowest output seen since 1966.|$|E

40|$|It is not {{an unusual}} {{complaint}} that in patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris or hand eczema, using warm water causes pain and/or itching of the injured skin. In using warm water, there are some patients with injured skin who do not complain of pain and/or itching and ordinary patients with skin injured as much as former who complain of pain and/or itching. This made us think {{that there must be}} a difference in the warm water used by these patients. Usually we get warm water from gas instantly heated water or from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. In patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water the complaints were more frequent than in patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water. Residual chlorine in water is well known to be the main factor worsening skin disease. Therfore, residual chlorine levels in gas instantly <b>heated</b> water and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water were measured at same temperature (40 ℃). Levels of the former were 67. 5 ～ 77. 5 % and that of the latter were 12. 5 - 31. 7 % of tap water. Then this significant difference in the levels of residual chlorine was thought to be a cause for the difference of complaints between patients using warm water from gas instantly heated water and patients using warm water from <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> stored water...|$|R
