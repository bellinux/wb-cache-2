5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), {{a fledgling}} author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires {{to the bathroom to}} discard a spent cigarette. Without warning or concern, the man suddenly reaches <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and removes a bloody heart. Later, he walks down metal stairs into a cluttered basement, and opens the door of an incinerator. Noticing a beating heart amidst the flames, and unfazed by the vision, he nonchalantly tosses in a paper bag.|$|E
5|$|At 5:17pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi {{was with}} his grandnieces {{in the garden of}} the former Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse fired three bullets from a Beretta 9mm pistol <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> at point-blank range. According to some accounts, Gandhi died on the spot. In other accounts, such as one {{prepared}} by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.|$|E

In May of the same year, when, during his absence in Edinburgh, conventicles were being held near Cardross, a party of guards {{in search of a}} covenanter named John King entered his house at midnight, broke <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chests,</b> and after acting with great rudeness towards his wife placed a guard on it.|$|R
50|$|After the siege, Hannibal {{sold all}} the {{inhabitants}} as slaves, and distributed {{the proceeds from}} those sales to his soldiers.

Bishop seized Legion's psi-blade and drove it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>chest,</b> {{allowing}} Legion to see the future that he caused. In his last moments, David apologized for what he did. David's mother, Gabrielle Haller, described having a [...] "maternal loss" [...] afterward, implying she miscarried before giving birth to David.|$|R
5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{werewolf}} {{is revealed}} to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's spell. It turns out that he is only able to keep on living due to an enchanted spike that is lodged <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and, without such, the spell is broken. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind that puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him but is later impaled by Will.|$|E
5|$|Tony and Ralph {{invest in}} a race horse named Pie-O-My, who wins several races and makes them both {{a great deal of}} money. However, when Ralph's 12-year-old son Justin is {{severely}} injured when an arrow plunges <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> Tony comes to believe Ralph burned Pie-O-My in a stable fire to collect $200,000 in insurance money. Tony confronts Ralph the following morning and Ralph denies setting the fire. The two engage in a violent brawl, culminating in Tony strangling Ralph to death.

60|$|When Doctor Walker had departed, the Admiral packed all <b>his</b> {{possessions}} back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> sea <b>chest</b> {{with the}} exception of one little brass-bound desk. This he unlocked, and took from it a dozen or so blue sheets of paper all mottled over with stamps and seals, with very large V. R.'s printed upon the heads of them. He tied these carefully into a small bundle, and placing them in the inner pocket of his coat, he seized his stick and hat.|$|R

He accidently shot a 5 cm nail <b>into</b> <b>his</b> left <b>chest</b> wall while working at a {{construction}} site. His airway was patent and vital signs were stable, however complaints of left chest pain with minimal shortness of breath. The nail was firmly cemented to the medial side of his left nipple. Bedside ultrasound was performed by an attending emergency physician. Pneumothorax and hemothorax were able to be ruled out immediately. The most dreadful cardiac injury was promptly ruled out as well as the tip of the nail was found few millimetres just above the pericardium.|$|R
50|$|Months later, Shaw was {{attacked}} by his son, Shinobi Shaw, who phased <b>his</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>chest</b> to induce a coronary. Shaw was then supposedly blown up in his Swiss Mountain chalet by a bomb set by his son. Shinobi shortly became the new Black King of Hellfire Club; however, Shaw survived, albeit with a scar on his face crossing his left eye, which was removed successfully by Madelyne Pryor (seemingly a sentient psionic construct of X-Man) using her psionic powers during their affair after his reappearance. Shaw became {{part of a new}} Inner Circle alongside Selene, Madelyne and Trevor Fitzroy, a descendant of Sebastian himself in an alternate future.|$|R
5|$|Akins {{became a}} free agent before the 2002 season. The Montreal Alouettes {{expressed}} interest in signing Akins, but he decided to re-sign with the Tiger-Cats in May shortly before a deadline imposed by head coach Ron Lancaster. In a pre-season game, Akins suffered a collarbone injury when a player's face mask was driven <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He returned in mid-July. In his second game of the season, Akins scored three touchdowns. He scored {{in each of the}} two following games as well. Akins' success was interrupted in late August when he re-injured his collarbone with deep bruising. After Akins returned, he caught an 84-yard touchdown while accumulating 150 receiving yards against the Alouettes. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats did not qualify for the playoffs in 2002, but Akins had his most successful season, catching 38 receptions for 732 yards and 7 touchdowns. All three values were career-highs for the wide receiver.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{vision of}} an {{independent}} India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs {{made their way to}} their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
5000|$|Yahoo! Music's Jairne Gill {{reviewed}} the single positively, giving it 7 stars out of 10. Though he felt Snow Patrol usually made [...] "ugly empty anthems", the single was a [...] "rather lovely little song" [...] and [...] "modest" [...] and [...] "chimingly melodic". Gill praised {{the lyrics of}} the song, calling it [...] "a pretty little knife which Gary Lightbody seems to be twisting <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>chest,</b> a list of druggy regrets and lost loves" [...] and also said that, though the song's [...] "gentle, skipping rhythm threatens to go BIG", it doesn't and [...] "a pretty and intimate song is preserved".|$|R

25|$|On {{her return}} that evening, Marat {{admitted}} her. At the time, he conducted {{most of his}} affairs from a bathtub because of his skin condition. Marat wrote down {{the names of the}} Girondists that she gave to him, and she then pulled out the knife and plunged it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> He called out: Aidez-moi, ma chère amie! ("Help me, my dear friend!"), and then died.|$|E
25|$|Governor Connally {{was riding}} in the same {{limousine}} in a seat {{directly in front of}} the President and three inches more to the left than Kennedy; he was also seriously injured, but survived. Doctors later stated that after the Governor was shot, his wife pulled him onto her lap, and the resulting posture helped close his front chest wound, which was causing air to be sucked directly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> around his collapsed right lung.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{changing}} Katrina's mind, Jack, Montoya and Guiteau {{find out that}} Valek has seized the cross and they arrive at an old church to kill more vampires, but they are soon set up as Cardinal Alba sides with Valek and kidnaps Crow, revealing that his plan all along was being turned by Valek so he too can become immortal. Katrina turns into a vampire and allies herself with Valek after biting Montoya. Cardinal Alba agrees to perform a ritual using the cross which will allow vampires to walk in sunlight and be invulnerable, but Guiteau, who was in hiding, appears and kills him before he can finish the ritual. Montoya and Guiteau then rescue Crow as the sun rises, and Crow heads off to confront Valek, whom he kills by ramming the Berziers cross <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and exposing him to sunlight, which causes Valek to explode.|$|E
50|$|A Greek police {{official}} said two armed men {{got out of}} a parked car as Hagopian walked out of his apartment building carrying his luggage. One {{of the two men}} opened fire with a sawed-off shotgun, wounding Hagopian in the chest and elbow. As Hagopian tried to flee, the killer ran after him and fired twice <b>into</b> <b>his</b> head and <b>chest.</b> The attackers escaped in a car left parked across the street.|$|R
60|$|And what {{a vision}} of glorious beauty met his enraptured eyes, while the fresh sea-breeze entered, like life, <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heaving <b>chest!</b> It was still a {{profound}} calm. Earth, air, water, sky, seemed to be uniting in a silent act of adoration to their great Creator, while the myriad creatures therein contained were comparatively quiet in the enjoyment of His rich and varied bounties. It {{seemed as if the}} hour were too early for the strife of violent passions--too calm for the stirrings of hatred or revenge. Everything around spoke only of peace. Sitting down with his back to a sun-bathed rock, and his face to the silver sea, Leo drew out his Bible and proceeded to read the records of the Prince of Peace.|$|R
50|$|Danny {{proves to}} be the most gifted of Lei Kung's students. He toughens his fists by {{plunging}} them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock. At 19, Danny is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying, who guards the molten heart that had been torn from its body. Guessing that the heart provides life energy to Shou-Lao through the dragon-shaped scar on its chest, Danny covers the scar with his own body and hangs on until Shou-Lao collapses and dies, in the process burning a dragon brand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>chest.</b> Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges <b>his</b> fists <b>into</b> a brazier containing the creature's molten heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Danny is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists.|$|R

500|$|Two other {{episodes in}} the Buffy canon are also based on, or have {{elements}} of, fairy tales: [...] "Killed by Death", where only sick children {{can see a}} demon who sucks away their lives, and [...] "Gingerbread", where a demon takes on the forms of Hansel and Gretel to create a moral panic in Sunnydale. [...] "Hush" [...] is often compared to these episodes because they contain similar elements. Whedon intended The Gentlemen to be Brothers Grimm-like monsters, with Giles {{playing the role of}} the wise man, Buffy the princess, and Tara the [...] "little girl wandering through the woods". In this incarnation, however, Buffy is a swashbuckling princess whose scream saves the town. Instead of being the damsel in distress she is the hero, breaking through a boarded-up window in the belfry, then grabbing a rope and swinging across the room to kill one of The Gentlemen's footmen by smashing her feet <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After losing {{consciousness}} again, {{the narrator}} discovers that the prison is slightly illuminated {{and that he}} is strapped to a wooden frame on his back, facing the ceiling. Above him is a picture of Father Time, with a razor-sharp pendulum measuring [...] "one foot from horn to horn" [...] suspended from it. The pendulum is swinging back and forth and slowly descending, designed to kill the narrator eventually. However, he is able to attract rats to him by smearing his bonds with the meat left for him to eat. The rats chew through the straps, and he slips free just before the pendulum can begin to slice <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} Mortal Kombat, Kano's special moves were the Knife Throw, making {{him one of}} two characters in the game (besides Scorpion) whose projectile was a physical weapon, while his body-propel move, the Cannonball, saw him curl {{into a ball and}} launch himself at his opponent. Sega Visions called the Knife Throw [...] "a strong distance weapon and easily thrown." [...] Kano also possessed one of the more graphic Fatalities in the game, which involved him plunging <b>his</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>chest</b> and ripping out their still-beating heart. Boon claimed that Sub-Zero's [...] "Spine Rip" [...] Fatality from the same game stood out more, because Kano's finisher did not have a [...] "mark left on the opponent's body." [...] Kano was cut from the Game Gear version of Mortal Kombat due to memory constraints, while a still image of him wielding an automatic weapon in his arcade ending was removed from the Genesis version of the game.|$|R

2500|$|Sigma 6 {{figures were}} heavily stylized with help by the Japanese {{animation}} company Gonzo. The Cobra Commander {{was released in}} the [...] "Commando" [...] collection in a new 8" [...] scale, in 2006. Wearing body armor and a cape, the Commander still donned his iconic hood with a battle helmet on top of it. As an action figure, Cobra Commander had a spinning wheel built <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> which registered battle damage if hit. A repaint of this figure, without the battle-damage feature and new weapons, was released in black and silver. A second, more radical repaint followed in 2007, with the Commander's armor painted silver, and an air chariot included as an accessory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the southern nonviolent protest movement was muted in Harlem. [...] Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the black leader most respected in Harlem. But on September 20, 1958, Izola Curry, deluded into believing the NAACP was controlled by Communists, approached Dr. King at a Blumstein's book-signing, {{and asked him if}} he was Martin Luther King, Jr. When King replied in the affirmative, she said, [...] "I've been looking for you for five years", then thrust a letter opener <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> NYPD [...] officers took King, still in the chair where he had sat, to an ambulance that took him to Harlem Hospital, for removal of the blade.

2500|$|The Kennedy eternal flame {{has also}} {{attracted}} some unwanted attention as well. The {{leader of a}} group protesting segregation in housing was nearly arrested at the grave site in August 1967 after attempting to lead a group of protesters in the singing of [...] "America the Beautiful". A mentally ill individual attempted to throw red paint on the grave in August 1971. A 23-year-old Army veteran committed suicide at the grave in 1972 by plunging a knife <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chest.</b> The cross and the headstone marking Robert F. Kennedy's grave were stolen in 1981 and never recovered. In December 1982, an intoxicated Salvadoran immigrant broke into the cemetery at night and knelt before the eternal flame. He experienced a fatal heart attack, and fell into the flame. In 1997, thieves pried loose one of the paving stones from the terrace {{in front of the}} eternal flame and attempted to make off with it. They gave up after realizing the [...] stone was too heavy to move.|$|E
50|$|In September 2000 Bradbury {{broke his}} neck in a {{training}} accident. Another skater fell {{in front of}} him and Bradbury tried to jump over him, but instead clipped him and tripped head first into the barriers. As a result, Bradbury fractured his C4 and C5 vertebra. He spent a month and a half in a halo brace, and needed four pins to be inserted in his skull and screws and plates bolted <b>into</b> <b>his</b> back and <b>chest.</b> Doctors told Bradbury that he would not be able to take to the ice again, but he was determined to reach another Olympics.
