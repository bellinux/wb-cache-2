5|$|The Act was {{repealed}} {{and replaced}} by the Royal Assent Act of 1967. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> so desires.|$|E
5|$|A {{cerebellar}} disorder may {{be present}} if the person cannot stand with arms extended, feet touching and eyes closed without swaying (Romberg's sign); {{if there is a}} tremor when the person reaches for an object; or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is unable to touch a fixed point, close the eyes and touch the same point again.|$|E
25|$|As in Sale, {{the game}} was split into four rounds. Contestants begin with a score of $20. When Edward Phillips asks a question, the first {{contestant}} to buzz in {{had the chance to}} answer the question; <b>if</b> correct, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> gained $5; <b>if</b> wrong, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> lost $5. Phillips revealed the answer immediately if the contestant answered incorrectly; no other contestants were given the opportunity to answer. Contestants needed not wait until Phillips had finished asking the question before buzzing in.|$|R
2500|$|Also {{throughout}} the game were several [...] "Who Am I?" [...] questions. Phillips read {{out a series}} of clues to the identity of a famous person, revealing facts which became progressively more helpful; the final and most helpful clue was the person's first name and last initial. As before, the first contestant to buzz in had the chance to answer the question; <b>if</b> correct, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> made a [...] "famous faces" [...] selection (see below); <b>if</b> wrong, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> lost no money, but Phillips continued reading clues and the other contestants were given the chance to answer.|$|R
6000|$|If {{the young}} gentleman fresh from College or the maiden lady Understander could be, {{if only for}} a month or two, a father! <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> could guess how gladly the father of limited income would reply, ...|$|R
5|$|However, even {{if any of}} {{the above}} {{situations}} applies to a person, he or she will not be regarded as having lawful authority <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has the item for the purpose of using it in a manner prejudicial to public security or the maintenance of public order.|$|E
5|$|She has {{suggested}} that {{to ensure that the}} institution of the Elected President continues to be legitimate, even if there is only one candidate in an election a vote should be held, and the candidate only declared elected <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> receives at least a specified percentage of votes.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} private Acts {{establishing}} religious organizations expressly confine membership of their governing boards to persons professing the respective religions. For instance, {{a person may}} only be appointed to the Hindu Endowments Board, which administers Hindu religious and charitable endowments, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is Hindu. Similarly, one may only {{be a member of}} the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board, which manages gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in Singapore, if one professes the Sikh faith.|$|E
60|$|The queen {{had then}} {{to tell him}} this much of the story, {{that it had been}} foretold that it would cause great sorrow and misfortune <b>if</b> either <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> got a sight of the child until it had {{completed}} its fourteenth year.|$|R
50|$|The {{veterinarian}} {{will likely}} ask the owner about the bird's housing, diet, and activities, then examine the birds feathers, eyes, ears, and nares {{for signs of}} illness. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will probably acquire a gram's stain, and may also clip the bird's wings and toenails <b>if</b> requested. <b>He</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will likely offer advice about caring for the pet.|$|R
60|$|There is this, at all events, {{to be said}} {{in regard}} to the rough system, that no man but an athlete could endure the fatigue of the process, while any man--or even woman--has {{physical}} strength sufficient to conquer by love, <b>if</b> only <b>he,</b> <b>or</b> <b>she,</b> possess the requisite patience and milk of human kindness.|$|R
5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation {{could be due}} to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Since {{an order}} for review of {{detention}} is a remedy for establishing the legality of detention, {{it may not be}} used to challenge the conditions under which a person is held, if the detention itself is lawful. Moreover, an order can only be sought where a person is being physically detained, and not <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is merely under some other form of restriction such as being out on bail.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} {{does not}} have a right to appointed counsel <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year, even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime, or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment. Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal, or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal, even if facing execution.|$|E
50|$|The week's {{winner is}} shown a short film about an {{overseas}} travel destination; <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is {{only able to}} view the film through those boxes that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has held {{at the end of}} the game. At the end of the film, the contestant has five seconds to identify the location. <b>If</b> successful, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wins a trip to that destination.|$|R
5000|$|One good turn deserves another: If {{someone has}} done you a favor, {{you should be}} willing to do her or him a {{comparable}} favor <b>if</b> and when <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should need one.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the 1950s version, if {{the game}} {{ended in a}} tie, no new game was played. Instead, the {{contestant}}s would be asked one question, and the first contestant to ring-in got to answer. <b>If</b> right, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> won the game {{and went on to}} play the bonus round; an incorrect answer gave the opponent a chance to respond. If both contestants missed the question, a new one was asked.|$|R
5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election {{to sit in the}} Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|Companions {{would have}} {{followed}} commands {{to the best}} of their ability, but in accordance with their personality; for example, a berserker-type companion told to attack aggressively would charge into melee combat, while an assassin-type companion would attempt to hide, and then creep about knocking foes unconscious or backstabbing. In contrast, a priestess-type companion might support the player character by casting beneficial spells, while a paladin-type would give support by attacking the player character's target, and then healing the protagonist after the battle or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> came close to dying.|$|E
5|$|Following {{majority}} rule in early 1980, British Army trainers oversaw {{the integration of}} guerrilla fighters into a battalion structure overlaid on the existing Rhodesian armed forces. For the first year, a system was followed where the top-performing candidate became battalion commander. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was from ZANLA, then his or her second-in-command was the top-performing ZIPRA candidate, and vice versa. This ensured {{a balance between the}} two movements in the command structure. From early 1981, this system was abandoned in favour of political appointments, and ZANLA and ZANU fighters consequently quickly formed the majority of battalion commanders in the ZNA.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} each day, the {{producer}} returns to the 765 Pro office with the idols. The player is shown the weekly sales ranking, and can choose to have a conversation with the idols, who play a game with the player and present a number of choices similar to the greeting in the morning. <b>If</b> available, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is also shown the idols' fan mail or email messages sent to him or her.|$|R
50|$|For {{criminal}} matters which are triable either way (i.e. either summarily or on indictment) the accused {{is given the}} choice to face trial in the Magistrate's Court without a jury or to elect for a trial before a jury in the High Court. If the accused is tried in the Magistrate's Court then, <b>if</b> convicted, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> would only be punishable {{to the extent of}} the limited sentencing powers of the Magistrate.|$|R
50|$|The {{contestant}} {{in control}} selected one gallery member, who opened his/her envelope and revealed its contents. The two contestants then squared {{off in a}} question round. Newton read {{a series of questions}} with three answer choices, and the contestants buzzed in to answer. <b>If</b> correct, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> scored one point, otherwise, the opponent chose from the remaining two choices. The first person to answer three questions correctly took control of the game.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, the monarch may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to be taken at either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned if the person is not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E
5|$|It {{is also an}} offence, {{inside or}} outside a {{security}} area, {{to be found in}} possession of supplies which cannot be satisfactorily accounted for, or to directly or indirectly provide supplies to another person, in circumstances which raise the reasonable presumption referred to above. The penalty for all these offences is life imprisonment. However, in the latter situation, a person will not be convicted <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> voluntarily provides full information of the offence to a police officer before being accused of or charged with the offence.|$|E
5000|$|The Head of Government is the Prime Minister, {{currently}} Juha Sipilä, who {{has held}} the office since 29 May 2015. The Prime Minister designate is subject to election by the Parliament and, <b>if</b> elected, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> [...] - {{along with all the}} other ministers upon the nomination of the Prime Minister - [...] are appointed by the President of Finland. All the ministers shall be Finnish citizens, known to be honest and competent.|$|R
5000|$|Those who are Dead Filed {{are never}} {{informed}} of that action. Getting {{out of the}} Dead File is {{at the discretion of}} the Ethics Officer. From page 9: [...] "How does a person ever get out of the Dead File? One could somehow discover without our help <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was in the dead file (we never inform them). <b>If</b> so, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> could take it up with the Ethics Officer. But the probable outcome may just be more Dead File." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{chairman}} of a troika was {{the chief of the}} corresponding territorial subdivision of NKVD (People's Commissar of a republican NKVD, etc.). Usually a troika included the prosecutor of the republic/krai/oblast in question; <b>if</b> not, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was allowed to be present at the session of a troika. The third person was usually the Communist Party secretary of the corresponding regional level. The staff of these troikas were personally specified in the Order № 00447.|$|R
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> had been alive, the burden of proving that the person is alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The minority status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Decisions of these committees are final and conclusive, and may not be appealed against or called into question in any court.|$|E
5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified. An individual may not sit in the Scottish Parliament <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is judged to be insane {{under the terms of the}} Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> the {{jurisdiction}} <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> heads {{is considered to}} have statehood (sovereign or not), the official is generally its head of state and (in various degrees of authority) chief executive. However, the precise meaning depends upon the particular circumstances where it is given.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{questions}} that fell to be determined was whether there was any duty on the court to enquire, under such circumstances, whether the prosecutor was indeed stopping the prosecution and, <b>if</b> so, whether <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> had the necessary consent to do so.|$|R
5000|$|The host {{selected}} a participant from a seemingly random group gathered around {{him or her}} on a street, at the beach, or on a college campus. The M.C. (Master of Ceremonies) then presented the stunt and told the player how much money <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> would win <b>if</b> the dare was successfully completed. If the contestant rejected the amount of money, the host usually raised the bet. As soon as a bet was agreed upon, the player attempted the stunt. If successful, the contestant won the money. <b>If</b> unsuccessful, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> won nothing except for what was collected in a [...] "pity jar" [...] by audience members watching.|$|R
