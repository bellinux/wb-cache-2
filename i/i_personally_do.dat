40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review and discuss in detail local aspects of {{principal}} bundles with groupoid structure. Many results, in particular from the second and third section, are already known to some extents, but, due to the lack of a ``unified'' point of view on the subject, I decided nonetheless to (re) define all the main concepts and write all proofs; however, some results are reformulated in a more elegant way, using the division map and the generalized conjugation of a Lie groupoid. In the same framework, I discuss later generalized groupoids and Morita equivalences from a local point of view; in particular, I found a (so far as I know) new characterization of generalized morphisms coming from nonabelian ech cohomology, which allows one to view generalized morphisms as a generalization of classical descent data. I found also a factorization formula for the division map, which is the crucial point in the local formulation of Morita equivalences.

I reexamined the study of Gmiir et al: which is the major clinical work supporting Beutler’s recommendations. These investigators reported a 3 % mortality rate from acute hemorrhage.
