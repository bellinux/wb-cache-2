The discussion will concentrate on the so-called general-purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS. After an overview of the detector's characteristics and performance, I will elaborate on the expected measurements of hard processes, with emphasis on jet and vector boson production, i. e., tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and Electroweak Physics.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to determine, whether the Economic and Monetary Union fulfills criteria of optimum currency area, to evaluate the nominal and real convergence of the Czech Republic to EMU and to assess benefits and costs resulting from the implementation of common currency in the Czech Republic. <b>I</b> present <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> of optimum currency area and I {{try to find out}} whether they are met within the EMU. There are three economic criteria, three political criteria, the criteria of alignment of the business cycle, and also to mention Brown's tests and criteria of Václav Klaus. It also analyses whether the Czech Republic meets the Maastricht (nominal) convergence criteria {{and the extent to which}} is achieved real convergence. The benefits and costs associated with membership in the European Monetary Union for the Czech Republic are described in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{argue that a}} {{holistic}} approach is better than an individualistic approach for interpreting the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA). I propose {{that the use of}} a holistic ethical framework, based on fundamental environmental philosophy, is better in that it more effectively fulfills the ESA 2 ̆ 7 s goals of species and ecosystem conservation. Holistic ethics is based on concern for a community as a whole, while individualistic ethics is based on concern for the individual. A holistic approach, I argue, is more beneficial to nature than is an individualistic approach or other non-holistic approaches. <b>I</b> set up <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> for determining the effectiveness of recovery plans for species, and I use those criteria to review eight cases of threatened and endangered species listed under the ESA. I conclude that holistic approaches are parallel with ecosystem management techniques and should be used in the protection of both species and ecosystems rather than non-holistic approaches...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} benefits and potential risks of citizen dialogues. These dialouges offer a new structured way for communication between local politcians and municipal officials {{on one hand and}} citizens on the other, that arguably could serve as way to include citizens in the local societal development. However, they can also increase inequality regarding the influence over local political issues, lead to increased distrust of the political institutions or be used to legitimize decisions that are already made. Our intentions with this study are to: identify the <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> in participatory- and deliberative democracy theory that can be applied to citizen dialogues in Swedish municipalities. If these <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> exist, we want to investigate whether citizen dialogues in Swedish municipalities meet these. Lastly, we want to see how these <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> can create an understanding of how citizen dialogues in Swedish municipalities need to be developed. These criteria has been identified as: participation, equality, reasoning, mutual respect and information. Through a qualitative text analysis of reports from citizen dialouges made by Swedish municipalities, we have found that none of these criteria were met...|$|R

40|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> for {{the design}} of "sustainably safe" bicycle {{provisions}} should be based on the cyclists' movements and encounters with other traffic. The four criteria for the cylists' movements are: (1) possible manoeuvres; (2) continuation of the travel without changing the most important characteristics of the traffic provision; (3) predictability: estimating possible changes based on the layout of the infrastructure; and (4) difference between categories or routes: estimating the continuation of a route {{on the basis of the}} layout of the infrastructure. The four criteria for the encounters between cyclists and other road users are: (a) travelling in the same direction or crossing; (b) difference in speed and mass between cyclists and, for instance, motor vehicles; (c) frequency of the encounters; and (d) the regulation of the encounters, for example, by a priority rule for cyclists. This paper describes which <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> play a role on the different infrastructure levels. These are: (I) network; (II) route; (III) road section and junction; and (IV) "connection". The paper discusses the combinations of the different criteria with the different levels on the basis of the following elementary triangle: function, design and use of traffic provisions. The paper also describes how the safety in a road network can be improved, and how the <b>basic</b> <b>criteria</b> should be used...|$|R
