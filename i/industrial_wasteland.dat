Beneficial purchased the 177-acre man-made island, formerly known as Seddon Island. Before it was developed, local newspapers described the Harbour Island as [...] "an <b>industrial</b> <b>wasteland</b> inhabited by wild pigs" [...] and the only structures as rusted railroad tracks and an unused phosphate facility. When the first phases were complete, the island opened with events hosted by former U.S. president Gerald Ford. After seven years of dwindling business, Beneficial converted the development into office space, and renamed it Knights Point in 1995.|$|E

Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It makes me feel good to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke.

This leads to its accidental death, after which he is haunted by what seem to be daemons that represent the baby and Henry finds himself in a [...] "heaven" [...] which he arrives at by entering the center of a planet rock. Lynch has consistently refused to either confirm or deny any interpretation of Eraserhead, or to [...] "confess his own thinking behind the many abstractions in the film".

5000|$|Despite the {{difficult}} economic context, the government maintained significant public investments. The European enlargement led the Luxembourgish State to invest {{heavily in the}} improvement and extension of the EU's infrastructure and services, based in Luxembourg. The government was also concerned with consolidating {{the country as a}} European seat. In June 2001 building work commenced on the Place de l’Europe in Luxembourg-Kirchberg. The project included two office towers, an extension of the conference centre as well as a concert hall. The conversion of <b>industrial</b> <b>wastelands</b> of ARBED in Belval constituted the second large construction project started under this government. This development project which aimed to improve the Southern region, manifested the government's decentralisation policy. In February 2001, the company Agora, including representatives of the State, ARBED, and the communes of Esch-sur-Alzette and Sanem, was created to develop the wastelands. The Fonds Belval, a state-owned company, was charged with realising the State's plans on the Belval-Ouest site and to showcase the blast furnaces.

40|$|For a {{long time}} and due to the {{socio-economic}} trauma caused by the closure of the mines, the hazards of abandoned sites and soil pollution, the newness of vestiges, or the symbol of the failure of an industrial development model, on-field industrial remains were not considered as valuable heritage, particularly in rural spaces. Indeed, in the dominant imagery of rural areas, industry and countryside do not fit together (Cloke et al., 1996; Edelblutte & Legrand, 2012). Yet, such industrial activities have a long history in some areas such as in rural East-Belgium. The past deindustrialization resulted in wastelands on which stakeholders have nowadays various interests. Some of these <b>industrial</b> <b>wastelands</b> try to become places of heritage preservation and valorisation (Fagnoni, 2003; Kitchen et al., 2006; Roth, 2007; Mitchell & O’Neill, 2016). In this paper, we consider <b>industrial</b> <b>wastelands</b> with the aim to develop and enhance rural development and heritage landscapes. The mining wastelands are defined as abandoned areas where old traces of mining (e. g. factories and buildings, cuts and fills material, other marks in the landscapes, polluted soils) are still present. These areas are waiting for a new evaluation in order to create rural development strategies and local projects. We study how to preserve and protect these authentic high value landscapes and what can be proposed as type of rural strategy and rural landscape management. How to reallocate the space of wastelands according to the valorisation of cultural and natural heritage? Through qualitative document analysis and stakeholders interviews, we are discussing on the basis of two case studies concerning heavy metals mines in Easten Belgium within an hour’s drive from Liège. The first case is the “Haldes calaminaires” area in Plombières (former lead and zinc mine) and the second one is the “Rouge-Thier” area in Stoumont (former manganese mine), both <b>industrial</b> <b>wastelands</b> in rural area with a real potential for rural development in some touristic, recreational, scientific, and pedagogical frameworks (Rosengarten, 2008; Dussart & Dussart, 1991). Different scenarios are possible to allow both sites to be recognized, saved, protected, enhanced, and developed for tourists and inhabitants, but they must confront the divergent heritage, cultural, biological, urban and socio-economic interests and issues of local and regional actors.
