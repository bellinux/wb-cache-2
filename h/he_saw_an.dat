5|$|In 1970 Kujau {{visited his}} family in East Germany and {{discovered}} {{that many of the}} locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Roy {{started to}} play for the University of Washington (UW). He {{remained}} there for four years under head coach Lorenzo Romar. He majored in American Ethnic Studies. After his junior year, Roy considered entering the draft, but changed his mind when he learned that teammate Nate Robinson and high school senior and UW signee Martell Webster intended to enter the draft. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to rise in the ranks on his college team, and improve his draft position.|$|E
5|$|The use of Yehudi {{lights to}} {{camouflage}} aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering {{experiments in the}} Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> aircraft coming in to land over snow suddenly vanish; {{he realized that the}} reflected light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer. Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> episode of the British Millionaire and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and thought again about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, Robert C. Ross founded one of {{the first}} {{hazardous}} waste management companies in the U.S. He began Robert Ross Industrial Disposal because <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to meet the hazardous waste management needs of companies in northern Ohio. In 1958, the company built {{one of the}} first hazardous waste incinerators in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1982 the Yomiuri Shimbun {{published}} an article about yamapikaryaa. An experienced boar hunter claimed to have seen yamapikaryaa about ten times in the mountains around Mount Dedou.

[...] "He was {{standing}} in the king's ship, and <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> great witchwife with a fork and a trough stand on the island. And <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> fowl on every ship's stem, a raven, or else an eagle, and he heard the witchwife sing an evil song." ...|$|R

25|$|From 14 March until 31 December 1899, {{he served}} as Chief of the Admiralty Staff (Admiralstab). In this {{position}} he expressed his concern for {{what he saw as}} Germany's hopeless situation with a weak navy and facing Britain in isolation. One solution <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> alliance with the United States, which was already a valuable trading partner of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Roach had {{observed}} that the British {{were in the process}} of replacing their merchant fleet of dated wooden-hulled paddle steamers with modern iron-hulled, screw-propelled vessels, and he anticipated a similar trend in the United States. Since the iron shipbuilding capacity of the U.S. was still modest, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to fill the anticipated demand with the establishment of an iron shipyard of his own.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, a {{few months}} after the first spate of alleged mutilations in the US, {{multiple}} farmers in Nebraska claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. One claimed <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> object which “looked as if it had a little bluish-green light on each side with a glow surrounding it.” The sightings were hailed by UFO researchers as the first physical evidence of extraterrestrial life.|$|E

25|$|Since his {{election}} in 1968, President Richard M. Nixon had been seeking {{a negotiated settlement}} to the Vietnam War. In 1970, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to buy time for the Saigon government during Vietnamization, the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops {{that began in the}} previous year. He also sought to convince Hanoi that he meant business. That opportunity was provided by the overthrow of Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk by the pro-American General Lon Nol.|$|E
25|$|Barker {{began his}} career as a {{musician}} in his youth with his streetband the Boozan Kings, and also toured Mississippi with Little Brother Montgomery. In 1930 he moved to New York City and switched to the guitar. On the day of his arrival in New York, his uncle Paul took him to the Rhythm Club, where <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> inspiring performance by McKinney's Cotton Pickers. It was their first performance in New York as a band.|$|E
25|$|The 1531 {{apparition}} of Our Lady of Guadalupe {{was reported}} by Saint Juan Diego. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> early morning vision of the Virgin Mary {{in which he was}} instructed to build an abbey on the Hill of Tepeyac in Mexico. The local prelate did not believe his account and asked for a miraculous sign, which was later provided as an icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe permanently imprinted on the saint's cloak where he had gathered roses. Over the years, Our Lady of Guadalupe became a symbol of the Catholic faith in Mexico and the Mexican diaspora.|$|E

25|$|When {{news of the}} {{disaster}} reached Senator William Alden Smith, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to establish an inquiry to investigate marine safety issues. Smith, who was a Republican Senator for Michigan, had previously investigated railroad safety issues and had sponsored many of the safety and operating regulations passed by Congress to govern {{the operations of the}} American rail industry. He realised the need for rapid action if a US inquiry was to be possible before the surviving passengers and crew dispersed and returned home. He first attempted to contact US President William Howard Taft, but was told by the President's secretary that no action was intended.|$|E
25|$|In Political Justice Godwin had {{acknowledged}} that {{an increase in}} the standard of living as he envisioned could cause population pressures, but <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> obvious solution to avoiding distress: “project a change in the structure of human action, if not of human nature, specifically the eclipsing of the desire for sex by the development of intellectual pleasures”. In the 1798 version of his essay, Malthus specifically rejected this possible change in human nature. In the second and subsequent editions, however, he wrote that widespread moral restraint, i.e., postponement of marriage and pre-nuptial celibacy (sexual abstinence), could reduce the tendency of a population to grow until distress was felt.".|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his training in England, he joined 79 Squadron in France. Flying a Sopwith Dolphin, Lord became an ace along {{with four other}} pilots in the squadron: Francis W. Gillet, Ronald Bannerman, John McNeaney, and Edgar Taylor. On June 27, 1918, Lord shot down an Albatros D.V as his third kill. On {{his return to the}} airfield, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> allied formation engaged with several Pfalz scouts. He joined in and shot down a Fokker Dr.I, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He rose to the position of flight commander before being wounded in October. His final score in World War I was an observation balloon and eight aircraft claimed destroyed, three 'out of control'.|$|E
60|$|Looking up, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> {{little white}} blur at the window, and Noel's face just visible.|$|R
60|$|Coming to the station, he went inside. There <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> money-changing window {{which was}} open, so he planked down a five-pound note and got two-hundred-and-ten lire. Here was a start. At <b>a</b> bookstall <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> man buy a big {{timetable}} {{with a large}} railway map in it. He immediately bought the same. Then he retired to a corner to get his whereabouts.|$|R
60|$|When {{he got to}} {{the place}} where the light had come from, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> wretched little cottage, and through a small pane of glass <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> couple of old folks inside. They were very old, and as grey-headed as a pigeon, and the old woman had such a long nose that she sat in the chimney corner and used it to stir the fire.|$|R
