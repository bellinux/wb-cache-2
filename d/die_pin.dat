50|$|The better-known J. T. Marshall gear was a {{modified}} Walschaerts valve gear which was first {{applied to a}} Great Northern Railway mineral locomotive, no. 743, in 1901 and received a glowing report. Next, it was tried on GNR Class C2 No. 1520 in March 1903. There was no external change visible on the locomotive {{as a result of}} this modification. When the valve gear was in use, the motion was derived from two eccentrics, one of which gave lap and lead movement by swinging the link backwards and forwards on its suspension bracket. The other eccentric was set at 90 degrees to the crank and rocked the link by means of a bell crank on the hanging link pin. The position of the radius rod <b>die</b> <b>pin</b> in the link determined the direction of movement and the cutoff. Showing little advantage over the normal Stephenson link valve gear, it was removed from the C2 'Atlantic' in April 1907 to ease maintenance.|$|E

40|$|During {{high-pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) {{of aluminium}} alloys, {{there is a}} tendency for the molten alloy to react with the tool steel <b>die,</b> core <b>pins</b> and inserts. This occurrence within the high pressure die casting (HPDC) industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. It is of concern to high-pressure die casters because of down-time due to the regular removal of the soldered layer and its detrimental affect on die life and casting quality. In this investigation, several physical vapour deposited (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, CrN and TiCN, were evaluated for their ability to eliminate soldering during HPDC of aluminium alloys. Accelerated semi-industrial trials were carried out in a 250 -t Toshiba HPDC machine using a specially designed die made of P 20 tool steel with removable core pins. The results from these trials showed that PVD coatings can act as a physical barrier coating preventing any reaction between the molten aluminium alloy and the tool steel. Thus the problem of soldering on such tools as core pins can be eliminated in high HPDC of aluminium alloys. In the accelerated trials, it was found that soldering was replaced by a built-up layer of cast aluminium alloy, which was less detrimental to tool life and reduced machine down-time due to the reduced need for tool polishing. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research program was to design and develop an optimal coating system that extends die life by minimizing premature die failure. In high-pressure aluminum die-casting, the <b>die,</b> core <b>pins</b> and inserts must withstand severe processing conditions. Many of the dies and tools in the industry are being coated to improve wear-resistance and decrease down-time for maintenance. However, thermal fatigue in metal itself can still be a major problem, especially since it often leads to catastrophic failure (i. e. die breakage) {{as opposed to a}} wear-based failure (parts begin to go out of tolerance). Tooling costs remain the largest portion of production costs for many of these parts, so the ability prevent catastrophic failures would be transformative for the manufacturing industry. The technology offers energy savings through reduced energy use in the die casting process from several factors, including increased life of the tools and dies, reuse of the dies and die components, reduction/elimination of lubricants, and reduced machine down time, and reduction of Al solder sticking on the die. The use of the optimized die coating system will also reduce environmental wastes and scrap parts. Current (2012) annual energy saving estimates, based on initial dissemination to the casting industry in 2010 and market penetration of 80 % by 2020, is 3. 1 trillion BTU's/year.

50|$|The {{physical}} layout of an opto-isolator depends {{primarily on the}} desired isolation voltage. Devices rated {{for less than a}} few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction. The sensor die is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin dual in-line package). The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the LED die. The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared. The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired breakdown voltage. For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75 kV and transients of 1 kV/μs, the clear polyimide sheet in the Avago ASSR-300 series is only 0.08 mm thick. Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet and the configuration of bonding wires that connect the <b>dies</b> with external <b>pins.</b> Real in-circuit isolation voltage is further reduced by creepage over the PCB and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25 mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3 mm/kV for coated conductors.|$|R
40|$|During high {{pressure}} die casting (HPDC) of aluminium alloys {{there is a tendency}} for the molten alloy to react with the steel <b>die,</b> core <b>pins</b> and inserts. This occurrence within the HPDC industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. This is of concern to {{high pressure}} die casters because of down-time, due to regular removal of the soldering, reduced die life and degradation of casting quality. The reaction between the tool steel (usually H 13) and the molten aluminium involves inter-diffusion and the formation of intermetallic phases. To remove this problem the possibility exists of applying a surface treatment to act as a barrier between molten alloy and the die. During the course of this research project several surface treatments were investigated namely PVD (TiN, CrN, TiCN), Duplex PVD (TiN, CrN, TiCN) and Gas Nitriding for soldering prevention during HPDC with aluminium alloy, and their results are compared to uncoated core pins. The coating selection criterion was based on commercial availability of surface treatments in Australia and suitability of coating properties with H 13 tool steel used in molten aluminium alloy (ADC- 12). One of the most important findings made during these experiments was the distinction and characterization of build-up on the surface of PVD coatings. It was found that build-up did not necessarily represent formation of intermetallics (soldering) for PVD surface engineered core pins. It addition build-up did not grow in thickness as previously thought and that build-up was influenced by high fluid flow and temperature during HPDC. The characterization of build-up was a fundamental important step in prolonging the performance of PVD surface engineered core pins in HPDC. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials at Nissan Casting Plant Pty Ltd Australia. The results demonstrate that PVD coatings can improve the resistance to soldering compared to conventional nitrided and un-coated core pins and the need for polishing was eliminated. Knowledge gained during this research program was transferred to NCAP and a guideline for using PVD coatings in HPDC was prepared. A seminar on PVD coating for HPDC was also given to the Australian die casting industry organized by the Australian Die Casting Association (ADCA) ...|$|R

40|$|A probe for {{measuring}} the transport critical current density (J(_c) (B,T)) of superconductors has been constructed, extending the magnetic field and temperature range of previous probes. It can measure critical currents up to 500 A, from 2 K up to 150 K, inside the bore of a 17 T Tesla magnet. The temperature is held constant during measurement to: ± 50 mK at 4. 2 K and below; ± 70 mK at 20 K; ± 100 mK at 80 K and ± 200 mK at 150 K. The J(_c) (B,T) of a Nb(46. 5 wt%) Ti multifilamentary wire has been measured in transverse and longitudinal fields. The longitudinal orientation has both a higher J(_c) and upper critical field. It is found that the orientation, field and temperature dependence of J(_c) (B,T) is described by a single functional form. In particular, the orientation dependence determined only by the upper critical field, the anisotropy of {{which is due to}} variations in the microstructure or flux cutting events. A Bi(_ 2) Sr(_ 2) Ca(_ 2) Cu(_ 3) O(_x) tape has been measured in three different orientations. An anomaly in J(_c) is observed, only below 10 K, at a field B(_ 2) (T) for each orientation. Above IT the data are best described by the function J(_c) (B,T) =a(_j) (T) exp{-B/β(T) }. There is a crossover to a stronger field and temperature dependence of J(_c) at temperatures above 55 K. Close to the irreversibility line there is a markedly different field dependence of J(_c) depending on whether the field is perpendicular or parallel to the tape surface. A new description has been put forward to explain the data. It is suggested that the intergrain material of the tape is a low Tc BSCCO phase, possibly die 2201 or 2011 phase, of which B,(T) is die upper critical field. Above 10 K, in fields less than IT, J(_c) is determined by coupling across S-N-S Josephson junctions at the grain boundaries. Above IT, current mainly flows between grains by connections which allow it to remain in the crystal ab-planes. J(_c) (B,T) is then determined by intrinsic properties and follows the exponential functional form. This form is determined by die average field component parallel to the c-axis. It is proposed that collective pinning theory offers the best framework for describing J(_c), in which case the crossover could be due to a pinning phase transition. The J(_c) (B,T) of some Bi(_ 2) Sr(_ 2) Ca(_ 1) Cu(_ 2) O(_x), multifilamentary wires is explained using the same description of S-N-S coupling and ab-plane connections as for the 2223 -tape. However, whereas the tape was highly aligned throughout, each wire filament has aligned grains in the region of die BSCCO-Ag interface but an untextured core. It is in the aligned regions of each filament that most of die ab-plane connections exist. Increasing the number of filaments therefore improves the wire performance in high fields, though phase purity and density are still important. The 19 and 37 filament wires are promising for high field applications below 20 K. The results on the BiSrCaCuO tape and wires demonstrate that, in this material, J(_c) (B,T) can be improved with better texturing and connectivity between grains. To advance the theory a better understanding of <b>die</b> average <b>pinning</b> potentials in BSCCO is required...|$|R
40|$|Hot {{extrusion}} {{of aluminum}} is widely practiced in industries for economic production of structural components. The surface finish and tolerance of the extruded components, both from design and aesthetic requirement, are important parameters. Hot extrusion involves forcing of aluminum {{in the form}} of a billet at a predetermined temperature through a shaped opening called die. Attempts, over time, are made to evolve the die profile to produce quality components. The main geometric feature of the die enables it in imparting plastic deformation and subsequent surface generation of the extrudate. The surface of extrudate is generated on the portion of the die called bearing channel or die land. Aluminum metal which moves relative to bearing channel experiences a different state-of-stress as it passes through the bearing channel. At the entry side of the bearing channel, the stress is compressive which is large in magnitude and this magnitude of compressive stress gets diminished as metal moves towards exit side and eventually becomes zero at the exit. Temperature gradients and its distribution along the bearing channel, similar to stress gradient, are reported. Literature reports formation of the transfer layer on the bearing channel. The transfer layer is of two distinctive types, the one near entry side which virtually leads to contact between aluminum and die steel and the other nearer to exit side which isolates aluminum from die steel. The understanding of the mechanism of formation of transfer layer is most important since it is instrumental in determining the surface finish of the extruded component. All of the previous studies were conducted either in an actual extrusion press or using an instrumented extrusion press in the laboratory. The variables during these experiments could be the temperature of billet, extrusion ratio and speed of ram. Conducting these experiments using extrusion press is expensive and time consuming. To do experiments where the condition in a bearing channel can be simulated would be useful in conducting a more comprehensive study. To simulate the condition in the bearing channel a high temperature vacuum based pin-on-disc machine is designed and built. The fact that in a bearing channel there is virtually metal to metal contact with minimal or no chance of any intervening oxide layer, necessitated studies to be conducted under vacuum. A pin-on-disc test conducted under vacuum and high temperature would almost simulate condition on a bearing channel. Using this specially designed and built experimental setup the parameters influencing the transfer layer formation, temperature, sliding speed, load on the specimen, vacuum level and surface characteristics of the die are studied. Another feature of the test rig is that the configuration of pin and disc setup is vertical, which is different from regular pin on disc tribo-system, where pin and disc are held in horizontal configuration. The advantage of holding in vertical configuration is to eliminate the possibility of trapping the debris which alters the existing friction force and conditions. The test rig is constructed using a cylindrical shell and a matching dome shell. The test rig, to facilitate the isolation of the instrumentations used to measure the forces and wear from the heat source is partitioned into two portions. The cylindrical bottom compartment called test chamber and dome shaped top compartment called sensor chambers are separated by a plate. On the plate in the sensor chamber, a load-cell to pickup friction force, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) to measure linear wear and loading lever mechanisms for imparting normal load and measuring friction force are fitted. The lever mechanism, in particular the one which magnifies the normal load is designed to conserve the space in the vacuum chamber. Housing the instrumentation inside the vacuum chamber thereby reducing the number of ports required to sense mechanical signals, increases the efficiency of the pumping system. The cylindrical shell of the testing chamber is a double walled structure and water cooled in order to prevent the exposer of sensors to higher testing temperature. Rubber ‘O’ rings are used, wherever it is required to seal the vacuum. The necessary temperature required at the contact interface in the testing chamber is obtained by an electric resistance furnace, which is configured in such a way in the chamber that the heat generated is completely directed to the area where pin and disc are positioned. The interface temperature is monitored using a chromal-alumal thermocouple which is fixed very close to sliding interface on the pin holder. The power input to the furnace is controlled using PID (proportional integral derivative). The required sliding speed is achieved with the help of direct current (DC) servomotor. The shaft on which the disc or ring is fixed is connected to a timer-pulley. The timer-pulley in turn is connected to servomotor through a timer-belt. The diameter ratio of the driving pulley and driven -timer-pulley is selected in such a way that the rpm of driven-pulley is reduced by four times and the torque increased by four times resulting in a more stable mechanical input to the sliding pair. The necessary high vacuum level in the test chamber is created by using rotary pump and diffusion pump combination. Following tests are carried out. 1. Compression test: The strain rate response of aluminum (6060) under compressive state of loading is studied at strain rates 10 - 3 s- 1, 10 - 2 s- 1, 10 - 1 s- 1, 1 s- 1, 10 s- 1 and 102 sand temperature ranging from 573 to 823 K. The compression specimen is machined out of homogenized aluminum alloy (6060) cast ingots. True stress and true strain are estimated from load-displacement data of compression test. The true stress and true strain data are made use of in predicting the friction coefficient and sliding mode during sliding of aluminum relative to die steel at various temperature and other independent variables in vacuum. 2. The tensile test: A series of tensile tests at different temperatures and 10 - 1 s- 1 strain rate are conducted. The temperatures employed are from 423 K to 723 K. True stress, true strain, ultimate tensile strength and total percentage of elongation are estimated using load displacement data. The estimated ultimate tensile strength and total percentage of elongation are used for qualitatively explaining the morphology of transfer layer formed in the sliding experiments under different independent variables like temperature, speed, normal load, and surface texture of steel surface. 3. Adhesion test: The interaction at different temperature between the die steel (H 11) and aluminum (6060) pair under static load is studied by conducting test in vacuum. The pin is made of homogenized aluminum and disc is made of die steel whose surface is generated by polishing on diamond paste until the average surface roughness (Sa) is of the order of 0. 1 microns. The test temperatures are varied from 423 to 723 K. The result is used in qualitatively explaining the morphology of transfer layer formed during sliding of aluminum and die steel pair in vacuum at various temperature, speeds and, normal load. 4. Sliding experiment: Steel pin and aluminum disc Pin on disc experiments are conducted at different temperatures in vacuum of the order of 4 X 10 - 4 Pa. The experiments are conducted employing factorial design. The temperature, speed and load are the experimental parameters. The pin and disc are respectively made out of die steel and aluminum. Experiments are carried out with normal loads 20 N, 40 N, 63 N, 80 N, and 100 N and speeds 0. 1 ms- 1, 0. 3 ms- 1, 0. 5 ms- 1, 1. 0 ms- 1, and 1. 5 ms- 1 and with temperature over a range from 423 to 773 K. The sliding distance covered is 500 meters. The friction force during sliding is monitored and used for estimating friction coefficient. Scanning electron microscopic study is carried out on surface, subsurface, wear track. The results, specifically, the friction coefficient and morphology of transfer layer are used to evaluate the influence of independent parameters on transfer mechanisms. The data generated from subsurface study and compression tests are used for estimating friction coefficient using Rigney’s plastic deformation model at 0. 1 ms- 1. 5. Sliding experiment: aluminum pin and Steel disc The experiments reported in the previous paragraph where aluminum disc is slid against <b>die</b> steel <b>pin</b> had developed only the stresses of the order 16 MPa. The estimated magnitude of stress level on bearing surface of extrusion die by various methods including numerical analysis is found to be more than 16 MPa. In order to achieve a higher magnitude of stress and preserve the transfer layer mechanism, sliding an aluminum pin over the part of the textured surface of die steel ring is carried out. The changed boundary condition resulted in a nominal stress of 28 MPa which is comparatively more at 723 K. The experiments are conducted employing factorial design. The other advantage of doing these experiments is that the effect of texture on the die surface can be studied by sliding aluminum pin over various surfaces. Thus temperature and surface texture are the experimental parameters for the present test. Different textured die steel surface is generated by machining process like, milling, electro discharge machining (EDM), wire electro discharge machining, silicon carbide slurry polishing, silicon carbide wheel grinding, CNC-milling and diamond paste polishing. Thus surfaces are basically of two types 1) with a lay on the surface and 2) a random surface. The tests are conducted at ambient temperature, 423, 573, 673, and 723 K with a normal load of 56 N and speed of 0. 129 ms- 1. The morphology of transfer layer on the die steel ring is studied in scanning electron microscope. The friction coefficient is estimated from monitored|$|R
