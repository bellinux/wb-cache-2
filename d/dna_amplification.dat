In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification,</b> and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a consensus sequence. Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E
25|$|Nested PCR: {{increases}} {{the specificity of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification,</b> by reducing background due to non-specific amplification of DNA. Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. In the first reaction, one pair of primers is used to generate DNA products, which besides the intended target, may still consist of non-specifically amplified DNA fragments. The product(s) are then used in a second PCR {{with a set of}} primers whose binding sites are completely or partially different from and located 3' of each of the primers used in the first reaction. Nested PCR is often more successful in specifically amplifying long DNA fragments than conventional PCR, but it requires more detailed knowledge of the target sequences.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{expression}} of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-erbB 2 and their correlation with human papillomavirus (HPV) status and prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. The expression of EGFR and c-erbB 2 was studied at the protein level using the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining method, at the RNA level using the ribonuclease protection assay and at the DNA level using Southern blot and hybridization method. One hundred and one patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were recruited. Fifty-one patients were of stage 1 B/ 2 A and 50 patients were of stage 2 B and above. Positive IHC stainings of EGFR and c-erbB 2 proteins were found in 74. 2 and 19. 8 % of cases, respectively. <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications</b> of EGFR and c-erbB 2 genes were detected in 35. 4 and 17. 2 %, respectively. Of the patients showing positive EGFR and c-erbB 2 staining, only 39. 2 and 25 %, respectively, showed <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications.</b> RNA overexpression of EGFR or c-erbB 2 was only detected in 2 % of cervical cancers and was associated with positive staining and <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications.</b> HPV was detected in 79. 2 % of the cases by HPV consensus primers L 1, in 57. 4 % for HPV 16 and 27. 7 % for HPV 18.

25|$|Another {{approach}} for measuring mRNA abundance is RT-qPCR. In this technique, reverse transcription {{is followed by}} quantitative PCR. Reverse transcription first generates a DNA template from the mRNA; this single-stranded template is called cDNA. The cDNA template is then amplified in the quantitative step, during which the fluorescence emitted by labeled hybridization probes or intercalating dyes changes as the <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> process progresses. With a carefully constructed standard curve, qPCR can produce an absolute measurement {{of the number of}} copies of original mRNA, typically in units of copies per nanolitre of homogenized tissue or copies per cell. qPCR is very sensitive (detection of a single mRNA molecule is theoretically possible), but can be expensive {{depending on the type of}} reporter used; fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes are more expensive than non-specific intercalating fluorescent dyes.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplification</b> by the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable microsatellites, also known as short tandem repeats (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the Mengele case. STR profiling was further refined {{by a team of}} scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the UK National DNA Database (NDNAD) in 1995. With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen micro satellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database {{whether or not they are}} convicted (different rules apply in Scotland). The national database now contains the DNA information of nearly five million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database, and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.|$|E

40|$|Nucleotide and deduced {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} of three (beta-keratins of Nile crocodile scales are presented. Using 5 '- and 3 '-RACE analysis, two cDNA sequences of 1 kb (Cr-gptrp- 1) and 1. 5 kb (Cr-gptrp- 2) were determined, corresponding to 17. 4 and 19. 3 kDa proteins, respectively, and a pI of 8. 0. In genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications,</b> we {{determined that the}} 5 '-UTR of Cr-gptrp- 2 contains an intron of 621 nucleotides. In addition, we isolated a third gene (Cr-gptrp- 3) in genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications</b> that exhibits seven amino acid differences with Cr-gptrp- 2. Genomic organization of the sequenced crocodilian beta-keratin genes is similar to avian beta-keratin genes. Deduced proteins are rich in glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, and contain cysteines toward the N- and C-terminal regions, likely {{for the formation of}} disulfide bonds. Prediction of the secondary structure suggests that the central core box of 20 amino acids contains two beta-strands and has 75 - 90 % identity with chick beta-keratins. Toward the C-terminus, numerous glycine-glycine-tyrosine and glycine-glycine-leucine repeats are present, which may contribute to making crocodile scales hard. In situ hybridization shows expression of beta-keratin genes in differentiating beta-cells of epidermal transitional layers. Phylogenetic analysis of the available archosaurian and lepidosaurian beta-keratins suggests that feather keratins diversified early from nonfeather keratins, deep in archosaur evolution. However, only the complete knowledge of all crocodilian beta-keratins will confirm whether feather keratins have an origin independent of those in bird scales, which preceded the split between birds and crocodiles.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a survey of}} genetic changes by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in 11 human breast cancer cell lines recently established in our laboratory. The most common gains took place at 8 q (73 %), 1 q (64 %), 7 q (64 %), 3 q (45 %) and 7 p (45 %), whereas losses were most frequent at Xp (54 %), 8 p (45 %), 18 q (45 %) and Xq (45 %). Many of the cell lines displayed prominent, localized <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications</b> by CGH. One-third of these loci affected breast cancer oncogenes, whose amplifications were validated with specific probes: 17 q 12 (two cell lines with ERBB 2 amplifications), 11 q 13 (two with cyclin-D 1), 8 p 11 âp 12 (two with FGFR 1) and 10 q 25 (one with FGFR 2). Gains and amplifications affecting 8 q were the most common genetic alterations in these cell lines with the minimal, common region of involvement at 8 q 22 âq 23. No high-level MYC (at 8 q 24) amplifications were found {{in any of the}} cell lines. Two-thirds of the amplification sites took place at loci not associated with established oncogenes, such as 1 q 41 âq 43, 7 q 21 âq 22, 7 q 31, 8 q 23, 9 p 21 âp 23, 11 p 12 âp 14, 15 q 12 âq 14, 16 q 13 âq 21, 17 q 23, 20 p 11 âp 12 and 20 q 13. Several of these locations have not been previously reported and may harbour important genes whose amplification is selected for during cancer development. In summary, this set of breast cancer cell lines displaying prominent <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications</b> should facilitate discovery and functional analysis of genes and signal transduction pathways contributing to breast cancer development.

Our earlier studies discovered impaired COPD alveolar macrophage responses to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands of nontypeable H. influenzae and provide rationale for further evaluation of TLR signaling. While {{the role of}} TLR single nucleotide polymorphisms is increasingly recognized in inflammatory diseases, TLR single nucleotide polymorphisms in COPD have only recently been explored. We hypothesized that specific TLR polymorphisms are associated with dysfunctional innate immune COPD alveolar macrophage responses and investigated polymorphisms of TLR 2 (Arg 753 Gln), TLR 4 (Thr 399 Ile; Asp 299 Gly), and TLR 9 (T 1486 C; T 1237 C).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications</b> alter {{gene dosage}} in cancer genomes by {{multiplying}} the gene copy number. Amplifications are quintessential in {{a considerable number}} of advanced cancers of various anatomical locations. The aims of this study were to classify human cancers based on their amplification patterns, explore the biological and clinical fundamentals behind their amplification-pattern based classification, and understand the characteristics in human genomic architecture that associate with amplification mechanisms. Methods We applied a machine learning approach to model <b>DNA</b> copy number <b>amplifications</b> using a data set of binary amplification records at chromosome sub-band resolution from 4400 cases that represent 82 cancer types. Amplification data was fused with background data: clinical, histological and biological classifications, and cytogenetic annotations. Statistical hypothesis testing was used to mine associations between the data sets. Results Probabilistic clustering of each chromosome identified 111 amplification models and divided the cancer cases into clusters. The distribution of classification terms in the amplification-model based clustering of cancer cases revealed cancer classes that were associated with specific <b>DNA</b> copy number <b>amplification</b> models. Amplification patterns â finite or bounded descriptions of the ranges of the amplifications in the chromosome â were extracted from the clustered data and expressed according to the original cytogenetic nomenclature. This was achieved by maximal frequent itemset mining using the cluster-specific data sets. The boundaries of amplification patterns were shown to be enriched with fragile sites, telomeres, centromeres, and light chromosome bands. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that amplifications are non-random chromosomal changes and specifically selected in tumor tissue microenvironment. Furthermore, statistical evidence showed that specific chromosomal features co-localize with amplification breakpoints and link them in the amplification process. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Induction {{of cancer}} can be {{associated}} for {{the expression of}} viral oncoproteins, the most important E6 and E7, or other [...] mechanisms many of them run by the integration such as the generation of altered transcripts, disruption of tumor suppressors, high levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>amplifications,</b> interchromosomial rearrangements, or changes in DNA methylation patterns, the latter being able to find even when the virus is identified in episomes. E6 sequesters p53 to promote p53 degradation while pRb inhibits E7. p53 prevents cell growth when DNA is damaged by activating apoptosis and p21, a kinase that blocks the formation of cyclin D / Cdk4 avoiding pRb phosphorylation and thereby prevents release of E2F is a transcription factor required for activation of genes involved in cell proliferation. pRb remains bound to E2F while this action phosphorylated preventing activation of proliferation.
