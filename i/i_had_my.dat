The following day, Reid accepted a coaching role assisting Williams {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Although he was yet to feature for the club that season due to injury, Reid still harboured hopes of playing again and told Forest Player HD “I’m going to be coupling this with my rehab – <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> operation four weeks ago – and I’m still trying to get back".|$|E

Later, especially after rock 'n' roll came along, I made the 'rumba' bass part heavier and heavier. I'd have the string bass, an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> editor count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in}} the film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.|$|E

[...] The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she had trouble convincing {{executives}} at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> first solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E
500|$|Power was {{released}} in the United States on September 13, 1988, through Sire on vinyl, compact disc, and cassette. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 on October 1, 1988, at number 102. Power stayed on this chart for 33 weeks and peaked at number 35 on November 12, 1988. While touring to support Power, Ice-T visited schools as a mentor [...] "telling the students of his shady past and profitable present". By January 1989, Power had sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States and went gold. A profanity-free version of the record was never released. Ice-T compared this {{to the release of}} N.W.A.'s album, stating that he felt releasing a clean album was [...] "selling out" [...] and that [...] "N.W.A. made more money because of it, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> integrity." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Love aborted {{her acting}} career and left New York, {{returning}} to the West Coast, citing the [...] "celebutante" [...] fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping {{in the small town}} of McMinnville, Oregon, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to Anchorage, Alaska, where she lived for three months to [...] "gather her thoughts," [...] supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. [...] "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. [...] "So I went on this sort of vision quest. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the loss}} of the steelworks, David Riley, the {{chairman}} of Jarrow Borough Council, told a rally of the town's unemployed in July 1936: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> way I would organise the unemployed of the whole country... and march them on London so they would all arrive at the same time. The government would then be forced to listen, or turn the military [...] on us". The idea of a march was taken up with enthusiasm by the mayor Billy Thompson, by Wilkinson, and by political, commercial and religious groups. It was decided that the march would be a local affair, representing the town, with no political connotations. It would be limited to 200 fit men who would arrive in London {{at the start of the}} new parliamentary session [...] on 3 November 1936, when a petition from the town would be presented to the House of Commons.|$|E

Afterwards he got a call to provide something to the soundtrack, the singer saw some scenes of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] and thought to himself [...] "that song I started might be perfect for this". He admitted to have the tune halfway done before visualizing an early cut of the film and, inspired by its characters, put together the finishing touches. In an interview with Billboard, he went on detail [...] "I just had this melody in my head and basically laid it down after I saw the film." [...] He had to watch [...] "most of the movie" [...] to feel [...] "the vibe", as well as its direction.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Johnson began his {{recording}} career, {{he was a}} well-known evangelist with a [...] "remarkable technique and {{a wide range of}} songs", as noted by the blues historian Paul Oliver. On December 3, 1927, Johnson was assembled along with Billiken Johnson and Coley Jones at a temporary studio that talent scout Frank Buckley Walker had set up in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Dallas to record for Columbia Records. In the ensuing session, Johnson played six selections, 13 takes in total, and was accompanied by Willie B. Harris on his first recording, [...] "I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole". Among the other songs Johnson recorded in Dallas were [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", [...] "It's Nobody's Fault but Mine", [...] "Mother's Children Have a Hard Time", [...] "Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground", and [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>My</b> Way I'd Tear the Building Down". He was compensated with $50 per [...] "usable" [...] side—a substantial amount for the period—and a bonus to forfeit royalties from sales of the records.|$|E
500|$|In May 2008, Johansson {{released}} her debut album Anywhere I Lay My Head, {{which consists of}} one original song and ten cover versions of Tom Waits' songs, and features David Bowie and members from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Celebration. Reviews of the album were mixed. Spin was not particularly impressed with Johansson's singing. Some critics {{found it to be}} [...] "surprisingly alluring", [...] "a bravely eccentric selection", and [...] "a brilliant album" [...] with [...] "ghostly magic". NME named the album the [...] "23rd best album of 2008"; it peaked at number126 on the Billboard 200. Johansson later spoke of the opportunity she had to record the album, adding, [...] "I thought I would do maybe an album of standards, because I'm not a songwriter. I'm a vocalist." [...] She started listening to Waits when she was 11 or 12 years old. In an interview, Johansson said of Waits, [...] "His melodies are so beautiful, his voice is so distinct and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> own way of doing Tom Waits songs." ...|$|E
500|$|With Indicud, {{on several}} tracks Cudi took a {{backseat}} in vocals to rather showcase his production skills.

[...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to hear him say something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E

500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things before I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E
500|$|Johnson, {{accompanied}} by Harris, returned to Dallas on December 5, 1928, to record [...] "I'm Gonna Run to the City of Refuge", [...] "Jesus Is Coming Soon", [...] "Lord I Just Can't Keep From Crying", and [...] "Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning". Two unreleased and untitled tracks were also recorded by Johnson under the pseudonym Blind Texas Marlin, but the master tapes {{of the session}} have never been recovered. Another year passed before Johnson recorded again, on December 10 and 11, 1929, the longest sessions of his career. He completed ten sides in 16 takes at Werlein's Music Store in New Orleans, also recording some duets with an unknown female singer, who {{is thought to have}} been a member of Reverend J. M. Gates's congregation, according to Johnson's biographer D.N. Blakey. The blind street performer Dave Ross reported observing Johnson performing on the street in New Orleans in December 1929. According to a story heard by the jazz historian Richard Allen, Johnson was arrested while performing in front of the Custom House on Canal Street, for allegedly attempting to incite a riot with his impassioned rendition of [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>My</b> Way I'd Tear the Building Down".|$|E
500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more. Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / Eyes wide open can't you see / <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> first heels by the age of 13".|$|E
