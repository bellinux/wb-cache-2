Not once only since the sun rose has my mind been empty as a drum. Then something struck on it, perhaps the holy Tanofir, perhaps another, and it knew what note to sound. So it was when I cursed you in the boat. So it was when I walked back with the eunuch, meaning to kill him on the road, and then remembered that {{the death of one}} vile eunuch would not help you at all, whereas alive he could bring me to the presence of the King, if I paid him, as I did out of the gold in your purse which I carried. Moreover he earned his hire, for when the King grew <b>dull,</b> <b>wine</b> not yet having taken a hold on him, it was he who brought me to his mind as one who might amuse him, being so ugly and different from others, if only for a few minutes, after the women dancers had failed to do so." ...|$|E
5000|$|The grape is a {{relatively}} easy to grow due to high resistance to various vine and grape disease such as coulure. It does have some susceptibility to oidium though. The vine can be very prolific producing yields that often average 7 tons per acre (120 hl/ha). A negative consequences of these high yields is that this normally magnifies the grape's naturally low acidity level which, if not corrected during winemaking, can produce [...] "flabby" [...] and <b>dull</b> <b>wines.</b> Being produced in generally cool climates, the grape is often chaptalized to boost the alcohol levels. In the past some producers would excessively chaptalize {{to the point where}} the higher sugar levels would stun the yeast during fermentation, leaving noticeable amounts of residual sugar and sweetness in the wine.|$|R

50|$|Years {{passed and}} Lyrcus {{and his wife}} had no children. Lyrcus made a journey to the oracle at Didyma to ask how he might obtain offspring. The answer was that he would beget a child with the first woman whom he bedded after leaving the shrine. Happily he hurried towards home and wife, but on the journey, when he arrived at Bybastus (or Bubastos), he was entertained by Staphylus, who welcomed Lyrcus in a {{friendly}} manner and enticed him to much drinking of wine. When Lyrcus had his senses <b>dulled</b> with <b>wine,</b> Staphylus united Lyrcus with Staphylus's own daughter Hemithea, having heard the prediction of the oracle and desiring to have descendants born to Hemithea.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{the wine}} region is known {{primarily}} for wine tourism, {{catering to the}} visitors of Lake Bolsena north of Rome, with comparatively little Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone being exported. Among wine critics, the wine often receives mixed opinions with wine experts such as Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson describing in The World Atlas of Wine Est! Est!! Est!!! di Montefiascone as [...] "usually the <b>dullest</b> white <b>wine</b> with the strangest name in the world." [...] Wine writers Joe Bastianich and David Lynch compares Est! Est!!
