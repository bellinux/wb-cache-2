5|$|The {{agriculture}} of {{the parish}} is chiefly confined to grazing, and would be more materially benefited by draining; but the tax upon brick, a most essential article in this process, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> great hindrance to it. The use of lime—imported from Wales, and brought by the inland navigations to the neighbourhood of our collieries—has become very general in {{the improvement of the}} meadow and pasture lands.|$|E
5|$|The Plateau Mount Royal borough was {{a working}} class francophone area. The largest {{neighbourhood}} is the Plateau (not {{to be confused}} with the whole borough), which is undergoing considerable gentrification, and a 2001 study deemed it as Canada's most creative neighbourhood because artists comprise 8% of its labour force. The neighbourhood of Mile End in the northwestern part of the borough, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> multicultural area of the city, and features two of Montreal's well-known bagel establishments, St-Viateur Bagel and Fairmount Bagel. The McGill Ghetto is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough, its name being derived from the fact that it is home to thousands of McGill University students and faculty members.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{coal mining}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{dangerous}} {{activity and the}} list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one.

25|$|Beer brewing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} {{industry for}} Haarlem {{going back to}} the 15th century, when there were no fewer than 100 breweries in the city. When the town's 750th anniversary was celebrated in 1995 a group of enthusiasts re-created an original Haarlem beer and brewed it again. The beer is called Jopenbier, or Jopen for short, named after an old type of beer barrel.|$|E

25|$|The {{wearing of}} hijab in France <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{controversial}} issue since 1989. The debate essentially concerns whether Muslim girls {{who choose to}} wear hijab may do so in state schools. A secondary issue is how to protect the free choice and other rights of young Muslim women {{who do not want}} the veil, but who may face strong pressure from families or traditionalists. Similar issues exist for civil servants and for acceptance of male Muslim medics in medical services.|$|E
25|$|After a 27% loss {{of funding}} from the Department of Transport, Chief Executives of Wiltshire and Swindon Camera Safety Partnership decided to switch off all fixed speed cameras, causing the loss of 40 jobs. Despite a 33% {{reduction}} in deaths and injuries on Wiltshire roads the decision to close the partnership was made in early August 2010. ACC Geenty said 'This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> difficult decision and one that the partners have agonised over because we are of course committed to continuing to improve road safety'.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, Colombia {{became the}} number one {{producer}} and exporter of premium mild washed coffee in the world. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant achievement, attained by the combined efforts of the private sector, the gremial organizations and the Federation's institutions. The successful model of Colombian coffee production and commerce is {{the outcome of a}} well balanced combination of efficient private enterprise and a well planned macroeconomic policy by the government. This economic model has become the organizational archetype for more than fifty coffee producing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.|$|E

25|$|Postage stamps {{are also}} object of a {{particular}} form of collecting. Stamp collecting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular hobby. In some cases, when demand greatly exceeds supply, their commercial value on this specific market may become enormously greater than face value, even after use. For some postal services the sale of stamps to collectors who will never use them is {{a significant source of}} revenue; for example, stamps from Tokelau, South Georgia & South Sandwich Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Niuafo´ou and many others. Stamp collecting is commonly known as philately, although strictly the latter term refers to the study of stamps.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{coal mining}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{dangerous}} activity, {{and the list}} of historical coal mining disasters is long. The principal hazards are mine wall failures and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Chronic lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black lung) were once common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy. In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung {{every year in the}} US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers). Rates may be higher than reported in some regions.|$|E
25|$|Trade <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{significant}} factor of the People's Republic of China's economy. In the twenty-five {{years that followed}} {{the founding of the}} Republic in 1949, China's trade institutions developed into a partially modern but somewhat inefficient system. The drive to modernize the economy that began in 1978 required a sharp acceleration in commodity flows and greatly improved efficiency in economic transactions. In the ensuing years economic reforms were adopted by the government to develop a socialist market economy. This type of economy combined central planning with market mechanisms. The changes resulted in the decentralization and expansion of domestic and foreign trade institutions, as well as a greatly enlarged role for free markets in the distribution of goods, and a prominent role for foreign trade and investment in economic development.|$|E

25|$|The {{non-deterministic}} property <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> valuable one, as it {{lets the}} user abstract {{a large number}} of properties (depending on what the net is used for). In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, timed Petri nets have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the stochastic Petri nets that add nondeterministic time through adjustable randomness of the transitions. The exponential random distribution is usually used to 'time' these nets. In this case, the nets' reachability graph {{can be used as a}} continuous time Markov chain (CTMC).|$|E
25|$|China's chief {{interest}} {{in the region of}} the Great Golden Peninsula was the expansion of its economic activities, namely trade. Foreign trade <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant factor in maintaining stability and in contributing to growth in China. Chinese merchants were constantly pushing south as trade with Burma thrived. The Chinese province of Yunnan – where the Mekong River, previously used for illegal migration, flows - is China's main avenue for trade with the Nanyang. Yunnan is a landlocked province that possesses a well-developed industrial base with cheap labor and a fast-growing economy. Its proximity to the Nanyang region has been complemented by its remoteness from Beijing's control – the region was the last stronghold of anti-communist forces. It has for years sought a foreign market for its goods and an outlet to sea; due to the ideal conditions described above and its easy access to the Mekong River, it has begun gaining access to the several markets of the Nanyang, particularly Burma and Laos.|$|E

Its stated utopian aim is to [...] "clear the planet", to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations. Scientology teaches {{that the source of}} people's unhappiness lies in [...] "engrams", psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of counselling called [...] "auditing" [...] made available by the Church of Scientology.|$|E
50|$|Duke Ellington didn't write much solo piano music, which, {{for one of}} {{the most}} {{distinguished}} composers, arrangers and Big Band leaders, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bit unusual.
