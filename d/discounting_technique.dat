Data sparseness is an inherent and a severe problem in language modeling. Smoothing {{is one of the}} important processes to handle this problem. There are several well-known smoothing techniques which are used to solve data sparseness problem. In general, smoothing techniques ignore linguistic knowledge and are particularly based on statistical hypotheses. Good Turing is very effective for data sparseness problem but it has a drawback that it calculates zero probability if frequency of next frequency is zero. Consequently a new technique is presented in this study, which is percentage <b>discounting</b> <b>technique</b> and this technique can overcome the drawback of Good Turing smoothing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Critical {{decisions}} are made by decision-makers throughout the life-cycle of large-scale projects. These {{decisions are}} crucial as they have a direct impact upon the outcome {{and the success of}} projects. To aid decision-makers in the decision making process we present an evidential reasoning framework. This approach utilizes the Dezert-Smarandache theory to fuse heterogeneous evidence sources that suffer from levels of uncertainty, imprecision and conflicts to provide beliefs for decision options. To analyze the impact of source reliability and priority upon the decision making process, a reliability <b>discounting</b> <b>technique</b> and a priority <b>discounting</b> <b>technique,</b> are applied. A maximal consistent subset is constructed to aid in defining where discounting should be applied.

40|$|Crucial {{decisions}} are necessary throughout the life-cycle of large-scale construction projects. Such {{decisions are}} critical {{in that they}} have a direct impact upon the outcomes and success of a given project. To improve the decision process, an evidential reasoning framework based on the Dezert-Smarandache theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, where heterogeneous evidence sources are fused together, is described and used here. Though they usually contain various levels of uncertainty, imprecision, and conflicts, the sources provide beliefs for decision making; usually the combination of these sources of evidence, with different reliabilities, is done by the classical Shafer’s discounting approach. This means that when considering unequal importance of sources, if any, a similar reliability discounting process is generally used, making no difference between the notion of importance and reliability. In multicriteria decision making, however, these notions should be clearly distinguished. This paper is to analyse the impact of source reliability and importance (priority) upon the decision making process.

40|$|Abstract: Vaccines have {{features}} that require special consideration when assessing their cost-effectiveness.

Advisory committees on public funding for vaccines, or for pharmaceuticals in general, should be knowledgable about these special features. We discuss key issues and difficulties in decision making for vaccines against rotavirus, human papillomavirus, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We argue that guidelines for economic evaluation should be reconsidered generally to recommend (1) modelling options {{for the assessment of}} interventions against infectious diseases; (2) a wider perspective to account for impacts on third parties, if relevant; (3) a wider scope of costs than health-care system costs alone, if appropriate; and (4) alternative <b>discounting</b> <b>techniques</b> to explore social time preference over long periods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the choice}} of an inter-generational discount rate {{as well as a}} method for inter-generational discounting. It is shown that the pure time preference rate is irrelevant for inter-generational comparisons. However, the application of the growth time preference rate - with respect to consumption - is a necessary condition for inter-temporal utility maximisation. Opportunity costs should be taken into account not by discounting with their internal rate of return, but by calculating consumption equivalents (shadow prices of capital). Thus, an intergenerational discount rate has {{to be based on the}} time preference approach. These considerations lead us to the formulation of a new <b>discounting</b> <b>technique,</b> "Generation Adjusted Discounting" (GAD). It takes into account intra- as well as inter-generational aspects. Compared with conventional discounting techniques, we find that the present values obtained by using the GAD noticeably exceed those derived conventionally. generation-adjusted discounting; intergenerational discounting; intragenerational discounting; opportunity cost rate; time preference rate; long-term decision making. ...|$|E
40|$|Within this paper, we analyse the {{fulfilment}} of the Kyoto-emissions reduction com-mitment exemplary in Germany and its implication {{on long-term}} paths of all macro-variables. Germany, {{like all other}} industrial or Annex B coun-tries, has to reduce its emissions by 2010 and after {{what we call a}} "Kyoto-forever-scenario". We exemplary investigate tradable permits as reduction measures in a national OverLapping Generations (OLG) -model, where we change the <b>discounting</b> <b>technique</b> by using generation adjusted discounting (GAD) in comparison to conventional OLG-models. We show that within our model-framework Germany is able to develop along growing paths of e. g. GDP in sharp contrast to conventional results of OLG-simulations. At the same time, nowadays living generations have to share higher burdens in terms of lower GDP, per capita consumption and employment which can be interpreted, firstly, as contemporary costs for reaching sustainable paths and, secondly, contributions for internalising intertemporal external effects. However, all costs in terms of lower macro-variables for current living generations are overcompensated by higher future values of them. This effect can be interpreted as intertemporal application of full cost-bearance, or, in other words, the polluter pay principle which is oriented on the sustainability of GHG abatement...|$|E

The decoder produces a hierarchical (tree-) structure of words and semantic category symbols by use of the so-called hierarchical language model (HLM). We discuss generation of HLM by mixing rulebased and data-driven language model (LM) generation techniques, namely weighted regular expressions, n-grams and exact LM.

The mobile travel information system developed at The Nottingham Trent University enables the integration of data concerning traffic flows and individual journey plans thus {{making it possible to}} perform optimisation of travel. This paper focuses on the issue of provision of real-time information about urban travel and assistance with planning travel. Nottingham’s SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique) traffic-light control system provides real-time information about the link travel times within certain areas of the city. However, rather than using link travel times {{at the time of the}} request, it is more effective to predict the link travel times for the time of travel along the particular links. The future link travel times depend upon the historical travel time of the link (for the specific time step in the day) as well as the current link travel time. Consequently, the link weights are a combination of real-time data, historical data and static data. Three prediction methods have been implemented and tested in the context of Nottingham’s urban road network.

40|$|Abstract. 1 In Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) systems, {{acoustic}} and Language Models (LM) must be integrated. To get optimum CSR performances, it {{is well-known}} that heuristic factors must be optimised. Due to its great effect on final CSR performances, the exponential scaling factor applied to LM probabilities {{is the most}} important. LM probabilities are obtained after applying a smoothing technique. The use of the scaling factor implies a redistribution of the smoothed LM probabilities, i. e., a new smoothing is obtained. In this work, {{the relationship between the}} amount of smoothing of LMs and the new smoothing achieved by the scaling factor is studied. High and low smoothed LMs, using wellknown <b>discounting</b> <b>techniques,</b> were integrated into the CSR system. The experimental evaluation was carried out on two Spanish speech application tasks with very different levels of difficulty. The strong relationship observed between the two redistributions of the LM probabilities was independent of the task. When the adequate value of the scaling factor was applied, not very different optimum CSR performances were obtained in spite of the great differences between perplexity values. ...|$|R

40|$|Agroforestry {{can help}} prevent land {{degradation}} while allowing continuing use of land to produce crops and livestock. A problem with the evaluation of agroforestry using long-run static models and traditional <b>discounting</b> <b>techniques</b> is that {{the present value of}} the forestry enterprise is generally much lower than that of other production activities. This problem is common with Australian native species which tend to have a high environmental value but a low market value. This paper presents an economic analysis of an agroforestry operation in land prone to degradation and in the presence of positive externalities provided by trees. The value of the land is estimated based on the present value of expected returns in perpetuity under optimal management. Simulation analysis is used to evaluate the loss in land value caused by dryland salinity. A nonlinear programming model is developed and used to study the effects of timber prices and forest planting costs on optimal forest area and the level of salinity. Elasticities of relevant variables with respect to prices and costs are derived and policy implications of results are discussed. agroforestry, land degradation, externalities, dryland salinity, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

40|$|Pump-pipeline {{systems are}} a common feature of every {{industry}} and account for about 20 % of the worldâ€™s electrical energy demand. Pump and pipe selection should happen simultaneously in pump-pipe system design rather than first sizing the pipe and then finding the pump {{to go with the}} pipe. Further, proper selection of systems should go beyond just considering only the initial cost but the total cost of ownership- the life cycle cost (LCC). In this paper a spreadsheet tool is developed for pump-pipe system technical analysis with the output design parameters facilitating LCC analysis. The program can calculate the operating point of any size of pump, at any given speed and with any pipe size and by use of appropriate cost models determine the unit cost of pumping for each system. Dimensionless pump characteristic curves that are generic for all radial flow pumps are modelled by multi-polynomial equations. Dimensional similitude can then be used to determine the actual characteristic curves for any pump of given impeller diameter and rotational speed. The system resistance curve is calculated from well-known hydraulic formulae and represented by a quadratic equation. The operating point of the pump-pipe system is obtained from a simultaneous solution of the quadratic equations representing the pump and the pipe resistance curves. Best practice technical constraints, like maximum deviation from best-efficiency point (BEP), allowable net positive suction head and maximum allowable operating hours, can be set by the designer. Operating the pump-pipe system near best efficiency point is desirable since it reduces both energy and pump maintenance costs. A pump-pipe system is selected only if it falls within designer-specified best practice constraints. The life cycle cost of each system that passes the first test is then calculated using <b>discounting</b> <b>techniques</b> and the pump-pipe system with the least LCC is adopted.,Zimbabwe Institution of Engineer...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} theory that helps explain the conditions under which firms select certain project evaluation techniques. This study uses contingency theory to analyze the impact of environmental uncertainty on the choice of project evaluation techniques. In addition to a direct measure of uncertainty, several dimensions of uncertainty are included in this study. These dimensions of uncertainty include control structure, method of financing, foreign assets, method of growth, and product domination. This study also analyzes the use of project evaluation, management science and risk management techniques in US firms over time and in UK firms over time in order to compare to prior research. A comparison of firms in the two countries are also provided. The primary method of data collection was a survey instrument. Data were also collected from annual reports and various other public sources. The variables that appear significant in the choice of project evaluation technique in US firms are environmental uncertainty, control structure, method of financing, foreign assets, and product domination. The variable that appear significant in the choice of project evaluation technique in UK firms is method of financing. US firms favor <b>discounted</b> cash flow <b>techniques</b> although this study detected a slight decrease over time.
