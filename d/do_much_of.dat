5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more {{than anyone else in the}} team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E
5|$|Randy Savage, who {{continued}} to sell his supposedly injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry that he actually made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration.|$|E

25|$|Additive manufacturing, {{starting}} with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products {{from other people}} and corporations. The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is {{more a matter of}} complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.|$|E

25|$|Because their {{patients}} are often seriously ill or require complex investigations, internists <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{their work in}} hospitals. Formerly, many internists were not subspecialized; such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem; this style of practice has become much less common. In modern urban practice, most internists are subspecialists: that is, they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge. For example, gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} {{required the}} construction of a new building during the Great Depression. The tower and wing were built between 1931 and 1934, at a cost of $2 million. Ground was broken for the building by Governor George F. Shafer on August 13, 1932. Workers on the building were paid only 30 cents an hour and, after multiple worker strikes, the capitol grounds were administered by martial law in June 1933. The state sold half of the original capitol campus to defray the cost of construction.Artist Edgar Miller was brought in to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the interior design and decoration as well as the bas-relief sculptures on the facade which depict the rich human history of North Dakota.|$|E

25|$|He {{was briefly}} a {{travelling}} lecturer with University College, Exeter, before {{getting a job}} with the West Region of the BBC Radio Home Service. That led him into cricket (and other sporting) commentary on matches in the region, though he did not <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> this until leaving the BBC staff and becoming a freelance. Eventually he graduated to national broadcasts, including appearances on Test Match Special from 1962 to 1975. He was a presenter of the BBC West regional TV news magazine programme Westward Ho! during 1953. He was the narrator for the short documentary film Falmouth for Orders in 1965 and for three episodes of the BBC TV natural history series The World About Us between 1968 and 1973. Subsequently he did some TV cricket commentary on county matches for HTV.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{she lost}} her mother, and, as her father had {{in the same year}} been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his {{presence}} in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was, for the time being, broken up; and the above-mentioned uncle, Timothy, sent his son the long winter drive through Vermont and Canadian snowdrifts to bring this favored niece under his own roof. And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once more about him, in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with no thought of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, she dropped her desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E

In addition, he had the risky job of going to the bank each week to collect the payroll. One of his main problems was sharing the ground with the local rugby league club and Shankly was very concerned about the damage done to the playing surface by the rugby players. The situation led to [...] "numerous arguments" [...] with the club's board which, as Kelly records, [...] "was stacked with rugby league men whose interest in football took second place to rugby".|$|E
500|$|Rather {{than being}} {{situated}} permanently in one place, the royal court was {{moved around the}} kingdom. Tod undertook various topographical and geological studies as it travelled from one area to another, using his training as an engineer and employing other people to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the field work. These studies culminated in 1815 with {{the production of a}} map which he presented to the Governor-General, the Marquis of Hastings. This map of [...] "Central India" [...] (his phrase) became of strategic importance to the British as they were soon to fight the Third Anglo-Maratha War. During that war, which ran from 1817 to 1818, Tod acted as a superintendent of the intelligence department and was able to draw on other aspects of regional knowledge which he had acquired while moving around with the court. He also drew up various strategies for the military campaign.|$|E
500|$|With its choruses {{presented}} in what Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "thundering, echo-drenched crescendo", [...] "Let It Down" [...] received a hard rock arrangement that recalls {{the sound of}} Wright's former band Spooky Tooth. Like Huntley, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter recognise the song as the most obvious example of Spector's influence on the album. In their book Eight Arms to Hold You, Madinger and Easter also credit the producer with [...] "creating havoc" [...] during the making of All Things Must Pass. According to Harrison's later recollections and those of Molland, Klaus Voormann and orchestral arranger John Barham, Spector's erratic behaviour and alcohol intake became a further burden on Harrison, alongside his marital problems {{and the death of}} his mother in July 1970. During a session at Apple Studio, Spector fell over and broke his arm; that and other [...] "health issues" [...] left Harrison to <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the production work alone through to 12 August.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the worker}} phase in many Polistes species adult workers and early males are eclosed (emerge as [...] adults from pupae). As workers emerge, {{they begin to}} assume colony tasks such as nest maintenance, foraging, and larva care. A typical P. erythrocephalus [...] nest grows to contain around 95 cells. It {{should be noted that}} if a colony loses its queen or if she stops ovipositing, then all {{construction}} on the nest will stop. This is because the queens are the [...] "primary initiators." [...] While the workers may <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the building and maintenance, queens with mature eggs in their ovaries demonstrate cell initiation behavior and are responsible for beginning the process.|$|E
2500|$|Anthropologist Jack Goody's {{comparative}} study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated an historical correlation between the practice of extensive shifting horticulture and polygamy {{in the majority of}} sub-Saharan African societies. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies between the male-dominated intensive plough-agriculture common in Eurasia and the extensive shifting horticulture found in sub-Saharan Africa. In some of the sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place in Africa, women <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the work. This favours polygamous marriages in which men sought to monopolize the production of women [...] "who are valued both as workers and as child bearers". Goody however, observes that the correlation is imperfect and varied. He also discusses more male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those that exist in much of West Africa, in particular the West African savannah, where polygyny is desired more for the creation of sons, whose labor is valued.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Coach Kipke told reporters: [...] "We got off easy[...] [...] [...] [...] Minnesota {{has a great}} {{football}} team, and it is {{only fair}} to say we were lucky to hold them scoreless[...] [...] [...] [...] Our offense probably would have looked better on a dry field. [...] Everhadus is our only hard driving back, while Minnesota has three, [...] [...] [...] Our other ball carriers depend on sidestepping to go places and they couldn't <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> that with the footing so slippery." [...] Kipke also praised his defense for their play after Minnesota drove to the 15-yard line: [...] "Fourth down and 12 yards to go didn't look bad at all. [...] Renner certainly meant business when he threw Alfonse for that six-yard loss." [...] The Wolverines played a defensive oriented game and relied heavily on Regeczi's punting. [...] One sports columnist wrote: [...] "No game I have seen this season more clearly brought out the inestimable value of consistent punting as did this bruise and batter struggle [...] [...] [...] [...] No matter where Michigan was located when Johnny Regeczi went back to kick, the boot almost always was good enough to place Minnesota on the defensive." ...|$|E
