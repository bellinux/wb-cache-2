5|$|Unlike the {{aromatic}} imidazol-2-ylidenes or triazol-5-ylidenes, these carbenes appear {{not to be}} thermodynamically stable, {{as shown}} by the <b>dimerisation</b> of some unhindered cyclic and acyclic examples.

5|$|Unlike the <b>dimerisation</b> of {{triplet state}} carbenes, these singlet state carbenes do not {{approach}} {{head to head}} ("least motion"), but rather the carbene lone pair attacks the empty carbon p-orbital ("non-least motion"). Carbene <b>dimerisation</b> can be catalyzed by both acids and metals.|$|E
5|$|However, these carbenes are not {{thermodynamically}} stable as decomposition and <b>dimerisation</b> {{have been}} observed for unhindered examples.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to oxygen (diradical) {{converts}} this carbene to {{the corresponding}} benzophenone and the diphenylmethane compound is formed {{when it is}} trapped by 1,4-cyclohexadiene. As with the other carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents, namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups, that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of <b>dimerisation</b> to a 1,1,2,2-tetra(phenyl)alkene.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this compound, {{and the role of}} steric protection in preventing <b>dimerisation,</b> has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E
5|$|At one time, stable carbenes {{were thought}} to {{reversibly}} dimerise through the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for years. This is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon <b>dimerisation.</b> In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid <b>dimerisation</b> of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence <b>dimerisation</b> to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E
5|$|Rhodocene {{exists as}} , a {{paramagnetic}} 19-valence electron radical monomer only {{at or below}} −196°C (liquid nitrogen temperatures) or above 150°C in the gas phase. It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a high order axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The <b>dimerisation</b> is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E

25|$|The direct tautomerisation is not energetically favoured, but a <b>dimerisation</b> {{followed}} by a double proton transfer and dissociation of the dimer is a self catalytic path from one tautomer to the other. Protic solvents also mediate the proton transfer during the tautomerisation.|$|E

25|$|The 3-dimensional {{structure}} of native antithrombin was first determined in 1994. Unexpectedly the protein crystallized as a heterodimer composed of one molecule of native antithrombin and one molecule of latent antithrombin. Latent antithrombin on formation immediately links to a molecule of native antithrombin {{to form the}} heterodimer, {{and it is not}} until the concentration of latent antithrombin exceeds 50% of the total antithrombin that it can be detected analytically. Not only is the latent form of antithrombin inactive against its target coagulation proteases, but its <b>dimerisation</b> with an otherwise active native antithrombin molecule also results in the native molecules inactivation. The physiological impact of the loss of antithrombin activity either through latent antithrombin formation or through subsequent dimer formation is exacerbated by the preference for <b>dimerisation</b> to occur between heparin activated β-antithrombin and latent antithrombin as opposed to α-antithrombin.|$|E
25|$|In {{solution}} the dimeric form is present; {{the ratio}} of <b>dimerisation</b> {{is strongly dependent on}} the polarity of the solvent. Polar and protic solvents interact with the hydrogen bonds and more monomer is formed. Hydrophobic effects in non-polar solvents lead to a predominance of the dimer. The ratio of the tautomeric forms is also dependent on the solvent. All possible tautomers and dimers can be present and form an equilibrium, and the exact measurement of all the equilibrium constants in the system is extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} of initiator caspases and inflammatory caspases is initiated by <b>dimerisation,</b> which is facilitated by binding to adaptor proteins via protein–protein interaction motifs that are collectively {{referred to as}} death folds. The death folds are located in a structural domain of the caspases known as the pro-domain, which is larger in those caspases that contain death folds than in those that do not. The pro-domain of the intrinsic initiator caspases and the inflammatory caspases contains a single death fold known as caspase recruitment domain (CARD), while the pro-domain of the extrinsic initiator caspases contains two death folds known as death effector domains (DED).|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input {{several levels}} above the actual MAP kinase. In {{contrast to the}} relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tighly locked into an inactive state by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consist of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to prenylation). That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this <b>dimerisation</b> event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their MAP kinase substrates.|$|E

500|$|The {{preparation}} of stable carbenes free from metal cations has been keenly sought to allow further {{study of the}} carbene species in isolation from these metals. Separating a carbene from a carbene-metal complex can be problematic due to {{the stability of the}} complex. Accordingly, it is preferable to make the carbene free from these metals in the first place. Indeed, some metal ions, rather than stabilising the carbene, have been implicated in the catalytic <b>dimerisation</b> of unhindered examples.|$|E
500|$|Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was {{the first}} {{chlorine}} oxide to be discovered in 1811 by Humphry Davy. It is a yellow paramagnetic gas (deep-red as a solid or liquid), as expected from its having an odd number of electrons: it is stable towards <b>dimerisation</b> due to the delocalisation of the unpaired electron. It explodes above −40°C as a liquid and under pressure as a gas and therefore must be made at low concentrations for wood-pulp bleaching and water treatment. It is usually prepared by reducing a chlorate as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|This <b>dimerisation</b> {{process has}} {{the overall effect}} of {{decreasing}} the electron count around the rhodium centre from 19 to 18. This occurs because the oxidative coupling of the two cyclopentadienyl ligands produces a new ligand with lower hapticity and which donates fewer electrons to the metal centre. The term hapticity is used to indicate the [...] "number of carbon (or other) atoms through which [...] binds (n)" [...] to a metal centre and is symbolised as ηn. For example, the ethylene ligand in Zeise's salt is bound to the platinum centre through both carbon atoms, and it hence formally has the formula K·H2O. The carbonyl ligands in nickel tetracarbonyl are each bound through only a carbon atom and are hence described as monohapto ligands, but η1-notations are typically omitted in formulae. The cyclopentadienyl ligands in many metallocene and half-sandwich compounds are pentahapto ligands, hence the formula [...] for the rhodocene monomer. In the rhodocene dimer, the coupled cyclopentadienyl ligands are 4-electron tetrahapto donors to each rhodium(I) metal centre, {{in contrast to the}} 6-electron pentahapto cyclopentadienyl donors. The increased stability of the 18-valence electron rhodium(I) dimer species as compared to the 19-valence electron rhodium(II) monomer likely explains why the monomer is only detected under extreme conditions.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dimerisation</b> {{is another}} {{important}} mechanism for c-Raf activity regulation and required for Raf activation loop phosphorylation. Normally, only the [...] "open" [...] kinase domains participate in <b>dimerisation.</b> Unlike B-Raf, that readily forms homodimers with itself, c-Raf prefers heterodimerisation with either B-Raf or KSR1. Homodimers and heterodimers all behave similarly. The B-Raf homodimer kinase domain structure clearly shows that the activation loops (that control the catalytic activity of all known protein kinases) are positioned in an active-like conformation in the dimer. This is due to an allosteric effect of the other molecule binding to the [...] "back" [...] side of the kinase; such dimers are symmetric and have two, partially active catalytic sites. At this stage, the activity of Raf kinases is low, and unstable.|$|E
2500|$|Primary {{sequence}} analysis of OSM allocates {{it to the}} gp130 group of cytokines. OSM most resembles LIF, bearing 22% sequence identity and 30% similarity. Incidentally the genes for OSM and LIF occur in tandem on human chromosome 22. Both LIF and OSM genes have very similar gene structures sharing similar promoter elements and intron-exon structure. These data suggest that OSM and LIF arose relatively recently in evolutionary terms by gene duplication. Of the five cysteine residues within the human OSM sequence four participate in disulfide bridges, one of these disulfide bonds namely between helices A and B is necessary for OSM activity. [...] The free cysteine residue {{does not appear to}} mediate <b>dimerisation</b> of OSM.|$|E
2500|$|Thiophene is {{considered}} to be aromatic, although theoretical calculations suggest that the degree of aromaticity is less than that of benzene. The [...] "electron pairs" [...] on sulfur are significantly delocalized in the pi electron system. [...] As a consequence of its aromaticity, thiophene does not exhibit the properties seen for conventional thioethers. [...] For example, the sulfur atom resists alkylation and oxidation. However, oxidation of a thiophene ring is thought to {{play a crucial role in}} the metabolic activation of various thiophene-containing drugs, such as tienilic acid and the investigational anticancer drug OSI-930. In these cases oxidation can occur both at sulfur, giving a thiophene S-oxide, as well as at the 2,3-double bond, giving the thiophene 2,3-epoxide, followed by subsequent NIH shift rearrangement. [...] Oxidation of thiophene by trifluoroperacetic acid also demonstrates both reaction pathways. [...] The major pathway forms the S-oxide as an intermediate, which undergoes subsequent Diels-Alder-type <b>dimerisation</b> and further oxidation, forming a mixture of sulfoxide and sulfone products with a combined yield of 83% (based on NMR evidence): ...|$|E
2500|$|Unbound AR {{is mainly}} {{located in the}} cytoplasm, like a typical steroid receptor, and is {{associated}} with a complex of heat shock proteins (HSP) through interactions with LBD. Androgens, either agonists or antagonists, position themselves in the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) of the cytosolic AR and bind to the LBD, see figure 2. The AR goes through a series of conformational changes and HSP dissociate from AR. The transformed AR undergoes <b>dimerisation,</b> phosphorylation and translocates to the nucleus. The translocated receptor then binds to the androgen-response elements (ARE) on the promoter of the androgen responsive gene, a consensus sequence located either upstream or downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of AR target genes. [...] Recruitment of other transcription co-factors (including co-activators and co-repressors) and general transcriptional machinery further ensures the transactivation of AR-regulated gene expression. All these complicated processes are initiated by the ligand-induced conformational changes in the LBD. Ligand specific recruitment of coregulators might be crucial for the agonist or antagonist activity of AR ligands. Binding of DNA is also required for AR-regulated gene expression, also known as classic genomic gene function of AR.|$|E
