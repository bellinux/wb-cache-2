5|$|In Part II of the series, {{three years}} after his mission, Deidara, {{a member of the}} {{criminal}} organization Akatsuki, is sent to Sunagakure to capture Gaara. Gaara fights Deidara to protect the village, but is defeated. The members of the Akatsuki then kidnap him and extract Shukaku from his body. Gaara dies in the process, his body being recovered by Naruto and Kakashi Hatake. Chiyo sacrifices her own life to revive Gaara after coming to acknowledge Naruto and Sakura Haruno's resolve. Sometime later, he goes to the Five Kage Summit, where the Akatsuki's leader Tobi, breaks into the meeting and announces the Fourth Great Ninja War to capture the last two Tailed-Beasts. Gaara later joins the new Shinobi Alliance as its field commander to protect Naruto and Killer Bee, using Naruto's philosophy of love and the Akatsuki's philosophy of hatred to unite the army when it nearly imploded from internal conflict. On {{the second day of the}} war, Gaara encounters his reanimated father. Rasa reveals the truth to Gaara that his uncle's final action was <b>his</b> <b>doing</b> and that the truth that Gaara's mother always loved him, moving Gaara to tears after learning his mother's will is the force behind his sand. Rasa recognizes his son has surpassed him and entrusts Sunagakure to him after being defeated. Gaara later defeats and seals the revived Second Mizukage and joins the rest of the five Kage to fight the Madara Uchiha who was reanimated by Kabuto, nearly getting killed as a result. Later healed by Tsunade, Gaara departs with the other Kage to site of their side's battle with Tobi. Before watching him be absorbed by the Gedo Statue again, Gaara manages to make his peace with Shukaku while thanking the tailed beast for ensuring that he would meet Naruto. They take him to Minato Namikaze and Gaara holds off Madara before Might Guy takes over prior Naruto being successfully revived. Once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is activated, Gaara is caught in the illusion of being with his entire family and Naruto as his friend before being freed by Naruto and Sasuke. By the series epilogue, having the Hidden Leaf Village's Nara Clan as in-laws through Temari, Gaara remains active as the Kazekage.|$|E

25|$|While {{investigating}} the Qunari plot, the Inquisitor learns that the elven gods, the Evanuris, were in truth extremely powerful mages from ancient times who became corrupt and arrogant in their power, and that Fen'Harel had led a rebellion against them. They also {{learn that the}} Veil was created by Fen'Harel, and that <b>his</b> <b>doing</b> so caused the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. The Inquisitor can also learn that Solas is Fen'Harel, depending on how well they search.|$|E

If he is not lying, then his statement is either true or false, which implies that either <b>his</b> nose <b>does</b> grow now or <b>his</b> nose <b>does</b> not grow now.

25|$|Ezekiel House left Owego in {{the spring}} of 1854 as he had taken a {{contract}} to build a county court house in the suburbs of Rockford, Illinois. Henry and his brother went to Rockford in the fall and started in business with their father. In 1857 Henry took a position with his father who was superintending the raising and reconstructing of the old city hall in Chicago. While working on a building in New York, Henry had the misfortune of having the extension muscle of his right hand severed by a chisel which dropped from a scaffold. This incapacitated <b>his</b> <b>doing</b> any carpentry work for several months. During this enforced idleness, he designed and patented an automatic gate.|$|E
25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of <b>His</b> <b>doing</b> what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.|$|E
25|$|Prince Wilhelm became King of Prussia {{upon his}} brother Frederick Wilhelm IV's death in 1861. The new monarch often came into {{conflict}} with the increasingly liberal Prussian Diet (Landtag). A crisis arose in 1862, when the Diet refused to authorize funding for a proposed re-organization of the army. The King's ministers could not convince legislators to pass the budget, and the King was unwilling to make concessions. Wilhelm threatened to abdicate in favour of his son Crown Prince Frederick William, who opposed <b>his</b> <b>doing</b> so, believing that Bismarck was the only politician capable of handling the crisis. However, Wilhelm was ambivalent about appointing a person who demanded unfettered control over foreign affairs. It was in September 1862, when the Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Deputies) overwhelmingly rejected the proposed budget, that Wilhelm was persuaded to recall Bismarck to Prussia {{on the advice of}} Roon. On 23 September 1862, Wilhelm appointed Bismarck Minister President and Foreign Minister.|$|E

500|$|In 1824, Beethoven {{redefined the}} symphony genre in his Ninth by {{introducing}} text and voice into a previously instrumental genre. <b>His</b> <b>doing</b> so sparked {{a debate on}} the future of the symphony itself. Beethoven's use of words, according to Richard Wagner, had shown [...] "the limits of purely instrumental music" [...] and marked [...] "the end of the symphony as a vital genre". Others were not sure how to proceed—whether to emulate the Ninth by writing symphonies with choral finales, or to develop the symphony genre in a purely instrumental fashion. Eventually, musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, the symphony was seen [...] "as an all-embracing, cosmic drama that transcended the realm of sound alone".|$|E
500|$|This episode {{does not}} feature Scully, as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future. Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales. He was {{requested}} {{for the part}} especially by Chris Carter. Casting director Rick Millikan noted, [...] "McGavin was Chris's inspiration for writing this series. He always had Darren in mind to use somewhere, {{and that was really}} <b>his</b> <b>doing.</b> He said 'I want Darren McGavin for this,' and he happened to be available, and we got him." [...] McGavin had originally been casting directors' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener [...] "Little Green Men". McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder's dad, but he again eluded the staff. In the end, McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Dales, the agent who founded the X-Files.|$|E
500|$|Liszt {{provided}} written prefaces {{for nine}} of his symphonic poems. <b>His</b> <b>doing</b> so, Alan Walker states, [...] "was {{a reflection of}} the historical position in which he found himself." [...] Liszt was aware these musical works would be experienced not just by select connoisseurs, as might have been the case in previous generations, but also by the general public. In addition, he knew about the public's fondness for attaching stories to instrumental music, regardless of their source, their relevance to a musical composition or whether the composer had actually sanctioned them. Therefore, in a pre-emptive gesture, Liszt provided context before others could invent one to take its place. Liszt may have also felt that since many of these works were written in new forms, some sort of verbal or written explanation would be welcome to explain their shape.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the amount}} of {{interest}} in the ending of this episode, David Mirkin wrote several [...] "terrible endings" [...] and, with just Harry Shearer, recorded several alternate endings. His original intention was to fool the production staff and also leak the endings to various media outlets, but much to his surprise he was unsuccessful. Several endings were animated that showed various characters shooting Mr. Burns. Several of the alternate endings aired during the clip show [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular". Various clips showed Apu, Moe, Barney, Tito, and even Santa's Little Helper as the gunmen. There was also a full-length conclusion that aired in which Smithers shot Burns and explained <b>his</b> <b>doing</b> so at Burns's bedside after Homer's wild chase, and fell on [...] "W" [...] and S" [...] on the compass, Waylon's initials; Burns then decides to give Smithers a 5 percent pay cut for attempting to kill him.|$|E
500|$|In reality, as Shisui {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} subliminally manipulate others and shares Itachi's love for the village, he intended to use his gift on the Uchiha clan leader to stop the coup d'état. However, Shisui is mortally wounded by the Leaf High Council member Danzo Shimura, who then takes his eye to achieve his own ideal of peace. When Shisui entrusts Itachi with his remaining eye, Itachi covers up Shisui's death and made it appear it was <b>his</b> <b>doing.</b> Eventually, in return for Danzo's offer to spare his younger brother, Itachi slaughters his entire clan. After creating the misconception that he murdered their family in cold blood to give Sasuke the mindset to become strong enough to kill him once he is capable, Itachi leaves the village, although he warns Danzo not to harm Sasuke. Meeting up with Konoha's Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi, who promises {{to do what he}} can to look after Sasuke, Itachi reveals his intentions to continue to protect the village from the shadows. Soon after perceiving them as a threat to Konoha, Itachi joins the Akatsuki ...|$|E
