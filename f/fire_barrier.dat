2500|$|The {{two types}} of <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> zones, [...] and [...] , were created from land vacated by relocation; the former were vacant plazas and the latter widened streets. Additionally, to {{accompany}} the street widening policy, houses were required to remove any eaves. The relocations resulted in an enlarged urban Edo. In 1662 (Kanbun 2), the areas of Ueno, Asakusa and Shiba outside the canals were brought under {{the administration of the}} machi-bugyō.|$|E
30|$|The {{materials}} and constructions discussed above for passing TB 129 are generally used for institutional mattresses. For institutional mattresses, fire performance {{is more important}} than comfort and aesthetics. However, polyvinyl tickings, <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> with fiberglass substrates, and solid core mattresses with densified polyester batting are not preferred choices for residential mattresses due to cost, comfort and aesthetics. Unlike institutional mattresses, comfort and aesthetics are of primary importance in the case of residential mattresses; hence, fire performance must be achieved while still maintaining the comfort and aesthetics. For this reason, highloft barrier materials are more commonly used as <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in residential mattresses. Ticking with polyester or polyester blends that are generally used in residential mattresses behave very differently in presence of <b>fire</b> <b>barriers.</b> The effects of melting and dripping can have a varied impact on the flammability of a mattress. Data for compliance to 16 CFR 1633 for residential mattresses with highloft or other newly engineered barrier materials are currently not available. Several polyester blend tickings are being currently investigated and their fire performance with and without <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> is being studied in our laboratories.|$|R

30|$|Active <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> have a {{chemical}} {{effect on the}} <b>fire.</b> Active <b>barrier</b> materials, not only prevent the ignition of interior cushioning material but can extinguish the flames from the ignition source and prevent the outer upholstery from burning. The chemical activity of active <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> can be in condensed phase (enhanced char formation), gas phase (flame suppression, flame quenching and/or intumescence) or both. They can suppress the flames from the ignition source, prevent the outer upholstery from burning, and prevent the ignition of interior cushioning material by forming char barrier. This essentially lowers the temperatures in a fire and reduces the generation of harmful smoke and gases ([Damant 2009]). Active technologies generally use combinations of fibers and/or coatings of fabrics, or PUFs with gas-phase-active FR for flame suppression or quenching. In general, passive technologies are good inhibitors of smoldering combustion, whereas active technologies suppress flaming combustion by altering either decomposition or oxidation reactions ([Wakelyn et al. 2005]).|$|R
2500|$|Dense {{distribution}} of buildings built from flammable materials {{was an important}} factor that allowed fires to evolve from small to great. Once one building caught fire, the neighboring ones would soon ignite before any firefighters could respond. For this reason, {{in the aftermath of}} the Great Fire of Meireki, structures made with non-flammable materials were promoted in Edo to enhance the city's defense against fires. <b>Fire</b> <b>barrier</b> zones called [...] and [...] were set up in various places in Edo. Adoption of fire-resistant materials including tiled roofs and earthen houses became mandatory.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike many of {{the other}} {{mountains}} in the area, the Pinaleños have no lava deposits.

[...] "Researchers from the University of Arizona Tree Ring Laboratory have discovered living trees that date back to 1257 and 1270 AD. Botanists say the Douglas firs have survived because the rocky cliffs of the mountains have served as a <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> for them. The scientists also found dead firs that dated as far back as 1102 AD." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the catastrophic}} {{loss in the}} Great Fire of Meireki, fire {{prevention}} measures received {{a great amount of}} emphasis in the reconstruction plan of Edo. <b>Fire</b> <b>barrier</b> zones were set up to prevent fires from spreading. That started with moving the primary residences of the [...] outside of the Edo Castle and dedicating the vacated space to fire prevention. Relocation of residences belonging to other daimyos and hatamotos followed. To alleviate the dense compaction of buildings inside Edo, most of the destinations were chosen to be distant from the castle. Furthermore, during the Genroku era, daimyos were granted land for constructing their secondary and tertiary residences in the outskirts of Edo, and their tertiary residences were also used as shelters during fires. Land was reclaimed as another means of accommodating new samurai residences. Around 1661 (Kanbun 1), land reclamation in Honjo was completed to allow for construction of samurai residences as well as relocation of chōnin residences. Similar relocation orders were also issued to temples and shrines. Most of them moved outside Edo's canals while some of them found their new sites in Asakusa, Komagome and Koishikawa. The relocation of the red-light district of [...] from the neighborhood of Nihonbashi to Asakusa also occurred in this period, although the move had been decided before the Great Fire of Meireki.|$|E

30|$|Fire {{blocking}} technologies operate by two broad, {{not mutually}} exclusive modes: passive and active ([Nurbakhsh & Mc Cormack 1998]). As the term suggests, passive <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> are predominantly non-reactive and do not become chemically involved in the flames. Their effectiveness derives from serving as a physical and/or thermal barrier between {{some or all of}} the fuel and the potential ignition source. These passive technologies prevent or delay the ignition of interior cushioning materials; however, they do not prevent burning of the outer cover fabric. Passive <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> are usually made from inorganic or inherently fire resistant organic fibers. Inherently fire resistant fibers used in this technology have high heat capacity and undergo an endothermic phase change in the presence of heat.|$|R

Fire barriers are continuous through concealed spaces (e.g., above a ceiling) to the floor deck or roof deck above the barrier.

40|$|To {{inform the}} Commission {{about the results}} of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff's review of Kaowool <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> at Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2 (FNP) and the staff's plans to address {{technical}} issues with Kaowool and FP- 60 barriers. BACKGROUND: In a memorandum dated June 9, 1998, the staff informed the Commission that the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) was evaluating the fireresistive capabilities of Kaowool <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in response to a Task Interface Agreement (TIA) with Region II regarding the barriers installed at FNP. As detailed below, the staff could not find a sound technical basis for concluding that Kaowool <b>barriers</b> provide adequate <b>fire</b> protection for equipment that needs to remain functional during and after a nuclear power plant fire. The questions regarding the Kaowool <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> at FNP may also apply to FP- 60 barriers and to other plants that use Kaowool or FP- 60 barriers. DISCUSSION: Kaowool is a noncombustible, flexible, ceramic-fiber blanket originally manufactured by Babcock and Wilcox. FP- 60 is basically an upgraded version of Kaowool with aluminum foil laminated to both surfaces. It is manufactured by Thermal Ceramics. Certain reactor licensees wrap Kaowool or FP- 60 blankets around electrical raceways that contain circuits needed to achieve and maintain post-fire safe shutdown. To the best of the staff's knowledge, Kaowool and FP- 60 are used to construct barriers intended to have a 1 -hour fire resistance rating, but not barriers with a 3 -hour rating. Some licensees may also use Kaowool and FP- 60 barriers to separate certain electrical systems in accordance with the guidance of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1. 75, "Physical Independence of Electrical Systems. " The technical issues detailed below apply only to Kaowool and FP- 60 <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> installed to protect th...|$|R

30|$|Unlike {{institutional}} mattresses, {{comfort and}} aesthetics are of primary {{importance in the}} case of residential mattresses. In residential settings, therefore, fire performance must be achieved while still maintaining both comfort and aesthetics. For this reason, nonwoven, highloft battings are more commonly used as <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in residential mattresses. Nonwoven cotton battings treated with boric acid have been used for many years as <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> in mattresses (Wakelyn et al. [2005]). However, boric acid treatment may have problems associated with chalking, color change and undesirable texture (Toxicological Risks of Selected Flame Retardant Chemicals [2000]). Highloft battings of FR rayon blended with polyester fibers have gained popularity especially after the introduction of 16 CFR 1633. These barrier materials are viewed as an environmentally friendly and economically practical approach to comply with 16 CFR 1633.|$|R

50|$|Spray {{fireproofing}} {{of structural}} steel is most efficiently accomplished before interior partitions are built, otherwise {{a conflict with}} fire stops in firewalls could result. Firestops must adhere to the bare, dry, unobstructed surfaces of the <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> which is penetrated (e.g., metal decking), or adjacent to an interface of two fire barriers at which fire stopping is required (e.g., beams). Spray fireproofing cannot be applied prior to fire stopping at these surfaces, as the fireproofing would obstruct adherence of the fire stop materials to the <b>fire</b> <b>barrier</b> surfaces. Spraying the upper room perimeter with fireproofing may also result in covering of wall/ceiling joints and through penetrations that require fire stopping. These joints are then not visually observed and not provided with proper fire stopping, violating the fire integrity of the passive <b>fire</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|E

50|$|Spray {{fireproofing}} {{products have}} not been qualified {{to the thousands of}} firestop configurations, so they cannot be installed in conformance of a certification listing.

40|$|Modelling fire {{performance}} of building <b>fire</b> <b>barriers</b> would allow optimising the design solutions before performing costly fire resistance tests and promote performance-based fire safety engineering.

The methodology was applied to stone wool core sandwich panels subjected to the ISO 834 standard fire resistance temperature/time curve. Realistic input parameter value distributions were applied based on material property measurements at site and data available in literature. A Monte Carlo approach and a functional analysis were used to analyse the results. Overall, the model is more sensitive to the boundary conditions than to the material thermal properties. Nevertheless, thermal conductivity can be identified as the most important individual input parameter...|$|R
