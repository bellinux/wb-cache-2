Its primary purpose is to research whiplash, and to aid designers in developing <b>effective</b> <b>head</b> and neck restraints. BioRID is more sophisticated in its spinal construction than Hybrid; 24 vertebra simulators allow BioRID to assume a much more natural seating posture, and to demonstrate the neck movement and configuration seen in rear-end collisions.|$|E
25|$|Head {{restraint}} — {{refers to}} a device designed to limit the rearward displacement of an adult occupant’s head {{in relation to the}} torso {{in order to reduce the}} risk of injury to the cervical vertebrae in the event of a rear impact. The most <b>effective</b> <b>head</b> restraint must allow a backset motion of less than 60mm to prevent the hyperextension of the neck during impact.|$|E

Many officials felt and showed more loyalty to the empress dowager than they did to the emperor, owing in part to her seniority and in part to her personalised approach to cultivating court favourites, many of whom would be given gifts of her artwork and invitations to join her at the theater for opera and acrobatics.|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of educational {{reform in the}} United Arab Emirates (UAE) imposes a change agent role on secondary school department heads however the assistance-intensive process is inhibited by the current educational structure. As the concept of teacher empowerment becomes accepted, some department heads {{have the ability to}} develop a professional learning community while others are unable to do so. The present study considers the present and ideal role of the department head as a change agent facilitating the {{implementation of}} educational reform in the UAE. A sequential mixed method mode of inquiry with two phases was employed. In phase one, department heads were profiled from a self, superior and subordinate perspective and a conceptual framework related to patterns of effective change agent behaviour was developed. Findings show that effective change agent characteristics of department heads included priorities related to change implementation and teacher support, a collaborative leadership style, seven strategies related to a participatory, supportive and facilitative approach and ten skills that motivate, energise and encourage teachers. The identification of two ineffective department heads by teacher informants in phase one provided an opportunity to study the work of effective and ineffective department heads as cases in-depth. Case study findings confirm the conceptual framework because <b>effective</b> <b>heads</b> were rated high for all characteristics identified, while ineffective heads were rated low. All department heads accepted the change agent role unofficially with no additional time release, but <b>effective</b> <b>heads</b> took ownership of the process and empowered teachers while ineffective heads provided assistance on request. <b>Effective</b> <b>heads</b> used interpersonal skills and asserted themselves as technical experts while ineffective heads were passive and were considered to be traditional teachers. Strategies and skills employed by <b>effective</b> <b>heads</b> included resource linking, collaborative problem solving, facilitation, support and administration/organisation while ineffective department heads used resolution giving and providing technical assistance. Time constraints, restrictive school schedules and role ambiguity were identified as major impediments to the change agent role of department heads in his study. Nevertheless, the new curriculum is being implemented in all of the departments studied verifying that the department head is an untapped resource in the change process. Educational StudiesD.

The People's Committee's successor, the People's United Party (PUP), sought constitutional reforms that expanded voting rights to all adults. The first election under universal suffrage was held in 1954 and was decisively won by the PUP, beginning a three-decade period in which the PUP dominated the country's politics.

25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an <b>effective</b> <b>head</b> restraint behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of archdeacon – the highest for clergy {{who are not}} a bishop – had great importance in the church of India in the centuries {{leading up to the}} formation of an independent Malankara Church.

40|$|Heads of {{department}} are in pivotal positions in secondary schools. Their tasks are well documented {{but it is}} not the tasks themselves that are critical for effectiveness but rather HOW the tasks are carried out. This research investigated the styles of <b>effective</b> <b>heads</b> {{of department}} and how these styles can be developed. For the first study a panel of judges was used to select seven <b>effective</b> <b>heads</b> of mathematics and, following interviews with each one, pen-pictures of their style were drawn up. The second study used four heads of mathematics who were by reputation regarded as effective and were well known to the researcher. Each head of mathematics nominated four colleagues and from interviews with these and the heads of mathematics themselves, extensive pen-pictures of the professional life of each of the heads of mathematics were drawn up. Comparison was made to some leadership theories and it is possible to suggest some generalisations, for example that potential styles are limited by behavioural or affective aspects which suggests that the professional lives of middle-managers are crucially influenced by their personal lives. There was no 'style for all seasons' but the pen-pictures showed the heads of mathematics to be: - 'people-centered' - supporting teachers and pupils through highlypersonalised, professional help; - efficient administrators; - open about their aims - idealistic but pragmatic; - extremely hard working - accepting responsibility for their subject; - members of personal and professional support networks - and involved in the mathematics education debate, both locally and nationally. INSET and appraisal are increasingly school-focussed and school-based. This research trialled aspects of appraisal such as the use of a colleague who can listen, reflect and draw up a written record. Processes such as these are crucial for the development of middle-managers in secondary schools...|$|R

5000|$|In his new {{political}} positions, and encouraged by his advisers, Walpole introduced the sinking fund, {{a device to}} reduce the national debt. The Cabinet {{of which he was}} a member was often divided over most important issues. Normally, Walpole and Lord Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and Lord Sunderland on the other. Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart. The Stanhope-Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support. In 1716 Townshend had been removed from the important post of Northern Secretary and put in the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
