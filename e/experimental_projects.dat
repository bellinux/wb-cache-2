5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall {{produced}} a massively popular mod for ARMA 2 {{that prompted the}} studio to develop a standalone game. The same year saw the arrest of two employees of Bohemia, who were charged with espionage by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ARMA 3s setting to a fictional one. The company is now working on several new projects, including preparing DayZ for an eventual full release and developing Ylands, a sandbox game {{which was part of}} Bohemia Incubator, a platform for Bohemia Interactive to release small, <b>experimental</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been <b>experimental</b> <b>projects</b> involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E

25|$|In later years, theatre in Portugal has {{developed}} into many other forms {{as in any}} other European country. Almost every repertoire {{can be seen in}} Portugal. Many companies have the works of Shakespeare, Molière, Brecht, Becket or Chekhov, and Portuguese classic and modern authors on their repertoire. Other companies show more <b>experimental</b> <b>projects.</b> All this makes the theatre repertoire very varied. Some of the most important professional theatre companies nowadays are: Teatro da Cornucópia, Teatro da Comuna, Teatro Aberto, Teatro Meridional, Teatro da Garagem, Companhia de Teatro de Almada, Companhia Teatral do Chiado, A Barraca, Teatro dos Aloés, Teatro Praga, Artistas Unidos, Seiva Trupe, As boas raparigas, ACTA, among many others.|$|E
25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} into flotation {{began when he}} was at Imperial College London, in 1969. A colleague, Dr J A Kitchener of the Royal School of Mines, pointed out that many of the new mineral deposits being found around the world required fine grinding to separate the valuable particles from the rock in which they were embedded, and the flotation technologies available at the time were relatively inefficient for recovering fine particles. Kitchener felt that improvements could best be achieved by an increased knowledge of the physics of flotation, rather than the chemistry of the reagents. Jameson had gained some expertise in the properties of bubbles and particles in suspensions whilst a PhD student at Cambridge. He began {{research into}} the fluid mechanics of the flotation process and set in train a series of <b>experimental</b> <b>projects</b> into the effect of particle diameter and bubble size on the flotation rate constant. Much of the research was conducted by honours students in chemical engineering. Jameson accepted the challenge of coming up with practical solutions to remedy the situation, if these could be identified.|$|E

Magle has gained a reputation as an organ virtuoso, and as a composer and performing artist who does not refrain from venturing into more <b>experimental</b> <b>projects</b> – often with improvisation – bordering jazz, electronica, and other non-classical genres.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1950s, {{civilian}} aircraft flew under 20,000 feet while {{military aircraft}} flew under 40,000 feet. Once the U-2 began flying at above 60,000 feet, an unexpected side effect was {{an increasing number}} of UFO sighting reports. Sightings occurred most often during early evenings hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2's silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a [...] "fiery" [...] appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw. Similarly, veterans of <b>experimental</b> <b>projects</b> such as OXCART and NERVA at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors: ...|$|E
2500|$|Rover {{also ran}} several {{experimental}} diesel engine projects {{in relation to}} the Land Rover. The 2-litre, [...] diesel unit designed and built by Rover for its 4x4 had entered production in 1956 and was one of Britain's first modern high-speed automotive diesel engines. <b>Experimental</b> <b>projects</b> were undertaken to improve the engine's power delivery, running qualities, and fuel tolerances. British Army requirements {{led to the development of}} a multifuel version of the 2.25-litre variant of the engine in 1962, which could run on petrol, diesel, Jet-A, or kerosene. However, the engine's power output when running on low-grade fuel was too low for the Army's uses. Rover developed a highly advanced (for the time) turbodiesel version of its engine in the mid-1960s to power its experimental '129-inch' heavy duty Land Rover designs. This 2.5-litre engine used a turbocharger built by Rover's gas turbine division as well as an intercooler. This was one of the first times these features had been incorporated on such a small-capacity diesel unit, but they were not adopted.|$|E
