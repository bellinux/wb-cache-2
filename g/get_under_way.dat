5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, {{and the next day}} at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of the U.S. Steel trust in 1901 threatened the AA with ruin. The trust incorporated plants of the American Tin Plate Co. into U.S Steel. If the AA was to save its existing locals at American Tin Plate and American Sheet Steel, it had to organize all the plants of U.S. Steel. But before an organizing drive could <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> U.S. Steel's tin plate subsidiary withdrew recognition from the AA and refused to bargain at unionized plants. The independent American Sheet Steel did the same.|$|E
25|$|The walkout tied {{up about}} ninety {{ships in the}} Port of Los Angeles. Police quickly started to round up known IWW agitators, thus {{depleting}} the ranks of strike leaders and permitting some ships to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> Twelve vessels in the offshore trade, manned by seamen sympathetic to the IWW, suffered the longest delays. The thirty-seven lumber schooners in port were largely manned by non-unionists or members of the Sailors Union. Nevertheless, the cargoes {{of a number of}} them had to be discharged in rotation at the piers by the ships' officers because of the shortage of dockhands.|$|E

The soldiers and transports for the expedition assembled at Annapolis. Embarkation began on January 5, 1862, and on January 9 they began to <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> with orders to rendezvous at Fort Monroe, near the entrance to Chesapeake Bay. There they met the naval contingent, and on January 11 they set sail. Until this time, only Burnside and his immediate staff knew their ultimate destination. Once at sea, the captain of each ship opened his sealed orders and learned that his ship should proceed to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras.|$|E

25|$|On October 26, 1944, WASP pilot Gertrude Tompkins Silver of the 601st Ferrying Squadron, 5th Ferrying Group, Love Field, Dallas, Texas, {{departed}} Los Angeles Airport, in North American P-51D Mustang, 44-15669, at 1600 hrs PWT, {{headed for}} the East Coast. She took off into the wind, into an offshore fog bank, and was expected that night at Palm Springs. She never arrived. Due to a paperwork foul-up, a search did not <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> for several days, and while the eventual search of land and sea was massive, it failed to find a trace of Silver or her plane. She is the only missing WASP pilot. She had married Sgt. Henry Silver one month before her disappearance.|$|E

A {{spokesman}} announced on 22 June that the line was expected to reopen between Bewdley and Arley {{by the end of}} July and the section between Bridgnorth and Hampton Loade to be up and running by the end of August; however it became apparent in early July 2007 that these reopenings would be delayed by as much as a month, later extended to up to three months. On 19 July, another torrential storm caused further wreckage in at least 45 separate locations as rain fell on the already saturated ground, and at least ten of these spots damage was so serious major engineering work was required before reconstruction could <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way.</b> It was also said later that the crucial link between Hampton Loade and Arley, including Highley station and the new Engine House museum, would probably not open until as late as Spring 2008.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{investigation}} could <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> Sherman alleged {{that he had}} paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay GBP2,500 each to Belcher and Sir Frank Soskice, the Solicitor General. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 cheque made out to Lass & Co. The cheque {{turned out to be}} a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque. Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the Lord Chancellor William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt should be alerted and asked to investigate. On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley. On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.|$|E

She approached the harbor entrance at 03:00 on 28 October, steaming at a speed of , with her fourth dummy funnel erected to disguise her identity. Emdens lookouts quickly spotted a warship in the port with her lights on; {{it turned out to be}} the Russian protected cruiser , a veteran of the Battle of Tsushima. Zhemchug had put into Penang for repairs to her boilers; only one was in service, which meant that she could not <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> nor were her ammunition hoists powered. Only five rounds of ready ammunition were permitted for each gun, with a sixth chambered. Emden pulled alongside Zhemchug at a distance of Müller ordered a torpedo to be fired at the Russian cruiser. Immediately thereafter, he gave the order for the 10.5cm guns to open fire.|$|E

Smith later described the album as [...] "an introduction to me and an introduction for me to recording", {{and said that she}} [...] "wanted to follow up [...] as quickly as possible with another record, something richer and varied". In July, it was announced that work had begun on her second album, with hopes to release it later in the year. Smith {{said in an interview that}} [...] "We're starting to look at what songs will be on the second album ... I'm not really choosing the songs myself, I'm leaving that up to the people at the record label.

500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not <b>get</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> {{for a few more}} weeks. January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is no doubt that he knew exactly where he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E
