OBJETIVO: descrever medidas antropométricas orofaciais em crianças paulistanas e comparar as médias dessas medidas com os padrões de normalidade publicados para a população norte-americana. MÉTODO: participaram 254 crianças, leucodermas, em dentição mista, com idades entre 7 e 11 anos e 11 meses, sem histórico de distúrbios ou tratamento fonoaudiológicos. As medidas antropométricas orofaciais coletadas foram a altura do lábio superior, a altura do lábio {{inferior}}, o comprimento do filtro e a altura do terço inferior da face. O instrumento utilizado foi um paquímetro eletrônico digital Starrett Series 727. RESULTADOS: os dados obtidos nesta amostra para a altura do lábio superior, altura do lábio inferior e altura do terço inferior da face encontram-se abaixo das médias descritas para as crianças norte-americanas. Os resultados desta amostra, referentes ao comprimento do filtro, coincidem com as médias descritas para as crianças norte-americanas. CONCLUSÃO: os resultados das medidas da presente amostra referentes a altura do lábio superior, altura do lábio inferior e altura do terço inferior da face foram menores do que aqueles publicados para as crianças norte-americanas. Os dados de normalidade da população norte-americana não são válidos para as crianças da nossa população, exceto para o comprimento do filtro. BACKGROUND: anthropometric orofacial {{measurements of}} children from Sao Paulo and from North America. AIM: to describe the anthropometric orofacial measurements {{of children from}} Sao Paulo and to compare the obtained means to the North American norms. METHOD: participants were 254 children, leukoderm, in mixed dentition period, with ages ranging from 7 to 11 years and 11 months, with no history of speech, language and hearing disorders or treatment. The investigated anthropometric orofacial measurements were the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the upper lip, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lower</b> lip, {{the length of the}} philtrum and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>lower</b> face. In order to obtain these measurements, an electronic digital sliding caliper Starrett Series 727 was used. RESULTS: the obtained data for the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the upper lip, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lower</b> lip and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lower</b> face are below the means described for North American children. When considering the length of the philtrum, similar results were found between the research sample and North American children.

The closed and the open portions of the cycle were modeled in this study using theory of gas dynamics and thermodynamics. Suitable forms {{of the first and}} second laws of thermodynamics were applied to a two zone (burned and unburned) control mass during the closed portion of the cycle and control volume during the open portion of the cycle, respectively.

In Tyrrell's case, the engine was equipped with a water injection system (a common means <b>of</b> <b>lowering</b> <b>cylinder</b> temperatures to increase power), whose supply tank was to be topped up late in the race. In addition, the FIA had already made provision to reduce the fuel allowance for each race during the season to 220 litres and banned the refueling of 1982-83, reducing the power available to turbocharged runners while imposing little restriction on more efficient non-turbo runners. Predictably turbo-powered teams were against this move, leaving only Tyrrell - whose engine did not need the additional fuel - in favour of it. However, F1 rules required unanimity for the change to be scrapped, leaving Tyrrell in the way.It had been observed in races that, after Tyrrell's final pit stop, lead shot could be seen escaping {{from the top of the}} car. It turned out that Tyrrell were running the car underweight during the race then, in the closing stages, topping up water injection supply tanks with an additional 2 gallons of water mixed with 140 lb of lead shot to ensure it made the weight limit. As this was pumped in under significant pressure, some escaped through the tank vent and rained down on neighbouring pits, in sufficient quantities for other teams to sweep the shot away before their drivers pitted.|$|R

A small change in the configurations <b>of</b> the flue, <b>lower</b> and upper labiums, etc. often results in a great change in the sound. This research aims to clarify {{the effect of the}} voicing adjustment on the physical properties of the air jet emerging from the flue and thus on the output sound. Two specific adjustments are considered here: the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lower</b> lip relative to the languid and the inner geometry of the foothole.

These observations were then used for estimating the output sound. To this end, sound was synthesized using a physical model that is a set of differential equations with delayed feedback describing the sound generation in the flue organ pipe.

Most faba bean genotypes show indeterminate growth habit. These genotypes may become very tall when water is available. Indeed faba bean crops may grow to a <b>height</b> <b>of</b> 2 m at maturity although faba bean crops {{are not usually}} that tall. Excessive plant height (PH) may result in plant lodging.

Other height-related traits are also important. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lower</b> flower (HLF) and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lower</b> pod (HLP) are important agronomic traits.
