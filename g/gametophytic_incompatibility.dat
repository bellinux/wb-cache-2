40|$|The ga 1 {{locus of}} maize confers {{unilateral}} cross incompatibility, preventing cross pollination between females carrying the incompatible Ga 1 -s allele and males not carrying a corresponding compatible allele. To characterize this {{system at the}} molecular level, we carried out a transcript profiling experiment in which silks from near isogenic lines carrying the Ga 1 -s and ga 1 alleles were compared. While several differentially expressed genes were identified, only one mapped to the known location of ga 1. This gene is a pectin methylesterase (PME), which we designated as ZmPme 3, and is present and expressed only in Ga 1 -s genotypes. While a functional ZmPME 3 is not present in the ga 1 genotypes examined, a pectin methylesterase gene cluster is found in ga 1 genotypes. The gene cluster in W 22 contains 58 tandem full-length or partial PME pseudo genes. These data combined with a wealth of previously published data on the involvement of PMEs in pollen tube growth suggest a role for cell wall modification enzymes in the pollen exclusion component of Ga 1 -s <b>gametophytic</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> Consistent with this role, a third allele which lacks the female function of Ga 1 -s, Ga 1 -m, has a mutationally inactivated version of ZmPme 3...|$|E

Heredity, 94 (3), 356 - 363. Sponsorship: BBSRCThe two-locus <b>gametophytic</b> <b>incompatibility</b> system in {{perennial}} ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is not always fully effective: obligate selfing of plants sieves self-compatible pollen mutants, and self-fertility becomes fixed in subsequent generations. Self-compatibility (SC) was investigated in an F 2 family. In vitro self-pollinations were analysed and recorded and plants were classified as being either partially or fully compatible. Distorted segregation ratios of markers on linkage group (LG) 5 were found, which indicate the possible presence of a gametophytic SC locus. Interval linkage analysis of pollen compatibility after selfing confirmed that this distortion was due to a locus (T) analogous to the S 5 locus of rye. However, even though markers in this region were, on average, less than 1 cM apart, the minimum number of plants possessing the unfavoured allele was never less than 6 % for any marker locus. We proved that this {{was because of the}} presence of another SC locus, exhibiting gametophytic selection, segregating in this population and identified by interval mapping analysis of compatibility classes of in vitro self-pollinations. This locus was located on LG 1, and probably corresponds to the S locus. We show that the T locus, a relic of a multilocus system, functions through interaction with the S locus: F 2 segregation of incompatibility phenotypes and linked markers demonstrated that the S/t pollen genotype combination, expected to be compatible on selfing, was sometimes incompatible. Further evidence is presented to show that this interaction must be dependent on yet another locus located on LG 2. A prime candidate would be the Z incompatibility locus. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{breeding}} is {{a multidisciplinary}} scientific activity with tool development as driving force. It {{is clear from}} history that availability of genetic variation and selection methods are bottom lines for variety development. The genetic source of traditional plant breeding is restricted to domestication of traits from the so-called 'breeders' gene pool', consisting of crossable sources. Gene cloning and genetic transformation broaden the available genetic variation to genes from all living organisms. The so-called new genes in genetically modified organism (GMO) plants, consist of transgenes, with (chimaeric) genes from outside the 'breeder's gene pool'. Transgenic plants needed additional biosafety rules such as Directive 2001 / 18 EC. However, these are not needed after transformation of the four rol-genes from wild-type Agrobacterium rhizogenes. In the meantime, cloned cisgenes, natural dominant genes from 'breeders' gene pool', are available, enabling cisgenic crops after marker-free transformation, which extends plant breeding with traditional traits. From long-term experience, {{it is clear that}} traditional breeding with the 'breeders' gene pool' has a history of safe use. Different scientific committees concluded that cisgenic crops are as safe as traditionally bred varieties. So, cisgenesis is a powerful new tool for plant breeding with traditional traits as indicated in the potential examples on: (1) breeding for durable resistance to potato late blight and apple scab by R-gene stacking; (2) the new possibility to come to stacking of monogenic resistance alleles in wheat; (3) engineering of restoration of cytoplasmic male sterility by cloned restorer genes and of altering <b>gametophytic</b> <b>incompatibility</b> by introducing additional S-alleles; (4) increasing phytase activity by gene dosage effect in barley; and (5) the possibility of changing hormone metabolism in (fruit) trees leading to important morphological alterations. In near future, because of availability of many more cisgenes, it is expected that the possibilities of cisgenesis will increase rapidly as the next step in plant breeding with traditional traits, if treatment as non-GMO is approved...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of gene and allelic genealogies at a <b>gametophytic</b> self- <b>incompatibility</b> locus in {{plants have been}} investigated analytically and checked against extensive numerical simulations. It is found that, as with overdominant loci, there are two genealogical processes with markedly different time scales. First, functionally distinct allelic lines diverge on an extremely long time scale which is inversely related to the mutation rate to new alleles. These alleles show a genealogical structure which is similar, after an appropriate rescaling of time, to that described by the coalescent process for genes at a neutral locus. Second, gene copies sampled within the same functional allelic line show genealogical relationships similar to neutral gene genealogies but on a much shorter time scale, {{which is on the}} same order of magnitude as the harmonic mean of the number of gene copies within an allelic line. These results are discussed in relation to data showing trans-specific polymorphisms for alleles at the <b>gametophytic</b> self- <b>incompatibility</b> locus in the Solanaceae. It is shown that population sizes on the order of 4 x 105 and a mutation rate per locus per generation as high as 10 - 6 could account for estimated allelic divergence times in this family.

40|$|Many {{flowering}} plants {{are unable to}} set seeds with their own pollen because a system known as gametophytic self-incompatibility is operating. The basis of this system is a single multiallelic locus S, and if the S allele carried by a pollen grain matches {{one of the two}} S alleles carried in the style, as it is certain to do upon self-pollination, then pollen tube growth is inhibited. Should one of the self-pollen grains carry a mutated S allele, however, it would not match either of those carried in the style and would therefore, not be inhibited. Gametophytic self-incompatibility thus provides a mechanism for discriminating between such mutant and nonmutant pollen grains. Knowing the numbers of pollen grains available to the stigma, and also the numbers of seeds produced, it becomes possible to estimate the frequency with which mutations occur at the S locus. Assay systems of mutagenesis which employ <b>gametophytic</b> self <b>incompatibility</b> will allow very large numbers of pollen grains to be screened for S allele mutants, which should indicate the mutagenicity of the environment. These systems have the added benefit that screening is done by the stylar tissues, rather than technicians. Finally, they may be used to construct largely autonomous assay systems which would provide continuous monitoring of the environment. Flowering plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms which insure that accidental selfpollinatio...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} observational, {{experimental}} and simulated data are analysed {{to discover how}} self incompatibility, relative bloom phenology and dormancy alleviation affect fruit set on 'Sundrop' apricot in Hawkes Bay. The derivation of two mathematical models, one of cross pollination, the other of bud development, provides a unifying theme to the study. Controlled pollination experiments demonstrated that 'Sundrop' displays <b>gametophytic</b> self <b>incompatibility.</b> Pollen tubes from 'Sundrop' pollen generally fail to penetrate styles of 'Sundrop' flowers and this prevents fruit set under Hawkes Bay conditions. Study of apricot pollen tube growth at five constant temperatures between 5 ° and 25 °C suggested that the penetration failure was not due to adverse temperature conditions since self pollen tube penetration was strongest at 10 ° and 15 °C, temperatures typical of Hawkes Bay during apricot bloom. Field observations of honey bee foragers illustrated the strong influence that weather conditions have on honey bee foraging activity, but showed that activity on 'Sundrop' flowers is normally sufficient to achieve satisfactory cross pollination. Analysis of bloom records indicated that relative times of bloom of apricots in Hawkes Bay and other North Island sites vary considerably from year to year. A simple model of pollenizer pollen transfer was therefore derived to estimate the optimum pollenizer bloom divergence for 'Sundrop'. It indicated 'Sundrop' should bloom slightly before (1 - 2 days) a pollenizer. Optimum divergence was most sensitive to the durations of pollen release and floral receptivity. Delayed pollination experiments showed that the duration of receptivity of 'Sundrop' flowers {{was the same as}} petal lifespan. Significant opportunity for cross pollination was still predicted when the pollenizer bloomed as late as six days after 'Sundrop'. By this criteria, 'Trevatt' (the most commonly-used pollenizer) appeared satisfactory under most, though not all, conditions. The pollen transfer model indicated that relative bloom phenology needed consideration for selection of pollenizers for 'Sundrop'. However, the "Utah' chill unit index was a poor predictor of dormancy alleviation and bloom for apricots under Hawkes Bay conditions. Hence, a model of low temperature-mediated alleviation of dormancy incorporating a progressive shift in bud temperature response was established based on an analysis of dormancy as the depression of a 'thermal response window' and chilling as a twofold seasonal signal controlling window size. Initial evaluation confirmed that the resulting PHYSHIFT model was highly flexible and could reproduce many of the responses that dormant buds of Prunus species display to constant and cyclic temperature regimes. Hence, the results suggest that the PHYSHIFT model may offer more reliable prediction of relative bloom timing for the purpose of pollenizer selection than chill unit models...|$|R
40|$|Self-incompatibility (SI) is a {{mechanism}} that many flowering plants employ to prevent fertilisation by self- and self-like pollen ensuring heterozygosity and hybrid vigour. Although {{a number of}} single locus mechanisms have been characterised in detail, no multi-locus systems have been fully elucidated. Historically, examples of the genetic analysis of multi-locus SI, to make analysis tractable, are either made on the progeny of bi-parental crosses, where the number of alleles at each locus is restricted, or on crosses prepared {{in such a way}} that only one of the SI loci segregates. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) possesses a well-documented two locus (S and Z) <b>gametophytic</b> <b>incompatibility</b> system. A more universal, realistic proof of principle study was conducted in a perennial ryegrass population in which allelic and non-allelic diversity was not artificially restricted. A complex pattern of pollinations from a diallel cross was revealed which could not possibly be interpreted easily per se, even with an already established genetic model. Instead, pollination scores were distilled into principal component scores described as Compatibility Components (CC 1 -CC 3). These were then subjected to a conventional genome-wide association analysis. CC 1 associated with markers on linkage groups (LGs) 1, 2, 3, and 6, CC 2 exclusively with markers in a genomic region on LG 2, and CC 3 with markers on LG 1. BLAST alignment with the Brachypodium physical map revealed highly significantly associated markers with peak associations with genes adjacent and four genes away from the chromosomal locations of candidate SI genes, S- and Z-DUF 247, respectively. Further significant associations were found in a Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 3 region, having shared synteny with Lolium LG 1, suggesting further SI loci linked to S or extensive micro-re-arrangement of the genome between B. distachyon and L. perenne. Significant associations with gene sequences aligning with marker sequences on Lolium LGs 3 and 6 were also identified. We therefore demonstrate the power of a novel association genetics approach to identify the genes controlling multi-locus gametophytic SI systems and to identify novel loci potentially involved in already established SI systems...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{presented}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of PhilosophyThe genus Restrepia is well known to orchid enthusiasts but its micromorphology has not been described, and its pollination and breeding systems have not been investigated. The aim of this investigation was, therefore, to add to existing knowledge so that the resultant data {{could be used to}} facilitate ex situ conservation initiatives. A detailed electron microscopy study (SEM) of the floral organs was performed. This confirmed the structure of the dorsal sepal and lateral petal osmophores, their secretory nature together with that of the synsepal and the labellum. It was postulated how, by manipulating different labellar surface textures, the flower might use these ‘tactile guides’ to steer the insect (fly) through the flower. The cirrhi were postulated to help by destabilising the pollinator in flight, trapping it and bringing about pollination. The papillate structure of the calli was established and their optical properties investigated. Media comparison investigations established that Western medium supported the highest germination rates and, with the addition of banana supplement, the highest rates for seedling growth and development. This represented the first protocol for axenic germination of Restrepia in the literature (Millner et al., 2008) and provided a tested methodology for investigating breeding systems and producing Restrepia plant material for both scientific and horticultural purposes. Self-pollinations were found to produce fewer embryos compared to cross-pollinations. The operation of self-incompatibility (SI) was confirmed by the study of pollen tube growth which further confirmed the time interval between pollination and fertilisation. A time line from pollination/fertilisation to flowering was established. The type of SI in operation was best explained by <b>gametophytic</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> This demonstrated {{that it was possible to}} raise Restrepia hybrids and species from seed, by performing intraspecific crosses so helping to preserve them for posterity and relieve pressure on wild populations. Narrow endemic Restrepia species face combined threats from habitat loss, habitat degradation and problems of viable seed production due to the effects of SI and inbreeding depression (ID). Recently developed online resources, such as GeoCAT, were used to perform a Red List assessment in order to identify the degree of threat individual species faced, both globally and nationally. All species were classified as facing substantial levels of threat; although this was lessened for populations in protected habitats. Conservation is needed for cultivated collections as well as these wild populations by keeping alive existing knowledge and expertise in growing these species...|$|E
40|$|Flowering {{plants are}} able to avoid {{inbreeding}} by several genetically based mechanisms. <b>Gametophytic</b> self- <b>incompatibility</b> (GSI) occurs when pollen is rejected in the style or on the stigma if it possesses a matching allele with either of the ovule parent's S-alleles. This mechanism typically involves a single genetic locus that is highly polymorphic within populations and species. S- alleles are maintained by strong negative frequency dependent selection that essentially favors alleles when they become rare in a population. This type of balancing selection preserves variation at the S-locus {{for millions of years}} enabling us to infer ancient demographic patterns through phylogenetic analyses of genealogies of S-alleles. GSI has been described in several taxa of Solanaceae but only one genus of Papaveraceae, the genus Papaver. Although the molecular mechanisms of self-recognition in these respective families differ remarkably, the underlying theoretical predictions regarding their genetics and evolution are expected to be similar. In Chapter I of this dissertation, I first explore the evolutionary history of a genetic bottleneck in the Solanaceae. Self-incompatible species in the sister genera Physalis and Witheringia share restricted variation at the S-locus indicative of an ancient bottleneck that occurred in a common ancestor. Using phylogenic approaches to look at S-allele variation in species of the subtribe Iochrominae, the clade containing Physalis and Witheringia, we {{are able to}} determine when this bottleneck event occurred. We then use two chloroplast markers, fossil calibrations and a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach to determine the approximate date of the bottleneck. In Chapter II, I examine the molecular evolution of individual codons from S-alleles from the bottlenecked lineages of Physalis compared to those of the non-bottlenecked lineages of Solanum. Because Physalis S- RNases appear to have diversified more recently than those of Solanum, we find significantly different patterns among amino acids undergoing positive selection using maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian coalescent methods. (increase in subst. at 4 fold degenerate sites or 3 rd position (general synonymous relative to 1 - 2 nd pos.) HyPhy. docs, overall dS increase in Physalis relative to Solanum; overall increase in dN in Physalis?). In Chapter III, I explore the genetics of a putative S-locus polymorphism in three previously uncharacterized species of Papaveraceae native to California. Analyses of putative S-allele sequences from A. munita, P. californicus and Romneya coulteri sampled from natural populations have shown that each harbors substantial genetic polymorphism homologous to stylar S-alleles from Papaver rhoeas. These genes appear to be expressed only in female reproductive tissues as expected for stylar S-locus products. In A. munita and P. californicus, greenhouse crosses among full sibs with matching putative S-genotypes usually don't result in seed set while crosses among individuals with non-matching genotypes almost always do. In addition, potential duplications at or near this locus have been detected in diploid P. californicus. Contrary to other well known SI systems, allelic genealogies from Papaveraceae show a general pattern of monophyletic clustering according to species. Genealogies of these species' S-alleles and those from newly sequenced Papaver alleles show general patterns of monophyletic clustering. The reduced levels of trans-specific polymorphism may be explained by founder events or population bottlenecks in each of the species, though other possibilities must also be considered. We also employ maximum likelihood models to estimate positive selection among putative alleles from these tax...|$|R
40|$|Solanum verrucosum (2 n = 24) is a self-compatible, highly fertile species. This {{conclusion}} {{is drawn from}} the results of studies on 21 various introductions of this species. In spite of self-compatibility and good male and female fertility, the species generally needs a pollinating agent to ensure seed set owing to the supra-staminal pistil characteristic of its flowers. S. verrucosum is heterozygous for genes controlling qualitative as well as quantitative characters. Differences between and variation within introductions of S. verrucosum occur. The species is not resistant to inbreeding. Pre-breeding and selection within the species is demonstrated to be effective and therefore is advisable for its efficient utilization in potato breeding. Within S. verrucosum, F 1 hybrids show a better performance than inbreds. The segregating F 2 show inbreeding depression. Heterosis is more pronounced in early growth stages. In different characters, magnitude of heterosis in F 1 and degree of inbreeding depression in F 2 are associated. In S. verrucosum, 'tall stem' is controlled by two complementary dominant genes, as is obvious in hybrids between the short-stemmed introduction CPC 1339 and the tall introductions CPC 2247 and PI 195172 - 237 - 9 - 13. A similar genetic basis determines early v. late flowering in CPC 1339 x PI 195172 - 237 - 9 - 13, late flowering of CPC 1339 being recessive. A significantly negative correlation has been found between flowering time and stem height. The 'bubble sterility' (pollen showing breakdown of the cytoplasm, staining faintly and looking bubbled) occurring in S. verrucosum Haw 2246 is controlled by polygenes. The 'blunt spine walls' of pollen grains (pollen with many coarse blunts on their walls), discovered in the same introduction, behaves as a monogenic recessive character. Both female fertility (number of seeds per berry) and male fertility (percentage of stainable pollen) are found from the study of different populations to be under polygenic control. Colchicine induced S. verrucosum plants with 48 chromosomes show a decrease in male and female fertility but an increase in vigour. In S. verrucosum, grafting onto tomato improves seed set and results in richer flowering and in a more vigorous growth, also in some interspecific hybrids. Grafting has no significant effect on male fertility, either in S. verrucosum, or in the male sterile interspecific hybrids. Upon inoculation with Phytophthora infestans Races 4, 1. 4, 1. 2. 3. 4, 1. 3. 4. 7. 8 and Isolates B 19 and 331, S. verrucosum reacts in different ways. Several introductions have segregated for resistance, others have appeared to consist of either susceptible or almost resistant individuals only. Both major genes and polygenes are assumed to condition resistance. Selection appears effective. Whether by direct approaches (the use of self-set seed) or indirect (the introduction of self-compatibility), haploids (parthenotes with 2 n = 24 from S. tuberosum) and self- incompatible species, especially S. phureja, proved to be highly heterozygous and suffer greatly from inbreeding. Worthless plants, and segregation for several vegetative and generative characters occur in inbred populations from self-incompatible species. In some cases, the degree of inbreeding is associated with the recessivity of specific genes. The self-compatible species S. polyadenium and S. etuberosum are neither crossable mutually, nor with any of the other species studied. Though barriers reducing berry and seed set and hybrid seed germination are present, S. verrucosum is easily crossed with several other species and haploids, but usually only as a female partner: as a rule pollen from self-compatible species is inhibited in styles of self-incompatible ones (unilateral incompatibility). Hybrids between female S. verrucosum and haploids and diploid species generally grow well. In two cases androgenetic plants (2 n = 24) have been found among hybrid populations, and in one case a parthenogenetic seed (2 n = 24) of S. verrucosum has occurred, giving rise to homozygous and homogeneous population. The parthenogenetic population shows reduced vigour but improved seed set and tuber yield and all its plants are resistant to Phytophthora Race 1. 2. 3. 4. All interspecific hybrids with different female S. verrucosum introductions are highly male sterile due to plasmon-genic interaction. The dominant plasmon-sensitive genes are wide spread in haploids and diploid species. In the 21 introductions of S. verrucosum, three plasmons, [Tr s], [Ps s] and [SY s], occur, each leading to diagnostic appearance of male sterility {{in the presence of the}} corresponding Tr, Ps and Sv dominant plasmon- sensitive genes. The male sterilities are 'tetrad sterility' (generally poor shedding and clumping of the faintly or non-stained sterile pollen grains in tetrads) in [Tr s] plasmon, 'partly stained pollen sterility' (pollen production normal, but the sterile pollen does not show complete staining) in [Ps s] plasmon, and 'striped vacuolar sterility' (very poor shedding of faintly stained sterile pollen, characterized by the presence of vacuoles and stripes) in [Sv s] plasmon. All S. verrucosum introductions possess sterilizing (sensitive) plasmons, contrary to a report in literature. In the backcrosses and segregating populations of the interspecific hybrids with S. verrucosum as a female, two additional types of male sterility have occurred: 'undivided microsporocytes' (failure of pollen mother cells to separate into 4 cells, irrespective of nucleus division; consequently microsporocytes are shed, each possessing 4 nuclei) and 'non-shedding' (pollen sacs hardly shedding any pollen). The former type (also discovered in pure S. verrucosum) is controlled by two complementary recessive genes, the latter by the presence of three complementary recessive ns genes in the [ns s] plasmon of S. verrucosum. The 'lobed appearance' of pollen grains (each grain having three lobes) is conditioned by dominant Ld gene(s) in [Ld s] plasmon of S. verrucosum. Generally plants having [Tr s] plasmon also possess [Ld s] plasmon. The Ld genes are wide spread, like the dominant Tr plasmon-sensitive genes which lead to male sterility. That is why tetrad sterility and lobed pollen are mostly associated in F 1 hybrids. Perhaps this is the reason why the lobed appearance of pollen has been reported by some authors as a type of male sterility. In our studies lobed pollen and male sterility have proved to be different characters. In one cross, duplicate linkage groups between Tr and Ld genes have been discovered with a crossing over value of 15 %. In all the above cases of plasmon-genic interaction, S. verrucosum possesses 'sensitive' plasmons, whereas other species and haploids are assumed to have 'resistant' plasmons. Self- and cross-incompatibility behaviour in S. phureja and S. stenotomum x S. phureja are controlled by two loci, S and R. The incompatibility reaction is gametophytically controlled. The S locus is epistatic to R; the latter has an allele (R fi) which, when present in homozygous condition, leads to female incompatibility. Irregularities observed in the studies of incompatibility may be due to recombining modifier complexes. Some evidence is presented in the discussion suggesting that the basic chromosome number in Solanum may be less than 12. The evolutionary aspects of self-compatibility and unilateral incompatibility is discussed. A two power competition hypothesis is presented to account for the relation, crossability and the expected behaviour of hybrids between self-compatible and selfincompatible species. Specific genes are assumed to be present in self-incompatible species, preventing fertilization by pollen carrying the self-compatibility alleles (S c). The hypothesis has shown why such genes must have developed in the course of evolution, what the result of their functioning has been and how self-compatible species react toward their development. Data from literature on the crosses between self-compatible and self-incompatible species (with the <b>gametophytic</b> system of <b>incompatibility)</b> from several genera of different families have been critically considered and are easily explained on the basis of this new hypothesis. Breeding for resistance to Phytophthora has been discussed. A new hypothesis is presented to combine 'uniform' and 'differential' resistance. Both types of resistance are assumed to be controlled by specialized interacting genes for resistance. The polygenes are 'older' and control the 'primary general' resistance, the major genes govern the direct (switching) work towards specific races. Breeding at the diploid level and the use of S. verrucosum and overcoming the barriers to its use in breeding are debated...|$|R
