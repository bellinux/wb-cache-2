40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which effects of floor eggs, washed floor <b>eggs,</b> and clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> were investigated on incubation characteristics and performance in later life of broiler chickens. In both experiments, a young and an older breeder flock were used in a 3 × 2 factorial design during incubation. In the second experiment, male and female chickens were reared separately until d 35 of age in floor pens. During this grow out trial, an extra group was created in which chickens obtained from clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> were mixed with chickens obtained from floor eggs, meaning that grow out period was set up as a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial design with 4 egg types, 2 breeder ages, and 2 sexes. In both experiments, fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs were lower in floor and washed eggs than in clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> (hatchability: experiment 1 : 74. 4 vs. 70. 6 vs. 92. 6 % for floor eggs, washed floor <b>eggs</b> and clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs,</b> respectively, P < 0. 001; experiment 2 : 78. 3 vs. 81. 7 vs. 90. 2 %, respectively, P < 0. 001). In experiment 2, BW at d 0 of chickens obtained from clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> was {{higher than that of}} chickens from floor eggs and washed floor eggs (41. 5 vs. 40. 4 and 40. 3 g, respectively; P < 0. 001). This difference disappeared during the grow out period and was absent at slaughter age at d 35 of age. Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality during the grow out period were not affected by egg type. Incidence and severity of hock burns and footpad dermatitis were not affected by egg type or breeder age. Litter friability at d 35 of age tended to be lower in pens with chickens obtained from washed floor eggs compared to clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs.</b> We conclude that incubation of floor eggs or washed floor eggs resulted in lower fertility and hatchability compared to clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs,</b> but that performance during the grow out period was not affected. </p...|$|R

40|$|Jersey for {{evidence}} of intraspecific brood parasit-ism and egg removal during the laying period. Egg removal occurred significantly more often at nests where intraspecific brood parasitism was detected (12 of 35 nests, 34 %) than at unparasitized nests (23 of 249 nests, 9 %). Brood parasitism (92 % of parasitized <b>nests)</b> and <b>egg</b> removal (74 % of <b>nests</b> with <b>egg</b> removal) were most common at <b>nests</b> where <b>egg</b> laying began in April of each year (i. e., early <b>nests).</b> <b>Egg</b> removal occurred at 26 (19 %) and brood parasitism at 32 (23 %) of 138 early nests. Both brood parasitism and egg removal were concentrated during the first four days in the lay-ing period when brood parasitism {{is most likely to}} be successful and when host nests are most vul-nerable to parasitism (Romagnano 1987). Both parasitism and removal usually involved a single <b>egg</b> at each <b>nest.</b> We detected brood parasitism and egg removal on the same day at five of 12 nests (42 %) where both were observed. Because starlings do not remove foreign <b>eggs</b> from their <b>nests</b> once they begin laying (Stouffer et al. 1987) we hypothe-size that parasite females ometimes removed host <b>eggs</b> while parasitizing <b>nests...</b>|$|R
