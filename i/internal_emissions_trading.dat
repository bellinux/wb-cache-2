40|$|Abstract: In recent few years, {{market economy}} {{mechanism}} in China has gradually established, and market based policy tools were attached more importance than ever before. As China {{economy has been}} growing fast with an annually increasing ratio of about 9. 8 % {{in the past three}} decades, its environmental problems are mostly getting worse. In the future, more environmental restraints would be imposed on the economic development, and bigger pressures of major pollutants reduction will be ensued, so policy innovation of environmental pollution prevention and control should be impeded. <b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> pilot projects has emerged in China since late 1980 ’s, but advanced very slowly. However, with great efforts in environmental protection of the governments these years, environmental monitoring and supervision and management capacities have been greatly increased, in particular in some sectors or regions, and with these years pilot projects exploration, lots of policy implementation experiences of <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> also gained. Under such backgrounds, pollution <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> programs developed rapidly especially since 2007, though the happened <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> case mostly concentrated on SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>trade</b> in the fire power generation industry, and COD <b>emission</b> <b>trade</b> in some small and medium-sized basins, development trends of <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> has become vigorous.

40|$|Over {{the last}} four decades <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> has enjoyed a high profile in {{environmental}} law scholarship and in environmental law and policy. Much of this regulatory discussion is promotional, preferring <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> above other regulatory strategies without, however, engaging with legal complexities embedded in conceptualising, scrutinising and managing <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> schemes. The combined effect of these debates is to create a perception that <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> is a straightforward regulatory strategy, imposable across various jurisdictions and environmental settings. This thesis shows that this view of <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> is problematic for at least two reasons. First, <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> responds to distinct environmental and non-environmental goals, including creating profit-centres, establishing a governance regime aimed at substituting state control of common resources, and ensuring regulatory compliance. This is important, as the particular purpose entrusted to a given <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> regime has, as its corollary, a particular governance structure, according to which the regime may be constructed and managed. Second, the governance structures of <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> regimes are culture- specific, which is a significant reminder of the importance of law in understanding not only how <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> schemes function but also what meaning is given to them as regulatory strategies. This is shown by deconstructing <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> discourses: that is, by inquiring into the assumptions about <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> that feature in the literature and in debates involving law- and policymakers and the judiciary at the EU level. Ultimately, this thesis makes a strong argument for reconfiguring the common understanding of <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> schemes as regulatory strategies, and sets out a framework for analysis to sustain that reconfiguration.

40|$|Abstract—This study aims {{to propose}} three {{evaluation}} methods {{to evaluate the}} Tokyo Cap and <b>Trade</b> Program when <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> is performed virtually among enterprises, focusing on carbon dioxide (CO 2), {{which is the only}} emitted greenhouse gas that tends to increase. The first method clarifies the optimum reduction rate for the highest cost benefit, the second discusses <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> among enterprises through market trading, and the third verifies long-term <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> during the term of the plan (2010 - 2019), checking the validity of <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> partly using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The findings of this study can be summarized in the following three points. 1. Since the total cost benefit is the greatest at a 44 % reduction rate, it is possible to set it more highly than that of the Tokyo Cap and Trade Program to get more total cost benefit. 2. At a 44 % reduction rate, among 320 enterprises, 8 purchasing enterprises and 245 sales enterprises gain profits from <b>emissions</b> <b>trading,</b> and 67 enterprises perform voluntary reduction without conducting <b>emissions</b> <b>trading.</b> Therefore, to further promote <b>emissions</b> <b>trading,</b> it is necessary to increase the sales volumes of <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> in addition to sales enterprises by increasing the number of purchasing enterprises. 3. Compared to short-term <b>emissions</b> <b>trading,</b> there are few enterprises which benefit in each year through the long-term <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> of the Tokyo Cap and Trade Program. Only 81 enterprises at the most can gain profits from <b>emissions</b> <b>trading</b> in FY 2019.

40|$|How to {{implement}} <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> is one {{question in the}} current negotiations on a new sulfur protocol in Europe. Whereas the current protocol stipulates a 30 percent uniform reduction, national emission ceilings included in the proposed new protocol imply differentiated reductions. In addition, emission and fuel standards are proposed. This paper examines the costs and environmental impacts of <b>emission</b> <b>trading.</b> <b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> combined with regulations is a new element in the paper. Calculations using the RAINS (Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation) model suggest that overlaying <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> on regulations not only reduces the cost savings but has beneficial impacts as well: ecosystem protection is not changed and significant decreases in environmental benefits for countries are largely avoided. <b>Emission</b> <b>trading</b> {{can also be used}} to decrease emissions and increase ecosystem protection. If combined with existing legislation, <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> minimizes losses in expected environmental benefits for some countries, and most countries gain. However, the initial distribution of emission ceilings has to be used so that some countries are not confronted with higher costs. Trade-offs appear to exist between the use of <b>emission</b> <b>trading</b> to achieve cost savings on the one hand, and ecosystem protection and distributional equity on the other.
