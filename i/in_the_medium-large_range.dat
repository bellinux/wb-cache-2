Small numbers of neurones with positive α 2 A-AR immunoreactivity (α 2 A-AR-IR) were detected in DRG from normal animals or contralateral to nerve lesions. In contrast, after complete or partial sciatic nerve transection the numbers of ipsilateral L 4 and L 5 DRG somata expressing α 2 A-AR-IR sharply increased (> 5 -fold).

After nerve injury, double labelling with Fluoro-Gold, a marker of retrograde transport from transected fibres, or by immunoreactivity for c-jun protein, an indicator of injury and regeneration, suggested that many of the neurones expressing α 2 A-AR-IR were uninjured by <b>the</b> sciatic lesions. <b>In</b> general <b>the</b> largest proportionate increase in numbers of neurones labelled by α 2 A-AR-IR after nerve lesions appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>medium-large</b> diameter <b>range</b> (31 – 40 μm), a group principally composed of cell bodies of low threshold mechanoreceptors.

40|$|By {{means of}} non-perturbative ab initio calculations, it is shown that {{paramagnetic}} closed-shell molecules {{are characterized by}} a strongly non-linear magnetic response, whose main feature consists of a paramagnetic-to-diamagnetic transition in a strong magnetic field. The physical origin of this phenomenon is rationalised {{on the basis of}} an analytical model based on molecular orbital theory. For the largest molecules considered here, the acepleiadylene dianion and the corannulene dianion, the transition field is of the order of 103 T, about one order of magnitude larger than the magnetic field strength currently achievable in experimental settings. However, our simple model suggests that the paramagnetic-to-diamagnetic transition is a universal property of paramagnetic closed-shell systems in strong magnetic fields, provided no singlet–triplet level crossing occurs for fields smaller than the critical transition field.

Laboratory and field investigations were used to assess the effect of N. minor presence on the retention and productivity of Greenshell musselTM spat. Specific consideration was given to predation pressure and induced anti-predator defenses, both of which can cause financial losses to mussel farmers. High (12 crabs/cage- 1) and low (3 crabs/cage- 1) densities of large (males: > 20 mm, females: > 15 mm TCW) and medium (males: 15 - 20 mm, females: 10 - 15 mm TCW) decorator crabs were placed in cages on commercial Greenshell mussel farm droppers at two sites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pelorus Sound. The byssal characteristics, spat retention rate and spat shell length were assessed at 8 and 11 weeks after trial initiation. Greenshell mussel density on the experimental droppers decreased significantly when medium and high densities of the decorator crabs (N. minor) were introduced. N. minor presence induced the remaining Greenshell mussel spat to produce more and thicker byssus threads which consequently lead to increased mussel attachment. <b>The</b> decrease <b>in</b> retention rate and <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> mussel attachment strength were more pronounced in small recently seeded spat. Laboratory experiments to assess the consumption rate of small (≤ 5 mm) Greenshell mussel spat by decorator crabs showed that mussel consumption by N. minor peaked at 56. 43 (± 13. 02 (95 % C.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) {{technology has}} rapidly increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last years. HVAC systems have become important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design of <b>medium-large</b> buildings {{in order to}} ensure thermal comfort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environments with respect to the temperature and humidity of the air. Control, optimisation and maintenance procedures are fundamental in HVAC systems in order to guarantee people comfort and energy efficient solutions in their management. Two different topics are covered in this thesis. Energy Efficient Control of Ice Thermal Energy Storage Systems HVAC plants have recently begun to be matched with thermal energy storage systems. If properly designed, installed, and maintained, these systems can be used to store energy when its cost is low and exploiting it when <b>the</b> price increases. <b>In</b> particular, in HVAC cooling systems, a common thermal storage medium is ice. From a control and optimisation point of view, a cooling plant with ice storage proves to be a complex system. Standard control strategies seem {{not to be able to}} achieve the right trade-off between energy efficiency and demand satisfaction. In this thesis, in order to design efficient control strategies for storage systems, a HVAC model with ice storage is developed in a simulation environment. The thermal behaviour of the HVAC system is derived from the mass and energy conservation equations; <b>in</b> particular <b>the</b> ice storage is considered a hybrid system, thus taking into consideration both sensible and latent heat. Three standard control methods are compared with a non-linear predictive control strategy. The simulations results show that the implemented non-linear predictive control strategy provides the best control for the efficient energy management of ice storage systems. Fault Detection in HVAC Systems Operating problems associated with degraded equipment, poor maintenance, and improperly implemented controls, plague many HVAC systems. Fault detection methods can therefore play a key role in monitoring complex HVAC plants, detecting anomalous behaviours in such a way as to keep <b>the</b> systems <b>in</b> their best operational conditions with minimum costs. In this thesis, fault detection and diagnosis methods on variable air volume (VAV) systems are first designed. To this aim, a VAV system model with two zones is developed; the control of system is obtained with a direct feedback linearisation technique. Supervised classification methods are used to detect and diagnose <b>the</b> simulated faults <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model. The simulations results show the good performances of <b>the</b> classification <b>in</b> <b>the</b> detection and diagnosis of the most common faults in VAV systems. Detection methods are then developed for the most relevant faults affecting chillers. To this aim, data collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> research project 1043 -RP promoted by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) are used. In this project experimental studies were conducted on a centrifugal water-cooled chiller in order to collect data in both normal and faulty situations. The developed technique is based on one-class classification methods with a novelty detection approach, where only normal data are used to characterize the correct system behaviour. The classification results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for the detection of the most common faults in chillers. ...|$|R

Our results demonstrate that bone consumed by D. viverrinus and D. hallucatus is highly unlikely to be confused with human-accumulated assemblages due to low dietary overlap and the very small bone fragment size produced by both quoll species. Bone accumulations of the larger D. maculatus species, however, may be incorrectly attributed to humans due to <b>the</b> consumption of <b>medium-large</b> mammals by both humans and quolls, and the larger size of bone fragments produced by D. maculatus. Although fragments as large as 25 mm were recovered from wild D. maculatus scats, the median length of scat-bone fragments for D. maculatus falls between ~. 8. 30 - 10. 40 mm. This is significantly different statistically to the median fragment length (11. 90 mm) of bone <b>in</b> scats of <b>the</b> Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii, as reported by Caroline Northwood (1990). Scats from wild D. maculatus indicate that polish and pitting are the most common forms of surface damage to bone, with more than 25 % of specimens displaying these marks. Punctures and tooth drag marks are far rarer, with only 5 % of bone specimens exhibiting this kind of damage. In light of these results, we advocate for detailed observation of the surface of bone specimens, along with obtaining specimen lengths, in order to distinguish quoll accumulated bone in archaeofaunal assemblages...|$|R
