[...] Timberlake taught Sunday school in Ann Arbor while attending the University of Michigan and said he intended to become a Presbyterian minister. [...] At a speech in Mansfield, Ohio, shortly after winning the Rose Bowl in January 1965, Timberlake said, [...] "I couldn't have played football if it hadn't been for Jesus Christ." [...] He continued, [...] "God changed my life. [...] He promises the abundant life, which he has given me, and eternal life, which <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> I'm sure I will have. [...] There's peace associated with being a Christian." ...|$|E
500|$|While he {{was living}} with Maynard, Salinger {{continued}} to write in a disciplined fashion, a few hours every morning. According to Maynard, by 1972 he had completed two new novels. In a rare 1974 interview with The New York Times, he explained: [...] "There is a marvelous peace in not publishing... I like to write. I love to write. But I write just for myself and my own pleasure." [...] According to Maynard, he saw publication as [...] "a damned interruption". In her memoir, Margaret Salinger describes the detailed filing system her father had for his unpublished manuscripts: [...] "A red mark meant, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> before I finish my work, publish this 'as is,' blue meant publish but edit first, and so on." [...] A neighbor said that Salinger {{told him that he}} had written 15 unpublished novels.|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, the Icelandic donor {{died and}} his penis was surgically removed {{so that it}} could be added to the museum's collection. The penectomy was not entirely {{successful}} and left the penis [...] "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look like this when I get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> first, well I can't say. She might say no." ...|$|E
500|$|After several further {{meetings}} and {{an exchange of}} letters, Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant. Now living in relative poverty, Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money, instead paying him in magical instruction. In March 1945, Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood, a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living. He continued living there with Crowley for several months, dealing with the old man's correspondences and needs. In turn, {{he was allowed to}} read from Crowley's extensive library on occult subjects, and performed ceremonial magic workings with him, becoming a high initiate of Crowley's magical group, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O.T.O. in the UK, writing in his diary, [...] "value of Grant. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> or go to the USA, there must be a trained man {{to take care of the}} English O.T.O." [...] However, they also argued, with Grant trying to convince Crowley to relocate to London. On one occasion Crowley shouted at him: [...] "You are the most consummate BORE that the world has yet known. And this at 20!" ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of der, die, das, not because I caught them but because I couldn't." ...|$|E

In January 2012 they toured Japan, becoming the first K-Pop idol group to perform at Tokyo Bunkamura Orchard Hall.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his injury, Liu Zan {{remained}} headstrong and unyielding. He {{was particularly}} fond of reading military and history books. Whenever he read about how military commanders {{in ancient times}} deployed their troops in battle, he would sigh because he thought that he could never be like them. He once told his family and friends, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state}} of chaos, with so many people fighting for power. Throughout history, only extraordinary people will succeed in becoming rich and famous. Now that I can't do anything with this crippling injury, I am no different from being dead. I intend to cut my leg. If I am lucky enough to survive and be able to straighten my leg, then I'll be able to pursue my dreams. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> then so be it." [...] His family and friends tried to stop him but to no avail. He cut himself in the leg and let blood flow freely, but became unconscious because of the pain. After he recovered, he could straighten his leg and walk normally again.|$|E

[...] His fever grew worse through the day, a Monday, and by Wednesday was vomiting and Dr. Pierre Rollin of the CDC took blood samples for testing. [...] A nurse who was administering an intravenous drip that evening at his home was surprised when he began speaking distinctly, though not to her: [...] "Oh, God, I think I will die in my service. [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> let me be the last." [...] Then, in a clear voice, he sang [...] "Onward, Christian Soldiers". Rollin came back with the results the next morning; it was Ebola. [...] Lukwiya immediately asked to be put into the isolation ward, stating [...] "Since I am the boss, I should show an example." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under Zhu Tao's {{subsequent}} suggestion—that {{going to}} Chang'an himself will show great faithfulness to the emperor—Zhu Ci himself offered {{to command the}} Lulong troops in fall defense in 774.

[...] In fall 774, Zhu Ci, leaving Zhu Tao in acting command of Lulong, left Lulong and headed for Chang'an. [...] When he got to Wei Prefecture (蔚州, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei), he grew ill. [...] His subordinates requested that he return to Lulong and wait until his illness got better. [...] Zhu Ci refused, stating, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> continue on and carry my body to Chang'an." [...] The subordinates did not dare to urge him otherwise any further. [...] When he arrived at Chang'an, as {{he was the first}} military governor who had ever visited Chang'an from An Lushan's old territory since the Anshi Rebellion, the officials and people were lined up to welcome him, in such a massive display that it was said that they looked like long walls. [...] Emperor Daizong invited Zhu Ci and his subordinates to a feast at Yanying Hall (延英殿), and it was said that Emperor Daizong gave him unprecedented rewards. [...] For that fall, the fall defense troops were divided into four commands, between Zhu Ci and three other prominent generals, Guo Ziyi, Li Baoyu, and Ma Lin (馬璘).|$|E
