5|$|After reuniting with Terra, the Returners {{decide that}} it is time to launch an all-out attack on the Empire, and Banon asks Terra to attempt {{contacting}} the espers' land in order to gain their support. Terra succeeds in making contact, and when the espers learn that the others captured by the Empire previously have now perished, they become infuriated and enter the human world, where they destroy much of Vector. When the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace. Gestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf, to which she agrees. Accompanied by Locke, Shadow (a ninja mercenary hired by the Empire for the mission), Generals Celes and Leo, the player must then guide Terra to the remote village Thamasa in search of the espers, where they meet Strago Magus and his granddaughter, Relm Arrowny, who also accompany them.|$|E

Despite this tragedy, Syaoran manages to become friends with other characters across his journey. Furthermore, Sakura once again develops feelings for Syaoran who {{at the same time}} starts falling for her again. The development of the characters' relationship demonstrates how while modern society depends on already existing one, a severed one can be reformed if people <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will.</b> At the same time, Syaoran has to say goodbye to the people he met as a result of having to continue travelling. Despite also losing these new founds friends, these actions will help Syaoran grow into a young man.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{inadequate}} {{infrastructure to}} accommodate their surging population, informal settlements {{on the outskirts}} of the cities are being formed. Many refugees deforest the unexplored land and build squatters settlements, or slums, on the steeps, exploiting many hilly areas. Development of these hilly lands not only increase the rate of erosion but also put the inhabitants vulnerable to the risk of landslide, adding factors of insecurity to the already underprivileged community. Although these settlements are illegal, the government does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> nor power to form urban plans, strategies to stop people from migrating, or to regulate the migrants' behavior.|$|E
25|$|Phil is told by Ian that Ben {{has died}} after a {{homophobic}} attack following a night out, however this {{turns out to}} be Paul, Ben's boyfriend. Ben struggles to grieve for Paul's death and asks Phil for a gun to take revenge, but he refuses and Ben disappears. When Grant returns to Walford again, he accuses Phil of killing Peggy and still orders him to return all of the money Phil owes to him. After going through Sharon's bag, Phil learns that Grant has a son, Mark Fowler (Ned Porteous), with Sharon's best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully/Jenna Russell) following a one-night stand 21 years previously. After agreeing to drop the truth, Phil denies speaking to Mark. Unbeknownst to Phil, Denise discovers she is five months pregnant by him {{as a result of a}} one-night stand they had. Ben and Jay are kidnapped by Paul's killers and he attempts to go after them, however when he collapses Grant offers to help him get Ben and Jay back. In gratitude for Grant rescuing Ben, Phil tells Grant that Mark is his son. Grant persuades Phil to attend Paul's funeral for Ben's sake, which he does. Phil lends Grant money to support him financially and Grant tells him to fight his liver condition. Later, Ben tells Phil that he will donate part of his liver. Phil advises against it but Ben is adamant, however, Ben's psychiatric test results mean that it is unlikely he will be able to. Phil is hospitalised again with an infection and Sharon discovers that Phil has changed his will to leave everything to Louise so she forces him to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> amended to include her. When Jay returns, Sharon allows him back into the Mitchell household, and when Phil is discharged and returns home, he eventually allows Jay to live there. When Phil has been sober for six months, he refuses to have the transplant, devastating his family, though Sharon supports his decision. However, after one of Dennis's friends at school is stabbed and dies, Dennis is visibly upset, and therefore Phil decides to go on the transplant list after realising he does not want to put his family through the upset of his death. Phil decides he wants to spend Christmas alone and Sharon reluctantly agrees. Phil is taken to hospital when a liver is found and changes his mind about being alone at Christmas, and he does not change his mind after tests show that the liver is not suitable. Jay has a visit from his police public protection officer, who says Jay will have to move out as Louise is underage. Phil refuses to make Jay leave, despite being told that Louise could be taken into care. On Christmas Day 2016, a matching liver is found and Phil at last has the operation.|$|E

500|$|On December 24, Khánh {{issued a}} {{declaration}} of independence from [...] "foreign manipulation", and condemned [...] "colonialism", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said [...] "The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> to exist as an independent state." [...] The newspaper said if the answer was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities.|$|E

If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution.

2500|$|Shortly {{before noon}} on Thursday 11 July, the Chief Constable {{reversed}} his decision {{and allowed the}} Orangemen to march along Garvaghy Road. The residents' group had not been consulted on this and rioting erupted as police in armoured vehicles flooded the Garvaghy area and batoned hundreds of protesters off the Garvaghy Road. About 1,200 Orangemen then marched down the road while residents were hemmed into their estates by riot police. There was outrage among the Catholic/nationalist community, who believed {{that the police had}} [...] "surrendered" [...] to loyalist violence and the threat of violence. An article in the Irish News concluded that [...] "the police did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> to impose the rule of law on the Orange Order and loyalists". The Chief Constable said he believed the situation could no longer be contained. He claimed the crowd at Drumcree was expected to rise to 60,000 or 70,000 that night and would have broken through the defences and attacked the nationalist area. Nationalists argued that the police did nothing to stop the thousands of loyalists from gathering.|$|E

[...] He blamed the poor performance of the 2008 film on {{the fact that it was}} not about aliens.

2500|$|The Indian {{victory would}} not have been {{complete}} without the capture of 'Area Flat Top', an adjacent peak and part of enemy defences on Point 4875. The 13 JAK Rifles had captured Flat top feature of Point 4875 on the afternoon of 5 July after a fierce battle with Pakistani forces. But the enemy launched an immediate counterattack to take back the Area Flat Top they had lost. [...] "Young Captain NA Nagappa was holding Flat Top. He had a small force but he fought ferociously to beat back the offensive. The first counter-attack was beaten back. The Pakistanis too were facing the same problem of climbing, with the Indian Army on top shooting at them. It is not that they did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> to do it but the carpet-firing by our troops did not let them come to the top," [...] a 79 Infantry Brigade officer said. There was a seesaw battle taking place at the Area Flat Top. All of a sudden, a shell hit Area Flat Top, seriously injuring Captain Nagappa who was shooting at the advancing Pakistani soldiers. Splinters pierced through both his legs and he fell unconscious. Taking advantage of this situation, the Pakistanis started climbing faster.|$|E
