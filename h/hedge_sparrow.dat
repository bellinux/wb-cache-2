6000|$|But Harringay had {{the upper}} hand now and meant to keep it. With rapid, bold strokes he {{continued}} to paint over the writhing canvas, until at last it was a uniform field of shining <b>Hedge</b> <b>Sparrow</b> tint. Once the mouth reappeared and {{got as far as}} [...] "Five master--" [...] before he filled it with enamel; and near the end the red eye opened and glared at him indignantly. But at last nothing remained save a gleaming panel of drying enamel. For a little while a faint stirring beneath the surface puckered it slightly here and there, but presently even that died away and the thing was perfectly still.|$|E

50|$|Also {{covered in}} this episode were {{molecular}} genetics, and DNA fingerprinting, which was first developed at Leicester University (where {{his father was}} principal in earlier years). Attenborough included excerpts from his series The Life of Birds, including a piece on <b>hedge</b> <b>sparrows,</b> and also explored Jane Goodall's work with chimpanzees and their use of tools to crack nuts, and their hunting of colobus monkeys in groups. Attenborough showed the books containing {{the whole of the}} decoded human genome.|$|R
50|$|Downton {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the Pipe rolls for 1160 as a 'new place'. The name is first recorded as Dunchinton although more commonly Donketon and Coates states that this is most likely derived from Dunneca's farm or otherwise from *OE dunnocatu-n (farm of <b>hedge</b> <b>sparrows).</b> In 1263 the estate seems to have belonged to Thomas de Orweye although, by 1397, it had expanded to include part of Everton in Milford. After c. 1500 the manor {{became part of the}} extensive possessions of the Milles family of Southampton, builders of Hurst Castle. The manor was purchased at end of the 18th century by Sir William Cornwallis (with adjoining manors in Milford) whose heir, Anne Whitby was the grandmother of Col. William Cornwallis-West. His son George Cornwallis-West went bankrupt around 1920 and the estate was sold. The western part, owned by the Ashley Clinton family, was sold a few years later although the planned large scale development was prevented.|$|R
50|$|The {{trail is}} {{a haven for}} various {{wildlife}}, and forms a green lung linking Ferry Bridge with the RSPB Radipole Lake wildlife reserve. The route often features many species of birds, including Kingfishers, Redwings and Great Crested Grebes. A range of insects, rodents, mammals such as foxes and badgers, as well as lizards and frogs can also be seen. Plantlife includes Foxgloves, Bluebells and Meadow Buttercups. Abbotsbury Road often has <b>Hedge</b> <b>Sparrows</b> and Blackbirds in the hedges, along with Garden Spiders and Great Green Bush Crickets. Serotine Bats and Pipistrelle Bats have also been seen around this area. To the south of Wyke Tunnel, the damp environment has spawned Pendulous Sedge and Heart's Tongue Ferns. Common frogs and Blackcaps are found within this area, as well as foxes and badgers. The Buxton Road Bridge region often has many species of butterfly during the summer, including Red Admiral, Comma and Holly Blue. Mice may also be spotted within the area. Between Sandsfoot and Wyke Halts, various wildlife from Common Lizards to the Common Blue Butterfly are often found. Amongst the reeds are Wasp Spiders and the rare Bithyinian Vetch and Little Robin plants. At the Sandsfoot Castle Gardens, the vantage spot over Portland Harbour is popular for seeing overwintering birds such as the Great Northern Diver, Slavonian Grebes and Merganzers.|$|R
6000|$|Masters, I sleep not {{quiet in}} my grave, [...] There where they laid me, by the Avon [...] shore, [...] In that some crazy wights have set it forth [...] By {{arguments}} most false and fanciful, [...] Analogy and far-drawn inference, [...] That Francis Bacon, Earl of Verulam [...] (A man whom I remember in old days, [...] A learned judge with sly adhesive palms, [...] To which the suitor's gold was wont to [...] stick) &mdash; [...] That this same Verulam had writ the plays [...] Which were the fancies of my frolic brain. [...] What can they urge to dispossess the crown [102] Which all my comrades {{and the whole}} loud [...] world [...] Did in my lifetime lay upon my brow? [...] Look straitly at these arguments and see [...] How witless and how fondly slight they be. [...] Imprimis, they have urged that, being [...] born [...] In the mean compass of a paltry town, [...] I could not in my youth have trimmed [...] my mind [...] To such an eagle pitch, but must be found, [...] Like the <b>hedge</b> <b>sparrow,</b> somewhere near [...] the ground. [...] Bethink you, sirs, that though I was [...] denied [...] The learning which in colleges is found, [...] Yet may a hungry brain still find its fo [...] Wherever books may lie or men may be; [103] And though perchance by Isis or by Cam [...] The meditative, philosophic plant [...] May best luxuriate; yet some would say [...] That in the task of limning mortal life [...] A fitter preparation might be made [...] Beside the banks of Thames. [...] And then [...] again, [...] If I be suspect, in that I was not [...] A fellow of a college, how, I pray, [...] Will Jonson pass, or Marlowe, or the rest, [...] Whose measured verse treads with as [...] proud a gait [...] As that which was my own? Whence did [...] they suck [...] This honey that they stored? [...] Can you [...] recite [...] The vantages which each of these has had [...] And I had not? [...] Or is the argument [104] That my Lord Verulam hath written all, [...] And covers in his wide-embracing self [...] The stolen fame of twenty smaller men? [...] You prate about my learning. [...] I [...] would urge [...] My want of learning rather as a proof [...] That I am still myself. [...] Have I not traced [...] A seaboard to Bohemia, and made [...] The cannons roar a whole wide century [...] Before the first was forged? [...] Think you, [...] then, [...] That he, the ever-learned Verulam, [...] Would have erred thus? [...] So may my very [...] faults [...] In their gross falseness prove that I am true, [...] And by that falseness gender truth in you. [...] And what is left? [...] They say that they [...] have found [105] A script, wherein the writer tells my Lord [...] He is a secret poet. [...] True enough! [...] But surely now that secret is o'er past. [...] Have you not read his poems? [...] Know [...] you not [...] That in our day a learned chancellor [...] Might better far dispense unjustest law [...] Than be suspect of such frivolity [...] As lies in verse? [...] Therefore his poetry [...] Was secret. [...] Now that he is gone [...] 'Tis so no longer. [...] You may read his verse, [...] And judge if mine be better or be worse: [...] Read and pronounce! [...] The meed of [...] praise is thine; [...] But still let his be his and mine be mine. [...] I say no more; {{but how can you}} for- [...] swear [...] Outspoken Jonson, he who knew me well; [106] So, too, the epitaph which still you read? [...] Think you they faced my sepulchre with [...] lies &mdash; [...] Gross lies, so evident and palpable [...] That every townsman must have wot of it, [...] And not a worshipper within the church [...] But must have smiled to see the marbled [...] fraud? [...] Surely this touches you? [...] But if by chance [...] My reasoning still leaves you obdurate, [...] I'll lay one final plea. [...] I pray you look [...] On my presentment, as it reaches you. [...] My features shall be sponsors for my fame; [...] My brow shall speak when Shakespeare's [...] voice is dumb, [...] And be his warrant in an age to come.|$|E

50|$|The dunnock (Prunella modularis) {{is a small}} passerine, or {{perching}} bird, {{found throughout}} temperate Europe and into Asia. Dunnocks have also been successfully introduced into New Zealand. It {{is by far the}} most widespread member of the accentor family, which otherwise consists of mountain species. Other common names of the dunnock include the hedge accentor, <b>hedge</b> <b>sparrow,</b> or hedge warbler.|$|E
5000|$|Despite some {{resemblance}} {{such as the}} seed-eater's {{bill and}} frequently well-marked heads, American sparrows, or New World sparrows, {{are members of a}} different family, Emberizidae, which also includes the buntings. The <b>hedge</b> <b>sparrow</b> or dunnock (Prunella modularis) is similarly unrelated. It is a sparrow in name only, a relict of the old practice of calling more types of small birds [...] "sparrows". A few further bird species are also called sparrows, such as the Java sparrow, an estrildid finch.|$|E
50|$|Highfield is a {{hamlet of}} around twenty-five {{households}} {{at a crossroads}} on the old Beith to Dalry A737 turnpike, {{about half a mile}} from Dalry. A pub was once located here known as the Highfield Inn with a shop attached. A part of the settlement on the B777 road to Kilwinning is known as the 'Creepies' or 'Little Acre.' Creepie is a Scots work for the <b>hedge</b> <b>sparrow.</b> The village had some miner's cottages at the 'Creepies', long since demolished.|$|E
