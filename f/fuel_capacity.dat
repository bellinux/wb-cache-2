5|$|One Filton-built company prototype, {{used the}} same wing and <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Model 100; first flew: 31 July 1956.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{internal}} <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> was low limiting the useful {{range of the}} aircraft, extra capacity was provided on later versions by lengthening the forward fuselage.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The UB II {{boats were}} ordered from three {{manufacturers}} in groups that numbered {{between two and}} twelve. Each group had slight variations in design, resulting in differences in displacements, lengths, speeds, <b>fuel</b> <b>capacities,</b> and operational ranges.|$|R
40|$|The problem {{discussed}} in {{this paper is to}} determine the range of a fleet of n aircraft with <b>fuel</b> <b>capacities</b> g gallons and fuel efficiencies ri gallons per mile (i= 1, [...] ., n). It is assumed that the aircraft may share fuel in flight and that any of the aircraft may be abandoned at any stage. The range is defined to be the greatest distance which can be attained in this way. Initially the fleet is supposed to have g gallons of fuel. A theoretical solution is obtained by the method which Richard Bellman [1] calls dynamic programming. Explicit solutions are obtained in the case of two aircraft with different <b>fuel</b> <b>capacities</b> and <b>fuel</b> efficiencies {{and in the case of}} any number of aircraft with identical <b>fuel</b> <b>capacities</b> and identical <b>fuel</b> efficiencies. The problem is similar to the so-called jeep problem. The jeep problem was solved rigorously by N. J. Fine [2]. A solution was also obtained by O. Helmer [3, 4]. Fine cited an unpublished solution by L. Alaoglu. The problem was generalized by C. G. Phipps [5]. Phipps informally developed the special result which is deduced in [section] 4 of this paper...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fuel</b> tank <b>capacity</b> is 225 litres.|$|R
5|$|The primary {{changes of}} the -200 over the -100 are wingtip fences and {{increased}} <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> for increased range. Indian Airlines used its first 31 A320-200s with double-bogie main landing gear for airfields with poor runway condition which a single-bogie main gear could not manage.|$|E
5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity,</b> and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|CV-22B : U.S. Air Force variant for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It conducts {{long-range}} {{special operations}} missions, and {{is equipped with}} extra wing fuel tanks, an AN/APQ-186 terrain-following radar, and other equipment such as the AN/ALQ-211, and AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis Directional Infrared Counter Measures. The <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> is increased by 588 gallons (2,230 L) with two inboard wing tanks; three auxiliary tanks (200 or 430 gal) can also be added in the cabin. The CV-22 replaced the MH-53 Pave Low.|$|E

5|$|Gripen NG: {{improved}} version following on {{from the}} Gripen Demo technology demonstrator. Changes from the JAS 39C/D include the more powerful F414G engine, Raven ES-05 AESA radar, increased <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> and payload, two additional hardpoints, and other improvements. These improvements have reportedly increased the Gripen NG costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and increased the flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).|$|E
5|$|Seeking to {{capitalize}} on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, {{in its first year}} of service. Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order for the type in December 1982. Featuring increased gross weight and greater <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity,</b> the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with El Al Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.|$|E
5|$|The B-52C's <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> (and range) was {{increased}} to 41,700USgallons by adding larger 3000USgallon underwing fuel tanks. The gross weight {{was increased}} by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model. The {{belly of the}} aircraft was painted with antiflash white paint, which was intended to reflect thermal radiation away after a nuclear detonation.|$|E
50|$|The McLaren F1 LM has a <b>fuel</b> tank <b>capacity</b> of 90 L.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, <b>fuel</b> tank <b>capacity</b> {{was reduced}} {{slightly}} from 24 litres to 22 L ...|$|R
5000|$|Downes made 29.14 kn on trials at [...] Normal <b>fuel</b> oil <b>capacity</b> was 312 tons.|$|R
5|$|The XF4H-1 was {{designed}} to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45° and was equipped with blown flaps for better low-speed handling.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> of the Ju 87D {{was raised}} to 800L (of which 780L were usable) by adding additional wing tanks while retaining the option to carry two 300L drop tanks. Tests at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield revealed it made possible a flight duration of 2 hours and 15 minutes. With an extra two 300L (80US gal) fuel tanks, it could achieve four hours flight time.|$|E
5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds, a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high lift-to-drag ratio. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E

50|$|The M1 and M1A1 were {{portable}} flamethrowers {{developed by}} the United States of America during World War II. The M1 weighed 72 lb, had a range of 15 meters, and had a <b>fuel</b> tank <b>capacity</b> of five gallons. The improved M1A1 weighed less, at 65 lb, had a much longer range of 45 meters, had the same <b>fuel</b> tank <b>capacity,</b> and fired thickened fuel (napalm).|$|R
5000|$|The {{lifeboats}} have maximum {{speeds of}} 25 kn and cruising speeds of 22 kn. Cape-class lifeboats have <b>fuel</b> <b>capacities</b> of 400 gal and ranges of [...] when cruising. They {{are capable of}} operating at wind speeds of 50 kn and wave heights of 30 ft. They can tow ships with displacements of up to 150 t and can withstand 60 kn winds and 20 ft-high breaking waves.|$|R
5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is more than}} double, {{allowing}} it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Development {{flying and}} route proving with the Comet 3 allowed {{accelerated}} certification {{of what was}} destined to be the most successful variant of the type, the Comet 4. All airline customers for the Comet 3 subsequently cancelled their orders and switched to the Comet 4, which was based on the Comet 3 but with improved <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity.</b> BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (outboard wing) fuel tanks of the Comet 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the Comet.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Tank {{constructed}} a fourth prototype (No. 04) and, {{in an attempt}} to resolve the design's deep stall problems at high angles of attack, added stall fences on each wing and four strakes on the rear fuselage. Other refinements included a pressurized cockpit, additional <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> and it was also the first prototype to be fitted with the definitive four 20mm Hispano Mark V cannon armament. Lt. Jorge Doyle piloted the fourth IAe 33 on its maiden flight on 20 August 1953 and, along with Lt. Gonzalez and Lt. Balado, began armament testing in 1954.|$|E

It can tow ships with displacements of up to 150 t and can withstand 60 kn winds and 20 ft-high breaking waves.|$|R
5|$|The Comet 4 was {{a further}} {{improvement}} on the stretched Comet 3 with even greater <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity.</b> The design had progressed {{significantly from the}} original Comet 1, growing by 18ft 6in (5.64m) and typically seating 74 to 81 passengers compared to the Comet 1's 36 to 44 (119 passengers could be accommodated in a special charter seating package in the later 4C series). The Comet 4 was considered the definitive series, having a longer range, higher cruising speed and higher maximum takeoff weight. These improvements were possible largely because of Avon engines with twice {{the thrust of the}} Comet 1's Ghosts. Deliveries to BOAC began on 30 September 1958 with two 48-seat aircraft, which were used to initiate the first scheduled transatlantic services.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity</b> restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an {{interceptor}} {{variant of}} the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, {{but it was not}} intended as a dog-fighter, instead it was a long-endurance interceptor to counter the threat from Cold War bombers. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater <b>fuel</b> <b>capacity,</b> the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is proven}} that CAFS attacks all three {{sides of the}} fire {{triangle}} simultaneously. The foam blankets the fuel, thereby reducing the <b>fuel’s</b> <b>capacity</b> to seek out a source of oxygen. The CAFS solution adheres to ceilings and walls, more readily aiding in rapid reduction in heat. Also, the opaque surfaces of the foam, as it adheres to walls and ceilings, shield the fuel source from radiant energy. (Brooks, 2005; Brooks, 2006) ...|$|R
