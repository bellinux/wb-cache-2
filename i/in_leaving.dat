5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills.

In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{partitioning}} <b>in</b> the <b>leaves</b> of Cucumis sativus L., a stachyose translocating plant, {{was influenced}} by {{the presence or absence of}} a single growing fruit on the plant. Fruit growth was very rapid with rates of fresh weight gain as high as 3. 3 grams per hour. Fruit growth was highly competitive with vegetative growth as indicated by lower fresh weights of leaf blades, petioles, stem internodes and root systems on plants bearing a single growing fruit compared to plants not bearing a fruit. Carbon exchange rates, starch accumulation rates and carbon export rates were higher <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> of plants bearing a fruit. Dry weight loss from leaves was higher at night from fruiting plants, and morning starch levels were consistently lower <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> of fruiting than <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> of vegetative plants indicating rapid starch mobilization at night from the leaves of fruiting plants. Galactinol, the galactosyl donor for stachyose biosynthesis, was present <b>in</b> the <b>leaves</b> of fruit-bearing plants at consistently lower concentration than <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> of vegetative plants. Galactinol synthase, and sucrose phosphate synthase activities were not different on a per gram fresh weight basis <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> from the two plant types; however, stachyose synthase activity was twice as high <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> from fruiting plants. Thus, the lower galactinol pools may be associated with an activation of the terminal step in stachyose biosynthesis <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>in</b> response to the high sink demand of a growing cucumber fruit...|$|R

5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years in Calgary, Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL. However, by 1999, attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum: buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City <b>in</b> <b>leaving</b> for the United States. The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999–2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful.

40|$|The {{coordinate}} {{appearance of}} the bispecific NAD(P) H-nitrate reductase (NR; EC 1. 6. 6. 2) and nitrite reductase (NiR; EC 1. 7. 7. 1) was investigated <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> and roots from European white birch seedlings (Betula pendula Roth). Induction by nitrate and light of both enzymes was analyzed by in vitro assays and by measuring NR- and NiR-encoding mRNA pools with homologous cDNAs as probes. When birch seedlings were grown on a medium containing ammonium as the sole nitrogen source, low constitutive expression of NR and NiR was observed <b>in</b> <b>leaves,</b> whereas only NiR was significantly expressed in roots. Upon transfer of the seedlings to a nitrate-containing medium, mRNA pools and activities of NR and NiR dramatically increased <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> and roots, with a more rapid induction <b>in</b> <b>leaves.</b> Peak accumulations of mRNA pools preceded the maximum activities of NR and NiR, suggesting that the appearance of both activities can be mainly attributed to an increased expression of NR and NiR genes. Expression of NR was strictly light-dependent <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> and roots and was repressed by ammonium in roots but not <b>in</b> <b>leaves.</b> <b>In</b> contrast with NR, constitutive expression of NiR was not affected by light, and even a slight induction following the addition of nitrate {{was found in the}} dark in roots but not <b>in</b> <b>leaves.</b> No effect of ammonium on NiR expression was detectable in both organs. <b>In</b> <b>leaves</b> as well as in roots, NiR was induced more rapidly than NR, which appears to be a safety measure to prevent nitrite accumulation...|$|R

England managed to recover somewhat after Laker and Bedser added 89 runs in only 73 minutes for the ninth wicket. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership, and it was surmised {{that he may have}} been happy for England to continue batting so that his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable.|$|E

5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested <b>in</b> <b>leaving</b> the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, the truth was that Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E
40|$|Two soybean [Glycine max (L.)

5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} to Singapore the 8th Division was deployed {{to defend the}} island's north-west coast. Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division's units were at half-strength. The commander of the Singapore fortress, Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival, believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector. The Japanese landing on 8 February {{took part in the}} Australian sector, however, and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting. The division was also unable to turn back the Japanese landing at Kranji and withdrew to the centre of the island. After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore, Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February. Following the surrender 14,972Australians were taken prisoner, though some escaped on ships. These escapees included Major General Bennett, who was found by two post-war inquiries to have been unjustified <b>in</b> <b>leaving</b> his command. The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers, and the failure of the Singapore Strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E

Both men supported Rutherford, though neither was enthusiastic about doing so. In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the Alberta Liberals selected Rutherford as their first leader. A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain, who was a Conservative federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a coalition government, announced that he would stay in Regina to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives.

For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing.

This dependence weakly appeared <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> wrapping the head and was absent inside the head, where often the calcium concentration was higher in the midrib part of leaf than in the margin part. Distinct differences in the calcium content <b>in</b> <b>leaves</b> of four culti vars of F 1, Chinese cabbage: ´Bilko', ´Parkin', 'Kasumi' and 'Yamiko' were not found. These cultivars differed clearly in the susceptibility to the tipburn incidence which appearance depended also on the temperature stress...|$|R
