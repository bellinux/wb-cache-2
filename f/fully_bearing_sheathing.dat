30|$|Conventional PT gap opening systems utilize flat <b>bearing</b> ends. <b>Fully</b> <b>bearing</b> gap-opening devices tend {{to expand}} the frame beyond its {{original}} span length (Garlock et al. 2007); Dowden and Bruneau 2011). The uncontrolled span expansion induces drift concentration, additional column moments and tends to damage floor level diaphragms. In order to alleviate these effects, a truncated {{version of the same}} LB (Fig.  2 a, c) has been introduced. The proposed LB consists of a pin ended, steel wide flange beam that contains the PT cables. In order to avoid contact between the column and the truncated ends of the LB, the width of the initial gap should be larger than ϕ̅d/ 2.|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study was}} performed with a nonlinear elastic {{finite element model}} for monotonic analyses of wood-framed shear walls. The objective was {{to provide information about}} simplifying a model of wood-framed shear walls with no significant loss in accuracy. The simplifications concern features such as slips in joints between frame members, slips in hold-down connections, and <b>bearing</b> between adjacent <b>sheathing</b> panels. The results from analyses of a shear wall with an opening of window shape show that the effect of constraint by the <b>bearing</b> between <b>sheathing</b> panels and slips in frame joints on the overall stiffness of the wall is limited. Thus, there are great possibilities for reducing the calculation time by not taking these phenomena into account, avoiding an excessive number of degrees of freedom and iterations. The influence of the simplifications on the distribution of vertical reaction forces along the wall is more significant. Furthermore, if each simplification is introduced separately, the effect on the overall stiffness is greater. The difference, however, is less than 10 %. The failing pattern of the nail connections is also clearly influenced by the simplifications when they are introduced separately. The results from the analyses show that slips in frame joints can be sufficiently represented by those in connection with the opening...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the stability criteria of an inline axialpiston pump with an eccentric control system. The hydrostatic/hydrodynamic bearings of the swash plate was inspected with model building and simulation as method. The general approach has been to regard the swash plate as stiff, leading to the hydrostatic friction between the swash plate and the pump house to be considered more or less constant. Recent research treat the swash plate as bendable which could lead to the swash plate bearings’ friction being replaced from mixed friction to a full contact interaction between the swash plate and the pump house, with an increased friction as result. This increase in friction is theorized to increase the stability ofthe pump by limiting the movement of the swash plate in comparison to the <b>fully</b> lubricated <b>bearing.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|More {{than one}} million joint {{replacements}} are performed in the USA annually. However, around 10 % of patients require revision surgery within 10 years with prosthetic joint infections (PJI) as a common reason. PJI has a recurrence rate of 16 %, a mortality rate of 2. 5 %, and end-stage treatments involving arthrodesis and amputation. Most drug eluting polymers that were in development {{to address this problem}} failed due to toxic degradation products, insufficient drug release, and insufficient mechanical strength. The gold standard of treatment uses antibiotic eluting bone cement which has a mechanical failure rate of 26 - 60 % within 49 - 54 months if used under load bearing conditions. Therefore, despite advances in orthopedic materials, development of drug-eluting devices with effective, sustained delivery with the necessary mechanical strength for a <b>fully</b> load <b>bearing</b> joint implant has been elusive. Here, we report the synthesis and application of a drug eluting, <b>fully</b> load <b>bearing,</b> and articulating joint prosthesis that has superior mechanical strength and drug elution profile compared to the clinical gold standard, antibiotic eluting bone cement. We modified the eccentricity of drug clusters and percolation threshold in the polymeric matrix of Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE), which resulted in maximized drug elution and mechanical strength retention. The optimized antibiotic eluting UHMWPE elutes antibiotic at a higher concentration {{for a longer period of}} time than antibiotic eluting bone cement while retaining the mechanical and wear properties of clinically used UHMWPE joint prosthesis. After drug elution, the empty drug clusters in the polymer were filled with biological lubricants during articulation, which through a combination of weeping and elastohydrodynamic lubrication, reduced the overall wear rate of the UHMWPE. Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infected lapine knee with the antibiotic eluting UHMWPE showed complete bacterial eradication without any detectable systemic side effect. Taken together, our study showed that the drug-eluting UHMWPE joint implants in this study are promising candidates for further clinical trial and as the next generation prosthetic joints. by Vincentius Jeremy Suhardi.

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the impact of}} tumor progression on the reversibility of Neu-induced tumorigenesis, we have used the tetracycline regulatory system to conditionally express activated Neu in the mammary epithelium of transgenic mice. When induced with doxycycline, bitransgenic MMTV-rtTA/TetO-NeuNT mice develop multiple invasive mammary carcinomas, essentially all of which regress to a clinically undetectable state following transgene deinduction. This demonstrates that Neu-initiated tumorigenesis is reversible. Strikingly, extensive lung metastases arising from Neu-induced mammary tumors also rapidly and fully regress following the abrogation of Neu expression. However, despite the near universal dependence of both primary tumors and metastases on Neu transgene expression, most animals <b>bearing</b> <b>fully</b> regressed Neu-induced tumors ultimately develop recurrent tumors that have progressed to a Neu-independent state...|$|R
