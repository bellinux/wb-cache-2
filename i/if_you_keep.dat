A lot of people don’t seem to understand that we can’t keep producing records <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E

500|$|Chinese {{politicians}} {{within the}} government raised issues with the Constitution in late 2005. Lim Keng Yaik of Gerakan asked for a re-examination of the social contract to ascertain whether Bangsa Malaysia could be achieved. Lim was severely criticised by many prominent Malay politicians, including Khairy Jamaluddin and Ahmad Shabery Cheek. The Malay press, mostly owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim responded: [...] "How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the 'Negaraku' (national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable aspect of Johnson's game was his {{blocking}} abilities, for which he received heavy praise. He took pride in it, saying [...] "It {{gave me a chance}} to hit all those people who hit me all the time." [...] Quarterback Bobby Layne, a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers, listed Johnson as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. [...] "By 'mean,' I mean vicious, unmanageable, consistently tough," [...] said Layne. [...] "I don't mean dirty." [...] Layne also called Johnson his [...] "bodyguard," [...] saying [...] "Half the good runners will get a passer killed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> them around long enough. But a quarterback hits the jackpot when he gets a combination runner-blocker like Johnson." ...|$|E
500|$|His son, Peter O'Malley, {{described}} his management style as follows: [...] "As president, {{the way he}} ran the business, he believed in stability and very little turnover. It was {{the strength of the}} organization. The management team worked as well as the team on the field." [...] This is evidenced in many ways, including the long tenure of both Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda as Dodgers managers and Vin Scully, the broadcast voice of the Dodgers. Alston was repeatedly rehired to consecutive one-year contracts from 1954–1976 until he retired. Then Lasorda, who had been a long-time employee in as a coach and minor league baseball manager, took over as manager for another 20 years. Scully has been the voice of the Dodgers since the O'Malley family acquired the team. In addition, the infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell and third baseman Ron Cey was the longest-running intact infield in major league history. Furthermore, O'Malley is said to have kept Bowie Kuhn in office as the Commissioner of Baseball until O'Malley's death. [...] O'Malley rewarded loyal employee Bavasi by allowing the San Diego Padres franchise to establish an expansion team with Bavasi as President in Southern California. Alston said O'Malley convinced him that when he signed his first one-year contract it could be a lifetime job by pointing out that [...] "signing one-year contracts can mean a lifetime job, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> signing enough of them." [...] Although O'Malley had good stories of loyalty with some employees, there were several stories of O'Malley's frugality.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Ammi expounded on the words, [...] "For it is a {{pleasant}} thing <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> them [...] within you; {{let them be}} established altogether upon your lips," [...] in [...] He explained that {{the words of the}} Torah are [...] "pleasant" [...] when one keeps them within oneself, and one does that when the words are [...] "established altogether upon your lips."
