40|$|Conference PaperTime-frequency {{representations}} (<b>TFRs)</b> provide <b>a</b> {{powerful and}} flexible structure for designing optimal detectors {{in a variety}} of nonstationary scenarios. In this paper, we describe a TFR-based framework for optimal detection of arbitrary second-order stochastic signals, with certain unknown or random nuisance parameters, in the presence of Gaussian noise. The framework provides a useful model for many important applications including machine fault diagnostics and radar/sonar. We emphasize a subspace-based formulation of <b>such</b> <b>TFR</b> detectors which can be exploited {{in a variety of}} ways to design new techniques. In particular, we explore an extension based on multi-channel/sensor measurements that are often available in practice to facilitate improved signal processing. In addition to potentially improved performance, the subspace-based interpretation of such multi-channel detectors provides useful information about the physical mechanisms underlying the signals of interest...|$|R

Since 9/11, TFRs have been routinely used to restrict airspace for 30 nautical miles around the President, with a 10 nmi km radius no-fly zone for non-scheduled flights. They are also available to other important people such as presidential and vice-presidential candidates (though not all do so, as Senator John Kerry, who did not ask for any TFR during the 2004 election).|$|R

40|$|Transferrin {{receptor}} (<b>TfR)</b> is <b>a</b> dimeric cell surface {{protein that}} binds both the serum iron transport protein transferrin (Fe-Tf) and HFE, the protein mutated {{in patients with}} the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE and Fe-Tf can bind simultaneously to <b>TfR</b> to form <b>a</b> ternary complex, but HFE binding to TfR lowers the apparent affinity of the Fe-Tf/TfR interaction. This apparent affinity reduction could result from direct competition between HFE and Fe-Tf for their overlapping binding sites on each TfR polypeptide chain, from negative cooperativity, or {{from a combination of}} both. To explore the mechanism of the affinity reduction, we constructed <b>a</b> heterodimeric <b>TfR</b> that contains mutations <b>such</b> that one <b>TfR</b> chain binds only HFE and the other binds only Fe-Tf. Binding studies using a heterodimeric form of soluble TfR demonstrate that TfR does not exhibit cooperativity in heterotropic ligand binding, suggesting that {{some or all of the}} effects of HFE on iron homeostasis result from competition with Fe-Tf for TfR binding. Experiments using transfected cell lines demonstrate a physiological role for this competition in altering HFE trafficking patterns...|$|R

For this purpose, we present a new approach that integrates traditional measures of fertility, <b>such</b> as the <b>TFR,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> versatile manner with (a) the tempo adjustment of fertility that corrects for distortions due to the rapid postponement of fertility, (b) life-table measures of fertility that eliminate influences caused by the parity composition of the population, and (c) methods for cohort completion and projection that provide a consistent and demographically correct mapping of recent period fertility patterns on the future childbearing behaviour of women still in their childbearing years. ...|$|R

However, <b>a</b> limit of <b>such</b> <b>TFRs</b> is they produce, in some cases, representations that are meaningless or difficult to explain and to analyze.

The two TFRs are applied to analyze echo signals of cylindrical tube. Resulting TFRs are {{compared to that of}} Wigner-Ville distribution.

40|$|HFE {{is related}} to major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) class I proteins and is mutated in the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis. HFE binds to the transferrin receptor (<b>TfR),</b> <b>a</b> receptor by which cells acquire iron-loaded transferrin.

On <b>a</b> cell membrane containing both proteins, HFE would 'lie down' parallel to the membrane, such that the HFE helices that delineate the counterpart of the MHC peptide-binding groove make extensive contacts with helices in the TfR dimerization domain. The structures of TfR alone and complexed with HFE differ in their domain arrangement and dimer interfaces, providing a mechanism for communicating binding events between TfR chains. The HFE‚ÄìTfR complex suggests a binding site for transferrin on TfR and sheds light upon the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes that}} whether period {{indicators}} are biased by timing effects {{depends on the}} objective of measurement. Several kinds of bias in the TFR are identified. Five reasons for measuring period fertility are distinguished: to explain fertility time trends, to anticipate future prospects, to describe trends, to provide input parameters for formal models, and to communicate with non-specialist audiences. Genuine timing effects are not biasing where period fertility is the explanandum, but are distorting where {{the aim is to}} estimate cohort fertility. Synthetic measures <b>such</b> as the <b>TFR</b> have <b>a</b> number of known defects. Alternatives to the TFR are available, and seem a more defensible solution to current problems than tempo adjustment.

In summary, GA binding to <b>TfR</b> induces <b>a</b> unique signal leading to rapid apoptosis of tumor cells.

40|$|Public {{discussions about}} {{fertility}} trends and policies {{in developed countries}} refer almost exclusively to the period Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which is commonly misinterpreted as the "mean number of children per woman" {{as if it were}} a cohort measure of fertility. We argue that the use of this indicator frequently leads to incorrect interpretations of period fertility levels and trends, resulting in distorted policy conclusions and, potentially, in misguided policies. We illustrate this point with four policy-relevant examples, drawn from contemporary Europe. These illustrations show that the <b>TFR</b> (<b>a)</b> inflates the presumed gap between fertility intentions and realised fertility, (b) erroneously suggests a significant fertility increase in many countries of Europe after the year 2000, (c) often exaggerates the level of immigrants' fertility and (d) frequently suggests that family-related policies which led to shorter birth spacing in fact brought an upward swing in fertility level. We argue that there seems to be no policy-relevant question for which the period TFR would be the indicator of choice to be preferred over other existing measures, which range from measures related to future cohort size (total number of births) to sophisticated fertility indexes controlling for age, parity, duration since previous birth and tempo effect. Hence, there is a strong case for stopping the use of the period <b>TFR</b> as <b>a</b> one-fits-all fertility indicator which is now common practice...|$|R
