The approach is based on a combined interpretation of interferometric phase pattern and interferometric coherence images to extract the extent and stability of landfast ice. Due to the low complexity of the base imagery used for landfast ice extraction, significant improvements in automation and reduction of required manual interactions by operators can be achieved.

Change detection {{is important for}} a variety of applications like updating maps (several years following the creation of the base map), emergency assessment following a natural catastrophe, and site monitoring. The first two cases often rely on existing geospatial information (i. e. maps) in the area of interest and involves data from different sources. Site monitoring on the other hand includes the observation of ongoing changes. Time series using an active sensor with a short revisit rate are optimal for this task. The highresolution of TerraSAR-X and its short repeat cycle of eleven days allow reliable time series acquisitions. ACD (Amplitude Change <b>Detection),</b> an <b>incoherent</b> method, compares the backscatter of two images acquired using the same imaging parameters. It is sensitive to significant changes, i. e. changes that strongly influence the backscatter of an area. CCD (Coherence Change Detection) exploits the coherence of two SAR images acquired at different times using the same imaging parameters. They can be used to detect subtle changes occurring between the two observation dates that would remain undetected by <b>incoherent</b> change <b>detection</b> techniques.

They {{are also used}} in opto- or electromechanical experiments {{with the goal of}} quantum control and phenomena of mechanical systems. Here, we report the realization and operation of a hybrid monolithically integrated transducer system consisting of a high-Q nanomechanical oscillator with modes in the MHz regime coupled to the near-field of a high-Q optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonator. The transducer system enables a sensitive resolution of the nanomechanical beam's thermal motion with a signal-to-noise of five orders of magnitude and has a force sensitivity of 74 aN Hz^- 1 / 2 at room temperature. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the sensitivity of continuous <b>incoherent</b> force <b>detection</b> improves only with the fourth root of the averaging time. Using dissipative feedback based on radiation pressure enabled control, we explicitly demonstrate by detecting a weak incoherent force that this constraint can be significantly relaxed. We achieve a more than 30 -fold reduction in averaging time with our hybrid transducer and are able to detect an incoherent force having a force spectral density as small as 15 aN Hz^- 1 / 2 within 35 s of averaging. This corresponds to a signal which is 25 times smaller than the thermal noise and would otherwise remain out of reach. The reported monolithic platform is an enabling step towards hybrid nanomechanical transducers relying on the light-mechanics interface. Comment: 12 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of {{faster and more}} sensitive detectors {{has been a major}} reason for the opening up of the THz spectral region. If only the amplitude of a THz wave is detected it is an incoherent or direct detector. When both the amplitude and phase are detected the detector is a coherent one. Coherent detection is not a direct process. In a heterodyne receiver, which is the most common coherent detector, detection is in two stages, with the incoming signal being 'mixed' with another signal, and it is the combination of both which is detected. In this lecture an overview will be presented about those incoherent and coherent detectors, which are used in many laboratories as weil as in space missions and other applications. The physics of the detection mechanism and major applications as weil as potential improvements will be presented.

40|$|International audienceThe {{automatic}} detection of temporal changes in sonar images is of high interest for monitoring critical areas as ports or channels used by submarines for instance. This problem is addressed here as <b>incoherent</b> change <b>detection</b> between two sonar passes. To {{be able to}} compare two surveys, sonar images have first to be registered to each other. A mean shift between the master image and the slave image has been estimated here at a coarse-to-fine image resolution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence {{between the first and}} the second sets of amplitude distributions related to homogeneous areas of the master image. Then two different methods have been proposed to detect changes in terms of contacts in the common area of the registered images. The first method is one of the well-known techniques used for synthetic aperture radar imagery: the log ratio of images. The second one is made of two stages: firstly a goodness-of-fit test is applied to every image divided into small overlapped snippets in order to detect statistical deviations due to possible contacts; secondly a pixelwise difference is simply performed between these two images of detected snippets put in a non-zero pixel value. For both methods morphological operations and local correlations have been performed in order to discard false alarms. Advantages and drawbacks of the two proposed methods are discussed with results on a set of data collected by DRDC-Atlantic with a high-frequency sidescan sonar a month apart in the winter of 2008 in a port area...|$|R
40|$|Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a {{technique}} to detect a network of extracted persistent scatterer (PS) points which feature temporal phase stability and strong radar signal throughout time-series of SAR images. The small surface deformations on such PS points are estimated. PSI particularly works well in monitoring human settlements because regular substructures of man-made objects give rise to large number of PS points. If such structures and/or substructures substantially alter or even vanish due to big change like construction, their PS points are discarded without additional explorations during standard PSI procedure. Such rejected points are called big change (BC) points. On the other hand, <b>incoherent</b> change <b>detection</b> (ICD) relies on local comparison of multi-temporal images (e. g. image difference, image ratio) to highlight scene modifications of larger size rather than detail level. However, image noise inevitably degrades ICD accuracy. We propose a change detection approach based on PSI to synergize benefits of PSI and ICD. PS points are extracted by PSI procedure. A local change index is introduced to quantify probability of a big change for each point. We propose an automatic thresholding method adopting change index to extract BC points along with a clue of the period they emerge. In the end, PS ad BC points are integrated into a change detection image. Our method is tested at a site located around north of Berlin main station where steady, demolished, and erected building substructures are successfully detected.
