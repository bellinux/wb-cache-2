6000|$|... "Gone {{home and}} told Mrs. Jennett." [...] Dick grinned at the thought; then, softening, [...] "Please don'tworry about it. Besides, we are wasting time. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> tea. I'll take the {{revolver}} for a bit." ...|$|E

60|$|MISS HOWARD (with {{a meaning}} laugh). Oh, I'd hardly {{say that was}} his main reason. He does look much thinner and very tired, though. I suppose he's been working too hard.

2500|$|Later, of his {{performance}} that series, Payton said [...] "You’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> at Jordan, you can’t {{back down on}} him. If you do, he's like a wolf, he's going to eat everything. He knew I wasn’t going to back down. I had to realize or see if he is really about being a dog, about this neighborhood stuff. I went at him. It was just me being me." ...|$|R

60|$|We have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the great}} purpose of manhood, a passionate unison in {{actively}} making a world. This {{is a real}} commingling of many. And in such a commingling we forfeit the individual. In the commingling of sex we are alone with one partner. It is an individual affair, there is no superior or inferior. But in the commingling of a passionate purpose, each individual sacredly abandons his individual. In the living faith of his soul, he surrenders his individuality to the great urge which is upon him. He may have to surrender his name, his fame, his fortune, his life, everything. But once a man, in the integrity of his own individual soul, believes, he surrenders his own individuality to his belief, and becomes one of a united body. He knows what he does. He makes the surrender honorably, in agreement with his own soul's deepest desire. But he surrenders, and remains responsible for the purity of his surrender.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then there'll be one. You think I'm a fool, {{you think}} I don't know {{anything}} all these literary and society people know. I do know. I {{know that a}} man and a woman have got to stick together, and if you go straying--you may think you're straying after the moon or social work or anything--but there's a strange man waiting round the corner for every woman and a strange woman for every man. Think I've had no temptations?... Oh! I know, I know. What's life or anything but that? and it's just because we've not gone on having more children, just because we listened to all those fools who said you were overdoing it, that all this fretting and grumbling began. We've got on to the wrong track, Elly, and we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> plain wholesome ways of living. See? That's what I've come down here for and what I mean to do. We've got to save ourselves. I've been too--too modern and all that. I'm going to be a husband as a husband should. I'm going to protect you from these idees--protect you from your own self.... And that's about where we stand, Elly, as I make it out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you see," [...] he said, {{with a sort}} {{of desperate}} calmness, [...] "that this girl has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be sent home to-day--not to-night nor to-morrow, but to-day? I can't do {{anything}} for her. You know, I'm the janitor and corresponding secretary of the Down-and-Out Club.

5000|$|Other critics {{accused the}} {{documentary}} of charting an uncomfortable line between storytelling and journalism. Two days after Durst's arrest {{and one day}} after the final installment of The Jinx was aired, The New Yorker reported that [...] "the filmmakers, having been quizzed on the time line of events as represented, have cancelled forthcoming interviews." [...] Specifically, when challenged over whether Durst's arrest for trespassing on Douglas Durst's property occurred before the filmmakers' second interview with Robert Durst, as implied by The Jinx, Andrew Jarecki replied, [...] "Yeah, I think I’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> you with a proper response on that." [...] Several media outlets questioned how long the filmmakers had sat on evidence damaging to Durst before turning it over to law enforcement.|$|E
5000|$|While Baker {{worked on}} the aliens, Spielberg was having second {{thoughts}} about Night Skies. [...] "I might have taken leave of my senses. Throughout production of Raiders, I was in between killing Nazis and blowing up flying wings and having Harrison Ford in all this high serialized adventure, I was {{sitting there in the}} middle of Tunisia, scratching my head and saying, 'I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the tranquillity, or at least the spirituality, of Close Encounters.'" [...] While on the set of Raiders, Spielberg read the Night Skies script to Melissa Mathison (who was there to see her then-boyfriend and future husband Harrison Ford) and she cried after hearing it because [...] "the idea of an alien creature who was benevolent, tender, emotional and sweet... and the idea of the creature's striking up a relationship with a child who came from a broken home was very affecting".|$|E

When she was asked if it was because the song was originally written for Britney Spears, she answered: [...] "Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me.
