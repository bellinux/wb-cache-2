2500|$|Ulysses was {{launched}} October 6, 1990, and reached Jupiter for its [...] "gravitational slingshot" [...] in February 1992. It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 {{and crossed the}} ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10−6 erg/cm2 (1 nJ/m2). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution data, recording it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from {{the sum of the}} 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations). During 'wait' mode, the data were taken either in 0.25 or 0.5 s integrations and 4 energy channels (with shortest <b>integration</b> <b>time</b> being 8 s). Again, the outputs of the 2 detectors were summed.|$|E

50|$|If objects {{within the}} scene are in motion {{relative}} to the imaging system, the resulting motion blur will result in lower spatial resolution.

5000|$|The term [...] "fixed pattern noise" [...] usually {{refers to}} two parameters. One is the DSNU (dark signal non-uniformity), {{which is the}} offset from the average across the imaging array at a {{particular}} setting (temperature, <b>integration</b> <b>time)</b> but no external illumination and the PRNU (photo response non-uniformity), which describes the gain or ratio between optical power on a pixel versus the electrical signal output. The latter is often simplified as a single value measured at e.g. 50% saturation level, implying a linear approximation of the not perfectly linear photo response photo response non-linearity (PRNL). [...] Often PRNU as defined above is subdivided in pure [...] "(offset) FPN" [...] which is the part not dependent on temperature and <b>integration</b> <b>time,</b> and the <b>integration</b> <b>time</b> and temperature dependent [...] "DSNU".Sometimes pixel noise as the average deviation from the array average under different illumination and temperature conditions is specified. Pixel noise therefore gives a number (commonly expressed in rms) that identifies FPN in all permitted imaging conditions, which might strongly deteriorate if additional electrical gain (and noise) is included.|$|E
