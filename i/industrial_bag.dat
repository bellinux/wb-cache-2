50|$|In 1930, {{the son of}} Georges Dupret, Marcel Dupret, {{took over}} the {{management}} of the company, and decided to start with the production of <b>industrial</b> <b>bags</b> and to expand the printing business and cardboard production. In 1934 the demand for playing cards on the Asian market increased, and a new factory was established in Calcutta (India), which would continue its business until the independence of India. In 1960, the company Copa was founded, which became a strong competitor on market for special paper. When the market for special paper decreased, several paper manufacturers from the Turnhout region, Copa, Mesmaekers, Biermans and Van Genechten, founded Turpa. In 1970 Biermans, together with Brepols and Van Genechten, founded Carta Mundi as a joint venture. In 1971, Biermans was acquired by Van Genechten, to create Van Genechten Biermans (VGB).|$|R

50|$|Containerboard, both virgin and recycled, and {{corrugated}} packaging solutions (shelf-ready and heavy-duty packaging, trays and boxes) {{are used}} for diverse industrial applications including the food sector. Mondi converts kraft paper into bags and specialty products for rugged <b>industrial</b> applications. These <b>bags</b> are compatible with high-speed filling and used primarily in the cement and construction industries. Bags and microwaveable packaging are produced of film-based flexible packaging. Special technologies, such as extrusion coatings, laminating, siliconising and printing facilitate some processes.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thiamine {{deficiency}} in humans affects the cardiovascular, muscular, nervous, and gastrointestinal systems. Wernicke's encephalopathy {{is described in}} alcoholism, in hyperemesis gravidarum, and in prolonged IV feeding without vitamin supplementation. METHODS: We report {{a case of a}} 66 -year-old man undergoing surgery for acute necrotic-hemorrhagic pancreatitis, who presented a Wernicke's syndrome during parenteral nutrition (PN). After surgery, he was treated with infusion of <b>industrial</b> 3 -compartment <b>bags,</b> without vitamin supplementation. On the seventh postoperative day, nausea and vomiting began, and 5 days later the patient showed diplopia, ataxia, general muscular stiffness, reduction of osteotendinous reflexes, confusional state, and thrombocytopenia. The magnetic resonance scan evidenced pathologic changes in the medial thalamus, in the third and fourth ventricular floor, in the cerebellar vermis, and in the periaqueductal gray substance. RESULTS: All neurologic signs and platelet blood count gradually normalized after IV supplementation of thiamine, 100 mg daily. The magnetic resonance scan repeated 40 days after the first one was normal. CONCLUSIONS: Our report points out the risk of incorrect procedures in management of <b>industrial</b> 3 -compartment <b>bags.</b> Moreover, we suggest that thrombocytopenia may be related to thiamine deficiency...|$|R
50|$|After copulating {{with his}} victims' corpses, Kearney would usually {{mutilate}} and dismember the remains with a hacksaw before disposing {{of them in}} various locations such as in canyons, in landfills, and along the freeways, usually in <b>industrial</b> trash <b>bags.</b> In some cases, Kearney disposed of the bodies in the desert where the remains could be consumed by carrion-eating animals. Kearney would sometimes drain the victim's blood to eliminate odor and would also sometimes bathe the body parts prior to disposal to minimize the presence of dried blood and eliminate fingerprint evidence. Sometimes, Kearney would beat his victims after they were dead. He perceived beating his dead victims as a cathartic exercise and {{a means by which}} he could effectively vent suppressed anger and animosity, and acquire a sense of power. Often, the victims resembled people who had bullied him in his childhood.|$|R
5000|$|In November, {{the volume}} of Russian paper exports to China {{decreased}} by 30-40%, coupled with a 30% drop in prices. Exports to Western Europe fare marginally better, with an estimated 25-40% drop in production volumes. Russia's largest producer of <b>industrial</b> paper <b>bags,</b> Segezh Paper Mill (controlled by the Bank of Moscow and the City of Moscow), declared a ten-day shutdown on 24 November. [...] UPM-Kymmene Oyj anticipates at least a 30-40% decrease in output compared to 2008. In June 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev visited Silicon Valley in San Jose, California in order to cultivate ideas of how to develop Russia as a major research center. Skolkovo, a mid-sized city near Moscow, is the proposed location for this Russian Silicon Valley, and will have its own tax structure. Yet, Medvedev has been criticized by opposition politicians for deflecting {{attention away from the}} struggling economy and corruption.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the current {{material}} consumption for packaging making in Europe is described. Per packaging type (food bottles, non-food bottles, boxes for primary packaging, flexible packaging, carrier <b>bags,</b> <b>industrial</b> boxes and pallets) options for improved material efficiency are described. The options {{are in the}} field of using thinner materials, using less material by changing the shape of the package, using recycled material and using refillable packages. This paper shows that many option are available to reduce the future material input for packaging and that a reduction of CO 2 emissions by this sector with a factor 2 is possible. A substantial share of this reduction can be achieved without any changes in consumer behavior...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Twelve years ago, the U. S. notion and {{millinery}} bag business began con-verting from {{paper to}} plastic. Today, flexible plastic packaging accounts for approx-imately 60 % of all bag and liner shipments, and 90 % of specialty bags and liners. In this growing market, {{there is a}} reed for bag making machinery which is reliable and able to maximize output This paper explores the market trends of plastic bags and describes the equipment for producing these products {{now and in the}} near future. DISCUSSION THE PLASTIC BAG market has steadily increased its share of the total bagmarket in the 1980 s. Producers of plastic merchandise bags have cap-tured 65 % of the total 30 billion unit market from the Kraft paper bags, with projections of 80 % by 1990. Retail stores have accepted these plastic bags because of their lower cost, better graphics, tear strength, water resistance, and the reduced space requirement for transport and storage [1]. Approx-imately 90 % of the resins used to produce merchandise bags are high den-sity polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). The plastic grocery sack has taken approximately 25 % of the $ 600 mil-lion, 22 billion unit grocery sack market, and if the trend continues, it will rise to 65 % by 1990. Nearly 1. 7 billion pounds of LLDPE went into trash bag markets, and these markets consisted of institutional, <b>industrial,</b> and consumer <b>bags</b> [2]. In 1986, 187 million pounds of HDPE were used for all bag markets with 76 million for grocery sacks, 62 million for can liners, and 25 million for merchandise bags [3]...|$|R
