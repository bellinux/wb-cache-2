5|$|The reasons Paraceratherium became extinct after {{surviving}} {{for about}} 11 million years are unknown, {{but it is}} unlikely that there was a single cause. Theorised reasons include climate change, low reproduction rate, and invasion by gomphothere proboscideans <b>from</b> <b>Africa</b> in the late Oligocene. Gomphotheres may have been able to considerably change the habitats they entered, {{in the same way that}} African elephants do today, by destroying trees and turning woodland into grassland. Once their food source became scarce and their numbers dwindled, Paraceratherium populations would have become more vulnerable to other threats. Large predators like Hyaenaelurus and Amphicyon also entered Asia <b>from</b> <b>Africa</b> during the early Miocene; these may have predated Paraceratherium calves. Other herbivores also invaded Asia during this time.|$|E
