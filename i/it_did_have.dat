5|$|In early June 1989, a {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from the}} west coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean, eventually crossing into the eastern North Pacific. Initially, several centers of circulation were associated with the system. Continuing organize, the storm is estimated to have attained tropical depression status at 0000 UTC on June 18. The depression was broad and lacked substantial thunderstorm activity. However, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> respectable outflow and banding. It moved towards the west and intensified into {{a tropical}} storm at 0000 UTC on June 20, 48 hours after being classified.|$|E
5|$|Model's {{main attack}} was {{delivered}} by XLVII Panzer Corps, supported by 45 Tigers of the attached 505th Heavy Tank Battalion. Covering their left flank was XLI Panzer Corps, with an attached regiment of 83 Ferdinand tank destroyers. On the right flank, XLVI Panzer Corps consisted {{at this time}} of four infantry divisions with just 9 tanks and 31 assault guns. To the left of XLI Panzer Corps was XXIII Army Corps, which consisted of the reinforced 78th Assault Infantry Division and two regular infantry divisions. While the corps contained no tanks, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> 62 assault guns. Opposing the 9th Army was the Central Front, deployed in three heavily fortified defensive belts.|$|E
5|$|Satellite nests {{are common}} among P. exclamans. A queen will fly somewhere between 0.15 and 11m {{away from the}} {{original}} nest to settle in a new location. About 16–39% of nests create satellites from May to July. Similar to the wasp species, Parischnogaster alternata, constructing multitude of nests in clusters {{in order to create}} protection through dilution effect, the satellites are used as an insurance against attacks by predators and parasitoids. Of 12 nests that were knocked down by birds that had satellites, 66.7% of the colony survived by moving to the satellite, compared to the reproductive success of nests with no satellite that were attacked (5.7%). When Chalcoela iphitalis invades, the prevalence of satellites didn’t increase the survivability, however <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> an effect when Elasmus polistis were introduced. It gave the P. exclamans a place to escape to.|$|E

5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in the main room but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E
