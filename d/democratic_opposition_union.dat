5000|$|The attention-catching paper soon {{developed}} a loyal contingent of readers, however, {{because of its}} professed neutrality. Inaugurated {{two months before the}} birth of the Peronist movement, arguably the central political development in Argentina since 1945, Clarín provoked few conflicts with the imposing new President Juan Perón, whose <b>opposition</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> he had endorsed; whereas La Nación and La Prensa personally accused Perón and, particularly, the first lady, Eva Perón (whom La Prensa only referred to as [...] "the wife of the president") of the days problems, Clarín focused on issues of social and economic development (particularly Argentinas budding industrialization, a concern it shared with the Perón administration), offering articles rich in facts, figures and anecdotes with limited editorials. It also benefited from Peróns hostility towards some competing magazines and dailies, particularly La Prensa, which Perón expropriated in April, 1951 (on the eve of his reelection campaign).|$|R
5000|$|In this context, Adevărul advertised {{that its}} main purpose was the {{dissemination}} of [...] "nothing but the truth", of [...] "exact information". The paper however stood out for promoting nationalist, populist and authoritarian concepts, which Berry has associated with the survival of previous national communist themes in FSN discourse. Such theses acquired particularly controversial representations during the violent Târgu Mureş riots of March 1990. Backing the official view according to which the ethnic Hungarian community was organizing itself in separatist struggle, it dedicated space to articles targeting the <b>opposition</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> of Hungarians (UDMR). Initially, Berry notes, Adevărul reported claims of extremist Hungarians in Transylvania committing vandalism against national monuments while acknowledging that the UDMR was not endorsing such acts, but slowly became a tribune for encouraging ethnic Romanians to take action, exclusively presenting its public with politicized and unmitigated {{information provided by the}} official agency Rompres and by the Romanian ultra-nationalist group Vatra Românească. Its editorials, often based on rumors, included negative portrayals of Hungarians, methods described by Berry as [...] "extremely xenophobic", [...] "unethical" [...] and forms of [...] "political manipulation".|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} international coercive policies on <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> parties operating within ‘rogue’ states. Using Serbia between 1992 and 2000 as a case study, {{the aim of this}} research is to evaluate the impact of the international community’s coercion of Serbia on the effectiveness of the Serbian <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> in their campaigns against the Milosevic regime. In order to explore this issue, the time period from 1992 to 2000 is broken down into five subperiods in each of which Serbia’s experience of international coercion differed in terms of its nature and/or extent. Within each of these sub-periods the issues of whether Serbia’s opposition parties held positions that differed from those of the Milosevic regime on issues that were of key international concern; the extent and nature of links between the Serbian <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> and the international community; and the impact of international policy on the effectiveness of the <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> in opposing the Milosevic regime is investigated. The findings of this research show that the positions of the <b>democratic</b> <b>opposition</b> parties were often closer to those of the international com m unity than were those of the Milosevic regime, and that for much of the time international coercion of Serbia undermined Serbia’s opposition in its efforts to oppose Milosevic...|$|R
