5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
25|$|Chief Executive Officer Richard Wheatly {{noted that}} the station format was <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> of its serious {{straight}} jazz playlist. To counteract this downturn in listeners to Jazz FM, from 1998, Wheatly introduced more varied jazz into the daytime playlists. From February 1998, smooth jazz and soul music were more integrated into the core playlist of Jazz FM.|$|E
25|$|Bastion Properties was <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> of {{building}} costs and an unsatisfactory building manager. After rapid expansion, Heseltine's businesses were badly {{hit by the}} Selwyn Lloyd financial squeeze of 1961 and, still not yet thirty years old, he would eventually owe £250,000 (around £4.5 million at 2016 prices). He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine joked about how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E

50|$|The {{story of}} Maria Di Rohan is both simple (the classic love triangle) and complicated. Chalais loves Maria, {{who has been}} forced to {{secretly}} marry Chevreuse. Chevreuse is <b>in</b> deep <b>trouble,</b> <b>because</b> he has killed a nephew of Richelieu.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> {{he lacked}} the means to live decently, and because his lack of a {{university}} degree meant he could not become a lawyer or a professor, Rosetti sought a professional job relatively safe from the vicissitudes of politics. At the time, the Foreign Affairs Ministry formed one such oasis. He applied there, and in April 1898, when Sturdza was both Prime and Foreign Minister, he was hired as the archivist's assistant, again helped by Bianu. His other supporter was Gheorghe Văsescu, {{a friend of the}} PNL factional leader Ion I. C. Brătianu. Although this new job was low in the ministerial hierarchy, his fluent knowledge of several languages (itself a precondition for working in the ministry) and his penchant for historical exegesis helped Rosetti advance. Nevertheless, the promotions came with a humiliating slowness and, with a wife, three sons and a daughter to support, he found the salary insufficient. Although the Conservatives returned to power in 1899, their new leader was Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino—Rosetti's patron, Catargiu, died suddenly the same year, leaving him virtually without friends in the party.|$|E
2500|$|Then in 1960, {{professional}} football came to Dallas and Houston. Attendance at Rice, SMU, TCU, and Baylor collapsed. [...] For over two decades, the SWC membership {{struggled with the}} issue. In 1974 a lengthy Texas Monthly article detailed the attendance decline at Rice, Baylor, SMU, and TCU, and suggested the SWC was <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> the University of Texas {{felt like it was}} subsidizing the conference. The conference collapsed in 1994.|$|E

60|$|Here, in the evening, {{amid the}} {{manifold}} smells of the day, the family goes to its virtuous couch. That is to say, {{as many as}} possible pile into the one bed (if bed they have), and the surplus turns in on the floor. And this is the round of their existence, month after month, year after year, for they never get a vacation save when they are evicted. When a child dies, and some are always bound to die, since fifty-five per cent. of the East End children die before they are five years old, the body is laid out in the same room. And if they are very poor, it is kept for some time until they can bury it. During the day it lies on the bed; during the night, when the living take the bed, the dead occupies the table, from which, in the morning, when the dead is put back into the bed, they eat their breakfast. Sometimes the body is placed on the shelf which serves as a pantry for their food. Only a couple of weeks ago, an East End woman was <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> <b>because,</b> in this fashion, being unable to bury it, she had kept her dead child three weeks.|$|E
5000|$|In 1866, the {{commission}} found itself <b>in</b> financial <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> of the just-ended Austro-Prussian War.

25|$|In 1974, Peugeot {{bought a}} 30% share of Citroën, {{and took it}} over {{completely}} in 1975 after the French government gave {{large sums of money}} to the new company. Citroën was <b>in</b> financial <b>trouble</b> <b>because</b> it developed too many radical new models for its financial resources. Some of them, notably the Citroën SM and the Comotor Wankel engine venture proved unprofitable. Others, the Citroën CX and Citroën GS for example, proved very successful in the marketplace.|$|R

5000|$|The BBC {{would later}} {{describe}} the bombing as {{a turning point}} <b>in</b> the <b>Troubles</b> <b>because</b> the attack shook the IRA [...] "to its core". Pivotal to the change in attitude towards this sort of attack was Wilson's reaction {{to the death of}} his daughter. The 60-year-old draper publicly forgave those who had planted the bomb and said he would pray for them. He also begged that no-one take revenge for Marie's death and pleaded with loyalists not to do so.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Terry {{may have}} {{realized}} that Educational was <b>in</b> financial <b>trouble,</b> <b>because</b> he found another lucrative outlet for his product.

It seemed that Demarco was passing away together with a whole age.|$|R
