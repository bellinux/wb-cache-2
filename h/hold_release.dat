2500|$|A common {{variation}} of the ADSR on some synthesizers, such as the Korg MS-20, was ADSHR (attack, decay, sustain, <b>hold,</b> <b>release).</b> [...] By adding a [...] "hold" [...] parameter, the system could hold notes at the sustain level for a fixed length of time before decaying. [...] The General Instruments AY-3-8912 sound chip included a hold time parameter only—the sustain level was not programmable. [...] Another common variation {{in the same vein}} is the AHDSR (attack, hold, decay, sustain, release) envelope, in which the [...] "hold" [...] parameter controls how long the envelope stays at full volume before entering the decay phase.

40|$|We {{study how}} {{synchronized}} gaze, gesture and speech rendered by an embodied conversational agent {{can influence the}} flow of conversations in multiparty settings. We review a computational framework for turn taking that provides the foundation for tracking and communicating intentions to <b>hold,</b> <b>release,</b> or {{take control of the}} conversational floor. We then present details of the implementation of the approach in an embodied conversational agent and describe experiments with the system in a shared task setting. Finally, we discuss results showing how the verbal and non-verbal cues used by the avatar can shape the dynamics of multiparty conversation...|$|E
30|$|These phases {{are named}} <b>hold,</b> <b>release,</b> relax, and switch, respectively. Figure  4 shows the four phases of clock. The main {{function}} of QCA clocks {{is to ensure}} the proper transfer of the data {{from one place to}} another in a circuit [12]. During the hold state the tunneling barrier of the quantum dots is high; hence, electrons are highly localized and have a fixed polarization. During the release state, the tunneling barrier is decreased and electrons slowly become free to move. In the relax state electrons are completely free to tunnel among quantum dots and do not have any influence on the neighboring cells. In the switch state the tunneling barrier is slowly raised constraining the electrons to the most stable state [13, 14].|$|E

40|$|A basic {{requirement}} {{for participation in}} conversation {{is the ability to}} jointly manage interaction. Examples of interaction management include indications to acquire, re-acquire, <b>hold,</b> <b>release,</b> and acknowledge floor ownership, and these are often implemented using specialized dialog act (DA) types. In this work, we explore the prosody of one class of such DA types, known as floor mechanisms, using a methodology based on a recently proposed representation of fundamental frequency variation (FFV). Models over the representation illustrate significant differences between floor mechanisms and other dialog act types, and lead to automatic detection accuracies in equal-prior test data of up to 75 %. Analysis indicates that FFV modeling offers a useful tool for the discovery of prosodic phenomena which are not explicitly labeled in the audio. 1...|$|E

This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, their attributes, and their operations that is independent of encoding and transport. The model consists of a Printer and a Job object. A Job optionally supports multiple documents. IPP 1. 1 semantics allow end-users and operators to query printer capabilities, submit print jobs, inquire about the status of print jobs and printers, cancel, <b>hold,</b> <b>release,</b> and restart print jobs. IPP 1. 1 semantics allow operators to pause, resume, and purge (jobs from) Printer objects. This document also addresses security, internationalization, and directory issues...|$|E
40|$|In proposing an {{ontology}} {{of motion}} capture, this paper identifies three modalities — capture, <b>hold,</b> <b>release</b> — to conceptualise the peculiar affordances of motion capture technology in {{its relationship to}} a performer 2 ̆ 7 s movement. Motion capture is unique among contemporary moving image media in its capacity to re-perform a performer 2 ̆ 7 srecorded movement a potentially limitless number of times, e. g. as applied to innumerable different CG characters. Unlike live-action film or even rotoscoping (motion capture 2 ̆ 7 s closest equivalent), the movement extracted from the captured performance lives on, but only {{by way of the}} inimagable (non-visible) domain of motion data. Motion data 2 ̆ 7 holds 2 ̆ 7 movement itself in inimagable form, and 2 ̆ 7 releases 2 ̆ 7 it in the domain of the digital moving image. This tri-fold conception relates an important dimension of (Heideggerian) Being to the idea of movement as fundamental to an ontology or 2 ̆ 7 being 2 ̆ 7 of motion capture. At the same time, the proposed ontology challenges the 2 ̆ 7 illusion of life 2 ̆ 7 metaphor as the accepted definition of (motion capture) animation. The Oscar 2 ̆ 7 s Special Rules for the Animated Feature Film Award asserts that 2 ̆ 7 by itself 2 ̆ 7 motion capture does not qualify as an animation method. The notion that a technology could do or be anything 2 ̆ 7 by itself 2 ̆ 7 affords a conceptual leap toward Heideggerian thinking on the nature of Being as embodied in temporality, in which past, present and future are unified. In its capacity to operate outside the domain of the digital moving image, the concept of 2 ̆ 7 movement itself 2 ̆ 7 not only articulates an ontology of motion capture: motion capture itself can be understood to be brought into being by movement, thus also challenging the notion that capture technology has a parasitic relationship to a performer 2 ̆ 7 s originary performance...|$|E
