5|$|<b>Habitat</b> {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either <b>habitat</b> can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to <b>habitat</b> modification than organisms that only require one <b>habitat</b> type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} <b>habitat</b> in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this <b>habitat</b> include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak. This <b>habitat</b> also contains gray and black birch trees. Pine, hemlock, and {{some types of}} oak trees are found on the higher parts of this <b>habitat.</b> Lower to the ground are huckleberry, teaberry, blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this <b>habitat</b> include wild onion and wild strawberries.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-eight {{species are}} {{threatened}} with extinction {{as a result}} of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or the pet trade. The principal threat is <b>habitat</b> loss, which causes <b>habitat</b> fragmentation and increased nest predation in <b>habitat</b> fragments.|$|E

They live in densely populated cities like Jodhpur, which has a population numbering up to a million.|$|R
5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their <b>habitat</b> in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable <b>habitat.</b> However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented <b>habitat</b> and caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E
5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is <b>habitat</b> degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. An example of a fish that has become endangered because of <b>habitat</b> change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|After mating in August or September, {{the female}} katipo {{produces}} {{five or six}} egg sacs in November or December. The spiderlings hatch during January and February and disperse into surrounding plants. Due to <b>habitat</b> loss and colonisation of their natural <b>habitat</b> by other exotic spiders, the katipo is threatened with extinction.|$|E
5|$|Marine <b>habitats</b> can {{be divided}} {{horizontally}} into coastal and open ocean <b>habitats.</b> Coastal <b>habitats</b> extend from the shoreline {{to the edge of}} the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal <b>habitats,</b> even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean <b>habitats</b> are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine <b>habitats</b> {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) <b>habitats.</b> A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|R

40|$|Ecological {{investigations}} {{were made}} of <b>habitats</b> containing natural populations of the snail Oncomelania hupensis quadrasi and of <b>habitats</b> free from the snail in the island of Leyte, Philippines. This species of snail is a vector of Schistosoma japonicum in the Philippines. Snail-infested <b>habitats</b> had dissolved oxygen levels of 3. 8 - 9. 85 ppm but snail-free <b>habitats</b> had levels of only 0. 08 - 3. 6 ppm. Snail-infested <b>habitats</b> were less polluted by organic matter than <b>habitats</b> that were snail-free. Larger numbers of chlorophyll-bearing algae were present in both {{the water and the}} soil of snail-infested <b>habitats.</b> Other factors, including temperature, pH, hydrogen carbonate alkalinity, and relative humidity, were also investigated...|$|R
5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland <b>habitat.</b> Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. <b>Habitat</b> is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E

5|$|Classified as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN due to ongoing <b>habitat</b> destruction and {{a decline in}} the quality of the remaining <b>habitat,</b> the long-tailed ground roller {{is believed to be the}} most threatened species of ground roller. Thirty percent of its already small <b>habitat</b> area was degraded between the mid-1970s and 2000. Slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, logging, and cattle grazing have all contributed to the loss of <b>habitat.</b> As of 2012, no reserves protect any portion of its <b>habitat,</b> and as a result its <b>habitat</b> has been described as the area of Madagascar most in need of conservation efforts. It is also threatened by both hunting and egg-collecting. In addition to humans, dogs hunt this species, and the introduced black rat is a nest predator. This ground roller is capable of tolerating some <b>habitat</b> disturbance, but requires a suitable amount of shade and leaf litter to continue living in the area. Although it was fairly common at the beginning of the twentieth century, its population went into decline and it was considered rare by the 1960s. As of 2012, the estimated population of the long-tailed ground roller is between 9,500 and 32,700 birds and declining.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of nature monitoring in synanthropic <b>habitats.</b> It shows the organizational aspects of monitoring, a survey procedure, including its assessment for use in synanthropic <b>habitats,</b> and the key findings of the research, including the evaluation of the conservation status of <b>habitats</b> covered by the monitoring and influencing factors’ effects. Observations of segetal and ruderal <b>habitats</b> were carried out in 2013 within the Kampinos National Park, according to the recommendations specified in the State Environmental Monitoring Programme, with specific adjustment to the monitored <b>habitats.</b> We used, for example, modified indices for specific structures and functions, e. g., by introducing the index of “archaeophytes”, which was also adopted as a cardinal index for synanthropic <b>habitats.</b> The obtained results show the detailed information, collected during monitoring, on the current status of synanthropic <b>habitats.</b> They allowed to evaluate conservation status, threats and conservation prospects for these <b>habitats.</b> This is the first proposal for the standardized monitoring of synanthropic <b>habitats</b> in Poland...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{influence}} of anthropogenic modification of coastal <b>habitats</b> on fish assemblages in Taiwan, comparing the abundance, species richness and taxonomic composition of fishes on natural v. artificial <b>habitats.</b> While there was no significant variation in the abundance or richness of fishes between natural and artificial <b>habitats,</b> the species composition of fishes in artificial <b>habitats</b> was significantly different from that of natural <b>habitats.</b> Natural reefs were characterized by greater abundance of Stethojulis spp. (Labridae), Abudefduf spp. (Pomacentridae) and Thalassoma spp. (Labridae), whereas anthropogenic <b>habitats</b> were dominated by Parupeneus indicus (Mullidae), Pempheris oualensis (Pempheridae) and Parapriacanthus ransonneti (Pempheridae). In general, it appears that specialist reef-associated species are being replaced with fishes that are much more generalist in their habitat-use. The loss of natural coastal <b>habitats</b> may threaten some species that cannot live in anthropogenically altered <b>habitats,</b> though the overall abundance and diversity of coastal fishes was not significantly different between natural and artificial <b>habitats</b> in Taiwan...|$|R
5|$|Common and {{widespread}} throughout New Guinea, the hooded pitohui is evaluated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In one study {{of the effects of}} small subsistence gardens, populations of hooded pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural <b>habitat</b> in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed <b>habitat</b> higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Habitat</b> {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments {{are most likely to be}} affected by <b>habitat</b> degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable <b>habitat.</b> For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Habitat</b> {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while <b>habitat</b> fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic <b>habitat.</b> Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E
50|$|Though {{vertebrates}} {{in general}} {{would not be}} considered pioneer species, there are exceptions. Natterjack toads are specialists in open, sparsely vegetated <b>habitats</b> which may be at an early seral stage. Wide-ranging generalists visit early succession stage <b>habitats,</b> but are not obligate species of those <b>habitats</b> because they use a mosaic of different <b>habitats.</b>|$|R

50|$|Coastal <b>habitats</b> are {{the most}} visible marine <b>habitats,</b> {{but they are not}} the only {{important}} marine <b>habitats.</b> Coastlines run for 380,000 kilometres, and the total volume of the ocean is 1,370 million cu km.

5|$|<b>Habitat</b> destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a <b>habitat</b> of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current <b>habitat</b> for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the <b>habitat</b> {{quality of}} upper Fishing Creek {{and its tributaries}} were rated {{on a scale of}} 1 to 200 (with a higher rating {{indicating}} better habitability) by Point Park University and the Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association. The headwaters of West Branch Fishing Creek had a score of 191, tying West Creek for the highest-rated site in the upper Fishing Creek watershed. Most of West Branch Fishing Creek received a rating between 166 and 200, indicating optimal <b>habitat</b> quality. The lower reaches of the creek, however, received a rating of 113 to 165, indicating suboptimal <b>habitat</b> quality.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, two genetic {{studies of}} North American gray wolves {{found that they}} formed six {{ecotypes}} – genetically and ecologically distinct populations separated from other populations by their different type of <b>habitat.</b> These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables. These findings were in accord with previous studies that precipitation influenced morphology and that vegetation and <b>habitat</b> type influenced wolf differences. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference {{to remain in the}} type of <b>habitat</b> that it was born into.|$|E

Open ocean <b>habitats</b> are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf.|$|R
50|$|P. cattleyanum grows {{effectively}} in undisturbed areas, complicating restoration efforts in sensitive <b>habitats.</b> Its ubiquity in damaged ecosystems further muddles management {{due to its}} high dispersal from these less-sensitive <b>habitats</b> to more fragile <b>habitats.</b>|$|R
5|$|In intensively farmed {{areas where}} {{agricultural}} practices {{appear to have}} made cropped land unsuitable, gardens are an important breeding <b>habitat.</b> In one English study, only 3.5% of territories were found in farmland, whereas gardens held 71.5% of the territories, despite that <b>habitat</b> making up only 2% of the total area. The remaining nests were in woodlands (1% of total area).|$|E
5|$|Methods used to {{recreate}} the bog turtle's <b>habitat</b> include: controlled burns to limit the growth of overshadowing trees and underbrush (thus bringing the <b>habitat</b> back to early successional); grazing livestock such as cows and goats in the desired <b>habitat</b> area (creating pockets of water and freshly churned mud); and promoting beaver activity, including dam construction in and around wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Much {{is written}} about the {{different}} factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is <b>habitat</b> loss in various forms. Related to water <b>habitat,</b> there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting <b>habitat,</b> urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E
40|$|Asteroid and cornet impacts {{can have}} a {{profound}} influence on the <b>habitats</b> available for lithophytic microorganisms. Using evidence from the Haughton impact structure, Nunavut, Canadian High Arctic, we describe the role of impacts in influencing, {{the nature of the}} lithophytic ecological niche. Impact-induced increases in rock porosity and fracturing can result in the formation of cryptoendolithic <b>habitats.</b> In some cases and depending upon the target material, an increase in rock translucence can yield new <b>habitats</b> for photosynthetic cryptoendoliths. Chasmoendolithic <b>habitats</b> are associated with cracks and cavities connected {{to the surface of the}} rock and are commonly increased in abundance as a result of impact bulking. Chasmoendolithic <b>habitats</b> require less specific geological conditions than are required for cryptoendolithic <b>habitats,</b> and their formation is likely to be common to most impact events. Impact events are unlikely to have all influence on epilithic and hypolithic <b>habitats</b> except in rare cases, where, for example, the formation of impact glasses might yield new hypolithic <b>habitats.</b> We present a synthetic understanding of the influence of asteroid and comet impacts on the availability and characteristics of rocky <b>habitats</b> for microorganisms. ...|$|R
