40|$|AbstractHeat {{pumps are}} {{becoming}} more and more applied for heating, due to their possibility of working as cooling systems in the summer period. However, up to now, recovery of expansion work in small system has not been considered as a viable solution, because of the limited amount of recoverable energy and of difficulties in designing and operating a two-phase <b>flow</b> <b>expander.</b> The idea here presented is to investigate the application of a radial piston machine, adapted from oleodynamic motor designs, as an expander that will be coupled with the compressor motor shaft; the consequent power reduction goes directly to COP improvement. First, heat pumps working conditions (pressures, mass and volume flows) are defined, and the possible power recovery is calculated. Then, a model for the performance calculation of the radial piston motors used as expander is presented; the model considers the kinematics of the mechanical system and uses real fluid properties.

Graph partitions or separators are central objects of study in the theory of Markov chains, geometric embeddings and are a natural algorithmic primitive in numeroussettings, including clustering, divide and conquer algorithms, PRAM emulation, VLSI layout, and packet routing in distributed networks. Since finding optimal separators is NP-hard, one is forced to settle forapproximation algorithms (see [28]) ...|$|R

We present overview of methods and concepts used to find best graph partitions according to several criteria. We prove duality of multi-commodity flow and sparsest cut problem due to work of Leighton and Rao by describing algorithm using a Linear programming relaxation and a geometric embedding. Then we present the work of Arora, Rao and Vazirani (ARV) and their algorithm based on Semidefinite programming relaxation and a geometric embedding. We also explain the concept of <b>expander</b> <b>flows</b> first introduced in the work of ARV. One section of our work is devoted to the spectral graph theory, introducing the concepts of the spectral gap, random walks, conductance and relations between them.

The use of hot gases of the same chemistry as the liquid for the turbine and pump side of the turbopumps {{eliminates the need for}} purges and some failures modes. Additionally, when the density of the fuel and oxidizer is significantly different, like in the H2/LOX case, the optimal turbopump speed differ so much that they need a gearbox between the fuel and oxidizer pumps. The use of dual expander cycle, with separate turbines, eliminates this failure-prone piece of equipment.|$|R

It is evaluated {{in the order of}} 15 % of the total electricity production taking refrigeration and air-conditioning into consideration. For this reason, in the last years several energy saving techniques have been proposed to reduce the power demand of such plants. The paper deals with the development of an innovative internal recovery system for cryogenic cooling plants. Such a system consists in a Compressor-Expander Group (CEG) designed {{on the basis of the}} automotive turbocharging technology. In particular, the paper is focused on the design of the expander, the critical component of the CEG system. Due to the low volumetric <b>flow</b> entering the <b>expander</b> and the high expansion ratio, a commercial turbocharger expander wheel was strongly modified. It was equipped with a transonic nozzle, designed to have a radially inflow full admission.

3000|$|The CNDP {{is related}} {{to a variety of}} other graph {{partitioning}} problems in the literature; for instance, the minimum multi-cut problem, which aims to separate a set of source-sink pairs by removing a subset of minimum weighted edges. An O([...] n) approximation for general graphs is provided in [22]. Another well-studied graph partitioning problem is the k-cut problem. Given an undirected weighted graph, the goal is to find a minimum cost set of edges that separates the graph into at least k connected components. An O(2 - 2 /k)-approximation algorithm has been devised for this problem [23]. Classical multi-way cut, multi-cut, and k-cut problems that include a budget constraint to limit the number edges or vertices that can be cut have been studied in [24], where the authors also propose the problem of maximizing the number of connected components. In [25, 26], an O(√(n))-approximation algorithm is presented for the sparsest cut, edge expansion, balanced separator, and graph conductance problems, all of which are based on the notion of graph partitioning. These approaches also minimize the size of the interface between the resulting components. Their approach is based on semi-definite relaxation to these problems in concert with <b>expander</b> <b>flows</b> and has influenced much subsequent research.|$|R

Accordingly the adoption of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) have been pushed. Such a technology is promising but it still shows some peculiar aspects. Some of them are related to stable and controllable operations of commercially available Gas Turbines (GTs) designed to be fed with Natural Gas (NG) once the original fuel is replaced by the hydrogen-rich syngas produced in an IGCC-CCS plant.. The thermo-physical properties of the H 2 -rich syngas require investigations and modifications of the combustor and of the turbomachines to meet stable and safe GT behavior. Such properties strongly affect the matching between GT compressor and expander.. To run the GT with the syngas, various options can be taken into consideration.

This article presents the experimental and theoretical results of the latest process modifications made, i. e. {{the effect of the}} installation of an aftercooler. The purpose of the aftercooler is to increase the performance of the cycle by utilizing more low-level heat in the humidification tower. The chosen aftercooler is of plate heat exchanger type, which, is very compact, has high thermal efficiency and low pressure drop. The installation of an aftercooler lowers the temperature of the air entering the humidification tower. This also lowers the temperature of the circulating humidification water, which facilitates the extraction of more low-level heat from the economizer. This low-level heat can be utilized to evaporate more water in the humidification tower and thus increase the gas <b>flow</b> in the <b>expander.</b> The pilot plant has been operated at different loads and the measured results has been evaluated and compared with theoretical models.

The total <b>flow</b> helical screw <b>expander</b> portable power plant, Model 76 - 1, {{had been built}} for the U. S. Government and field-tested in Utah, USA, in 1978 and 1979. The expander had oversized internal clearances designed for self-cleaning operation on fluids that deposit adherent scale normally detrimental to the utiliation of liquid dominated fields. Conditions with which the expander was tested included inlet pressures of 64 to 220 psia, inlet qualities of 0 % to 100 %, exhaust pressures of 3. 1 to 40 psia, electrial loads of idle and 110 to 933 kW, electrical frequencies of 50 and 60 Hz, male rotor speeds of 2500 to 4000 rpm, and fluid characteristics to 310, 000 ppm total dissolved solids and noncondensables to 38 wt % of the vapor. Some testing was done on-grid. Typical expander isentropic efficiency was 40 % to 50 % with the clearances not closed, and 5 percentage points or more higher with the clearances partly closed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reduced-order through-flow expander {{design for the}} Humid Air Turbine (HAT) also called the Evaporative Gas Turbine (EvGT). The HAT cycle is an innovative gas turbine cycle that uses humid air to enhance efficiency and power output. This means {{that there will be}} a higher water vapour content in the exhaust gases than for a simple cycle. This high water content affects the design of the HAT expander. The design of a wet expander is presented and compared with the results obtained with an expander working under dry exhaust gas conditions. The study was conducted using the reduced-order turbine design tool LUAX-T, developed at Lund University, which is freely available for academic use upon request. LUAX-T allows a flow-path analysis of the expander by specifying important flow-path parameters such as blade root stress and wall-hade angle. The HAT cycle enables cooling <b>flow</b> to the <b>expander</b> under different conditions and design differences for three different options are presented. The first cooling air bleeding point evaluated is the original position, where air is bled from the compressor discharge. The second position is just before the humidification tower, where the air has been cooled down to a low temperature. The third position is just after the humidification tower, where the air has been humidified thus changing its thermodynamic properties. Results in this paper shows that there is a need for an additional turbine stage in a humid expander compared to a dry expander. There are also results indicating that the compressor power can be reduced depending on which cooling strategy is used which can yield an increased total efficiency for a HAT cycle...|$|R
40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in many industries. It is considered that scroll compressors {{have the advantage of}} high efficiency, lower noise and vibration levels. There are various losses in a scroll compressor that need to be studied to achieve better efficiency, of which the most significant is the flow losses, especially the losses at discharge. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can be a useful tool in understanding the flow field and help reduce the flow losses through design optimizations. There are few numerical studies on the flow inside the scroll compressor. The reason is that defining the mesh and its movement in the scroll rotor can be demanding. The flow field of a scroll compressor is unsteady and 3 -dimensional, consisting of gas pockets with changing geometry and volume. More often than not, check valves are used at the discharge to prevent reverse flow, which complicates the setup of the numerical simulation. The present work demonstrates a newly developed rotor template tool for scroll compressors/ expanders. This scroll template generates high-quality structure mesh from the outlines of stationary and orbiting rotors, which are input from the user. The mesh movement is also automatically calculated to account for every position of the orbiting rotor, maintaining good grid quality and smooth movement through the whole revolution. The tool greatly simplifies the setup of the CFD simulation and can significantly reduce turn-around time. Moreover, the check valve is simulated with the flip valve template tool. Here, the bending deformation of the flexible reed valve plate is replaced by a rigid body rotation. With judicious choices of torsional elastic constant and preload torque, the valve opening {{at the center of the}} discharging port can be setup to mimic that of a flexible flap. The rotor and valve components are then combined, to provide a complete solution for scroll compressor/ <b>expander</b> <b>flow</b> simulations...|$|R

In reality, most ORC systems are designed and manufactured for recovery of thermal energy from various sources but at “large power rating” (exhaust gas turbines, internal combustion engines, geothermal sources, large melting furnaces, biomass, solar, etc.) from where it is possible to produce electric energy (30 kW ÷ 300 kW), but for the application of this system for small nominal power, as well as the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines (car sedan or town, ships, etc.) or smaller heat exchangers, there are very few applications. The aim of this work is to design a turbo-expander that meets system requirements: low pressure, small size, low mass <b>flow</b> rates.

40|$|Passive cooling {{has shown}} to be a very {{dependable}} cryogenic cooling method for space missions. Several missions employ passive radiators to cool down their delicate sensor systems for many years, without consuming power, without exporting vibrations or producing electromagnetic interference. So for a number of applications, passive cooling is a good choice. At lower temperatures, the passive coolers run into limitations that prohibit accommodation on a spacecraft. The approach to this issue has been to find a technology able to supplement passive cooling for lower temperatures, which maintains as much as possible of the advantages of passive coolers. Sorption cooling employs a closed cycle Joule–Thomson expansion process to achieve the cooling effect. Sorption cells perform the compression phase in this cycle. At a low temperature and pressure, these cells adsorb the working fluid. At a higher temperature they desorb the fluid and thus produce a high-pressure <b>flow</b> to the <b>expander</b> in the cold stage. The sorption process selected for this application is of the physical type, which is completely reversible. It does not suffer from degradation {{as is the case with}} chemical sorption of, e. g., hydrogen in metal hydrides. Sorption coolers include no moving parts except for some check valves, they export neither mechanical vibrations nor electromagnetic interference, and are potentially very dependable due to their simplicity. The required cooling temperature determines the type of working fluid to be applied. Sorption coolers can be used in conjunction with passive cooling for heat rejection at different levels. This paper starts with a brief discussion on applications of passive coolers in different types of orbits and on the limitations of passive cooling for lower cooling temperatures. Next, the working principle of sorption cooling is summarized. The DARWIN mission is chosen as an example application of sorption and passive cooling and special attention is paid to the reduction of the radiator area needed by the sorption cooler. The application field of this type of sorption cooling in space missions is currently being expanded by examining the performance of alternative working fluids, suitable for different cooling temperatures...|$|R
