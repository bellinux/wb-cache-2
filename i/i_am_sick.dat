500|$|In 1923 the {{composer}} Frederic Austin wrote the opera Polly, closely {{based on the}} 1729 work {{of the same name}} by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch; recordings of Austin's work were published by Columbia's main rival, the Gramophone Company. At Columbia's request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay's original. Austin considered that it copied elements of his, and sued for copyright infringement. Acting as a court expert witness, {{the composer}} Sir Frederick Bridge thought that the case [...] "...is an awful bore.... These two good men are good musicians, and they have no business to be fighting over the game. It is not worth the trouble.... It is rubbish. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of Polly." [...] After three weeks the case ended with the judge finding against Columbia.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot over seven {{days with a}} budget of about $68,000. Both Roger and Gene Corman were present {{for most of the}} film's {{production}} and involved creatively as well as financially. Gene was more involved with running the day-to-day operations while the more experienced Roger Corman supervised and provided guidance to both Gene and Kowalski. Martin Varno was also present for shooting. They operated out of the Charlie Chaplin Studios, which was called Kling Studios at the time. Some rewriting was done as the filming progressed, and director Bernard L. Kowalski called it a collaborative process that involved himself, the Cormans and the whole crew. Varno, however, said he was not happy with how the filming process went, and that the Cormans changed dialogue and story elements without his consultation or permission. He said it reached the point where he called his agent and said, [...] "I am not working for these sons of bitches any more! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of the whole thing!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the 1993 Conservative conference, Archer urged then Home Secretary Michael Howard, to [...] "Stand and deliver," [...] saying: [...] "Michael, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of being told by old people that they are frightened to open the door, they're frightened to go out at night, frightened to use the parks and byways where their parents and {{grandparents}} walked with freedom... We say to you: stand and deliver!". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of [...] "do-gooders" [...] and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role.|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the enemy's retreat, the Wei general Zhuge Dan ordered his subordinate Jiang Ban (蔣班) to lead 4,000 troops to pursue and attack Liu Zan. As Liu Zan was ill at the time, {{he could not get}} up and direct the troops to fight the enemy. Knowing that they would lose the battle, he passed his ceremonial umbrella and his official seal to his subordinate(s) and told him, [...] "As a commander, I have defeated enemies and captured their flags, but I have never lost a single battle. Now, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and outnumbered by the enemy. You should quickly leave while you still can. It won't do our State any good if all of us die here today; it'll only benefit the enemy." [...] When his subordinate(s) refused to leave, he drew his sword and threatened to kill him; only then did his subordinate(s) leave.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Hudson's {{press release}} {{disclosing}} his infection, William M. Hoffman, {{the author of}} As Is, a play about AIDS that appeared on Broadway in 1985, stated: [...] "If Rock Hudson can have it, nice people can have it. It's just a disease, not a moral affliction." [...] At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: [...] "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS {{to the attention of}} the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage." [...] Morgan Fairchild said that [...] "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face." [...] In a telegram Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend in person, Hudson said: [...] "I am not happy that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick.</b> I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Franklin B. Gowen, the {{president}} of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company and [...] "the wealthiest anthracite coal mine owner in the world", hired Allan Pinkerton's services to deal with the Mollies. Pinkerton selected James McParland (sometimes called McParlan), a native of County Armagh, to go undercover against the Mollies. Using the alias [...] "James McKenna", he made Shenandoah his headquarters and claimed to have become a trusted member of the organization. His assignment was to collect evidence of murder plots and intrigue, passing this information along to his Pinkerton manager. He also began working secretly with a Pinkerton agent assigned to the Coal and Iron Police for the purpose of coordinating the eventual arrest and prosecution of members of the Molly Maguires. Although there had been fifty [...] "inexplicable murders" [...] between 1863 and 1867 in Schuylkill County, progress in the investigations was slow. There was [...] "a lull in the entire area, broken only by minor shootings". McParland wrote: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of this thing. I seem to make no progress.|$|E
2500|$|West was {{a member}} of Instonians in 2003 and in 2004 he moved to Bangor Cricket Club where he was the team's {{professional}} player for two seasons. He moved to Belfast after marrying a girl from Northern Ireland. As early as 2005, when he finished top of the Northern Cricket Union batting averages and was named Northern Ireland Player of the Year, there was speculation that West might play for Ireland. At the end of the 2005 season, West moved back to Instonians where he was a local player rather than a professional, stating [...] "I enjoyed my two years at Bangor and made a lot of friends there, however, now that I am working full time [...] and living in Belfast it seemed a natural move to come back to Instonians". During his second stint with Instonians, West was occasionally suffered disciplinary problems, and on his departure from the club to join Civil Service North at the end of 2007, West said [...] "I don't want to see another disciplinary committee room. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of it and they are probably sick of me". On signing West, the Civil Service North captain said [...] "In Regan, we have signed a quality batsman and a quality bowler– indeed he is two players in one".|$|E
