5|$|Public {{transportation}} is available daily. A bus stop is located <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the entrance. Parking is free.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{bus station}} <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of the main}} {{entrance}} for several key bus services, including 10, 59, 73, 205 and 390.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} chapter of Robert J. Sawyer's science fiction novel Calculating God, an alien {{spaceship}} lands <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the McLaughlin Planetarium, prior to {{going on a}} tour of the exhibits in the Royal Ontario Museum.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>directly</b> located <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Ez-Zituna Mosque, near Souk El Attarine.|$|R

50|$|In {{its most}} basic form, a student would recite {{verbatim}} poems or essays of others, either to the teacher or tutor <b>directly,</b> or <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a class or body of assembled students.|$|R
5|$|Additional common {{features}} {{are shared by}} the palaces of Pylos, Mycenae and Tiryns; a large court with colonnades lies <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the central megaron, while a second, but smaller, megaron is also found inside these structures. The staircases in the palace of Pylos indicate that the palaces had two stories. The private quarters {{of the members of}} the royal family were presumably located on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Fin skeletons are {{elongated}} {{and supported}} with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers. Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of them because}} their fins do {{not allow them to}} move in the tail-first direction.|$|E
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one {{on either side of the}} centreline.|$|E
50|$|The {{urban bus}} stops are <b>directly</b> located <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the station's main entrance. The Autostazione bus station is located {{to the south}} and there are long-distance {{services}} to Slovenia, Austria and the Balkan Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|The {{quadrangle}} or diamond <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> of {{the main}} building is the largest outdoor public space, used primarily for large student gatherings, such as the shows hosted during the annual Deepwoods intercollegiate cultural festival.|$|R
50|$|The pier {{was moved}} further into Victoria Harbour, and {{constructed}} on reclaimed land approximately 300 metres {{away from the}} former site (as the crow flies). The new pier is located <b>directly</b> northwards, <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the old pier.|$|R
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E
5|$|The DVD's special {{features}} include {{an interview with}} Wiseau, who is asked questions by an off-screen Greg Sestero. Wiseau sits <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a fireplace, with a mantel cluttered by various props from the film; next to him sits a large framed theatrical poster for the film. A few of Wiseau's answers are dubbed in, although {{it is evident that}} the dubbed responses match what he was originally saying. Wiseau fails to answer several of the questions, instead offering non sequiturs.|$|E
5|$|The plan to {{relocate}} the Central Ferry Piers {{dates back to}} July 1999, when proposed amendments to the draft Central District (Extension) Outline Zoning Plan covering the Central Reclamation III area were published. Both the third generation Star Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier would be demolished and 16 hectares of land <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the fourth-generation pier reclaimed {{to make way for}} a six-lane road and a low-rise shopping centre. The cost was estimated at HK$3.5 billion. The Government said that the historical significance of the third-generation pier would be recognised and promised to recreate the landmark on the new waterfront.|$|E
50|$|A Chaise a Bureau is a Rococo {{style of}} chair created {{during the first}} half of the 18th century. This chair was {{constructed}} so it could sit in a corner of a room. There is one leg <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the back and one <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>front.</b> There is also one leg on each side.|$|R
6000|$|The Serpent now {{reached the}} shore, <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> {{of his two}} comrades, with whose precise {{position}} {{he must have been}} acquainted before leaving {{the eastern side of the}} river, and rising from the water he shook himself like a dog, and made the usual exclamation--"Hugh!" ...|$|R
60|$|Jane Haden did {{not answer}} <b>directly,</b> but {{standing}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of her husband, removed the handkerchief which covered the baby's face as he lay on her arm.|$|R
5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his position. Kouma's four {{vehicles}} attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around {{the left side of}} A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was built like a fortress of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced {{to spend more time}} defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
500|$|At about 4 p.m., the V Corps {{was ordered}} to advance {{in support of the}} III Corps. Barnes's {{division}} passed north of Little Round Top and deployed just south of the Wheatfield along a small, stony hill within sight of the Rose farmouse which was <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> their <b>front.</b> [...] Once deployed, the soldiers of the 22nd began to pile paper cartridges on the ground <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them, sensing they would be holding that ground for some time.|$|R
60|$|The ----th {{was placed}} <b>in</b> column <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> {{the rear of}} the Highlanders, who were led, on this occasion, by Col. Gordon Graham; a veteran officer of great experience, and of an undaunted courage. [36] Of course, I saw this officer and this regiment, being as they were <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> my <b>front,</b> but I saw little else; more {{especially}} after the smoke of the first discharge was added to the other obstacles to vision.|$|R
3000|$|... ′(n) of PA pass firstly the ADC, {{then the}} noise is added on the output signal of PA. The {{processed}} input and output signals are used for the model identification of (1) and (4). For ILA, the identified postdistorter model is <b>directly</b> placed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of PA as the predistorter [7]. For DLA, the predistorter is determined by inverting the identified PA model [10].|$|R
5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.|$|E
50|$|Each piece can {{challenge}} an opposing piece that is <b>directly</b> adjacent <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> behind, or {{to either side}} of it (identical in effect to the way it moves). Thus, a piece does not directly threaten an opposing piece that is situated diagonally to it. However, a piece that is known or thought to be stronger can restrict the movement of a weaker opposing piece that is situated diagonally to it by threatening elimination.|$|R
60|$|Eve said no more, {{though every}} {{syllable}} {{that the young}} man uttered was received by attentive ears, and retained with a scrupulous fidelity of memory. They walked some distance in silence, until they reached the grounds of a house that was beautifully placed {{on the side of the}} mountain, near a lovely wood of pines. Crossing these grounds, until they reached a terrace <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the dwelling, the village of Templeton lay <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> their <b>front,</b> perhaps a hundred feet beneath them, and yet so near, as to render the minutest object distinct. Here they all stopped to take a more distinct view of a place that had so much interest with most of the party.|$|R
50|$|The main {{premises}} of the “Parthenope” University are located <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> {{of the passenger}} port of Naples. Additionally, “Parthenope” has acquired classrooms buildings on the Posillipo coast and in the former church of San Giorgio dei Genovesi, located in the centre of Naples. An additional location is under preparation at the new civic centre, the Centro Direzionale. With the increased extension and completion of main facilities and its final accreditation as a full university, the current student population of the Parthenope University is about 15,000 units.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} year, she {{starred in}} the melodrama Autumn in New York, alongside Richard Gere. The film revolves around a relationship between an older man (Gere) and a younger woman (Ryder). Autumn in New York received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success, grossing $90million at the worldwide box office. Ryder then played a nun of a secret society loosely connected to the Roman Catholic Church and determined to prevent Armageddon in Lost Souls (2000), which was a commercial failure. Ryder refused to do commercial promotion for the film. Later in 2000, {{she was one of}} several celebrities who made small cameo appearances in Zoolander (released in 2001). On October 6, 2000, Ryder received her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Johnny Grant building next to the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. She was the 2,165th recipient of this honor.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{problems}} persisted, leading to motion pictures and sound recording largely taking separate paths for a generation. The primary issue was synchronization: pictures and sound were recorded and played back by separate devices, which {{were difficult to}} start and maintain in tandem. Sufficient playback volume was also hard to achieve. While motion picture projectors soon allowed film to be shown to large theater audiences, audio technology before the development of electric amplification could not project satisfactorily to fill large spaces. Finally, there was the challenge of recording fidelity. The primitive systems of the era produced sound of very low quality unless the performers were stationed <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the cumbersome recording devices (acoustical horns, for the most part), imposing severe limits on the sort of films that could be created with live-recorded sound.|$|E
5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> <b>front.</b> These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E
60|$|The other set {{of wheels}} sounded from the lane Stephen had just traversed. On closer observation, he {{perceived}} {{that they were}} moving from the precincts of the ancient manor-house adjoining the vicarage grounds. A carriage then left the entrance gates of the house, and wheeling round came fully in sight. It was a plain travelling carriage, with a small quantity of luggage, apparently a lady's. The vehicle came to the junction of the four ways half-a-minute before the carrier reached the same spot, and crossed <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> his <b>front,</b> proceeding by the lane on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|In Western culture it is {{traditional}} {{for the man}} to make a proposal to the woman <b>directly</b> while genuflecting <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of her. The ritual often involves the formal asking of the question [...] "Will you marry me, ...?" [...] and the presentation of an engagement ring. It may include him putting the ring on her finger. Sometimes the proposal {{is intended to be}} a surprise.|$|R
25|$|The {{meaning of}} a tree was {{somewhat}} different for different language front ends, and front ends could provide their own tree codes. This was simplified {{with the introduction of}} GENERIC and GIMPLE, two new forms of language-independent trees that were introduced with the advent of GCC 4.0. GENERIC is more complex, based on the GCC 3.x Java front end's intermediate representation. GIMPLE is a simplified GENERIC, in which various constructs are lowered to multiple GIMPLE instructions. The C, C++ and Java front ends produce GENERIC <b>directly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> end. Other front ends instead have different intermediate representations after parsing and convert these to GENERIC.|$|R
