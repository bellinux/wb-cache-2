5|$|Within minutes Calypso {{had also}} veered its cable so that Italienne, now beached, could resume {{fire on the}} British squadron, but the frigate overcompensated and drifted stern-first onto the shore. The British ships {{continued}} their fire until the rapidly <b>falling</b> <b>tide</b> forced them to retire one by one, with Defiance being the last to retire at 12:15. The squadron then returned for one more pass, the final shots fired by Donegal, before Stopford ordered them to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the James River Squadron {{had turned}} its {{attention}} to Minnesota, which had left Fort Monroe {{to join in the}} battle and had run aground. After Virginia had dealt with the surrender of Congress, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her deep draft and the <b>falling</b> <b>tide,</b> however, Virginia was unable to get close enough to be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. Virginia left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell's Point for the night, but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were aground.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the <b>falling</b> <b>tide.</b> The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E

5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As {{no one else could}} see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the <b>falling</b> <b>tide</b> meant that she was out of reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E
25|$|A {{specialised}} vehicle {{intended for}} Sea Lion was the Landwasserschlepper (LWS), an amphibious tractor under development since 1935. It was originally {{intended for use}} by Army engineers to assist with river crossings. Three of them were assigned to Tank Detachment 100 {{as part of the}} invasion; it was intended to use them for pulling ashore unpowered assault barges and towing vehicles across the beaches. They would also have been used to carry supplies directly ashore during the six hours of <b>falling</b> <b>tide</b> when the barges were grounded. This involved towing a Kässbohrer amphibious trailer capable of transporting 10–20 tons of freight behind the LWS. The LWS was demonstrated to General Halder on 2 August 1940 by the Reinhardt Trials Staff on the island of Sylt and, though he was critical of its high silhouette on land, he recognised the overall usefulness of the design. It was proposed to build enough tractors that one or two could be assigned to each invasion barge, but the late date and difficulties in mass-producing the vehicle prevented this.|$|E
500|$|The major {{significance}} of the battle {{is that it was}} the first meeting in combat of ironclad warships, i.e., the [...] and the CSS Virginia. The Confederate fleet consisted of the ironclad ram Virginia (built from the remnants of the USS Merrimack) and several supporting vessels. On the first day of battle, they were opposed by several conventional, wooden-hulled ships of the Union Navy. On that day, Virginia was able to destroy two ships of the Federal flotilla, [...] and , and was about to attack a third, , which had run aground. [...] However, the action was halted by darkness and <b>falling</b> <b>tide,</b> so Virginia retired {{to take care of her}} few wounded—which included her captain, Flag Officer Franklin Buchanan—and repair her minimal battle damage.|$|E

500|$|At 06:30, Hydra {{caught up}} with Pevrieux on the Confiante and began a heavy fire, which the French warship {{returned}} when possible. The exchange continued for 45 minutes until 07:15, when Confiante, having suffered serious damage, drove aground on a sandbank near Beuzeval, a village a short distance {{to the west of}} the mouth of the Dives. As Confiante struck the sandbank, her mainmast collapsed, rending further manoeuvre under hostile fire impossible. Vésuve too drove ashore to avoid the British attack, Lieutenant Lecolier managing to beach his ship within the Dives estuary itself. As the rising tide brought the corvette off the beach, Lecolier made a brief attempt to escape westwards towards Caen, but Trial and Vesuvius were alert and drove Vésuve back to the shore. There the two small British vessels opened up a distant fire on the corvette, as did Hydra to the west against Confiante. At 09:30, the <b>falling</b> <b>tide</b> forced the British ships to retreat off-shore, Laforey gathering his vessels approximately [...] northeast of the beached French convoy.|$|E
2500|$|All beaches {{grow and}} shrink {{depending}} on tides, precipitation, wind, waves and current. Wet beaches tend to lose sand. Waves infiltrate dry beaches easily and deposit sandy sediment. Generally a beach is wet during <b>falling</b> <b>tide,</b> because the sea sinks {{faster than the}} beach drains. As a result, most erosion happens during <b>falling</b> <b>tide.</b> Beach drainage (beach dewatering) using Pressure Equalizing Modules (PEMs) allow the beach to drain more effectively during <b>falling</b> <b>tide.</b> Fewer hours of wet beach translate to less erosion. Permeable PEM tubes inserted vertically into the foreshore connect the different layers of groundwater. The groundwater enters the PEM tube allowing gravity to conduct it to a coarser sand layer, where it can drain more quickly. The PEM modules are placed in a row from the dune to the mean low waterline. Distance between rows is typically [...] but this is project-specific. PEM systems come in different sizes. Modules connect layers with varying hydraulic conductivity. Air/water can enter and equalize pressure.|$|E

2500|$|Tidal {{effects are}} also important; the {{influence}} of a 1m tidal oscillation can be felt as much as 100km from the sea. [...] On an hour-to-hour basis, surges of ice motion can be modulated by tidal activity. [...] During larger spring tides, an ice stream will remain almost stationary for hours at a time, before a surge of around a foot in under an hour, just after the peak high tide; a stationary period then takes hold until another surge towards the middle or end of the <b>falling</b> <b>tide.</b> At neap tides, this interaction is less pronounced, without tides surges would occur more randomly, approximately every 12 hours.|$|E

2500|$|The Severn Estuary {{presented}} a barrier between the Bristol area and South Wales. The estuary has a maximum tidal range of 14.5 metres, {{the second highest}} in the world, and during a rising or <b>falling</b> <b>tide</b> there are strong currents of up to 8knots (4m/s). Much of the estuary is mud flats that are exposed at low tide; these have been designated a Special Protection Area. The {{central part of the}} estuary is a navigable channel which, {{at the site of the}} bridge, is known as [...] "The Shoots". The bridge is upstream from Avonmouth and the Port of Bristol, but downstream from the Port of Sharpness.

40|$|Glacier microseismicity is a {{promising}} tool to study glacier dynamics. However, physical processes connecting seismic signals and ice dynamics are not clearly understood at present. Particularly, {{the relationship between}} tide-modulated seismicity and dynamics of calving glaciers remains elusive. Here we analyze records from an on-ice seismometer placed 250 m from the calving front of Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland. Using high-frequency glacier flow speed measurements, we show that the microseismic activity is related to strain rate variations. The seismic activity correlates with longitudinal stretching measured at the glacier surface. Both higher melt rates and <b>falling</b> <b>tides</b> accelerate glacier motion and increase longitudinal stretching. Long-term microseismic monitoring could therefore provide insights on how a calving glacier's force balance and flow regime react to changes at the ice-ocean interface...|$|R

30|$|These {{processes}} can {{be illustrated}} with {{an example from}} a microtidal (mean tidal range = 1.2 m) low marsh site in coastal Virginia, USA (Christiansen et al. 2000). Peak flow velocities at the site average ~ 0.2 cm/s during rising and <b>falling</b> <b>tides.</b> For tidal amplitudes between 0.95 and 1.05 m (hmax ≈ 0.6 m), average peak suspended sediment concentration entering the marsh platform during flood is 85 mg/L, which decreases by roughly 20 % 3 m into the marsh (Christiansen et al. 2000). This rate of decrease is consistent with an average settling velocity of roughly 0.1 mm/s, the Stoke’s settling rate for particles of ~ 12 μm diameter. Grain size distributions of marsh surface sediment near the marsh edge have a modal size of 15 – 20 μm (Christiansen et al. 2000).|$|R
50|$|The {{size of an}} inlet or estuary is determined, {{according}} to O’Brien by tidal prism. Tidal prism magnitude can be calculated by multiplying {{the area of the}} estuary by the tidal range of that estuary. During spring or <b>fall</b> <b>tides,</b> when sea level is relatively high and floods backbarrier areas that are normally above tidal inundation, the cross sectional area at the entrance of the estuary increases as tidal prism increases. Since tidal prism is largely a function of area of open water and tidal range, it can be changed by alterations of the basin area of estuaries and inlets as in dredging; however, if the estuary or inlet is dredged, or the size changed, the channel will fill in with sediment until it has returned to tidal prism equilibrium.|$|R
