50|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>testation</b> is {{the power}} of a person to make a will and {{testament}} specifying whatever heirs they please. It is historically associated with English common law, and contrasted with forced heirship, where part or all of the estate is automatically inherited by the next of kin. Opponents of abosolute <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>testation</b> have pointed to the possibility of a widow or orphan being left destitute while property of a spouse or parent is bequeathed to others. Some opponents of inheritance tax have characterized it as an abrogation of <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>testation.</b>|$|E

With the adoption of Christian funerary practices, it became common to gift away the dead's part, and after {{the revival of the}} will, and consequently <b>of</b> <b>testation,</b> the dead's part came to be freely disposable.|$|R
