5000|$|The Russell Terrier {{originated}} in England, with Australia being designated country of {{development for the}} breed. The Russell Terrier was developed {{for use in the}} sport of foxhunting, using parallel breeding strains from the Reverend John Russell's original fox working terriers in the early nineteenth century. The Russell Terrier is utilized today as a working terrier. Two distinct breeds evolved with similar standards except for height and proportion, the Russell being shorter in height with a distinctly rectangular shape and the Parsons being taller more square in silhouette. The small size of the Russell breed, 10″ to 12″ tall and rectangular in shape, made them an ideal size to be carried horseback in terrier bags, a requisite for certain terrain. The nose to locate and the voice to bolt the fox was far more important than speed. The Russell Terriers <b>handy</b> <b>size,</b> small flexible chest, short legs, nose, strong voice and fearless nature made them excellent workers below ground bolting fox. Russell Terriers derived from the Reverend Russell's fox working strains, share many characteristics with the Parson Russell Terrier. However, the two breeds are distinctly different in height, body proportions and length of leg, each having been maintained as separate breeds in the US and Europe for many decades. The American Russell Terrier Club registry has maintained the breed since 1995, with full registration at one year of age, requiring a health certificate, evaluated breeding status plus verification of pedigree purity. Breeding lines have been maintained with the intent to exclude infusion of Parson Russell Terrier blood lines as well as other [...] "foreign" [...] terrier blood. The American Russell Terrier Club has the only Foundation stock designated UKC FS [...] Russell Terriers and AKC FSS Russell Terriers being the original founding US registry for the breed. The American Russell Terrier Club submitted the application for inclusion into the AKC FSS being officially accepted by AKC December 8, 2004. The club relinquished their registry to AKC to provide a data base for the Foundation stock for the breed.|$|E

40|$|The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) is {{a widely}} {{recognised}} barometer of dry bulk freight rates. As such, its composition is monitored continuously. In 1993, all <b>handy</b> <b>size</b> trades were expunged from the BFI. This paper tests whether {{the change in the}} composition of the BFI has altered its underlying behaviour. This is achieved by applying a Box-Jenkins methodology to a BFI database covering a period following this pivotal change and comparing the properties of the resulting ARIMA model to those of a model previously estimated by applying the same methodology to data from an earlier period. On the basis of a range of criteria, the two models prove to be remarkably similar and the paper concludes that the behaviour of the BFI has not been radically altered even following this radical revision.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study on the {{uncertainties}} in assessing loading conditions of <b>handy</b> <b>size</b> bulk carriers. Loading conditions and the corresponding hull girder still-water loads are important for the safety of bulk carriers. Unfortunately, statistical studies on this topic remain very few, partly because of the difficulty in fully understanding the impact of loading/unloading operation process and partly because of intrinsic uncertainties in measuring cargo loading conditions data. Three handy-size bulk carriers were investigated and their actual loading conditions, spanning several voyages in 22 months, were collected. Statistical analyses of the collected data resulted in an estimate of the uncertainties in the loading/unloading process. Based on these analyses, probability distribution models for weights in cargo holds, water ballast tanks, fuel tanks as well as consumable tanks are proposed best fitting the collected data; hull girder still water loads statistical distributions are also obtained. It is expected that these analytical models can be used in structural reliability analyses that require the definition of uncertainties of loading conditions and of resulting still water loads...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. The {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to identify the reasoning behind why {{there has been a}} decline in bunker callers to the port of Durban {{at a time when there}} has been an increase in shipping activity and other ports around the world have experienced rapid growth in their bunker markets. It was first necessary to establish that there has been a fall off, what the economic impact of the fall off was and then to analyse the current operational procedure and the strengths and weaknesses of the port. The ports of Singapore and Gibraltar are looked at as they are two ports where bunkering has grown over the period Durban has seen a decline. The SWOT analysis of Durban takes into account the survey that was conducted by IBIA to ascertain what were perceived to be the main factors behind South African ports losing bunker business The type of ship that calls at Durban for bunkering and what is the most common voyage route are identified. It was found to be a <b>handy</b> <b>size</b> ship with the last port of call being a South American port. The cost for the voyage and the port call at Durban are calculated to work out the maximum time the ship should be at Durban from arriving outside to once again sailing. It is found to be twelve hours. The relationships of the parties to the bunker operation are analysed to see where it would be possible to introduce efficiencies to the supply chain and how to reduce the overall port stay to under twelve hours. Over an above this the port costs are reviewed as there are areas where discounting could be introduced to once more encourage owners to call A major stumbling block to the whole process is the unreliability of supply with the port being unable to provide bunkers 11 % of the time. The need to address the stock management problems experienced by the majors is vital to the success of promoting Durban as a bunker port and ways of achieving this are proposed...|$|E

40|$|All {{historic}} dental collections {{share the}} fact that an expansion phase is followed by a utilization phase. However the objects become more important for the dental histo-rian not until they enter the historical phase. This can be demonstrated with Friedrich Carl Ferdinand Busch’s research collec-tion. This research collection comprises special kinds of wall charts that were formed out of more than 7 500 teeth. With regards to content this way gives the opportunity to adept substantial dental theoretical knowledge including significant therapies of the ending 19 th century. This was enough of a reason to choose these teeth wall charts as subject of this underlying dissertation and to prepare them for handing over to the Medical Historical Museum of Berlin and thus conserve the valuable assets. Busch prepared several teeth wall charts of <b>handy</b> <b>size</b> from these extraction objects for lectures. If one considers the average number of teeth on the presently eight original wall charts as well as the overall number of teeth mentioned by Busch it can be assumed that there must have been once more than the 160 wall charts in existence. During reconstruction more than 2 117 teeth could be identified. A major loss has to be noticed with regard to objects with caries. When systemizing anomaly of teeth Busch formed the distinction of the “Mehrfach-gebilde” that is used until present and included also the “Dens in dente” because of histological diagnostics. Busch initiated the cause study of less mineralized remaining teeth and he rightly saw the connection of this with the damage of the primary dentition. Busch diagnosed the osteoclasts as the damaging factor at the resorptive changes. The reason for his studies were the replantations that were often accompanied with painful resorptions. The only acceptable indication for Busch was the tooth conservation at hopeless diagnosis. He did not consider the periodontium that needs to be treated with care. Because of this misjudgment his recommended thera-py gives no starting point for a therapy development. He recognized correctly that deficits in mineralization, caused by children`s illness, is the reason for extensively cariously damaged first molars, if the growth of the root is not finished. Furthermore he asserted that caries with 50 % is the most important reason for extraction. Further research was done by Miller, who developed the chemical-parasitäre theory in 1889. His comparing anatomic studies show results about the detritions of the teeth. He thought that mechanical factors that were increased through chemical influences were of importance. However, it is highly likely that the research results have to be credited to Miller. The tooth discolouring appeared Busch to be important, even so he only presented few discoulered objects. Busch discovered the bleaching effect of hydrogen perox-ide for therapeutic reasons; however, the therapy done today is done according to Miller. Buschs‘ research regarding the healing of the dental pulp and dentine in search for not physiological stimuli resulted in the detection of different formed dentine. It is regretfully, that he did not conclude from his research results to the possibility of pre-servation the vitality of teeth...|$|E
