5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (scavenging), web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the most}} {{significant}} contributor to Kalimpong's economy. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town's residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hopes to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La (pass) in April 2006. Though this has resumed Indo–China border trades, it is expected that Kalimpong will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of revival as a hub for Indo–China trades if the demand of local leaders for reopening of Jelep La pass also is met.|$|E

5|$|After {{his final}} season at Michigan, Robinson {{stated that he}} was open to playing any {{position}} in the National Football League. Some suggested that he would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback, receiver, running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4.35 in the 40 yard dash. CBS Sports' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball. Doug Flutie (Buffalo Bills) and Dieter Brock (Los Angeles Rams) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson. Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that {{a large majority of}} the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%. Solar urticaria may occur in all races but studies monitoring 135 African Americans and 110 Caucasians with photodermatoses found that 2.2% of the African Americans had SU and 8% of the Caucasians had the disease showing that Caucasians <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of getting the disease. Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females {{are more likely to be}} affected than males. The age ranges anywhere from 5–70 years old, but the average age is 35 and cases have been reported with children that are still in infancy. Solar urticaria accounts for less than one percent of the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E

5|$|Raëlians {{believe that}} {{humanity}} {{would be able}} to create life on other planets only if humanity is peaceful enough to stop war. In that case, humanity could travel the distances between stars and create life on another planet. Progress in terraforming, molecular biology, and cloning would enable these teams to create continents and life from scratch. Progress in social engineering would ensure that this creation would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of both surviving and having the potential to understand its creators. Research on how civilization would occur on another planet would allow scientists to decide what traces of their origin should be left behind so that their role in life creation would someday be revealed. The progress achieved by the science teams would ultimately sustain a perpetual chain of life.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} inspection in October 1950 {{reported that it}} would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of attracting assistance from Main Roads. The Mandurah Road Board spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.|$|E
5|$|Common defects of the forelegs include base-wide and base-narrow, {{where the}} legs are farther apart or closer {{together}} on the ground then they are when they originate in the chest; toeing-in and toeing-out, where the hooves point inwards or outwards; knee deviations to the front (buck knees), rear (calf knees), inside (knock knees) or outside (bowleg); short or long pasterns; and many problems with the feet. Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators. Foals raised by humans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> for survival, as there are therapeutic treatments that can improve even major conformation problems. However, some of these conformation problems can be transmitted to offspring, and so these horses are a poor choice for breeding stock.|$|E

5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>chance</b> of surviving. These females also attract more males, {{and are more likely to}} cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E

25|$|The Black hover wasp is a primitively eusocial species. The {{relatedness}} {{of individual}} colony members is comparative to other eusocial insects such as Polistes, bees, and the sphecid.
