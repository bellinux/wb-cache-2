5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally {{have been proven}} to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic {{studies have shown that}} the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.|$|E

5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, would be {{difficult}} to detect due to the strong glare of the nearby Sun, and ground-based searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E
5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. was {{developed}} and published by Atlus for the Virtual Boy, and was released on September 29, 1995 in Japan, and somewhere between late October and November 1995 in North America.

It is a spin-off from Atlus' Megami Tensei series, and the first entry to be released outside Japan. Being a Virtual Boy title, it made use of the system's stereoscopic 3D to display conventional 2D graphics in monochrome red and black visuals, and a graphics technique called parallax scrolling, to create a 3D effect.|$|E

Dean Devlin gave Maggs permission to produce an original version, {{on the condition that}} he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> certain details of the movie's plot, and that the British were not depicted as saving the day. Independence Day UK was set up to be similar to the 1938 radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds - the first 20 minutes were live.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cristobal {{originated}} from a westward-tracking tropical wave which {{emerged from the}} western coast of Africa on August 14, accompanied for several days by an expanse of clouds. Some cyclonic turning was evident as the disturbance approached the Leeward Islands by August 21, but a Hurricane Hunters flight tasked with investigating the system <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> a strong circulation at the surface. The system failed to consolidate as it traversed Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, but on August 23, further reconnaissance data confirmed {{the formation of a}} tropical depression just south of the Caicos Islands. The nascent cyclone slowly moved north-northwestward toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Moderate wind shear in the area kept convection over the depression disorganized and outflow limited, and the storm only gradually intensified. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristobal at 06:00UTC on August24, while located just north of Mayaguana in the Bahamas, but its structure was vertically tilted and suboptimally broad.|$|E

5|$|Kesler {{completed}} the 2009–10 campaign {{with a new}} personal best in points {{for the third consecutive}} season with 75 points (25 goals and 50 assists). With the Sundin's retirement and Demitra being held out of the lineup with injuries, he was moved to his natural center position and joined by wingers Mikael Samuelsson and Mason Raymond. His 26 power play points ranked second on the team to Henrik Sedin. Playing on the second power play unit, he earned many of his points controlling the puck along the half-boards. He also averaged a career-high 19:37 minutes of ice time per game, which ranked second among team forwards to Henrik Sedin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Kesler notched a goal and nine assists in 12 games. After helping the Canucks eliminate the Los Angeles Kings in the first round, he played with a sore shoulder in the second round, as Vancouver were eliminated by the Blackhawks for the second consecutive year. An MRI <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> any serious injury. He admitted following the defeat to not having played his best during the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|On July9, 2013, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coast of Africa. Tracking swiftly westward across the Atlantic, it passed across Central America on July18 and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean shortly thereafter. Early on July21, a broad low-pressure area formed {{in association with}} the wave, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the disturbance for slow development into {{a tropical}} cyclone accordingly. Shower and thunderstorm activity coalesced over the subsequent days, prompting the NHC to increase its chances for development to the high category; despite this, satellite data from early on July24 <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> a well-defined circulation necessary for classification. By that evening, a combination of visible and microwave satellite imagery depicted an improvement of the vortex, and the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 0000UTC on July25, while situated 980miles (1,575km) west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E

Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his division of 4,200 cavalrymen through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and Gillem at Knoxville, Tennessee, where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1,500 men. Stoneman <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after they had departed Knoxville on December 10. On December 12, Stoneman's force flanked and forced back Confederate Brig. Gen. Basil W. Duke's cavalry at Rogersville, Tennessee. Union forces defeated and scattered Confederate troops the next day at Kingsport, Tennessee. There Gillem captured 84 prisoners, including Col. Richard C. Morgan and the brigade's supply train.|$|E

Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had {{up until then}} been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E
5|$|Former Indian player Prabhakaralso {{publicly}} {{claimed that}} Kapil wanted {{to throw away}} a match against Pakistan. Prabhakar's allegations against an unknown team member was not new as he made these allegations to a magazine The Outlook in 1997 based on which BCCI instituted the Chandrachud Inquiry, a one man commission headed by retired Chief Justice of India Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud. Prabhakar <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> names or provide evidence of his charges (match fixing and phone tapping allegation on then cricket manager Ajit Wadekar). When the match fixing controversy resurfaced in 2000, BCCI released the Chandrachud Report to the media. The reaction of the Indian public resulted in PILs and International Cricket Council and the BCCI were called to respond in the Delhi and Calcutta High Courts. In response to the crisis, the Indian government initiated a CBI inquiry on 28 April 2000. Former BCCI President Inderjit Singh Bindra revealed on 4 May 2000 that Prabhakar told him that Kapil asked him to throw away the match. During the ensuing exchanges between various parties, Kapil Dev broke down {{in an interview on}} BBC's Hard Talk with Karan Thapar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>reveal</b> her {{allegiance}} to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels {{out of the}} ring and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty {{out of the ring}}, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.|$|E
