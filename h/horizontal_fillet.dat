2500|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding {{process in which}} the arc is struck beneath a covering layer of granular flux. [...] This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself and, combined {{with the use of a}} continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. [...] Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes since the flux hides the arc and no smoke is produced. [...] The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products. As the arc is not visible, it is typically automated. SAW is only possible in the 1F (flat fillet), 2F (<b>horizontal</b> <b>fillet),</b> and 1G (flat groove) positions.|$|E
50|$|The cathedral was {{designed}} in the Gothic Pointed architectural style. The present structure consists of a nave with double aisles, pseudo-transepts with eastern aisles, and a sanctuary. The nave and aisles are of four bays westward of the cross. The primary aisles are carried to the same height as the nave. The secondary aisles are low, and used for chapels. The wall between the two aisles carries a clerestory. The piers are worked in imitation of palm-trees. On a bold square base, 5 sq ft, is imposed an octagon. On the octagon, there is a circle of deeply cut classicizing mouldings from which rise columns circular in plan. These columns are finely moulded; four bold circular rolls at the cardinal sides; between each are three fluted members. The whole effect combines the Corinthian and Pointed. These columns are banded twice with a very rich and effective moulding, combining a cable, with a row of ball-flowers above it; below, a deeply cut chevron, pointing downwards. These shafts have no capitals; they run up into a <b>horizontal</b> <b>fillet,</b> from which spring plain vaulting ribs, which flow from the shafts as palm-branches do from the trunk. The vaulting is good sexpartite. Between the two aisles are pure pointed arches. The responds to the circular piers,—that is, the responds on the wall between the aisles, into which the vaulting of the primary aisles falls,—are half shafts of ordinary Pointed work, without fillets, and of five foliaged heads; the caps of the aisle vaulting are also foliaged. The western responds to the circular shafts are also ordinary Pointed. It is plain, therefore, that the architect could only trust to his palmary development in the isolated shafts. This is the old work: the church being left unfinished in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the second}} half of the 15th century, Stockholm was being {{transformed}} into a city built in stone and the Scales House present in Vädersolstavlan, a painting depicting an event in 1535 and the oldest known colour image of the city, was probably built in the 1460s, an assumption confirmed both by historical records and dendrochronological samples. It is depicted as a one-storey brick building with a stepped gable and white blind windows, a crane hanging over the round arched portal facing the square. A clock was added in the mid-16th century together with a shed for foreign merchants to keep their goods. As two stories were added to the Scales House in 1596-1603, the shed was enlarged into a warehouse and the entire structure transformed into a Renaissance building furnished with an elaborated stone portal, <b>horizontal</b> sandstone <b>fillets,</b> volutes and finials, and a ridge turret covered in copper. Stone tables on the front gable were painted in blue and furnished with gilded crowns and the inscription [...] "1603". One of these can still be found in the entrance facing Skeppsbron.|$|R
40|$|Gilt edges. Full brown morocco grain. Marbled {{endpapers}} and pastedowns. Front cover blocked {{in black}} and back cover blocked identically in reverse. A thin double fillet is blocked on the border. Within the rectangle it forms is a smaller double fillet forming an inner border. The horizontal and vertical sides of the inner border run on into the outer border to form a central rectangle with two narrower oblong vertical panels at either side and oblong panels at the head and foot which intersect at the corners to form small squares. The central panel is blank except for a fillet which continuously follows {{the inside of the}} panel border in a pattern alternately urdy and nebuly. Within the nebulas is a repeated pattern of a blocked oval and within the 'pointed battlements' is a repeated pattern of three blocked dots. The border fillet of the central panel extends in all four directions into each of the adjoining side, upper and lower panels to create a narrower panel, each of which is decorated by a repeating pattern of blocked circles. From the upper and lower narrower panel, one at each end, two more double vertical fillets extend to the cover edge. The right hand narrower panel also has two double fillets extending to the cover edge. The left-hand narrower panel has four equidistant imitation spine-cover clasps which extend to the spine. In each of the four corner squares is a floral arabesque blocked in black. The spine is blocked {{in black and}} gold. At the head and tail thin double <b>horizontal</b> <b>fillets</b> are blocked in black. Above the tail fillets a second double fillet creates a panel in which the word '| ILLUSTRATED |' is blocked in gold.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The major {{consideration}} {{of this study}} was the testing of the superiority of the whole or part method for developing basic arc welding skills. Data were also generated which facilitated investigation of: (1) the relationship of welding skill development to cognitive attainment of welding information as measured by welding proficiency posttest scores and written test scores, respectively; (2) a comparison of skill development among three levels of students grouped according to welding proficiency pretest scores; and (3) a comparison of welding skill development of students in separated and mixed (whole or part method) welding sections. Fifty-five students comprised the population for this study. Subjects were selected from beginning welding students enrolled in day or evening programs at Everett Community College during the Fall and Winter quarters of the 1971 - 72 school year. Students selected for participation were programmed through a 15 -hour practice session running flat and overlapping flat beads. Students were tested and paired according to similarity of welding proficiency pre-test scores. Pairs were split or arbitrarily assigned to the whole or part method of learning. Four welding sections were homogeneous; that is, contained only whole- or part-method students. All other welding sections were heterogeneous; that is, both whole- and part-method students learning together. Three welding positions, horizontal, vertical, and overhead, were selected as the learning elements used to test the whole versus part method of learning. That concept was implemented by assigning students to one of two sequences. Whole-method, experimental students practiced a total of 45 hours. The welding practice sessions were divided into three equal parts, time-wise. Each student practiced one-third of each session on <b>horizontal</b> <b>fillet</b> welds, one-third on vertical fillet welds, and one-third on overhead fillet welds. This schedule was followed until 45 hours of practice were completed. Part-method, control students utilized the following sequence: (1) fifteen hours of welding practice on <b>horizontal</b> <b>fillet</b> welds, then (2) 15 hours of welding practice on vertical fillet welds, and finally (3) 15 hours of welding practice on overhead fillet welds. Upon completion of a 45 -hour practice schedule, all students made fillet weld test plates in the three positions and were tested on the cognitive aspects of welding which were judged relevant. The welding proficiency and cognitive test scores provided the data for the statistical test of each of the hypotheses. Within the limits of this study, the following conclusions are evident concerning the hypotheses: 1. Whole (experimental) and part (control) method students demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the level of welding proficiency. 2. Students who scored highest on the pre-test demonstrated statistically significant higher welding proficiency post-test scores than students who scored lowest on the pre-test. 3. Whole-method students in mixed classes demonstrated statistically higher welding proficiency post-test scores than their counterparts in segregated classes. 4. There was practically no linear relationship or commonality between welding proficiency post-test scores and cognitive test scores...|$|E

Binder's ticket {{on lower}} pastedown: '| BOUND | BY | LEIGHTON | SON AND | HODGE |'. Front cover is blocked {{in black and}} gold. Back cover is blocked in blind with the identical design. On the outermost borders of front cover are two continuous fillets blocked in black, the inner fillet being in a dogtooth pattern, the outer plain. Inside this there is a double fillet rectangular border blocked in gold, crossed by two additional horizontal double fillets of identical pattern to create outer rectangular panels and a central square panel. Within the double fillets there is a repeating pattern of dots within circles blocked in gold. At corner intersections of these double fillets and at the centre-point between the intersections there are squares blocked in black. At {{each of the four}} corners is a quatrefoil consisting of a border blocked in gold and black surrounding a central onlay of blue paper. The quatrefoils contain Greek characters as follows: top left and bottom left:'|ΙΣ|'; top right and bottom right: '|ΧΣ|'. The upper rectangular panel contains the words: '| THE SERMON |' blocked in gold; the lower rectangular panel: '| ON THE MOUNT |'. The square central panel contains an elaborate cross formy the terminations of whose arms, head and foot are invected. Its centerpiece is an eight-petalled flower shape of pale blue paper onlay, surrounded by two fillets of the same shape blocked in gold, between which is a repeating pattern of dots blocked in gold on a red background. At the centre of the blue flower motif is a disc bordered by interpenetrating dentellated circles the outer blocked in gold, the inner in black, both bordered by a circle in red. The inner disc contains a representation of the paschal lamb nimbused and carrying a staff ending in a cross at the head of which is a white pennon charged with a red cross. On the each of the petals of the blue flower appears a Greek character blocked in gold in the following sequence clockwise from the topmost petal: '|Α|Χ|Ρ|Σ|Ω|Ι|Η|Σ|' The arms of the cross consist of an inner portion onlaid in red and an outer portion onlaid in blue. Along the length of each extends a heraldic red rose with leaves of green outlined in gold blocking and a stem blocked in gold. Between the arms of the cross and its upright extend diagonally towards each corner of the square panel four lilies each with four green onlay leaves outlined in gold blocking and with flower and stem blocked in gold.
