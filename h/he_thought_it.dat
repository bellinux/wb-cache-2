5|$|From Russia, with Love is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; at the time <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Nansen {{passed his}} {{university}} entrance examination, the examen artium. He decided to study zoology, claiming {{later that he}} chose the subject because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> offered {{the chance of a}} life in the open air. He began his studies at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania early in 1881.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 book, The Three Americas, Widney {{said that}} Atlantis {{was in the}} area where the Bahamas are located. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a semi-tropical island, {{inhabited}} by peoples from the Americas rather than from Europe. He also believed that there was a submerged lost continent in the South Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} was {{produced}} by the ABC Studios in association with The Mark Gordon Company and Random Acts Productions. Safran, Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Jake Coburn served as the executive producers. The show was designed to have a flashback narrative, shifting between two timelines. Safran incorporated the flashforward storytelling technique as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> allowed them to spread out the plot points.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would provide {{a link to the}} past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was comfortable with the decision as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E
5|$|In his memoirs, Diefenbaker did {{not mention}} the elder Atherton's initial {{approach}} but wrote that he was in Australia at a parliamentary conference {{at the time of the}} Canoe River crash. An Australian lawyer pointed out the case to Diefenbaker; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> interesting but noted that he was not a member of the Law Society of British Columbia. Diefenbaker wrote that he planned to meet Edna in Hawaii on his way back from Australia. Instead she wired him, requesting that he meet her in Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was {{dominated}} by adjoining utility buildings, which were linked to it by high-level walkways. Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only {{one of which was}} subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> important for the design to centre around the building that houses the information about the atomic explosion.|$|E

5|$|Ingels {{was born}} in Copenhagen in 1974 to an {{engineer}} father and a dentist mother. Hoping to become a cartoonist, he began to study architecture in 1993 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would help him to improve his drawing skills. Only {{after he had been}} studying for a couple of years, did he really take an interest in architecture. He continued his studies at the Escola Tècnica Superior d'Arquitectura in Barcelona, and returned to Copenhagen to receive his diploma in 1999. As a third-year student in Barcelona, he set up his first practice and won his first competition.|$|E
5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|Keyser and de Houtman {{assigned}} {{twelve stars}} to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, {{but did not}} assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally been placed in Microscopium. Conversely, Gould dropped Lacaille's Sigma as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was too dim.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed {{that he would not}} be required to establish a base there if <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, {{he wanted to show}} the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E

5|$|Botha, who {{had been}} asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to be unfair to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> authentic.|$|E
