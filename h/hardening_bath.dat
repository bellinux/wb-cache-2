50|$|In {{some old}} processes, the film {{emulsion}} was hardened during the process, typically before the bleach. Such a <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> often used aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. In modern processing, these hardening steps are unnecessary because the film emulsion is sufficiently hardened {{to withstand the}} processing chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|Liquids are {{encapsulated}} using {{a rotating}} extrusion head containing concentric nozzles. In this process, a jet of core liquid {{is surrounded by}} a sheath of wall solution or melt. As the jet moves through the air it breaks, owing to Rayleigh instability, into droplets of core, each coated with the wall solution. While the droplets are in flight, the molten wall may be hardened or a solvent may be evaporated from the wall solution. Since most of the droplets are within ± 10% of the mean diameter, they land in a narrow ring around the spray nozzle. Hence, if needed, the capsules can be hardened after formation by catching them in a ring-shaped <b>hardening</b> <b>bath.</b> This process is excellent for forming particles [...] in diameter. Since the drops are formed by the breakup of a liquid jet, the process is only suitable for liquid or slurries. A high production can be achieved, up to 22.5 kg of microcapsules can be produced per nozzle per hour.|$|E
40|$|Lipid-based (LB) {{formulations}} are versatile {{systems that}} can solubilise poorly water-soluble drugs, but also work as dispersing medium for hydrophilic formulation components. Dispersed particles can consist of more complex structures. Interesting is the dispersion of water-based microgels in LB systems to create hydrophilic compartments within a non-aqueous medium, suitable for direct capsule filling. Such systems represent a suitable milieu for protein microencapsulation to ensure protection from degradation of these macromolecules. In fact, while oral macromolecule delivery is a thriving topic in modern pharmaceutics, the first {{challenge is to}} achieve a stable drug product throughout manufacturing. Owing to the structured and complex nature of such system, a thorough characterisation is needed to gain adequate understanding of the system. Identification of critical material attributes and process parameters is key {{in the framework of}} the Quality-by-Design (QbD) initiative. The purpose of this thesis is to formulate novel LB systems suitable for capsule filling that allow oral delivery of proteins and small molecules. The present thesis consists of four studies. The first two introduce new manufacturing approaches for protein microencapsulation using LB systems as carrying medium for oral delivery. The third and fourth studies address manufacturing criticalities of LB systems using macromolecules and small molecules as active ingredients, respectively. A special focus is kept on the development aspects of these systems by using statistical methods to design quality into the novel drugs delivery formulations. The first study focused on the feasibility of protein microencapsulation by prilling into a LB <b>hardening</b> <b>bath.</b> Here, prilling was applied by dropping a protein-containing polymeric solution into a LB <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> where cross-linking occurred. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and a chitosan derivate were used as a model protein and a polyfunctional gel-forming polymer, respectively. The <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> was loaded with calcium ions to allow ionotropic gelling of the polymer. Particle morphology and size were dependent on the LB <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> used. The microgels had high protein encapsulation efficiency and were able to rapidly release their content during in vitro dissolution testing. Additionally, the model protein remained unscathed throughout the entire manufacturing process and during preliminary stability studies in the LB hardening baths. Overall this approach demonstrated the technical viability of LB systems to act as <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> for the prilling process and simultaneously as dispersing medium for the thereby formed microgels to achieve liquid capsule filling. The second study focused on improving the previously introduced LB drug delivery systems (DDS). The aim was to achieve a multi-compartmental system composed of protein-containing nanotubes embedded into the microgels obtained by prilling. To increase protein loading by better fitting the large model protein, i. e., BSA, the nanotubes’ lumen was chemically enlarged. The obtained Nanoparticles-in-Microsphere Oral System (NiMOS) showed hardening bath-dependent morphology and good protein entrapment efficiency. Protein stability during the process was confirmed. Furthermore, the proposed NiMOS demonstrated protection from enzymatic degradation after preliminary in vitro testing. Also, the multi-compartmental structure extended the protein release profile. This study showed the feasibility of this flexible multi-compartment system for oral protein delivery. The third study investigated systematically LB formulations as hardening baths for prilling using Design of Experiments (DoE). Over 880 formulations were screened with respect to miscibility, counter-ion solubility, and droplet gelling by using 60 ternary phase diagrams comprising two co-solvents, ten different glycerides, and three so-called complementary excipients. Soft and hard capsules were filled with 245 selected <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> formulations for a preliminary compatibility assessment. The ternary phase diagrams’ centre points were statistically evaluated to understand the formulation effect on microgel morphology, protein encapsulation efficiency, and protein stability. The large datasets were analysed by means of partial least squares (PLS) regression to correlate the formulation and experimental factors with the chosen response variables. This work generated an improved understanding for this type of LB systems. Finally, a fourth study introduced novel tools within the QbD initiative to evaluate complex LB dispersions such as highly concentrated suspensions. The surface energy of the particles intended for suspension was profiled using inverse gas chromatography to understand the heterogeneity in energy distribution. This was correlated to different inter-batch rheological properties at higher solid fractions after LB suspension manufacturing. A mathematical model was then used to predict experimental viscosity values as a function of suspended solid fraction. The agglomeration patterns of the manufactured suspensions were interpreted using the fractal concept of flocculation. This concept as well as the surface energy profiling showed great potential for designing quality into concentrated pharmaceutical suspensions. This thesis introduced new complex LB systems suitable for oral delivery of proteins and small molecules. Novel formulations approaches have been investigated and developed within a QbD framework. A particular emphasis was on microgel dispersions in lipids for oral (local) protein delivery. The technical viability of this delivery approach was demonstrated on the level of manufacturing and in vitro release testing. Future research may include in vivo studies to understand and improve the biopharmaceutical performance of the proposed LB DDS, as well as a thorough mechanistic investigation for these complex LB formulations...|$|E

40|$|A noncyanide gold bath is {{used for}} plating {{components}} that require an electrically conductive hard surface with a high coefficient of friction. The arsenic <b>hardened</b> gold <b>bath</b> used, has the required properties when fresh with a concentration of Au of 12. 3 g/L. As the bath ages, the hardness, {{as well as the}} coefficient of friction, decrease. With the expense of gold, it is necessary to mitigate this decrease and get the preferred properties throughout the bath life. Mitigation begins by analyzing the bath as it ages and determining the changes in crystallographic orientation and grain size. These can then be correlated to the declining hardness and coefficient of friction. Nucleation modeling was performed to analyze the applied potential’s effect on the crystallographi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSalt <b>bath</b> <b>hardening</b> at low {{temperature}} was applied {{in order to}} enhance the surface hardness of AISI 201 stainless steel. The structure and properties of the hardened layer were investigated, such as microstructure, hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance. The experiment results show that the treatment temperature plays an importance role in the microstructure and properties of the hardened layer. If the treatment temperature is below 460 °C, the hardened layer was a face centre tetragonal (fct) structure without chromium nitride precipitation. The corrosion resistance of hardened layer is better than the matrix and as good as AISI 316 austenitic stainless steel. If the temperature rises above 460 °C the precipitation show up and the corrosion resistance gets worse. The hardness and thickness of the layer increase as the raising of treatment temperature. The test of wear resistance shows that the amount of wear reduces rapidly after hardening treatment and the worn morphology of the surface behaves abrasive wear while that of AISI 201 stainless steel behaves adhesive wear...|$|R
40|$|Silver halide {{sensitized}} gelatin (SHSG) is {{an interesting}} technique {{for the production of}} holographic optical elements. It combines the high sensitivity of photographic emulsions with the well-known low scattering and high diffraction efficiency corresponding to dichromated gelatin. In this paper we describe SHSG holograms recorded on Slavich PFG- 01 emulsions. We will show that real high diffraction efficiencies can be obtained (as high as 93 % allowing for reflections) when using this material for recording phase transmission holograms. The influence of the bleach bath temperature and a <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> in the processing was studied and the procedure was optimized for these two parameters. Our investigations reveal that PFG- 01 emulsion is not only a substitute for Agfa material, but also offers better results, at a moment in which Agfa has stopped its production of holographic material. This study was supported by the "Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología" (CICYT) of Spain under project no. MAT 97 - 0705 -C 02 - 02...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{describes}} {{preliminary results}} {{on the development of}} a batch lab-scale co-extrusion device for the production of alginate beads as carrier for hydrophilic compounds. A dual jet of liquid core (aqueous solution of glucose or vitamin B 12 or olive oil) and liquid shell material (aqueous solution of alginates differing for guluronic to mannuronic ratio) was pumped through concentric extrusion nozzles and droplets were formed by means of a rotating fluid jet cutter. The shell of the bead was then hardened in the <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> containing a calcium chloride solution. Optimization of the co-extrusion plant accounts for the management of the operative conditions within the hardening unit (incubation time, molarity of the gelling agent), and for the control of the surface-tension-driven breakup of laminar jets which was managed by varying the jet cutter - hardening unit distance. Beads enriched in vitamin B 12, that were formed according to the best plant set-up, were tested for the bioactive release when stressed under thermal conditions simulating typical dairy products processes. Cyanocobalamin was retained at all...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} holographic filters in solar spectrum splitting applications. Photovoltaic (PV) systems utilizing spectrum splitting have higher theoretical conversion efficiency than single bandgap cell modules. Dichroic band-rejection filters {{have been used for}} spectrum splitting applications with some success however these filters are limited to spectral control at fixed reflection angles. Reflection holographic filters are fabricated by recording interference pattern of two coherent beams at arbitrary construction angles. This feature can be used to control the angles over which spectral selectivity is obtained. In addition focusing wavefronts {{can also be used to}} increase functionality in the filter. Holograms fabricated in dichromated gelatin (DCG) have the benefit of light weight, low scattering and absorption losses. In addition, reflection holograms recorded in the Lippmann configuration have been shown to produce strong chirping as a result of wet processing. Chirping broadens the filter rejection bandwidth both spectrally and angularly. It can be tuned to achieve spectral bandwidth suitable for spectrum splitting applications. We explore different DCG film fabrication and processing parameters to improve the optical performance of the filter. The diffraction efficiency bandwidth and scattering losses are optimized by changing the exposure energy, isopropanol dehydration bath temperature and <b>hardening</b> <b>bath</b> duration. A holographic spectrum-splitting PV module is proposed with Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and silicon (Si) PV cells with efficiency of 25. 1 % and 19. 7 % respectively. The calculated conversion efficiency with a prototype hologram is 27. 94 % which is 93. 94 % compared to the ideal spectrum-splitting efficiency of 29. 74 %...|$|E
