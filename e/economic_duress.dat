2500|$|While {{the law on}} {{disclosure}} and misrepresentation aims to make contracting parties informed (or not disinformed), the law also says agreements may be avoided when, in a very general sense, a person's free will was impaired. Complete exercise of [...] "free will" [...] is rare for most people, because they make choices within a constrained range of alternatives. The law still holds people to nearly all contracts (if consumer, employment, tenancy, etc. legislation is not activated) except where someone was under duress, unduly influenced or exploited while in a vulnerable position. Like misrepresentation, the victim may avoid the contract, and the parties restore their property to reverse unjust enrichment, subject to the victim's claim for damages, so long as none of the four equitable bars to rescission lie (i.e. no excessive lapse of time, affirmation of the contract, intervention of an innocent third party's rights and counter-restitution is possible). The most straight forward claim, for duress, involves illegitimate threats. The common law long allowed a claim if duress was of a physical nature. So long as a threat {{is just one of}} the reasons a person enters an agreement, even if not the main reason, the agreement may be avoided. Only late in the 20th century was escape allowed if the threat involved illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always [...] "illegitimate" [...] if it is to do an unlawful act, such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push someone out of business. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao on v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal, aimed at selling their company's building, unless the Lau family agreed to change a part of the proposed agreement to guarantee the Paos would receive rises in the swapped shares' prices on repurchase. The Laus signed the guarantee agreement after this threat, and then claimed it was not binding. But the Privy Council advised their signature was only a result of [...] "commercial pressure", not <b>economic</b> <b>duress.</b> The Laus' considered the situation before signing, and did not behave like someone under duress, so there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a vulnerable person. An obvious case involving [...] "lawful act duress" [...] is blackmail. The blackmailer has to justify, not doing the lawful act they threaten, but against a person highly vulnerable to them, the demand of money.|$|E

2500|$|When a {{contract}} is formed, good consideration is needed, {{and so a}} gratuitous promise is not binding. That said, while consideration must be of sufficient value in the law's eyes, it need not reflect an adequate price. Proverbially, one may sell a house {{for as little as}} a peppercorn, even if the seller [...] "does not like pepper and will throw away the corn." [...] This means the courts do not generally enquire into the fairness of the exchange, unless there is statutory regulation or (in specific contexts such as for consumers, employment, or tenancies) there are two parties of unequal bargaining power. Another difficulty is that consideration for a deal was said not to exist if the thing given was an act done before the promise, such as promising to pay off a loan for money already used to educate a girl. In this situation the courts have long shown themselves willing to hold that the thing done was implicitly relying on the expectation of a reward. More significant problems arise where parties to {{a contract}} wish to vary its terms. The old rule, predating the development of the protections in the law of <b>economic</b> <b>duress,</b> was that if one side merely promises to perform a duty which she had already undertaken in return for a higher price, there is no contract. However, in the leading case of Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd, the Court of Appeal held that it would be more ready to construe someone performing essentially what they were bound to do before as giving consideration for the new deal if they conferred a [...] "practical benefit" [...] on the other side. So, when Williams, a carpenter, was promised by Roffey Bros, the builders, more money to complete work on time, it was held that because Roffey Bros would avoid having to pay a penalty clause for late completion of its own contract, would potentially avoid the expense of litigation and had a slightly more sensible mechanism for payments, these were enough. Speaking of consideration, Russell LJ stated that, [...] "courts nowadays should be more ready to find its existence... where the bargaining powers are not unequal and where the finding of consideration reflects the true intention of the parties." [...] In other words, in the context of contractual variations, the definition of consideration has been watered down. However, in one situation the [...] "practical benefit" [...] analysis cannot be invoked, namely where the agreed variation is to reduce debt repayments. In Foakes v Beer, the House of Lords held that even though Mrs Beer promised Mr Foakes he could pay back £2090 19s by instalment and without interest, she could subsequently change her mind and demand the whole sum. Despite Lord Blackburn registering a note of dissent in that case and other doubts, the Court of Appeal held in Re Selectmove Ltd, that it was bound by the precedent of the Lords and could not deploy the [...] "practical benefit" [...] reasoning of Williams for any debt repayment cases.|$|E

That the requirements were so strict is to be expected - if the requirements were not so strict you might have parties arguing, for example, that they had been forced to enter a loan because they were poor (<b>economic</b> <b>duress.)</b> Dolus was included in metus, but since metus was enforceable against a third party whilst dolus was not, metus was a better defence to use (D.44.4.4.33.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{commentators}} {{say that}} {{the decision by the}} judge not to award the money to the plaintiffs was based at least partly on public policy; should he have done so it would have created precedent that would risk crew members blackmailing captains into giving them more money.

In Hartley v Ponsonby it was held that where a remaining crew were required to do something extra, beyond the scope of their contracts (which unlike in Stilk did not require performance in all emergencies) that the promise of extra pay could be enforced. Another exception to the rule that performing a pre-existing contractual duty is not valid consideration for a new agreement was created in Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd 1991 1 QB 1 which decided that in such situations the court will be quick to find consideration, if [...] "practical benefits" [...] are given from one to another party.

The concept of duress in general was explained by the Supreme Court of Appeal as follows: ‘in general terms, an undertaking that is extracted by an unlawful or unconscionable threat of some considerable harm, is voidable’ (para 6). Since the harm threatened in Medscheme was economic harm, the Supreme Court of Appeal had to consider whether a threat of economic harm could ever amount to duress in our law. <b>Economic</b> <b>duress</b> (or business compulsion) may broadly be described as imposition, oppression or taking undue advantage of the business or financial stress or extreme necessity or weakness of another (Lafayette Dramatic Productions Inc v Ferentz 9 NW 2 d 57 (1943); Hackley v Headley 8 NW 511 (1881)). To put it differently, <b>economic</b> <b>duress</b> is constituted by illegitimate commercial pressure exerted on a party to a contract, which induces him to enter into the contract, and which amounts to a coercion of the will which vitiates his consent (see Occidental Worldwide Investment Corporation v Skibs A/S Avanti [1976] 1 Lloyds Rep 293 at 335; North Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Hyundai Construction Co Ltd [1979] AC 704; Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614 at 635 – 6; Universe Tankships Inc of Monrovia v International Transport Workers’ Federation [1982] 2 All ER 67 (HL) at 75 – 6, 88 – 9; Alec Lobb (Garages) Ltd v Total Oil GB Ltd [1983] 1 All ER 944 (Ch) at 960).
