5|$|Much {{is written}} about the {{different}} factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human <b>foot</b> <b>traffic.</b> Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|The station {{closed in}} 1940 (along with nearby Marlborough Street Magistrates Court) to be {{replaced}} with an integrated West End Central Police Station at Savile Row, with the street being renamed Piccadilly Place. A subsequent rise in <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> around the area, and associated crime, led to the station being re-opened in 1966, with the street being renamed back to Vine Street in 1972. The police station closed in 1997 and the building was demolished in 2005 for redevelopment.|$|E
50|$|The bridge, {{known as}} the Tamsui Wooden Bridge (淡水木橋; Dànshuǐ Mùqiáo; Tām-súi-bo̍k-kiô), was a (1498 chi) wooden {{structure}} designed to carry only rail <b>traffic.</b> <b>Foot</b> and horse <b>traffic</b> could also cross on paths {{on either side of}} the rail. However, the bridge's wood pilings required frequent repair due to periodic flooding, and an August 1897 typhoon seriously damaged the bridge.|$|R
25|$|In Michigan, it {{is illegal}} to flash high beams within 500 <b>feet</b> of {{oncoming}} <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{trail to}} Bear Lake was reopened in March 2008 to <b>foot</b> and bicycle <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
5|$|After {{ownership}} of the Meridian Main Street {{was transferred to the}} Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{improvements}} {{continued in}} the 1990s. A five-mile (8km) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant treatment {{was added to the}} areas that receive no sun in the winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen. At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen, a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.|$|E
25|$|In {{at least}} one instance, {{emergency}} medical workers were forced to leave their ambulance and respond on <b>foot</b> because <b>traffic</b> congestion was so heavy. Emergency responders were delayed nearly one hour in rendering assistance to a man experiencing chest pains.|$|R
50|$|Westbound I-44 {{northeast}} of Tulsa {{was affected by}} a sinkhole found on June 2, 2010. According to the local news, the sinkhole measured 12 feet wide and 24 <b>feet</b> long. <b>Traffic</b> was only affected {{for a short period}} of time and the roadway has since been reopened.|$|R
50|$|The runways are {{watched over}} by a 227 <b>foot</b> tall air <b>traffic</b> control tower. The tower {{formerly}} used by the Air Force has been demolished.|$|R
5|$|Later in the year, the SER {{secretary}} Samuel Smiles {{looked for}} potential routes and decided the best location {{would be on}} the site of the former Hungerford Market adjacent to The Strand, and that the line should be directly connected to Waterloo, allowing a link with London and South Western Railway services. The Charing Cross Railway Company was formed in 1859 in order to build the extension, and the SER paid £300,000 (now £) in capital to help build this. The line towards Charing Cross was expensive to build as it traversed a heavily built-up area, which was exacerbated in 1862 when the company chose to upgrade the two running lines to three, and doubled the capacity over the bridge to four tracks. The bridge replaced the original suspension bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel which opened in 1845. Work began in June 1860 and took around three years. The old suspension bridge remained open until the new bridge was suitable to carry <b>foot</b> <b>traffic.</b> A trial run over the new line took place on 1 December 1863.|$|E
25|$|A new {{cafeteria}} and hallway replaced much of {{the original}} HSE High School courtyard {{in the summer of}} 2010. The addition was part of a $1.5 million project to combat overcrowding and help ease <b>foot</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{they are}} floor coverings, ledger stones are {{vulnerable}} to wear from <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> and damage from structural alterations to churches. The Ledgerstones Survey of England & Wales exists to record {{the information on the}} stones before it is lost.|$|E

50|$|In the 1850s Chicago {{was growing}} rapidly and local {{transportation}} was a problem. Flat and low, drainage was {{poor and the}} roads were often muddy and near impassible for <b>foot</b> and horse <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{closure of}} Potomac {{negatively}} impacted <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> at Washington Harbour, causing economic distress for other retailers. In December, Washington Harbour Associates asked a federal bankruptcy court to release Potomac from its lease, {{so that the}} complex could rent out to the space to another tenant.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, several {{attempts}} at the macro-scale {{application of the}} piezoelectric technology have emerged to harvest kinetic energy from walking pedestrians. The piezoelectric floors have been trialed {{since the beginning of}} 2007 in two Japanese train stations, Tokyo and Shibuya stations. The electricity generated from the <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> is used to provide all the electricity needed to run the automatic ticket gates and electronic display systems. In London, a famous nightclub exploited the piezoelectric technology in its dance floor. Parts of the lighting and sound systems in the club can be powered by the energy harvesting tiles. However, the piezoelectric tile deployed on the ground usually harvests energy from low frequency strikes provided by the <b>foot</b> <b>traffic.</b> This working condition may eventually lead to low power generation efficiency.|$|E
25|$|In North America, heavy rail {{can also}} refer to rapid transit, when {{referring}} to systems with heavier passenger loadings than light rail systems, but distinct from commuter rail and intercity rail systems. It is characterized by high-speed, passenger rail cars running in separate rights-of-way from which all other vehicular and <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> are excluded.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a 19-seat Beechcraft 1900D twin-engined turboprop airliner; it was thirteen {{years old and}} registered in Nepal as 9N-AEK. Initial investigations revealed that the {{aircraft was}} being operated under VFR (Visual Flight Rules); and two minutes before {{it was due to}} land it entered clouds and crashed at 5400 <b>feet.</b> Air <b>traffic</b> controllers and members of the investigation team claim the reason for the crash was pilot error.|$|R
50|$|There are two routes, one for southeast-bound {{traffic and}} one for northwest-bound traffic. Both follow the 132° radial of the Santa Monica VOR between the Santa Monica Airport and the {{intersection}} of Interstate 405 and Imperial Highway. Southeast-bound traffic flies at 3,500 <b>feet.</b> Northwest-bound <b>traffic</b> flies at 4,500 feet. Despite being in the Class B airspace, aircraft following the rules of this corridor need not communicate with ATC.|$|R
25|$|A {{temporary}} {{gravel road}} is {{constructed in the}} northeast quadrant of the Ellipse each year to give workers access to the tree for decoration. A wooden snow fence is installed near the tree and around the Pageant of Peace area each year as well to protect the lawn during periods of high <b>foot</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the dam's {{reconstruction}} in 1926, {{workers and}} local people {{were permitted to}} walk {{across the top of}} the dam as a means of getting to work and school. For security reasons, the Montana Power Company closed the dam to such <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> during World War II and never allowed it to resume afterward.|$|E
25|$|A {{rapid transit}} system is an {{electric}} railway characterized by high speed and rapid acceleration. It uses passenger railcars operating singly or in multiple unit trains on fixed rails. It operates on separate rights-of-way {{from which all}} other vehicular and <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> are excluded (i.e. is fully grade separated from other traffic). It uses sophisticated signaling systems, and high platform loading.|$|E
5000|$|Horseback Riding and Equestrian Camping - The 15 mi Orange Trail (or Horse Trail) is {{dedicated}} to equestrian use, with <b>foot</b> and bike <b>traffic</b> unpermitted. The park offers guided horseback rides as well. A 12-site equestrian campground was opened in 2011.|$|R
50|$|The society {{lies in the}} Airport Police Station area. At {{the south}} and east entrances, there are several PIA {{township}} security guards who inspect and surveil <b>foot</b> or auto <b>traffic</b> coming {{in and out of the}} society for the security of the township.|$|R
5000|$|Departure leg, Initial, or Climb out. The {{climbing}} flight path along the extended runway centerline which begins at takeoff {{and continues to}} at least 1/2 mile beyond the runway's departure end and not less than 300 <b>feet</b> below the <b>traffic</b> pattern altitude.|$|R
25|$|Store owners’ {{complaints}} concerning upkeep are {{countered by}} {{the argument that}} it increases <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> and business. Debrorah Holley, administrator of the Downtown Business Improvement Association, admits that despite the obvious problems it causes, it is nonetheless a landmark. The alley attracts tourists to the downtown, in such large numbers that {{there used to be}} a local radio station disc jockey that led people on bimonthly tours of the gum alley gallery.|$|E
25|$|On June 21, 2011, the New York Times {{reported}} that the project would be largely complete by late 2013. The developers were pursuing high-end retailers like Apple Inc. to lease space in the development. They were not, however, willing to allow banks to lease space, because they had low <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> and were not open at night, although other reports contend this decision was made primarily to satisfy Qatari Diar’s requirement of adherence to Sharia, or Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|Instead, it {{recommends}} {{building on}} the existing clusters of restaurants and home-furnishings stores. Two businesses in each, Doca's Portuguese restaurant and Melita's respectively, draw customers {{from all over the}} county. Other regional chainlets could be drawn to Ossining. Restaurants in particular could see more ethnic diversity, widening the existing focus on Latin fare. The plan also recommends both improving cultural offerings downtown, and promoting more residential and office use to increase <b>foot</b> <b>traffic</b> around the clock.|$|E
50|$|Chouteau Island is {{accessed}} by car only from Illinois via the Canal Bridge, a two-lane vehicular bridge that crosses the Chain of Rocks Canal. From Missouri, visitors may reach the Island by <b>foot</b> or bicycle <b>traffic</b> via U.S. Route 66's Old Chain of Rocks Bridge.|$|R
50|$|In the 1830s, East Bridgeport {{was still}} largely {{farmland}} but {{the construction of}} <b>foot</b> and general <b>traffic</b> bridges over the Pequonnock in the 1840s and 1850s opened the area to development {{and it was not}} long before the area became a major area for industry.|$|R
