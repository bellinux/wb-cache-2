The k nodes can be ordered such that between an arbitrary pair of them there exists a <b>directed</b> <b>link</b> pointing from the node with the higher rank towards the node with the lower rank.

50|$|The off-diagonal {{cells are}} used to {{indicate}} relationships between the elements. A marking of the cell indicates a <b>directed</b> <b>link</b> between two elements and can represent design relations or constraints between product components, communication between teams, information flow or precedence relations between activities. In one convention, reading across a row reveals the outputs that the element in that row provides to other elements, and scanning a column reveals the inputs that the element in that column receives from other elements. For example, in the DSM, the marking in row A and column C indicated a link from A to C (output from A, input to C). Alternatively, the rows and columns may be switched (without a change of meaning). Both conventions {{may be found in}} the literature.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-speed}} wireless system (&# 62;or= 100 Mb/s) for indoor infrared (IR) communications via {{the line}} of sight is described and feasibility is shown in an experimental demonstrator. A diffuse link is used for connectivity, and tracked directed links are used for high-speed communications. The transmitter is made of a laser diode array in combination with multiple-beam forming optics. For the receiver (Rx), a wide-angle lens, and an avalanche photodiode array are used. For the diffuse link, the signals from all pixels in the array are combined. Pixels are selectively addressed to realize directed links. Fast electronic tracking of a <b>directed</b> <b>link</b> is possible by switching the signal path onto the right pixel in the array. Diffuse link, <b>directed</b> <b>link,</b> position detection, and tracking can be realized with {{one and the same}} transceiver hardware. A favorite system design is derived from constraints due to the IR channel, eye safety, lenses, photodetectors, and the overall system complexity. The experimental system shows some key features, namely 155 -Mb/s wireless transmission over a distance of nearly 2 m with electronic tracking at an imaging IR Rx. Electronic tracking of IR links, thus, allows both high data rates and high capacity for wireless access in small office and home environments...|$|E

30|$|In a {{directed}} {{network with}} n nodes, there are n(n− 1) potential links.

In this research, the physical transportation network is expanded into two coupled high-dimensional space–time networks, for passengers and vehicles. Besides typical space–time traveling/waiting arcs, additional space–time arcs, such as pickup and drop-off space–time arc, are also constructed for modeling the vehicle-passenger service process.|$|E
30|$|To {{construct}} an NK Boolean Network, N nodes are first created.

For each of the N nodes a random logic function is created and assigned to the node. When K= 2 this logic function may well be one of the well known Boolean functions such as AND and OR, though this is not definite. Each node has a binary state (0 or 1) which is randomly selected at the time of model creation and then updated as the model runs.|$|E
30|$|While {{the works}} in [2 – 5, 7] all {{considered}} minimizing the total transmit power of interference networks, another important performance metric, which concerns more {{about the quality of}} communications, is the mean-square-error (MSE) for signal estimation. In [8 – 10], the sum minimum MSE (MMSE) was considered to design iterative algorithms for MIMO interference relay systems taking the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> between the source and destination nodes into consideration, and in [11], similar problem has been considered ignoring the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> between the communicating parties. Indeed the <b>direct</b> source-destination <b>links</b> can {{play a vital role in}} wireless communication systems when the link-strength is significant. However, multihop communication is motivated by the fact that such <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> may undergo deep shadowing effects in many practical scenarios. Hence, many existing works on multihop communications have ignored the <b>direct</b> <b>links.</b> Nonetheless, the sum MMSE criterion runs the risk that some of the receivers may suffer from unacceptably high MSEs. Also, {{the works in}} [8 – 10] considered one-way relaying only.|$|R
