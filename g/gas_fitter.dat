5|$|From {{an early}} age, Hobbs played cricket {{whenever}} he could. His first games were {{played in the}} streets near his house. He was educated at a primary school affiliated with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an errand boy until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice <b>gas</b> <b>fitter,</b> and practised cricket on Parker's Piece, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.|$|E

After leaving school {{at the age of}} fifteen he spent six years (1958–1964) as an {{apprentice}} <b>gas</b> <b>fitter</b> with the North Western Gas Board, and obtained his City and Guilds and advanced diplomas in Gas Technology. After the completion of his apprenticeship he was offered a management position with the Gas Board. During his industrial career he also served as a union representative.|$|E
25|$|Hobbs {{was educated}} at a primary school {{affiliated}} with his local Anglican church, St Matthew's. In 1891, {{he moved to}} York Street Boys' School, where in contrast to his previous school, his family had to pay fees for him to attend. He later wrote {{that he was a}} poor scholar but was more successful at sports. Both he and his mother later recounted that he was rarely in trouble at home or school, except when carrying out practical jokes. He was also heavily involved in St Matthew's Church, and {{was a member of the}} church choir. Although his first appearance in a cricket match was as a last minute substitute playing for Jesus College choir, he played regularly for the St Matthew's choir team, which he went on to captain, and the York Street school team. He was also a founder member of a team called the Ivy Club which played on Parker's Piece. During holidays, he helped his father at work on the Jesus College ground. In his final year at York Street, in order to supplement the family budget, he took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house where his duties mainly involved cleaning. When he left school in 1895, Hobbs initially worked as an errand boy before his father's connections at the university helped him to get a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Then, aged 16, he began a potentially more permanent career working as an apprentice <b>gas</b> <b>fitter.</b>|$|E

25|$|Natural gas {{processing}} changes the commodity in two critical ways. First, it extracts valuable by-products; second, it renders natural <b>gas</b> <b>fit</b> {{to be transported}} to a point for commercial sale and consumption. Through the use of evolving technology, the {{gas processing}} industry of each era extracts higher percentages of {{a wider range of}} hydrocarbons and other commercial by-products than its predecessors. It also removes ever-higher percentages of dangerous and other unwanted impurities. Steady growth has made natural gas a major industry, with 180 cubic kilometres of gas flowing from Canadian fields to market, every year.|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of a freely cooling {{granular}} gas decreases as a power law t(-theta) large times t. Two theoretical conjectures exist for the exponent theta. One based on ballistic aggregation of compact spherical aggregates predicts theta = 2 d/(d + 2) in d dimensions. The other based on Burgers equation describing anisotropic, extended clusters predicts theta = d/ 2 when 2 <= d <= 4. We do extensive simulations in three dimensions to find that while theta is as predicted by ballistic aggregation, the cluster statistics and velocity distribution differ from it. Thus, the freely cooling granular <b>gas</b> <b>fits</b> to neither the ballistic aggregation or a Burgers equation description...|$|R

The court further ruled that [...] "policy judgments {{have nothing to do}} with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and do not amount to a reasoned justification for declining to form a scientific judgment." [...] In EPA's view, this required the agency to make a positive or negative endangerment finding under Section 202(a) of the CAA.|$|R

50|$|The Kirby-Morgan KM 48 Supermask is unique, in {{that the}} {{airspace}} for the eyes is completely separate from the mouth area, and the mask can be worn as a half mask by leaving off the mouthpiece pod, which holds the demand valve or rebreather mouthpiece. This allows bailout to a standard scuba demand valve with mouth grip, but also allows the diver to carry bailout <b>gas</b> <b>fitted</b> to a second pod, which can be clopped to the mask when the primary pod has been unclipped. This can be done underwater, and {{as there is a}} standard mouthpiece inside the pod, breathing can commence before the pod is fully connected and sealed.

40|$|Dusty plasmas are a {{model system}} for {{studying}} strong correlation. The dust grains' {{size of a}} few micro-meters and their characteristic oscillation frequency of a few hertz allows for an investigation of many particle effects on an atomic level. In this article, we model the heat transport through an axially confined 2 D dust cluster from the center to the outside. The system behaves particularly interesting since heat is not only conducted within the dust component but also transfered to the neutral <b>gas.</b> <b>Fitting</b> the analytical solution to the obtained radial temperature profiles allows to determine the heat conductivity.

40|$|It {{has often}} been assumed that {{ordering}} problems form a special class of problems amenable to a largely uniform treatment. Since successful ordering Genetic Algorithms (gas) have been defined for optimization of some ordering problems, it has become customary to assume that ordering problems are well solved by ordering <b>gas</b> <b>fitted</b> with (standard) operators. The success of the standard ordering gas on some problems led to an indirect approach to solving numerous combinatorial problems as follows: define a decoder of a permutation of items that builds {{a solution to the}} original problem, and use the ordering ga to find a permutation that decodes into a good solution to the original problem. Such lavish applications of the standard ordering ga to all sorts of problems have become pervasive. In this paper, we construct a very simple way of transforming a function defined over bitstrings to a function defined over permutations, and conversely. As a result, there is a simple way of transforming any [...] ...|$|R
