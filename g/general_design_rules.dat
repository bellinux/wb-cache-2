Considers a multistage serial production line system with materials in the system controlled by kanban discipline. Presents simulation results to evaluate the production system performance {{in terms of the}} average throughput rate and the average system time for a fixed total number of kanbans over a given number of serial workstations. Constructs and compares efficient allocation sets for three and four workstations that are generated by kanban discipline for two processing time distributions, namely, uniform and exponential distributions.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{transport}} paths of photocarriers (electrons and holes) before collected by electrodes strongly affect bulk recombination and thus electrical properties of solar cells, including open-circuit voltage and fill factor. For boosting device performance, a <b>general</b> <b>design</b> <b>rule,</b> tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, is proposed to decide the transport paths of photocarriers. Due to a unique ability to localize and concentrate light, plasmonics is explored to manipulate photocarrier transport through spatially redistributing light absorption at the active layer of devices. Without changing the active materials, we conceive a plasmonic-electrical concept, which tunes electrical properties of solar cells via the plasmon-modified optical field distribution, to realize the <b>design</b> <b>rule.</b> Incorporating spectrally and spatially configurable metallic nanostructures, thin-film solar cells are theoretically modelled and experimentally fabricated to validate the <b>design</b> <b>rule</b> and verify the plasmonic-tunable electrical properties.

Recently, performances of thin-film solar cells have been pronouncedly improved by introducing metallic nanostructures.

The plasmonic-optical effects could: (1) boost optical absorption of active materials; (2) spatially redistribute light absorption at the active layer due to the localized near-field enhancement around metallic nanostructures. Except for the plasmonic-optical effects, the effects of plasmonically modified recombination, transport and collection of photocarriers (electrons and holes), hereafter named plasmonic-electrical effects, have been proposed by Sha, etal. For boosting device performance, they conceived a <b>general</b> <b>design</b> <b>rule,</b> tailored to arbitrary electron to hole mobility ratio, to decide the transport paths of photocarriers.

These modeling techniques for an exact statistical analysis of a given cell structure are more and more important for an efficient use of the given resources from a system-level point of view.

In this paper, we test whether these design rules apply to microscale valveless micropumps using highly resolved CFD calculations. The variation of flow with pump pressure-drop was studied by varying the resistance of an external circuit.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 One of {{the classic}} {{problems}} in industrial engineering is the buffer allocation problem. The objective of the buffer allocation problem is to maximize some line output, typically throughput, through the allocation of buffers throughout the production line. Previous {{work in this area}} has focused on either determining <b>general</b> <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> or developing heuristics to determine optimal buffer placement. Most of this work was done on production lines which were assumed to have an unlimited supply of jobs to the first workstation and an unlimited storage space after the last workstation (open production lines). The purpose of this research was to study buffer allocation in closed production lines and focus on the validation and development of <b>general</b> <b>design</b> <b>rules</b> for buffer placement. Balanced and unbalanced lines were studied with workstations representing manual stations, and then with workstations representing automated machines. The general approach taken was to first identify an existing buffer allocation rule established for open lines and then determine the corresponding rule for closed production lines. Next, a set of experiments were designed to test the closed production line design rule. Finally, the design rule was validated, modified, or reformulated. The findings of this research indicate that an even buffer allocation is optimal for balanced closed production lines. It also showed similar behavior to open production lines when a bottleneck is present, but the effect of the bottleneck is not as strong. Also, differences between reliable and unreliable lines were observed. Finally, the rules developed seemed to be consistent for short lines as well as long ones. Several of the rules developed in this research can be utilized immediately in the design of closed production lines. Also, {{because of the lack of}} literature on closed production lines, it will serve as a good first step into the understanding of the role of buffers in closed production lines...|$|E

A practical design example of a 1 × 4 nonblocking wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) switch is detailed to illustrate the design steps and the required phase assignment of each phase shifter for various output states.

Since known ferroelectrics are rather limited, finding new ferroelectric (FE) materials has become a flourishing field.
