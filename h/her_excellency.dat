5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of <b>Her</b> <b>Excellency</b> The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight Champion of the World and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment I tried to sign up for Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. <b>Her</b> <b>Excellency</b> was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House state dinner in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E

50|$|Ode to the Gods is {{the name}} of an English soundtrack album to Stavros Sideras' 1993 one-act opera of the same name {{starring}} Greek Cypriot singer Anna Vissi. It is Anna Vissi’s first English soundtrack album and was released in Cyprus and Greece in 1993 by Cypriot record company All Records. Vissi’s costars included Labis Livieratos and Bessie Malfa, who perform on three tracks each. The opera was only staged once in October 1993 in Limassol {{under the auspices of the}} Government of Cyprus and played before Queen Elizabeth II and <b>Her</b> <b>Excellencies.</b> Music and lyrics are by Stavros Sideras.|$|R
25|$|In 2006 President John Agyekum Kufour {{appointed}} Amoakohene to head Ghana's {{embassy in}} Canada as its High Commissioner. She officially begun her diplomatic responsibility on 26 September 2006 when she presented her letters of commission to the Governor General of Canada, <b>Her</b> <b>Excellency</b> Michaelle Jean, at her official Provincial office and residence at La Citadel in Quebec City. As High Commissioner, she embarked on some philanthropic activities, {{one of which}} involved the donation of medical equipment to the Nsawkaw Hospital. She was the second High Commissioner to Canada in the Kufour administration and served in that position from July 2006 to February 2009.|$|E
25|$|Massey's {{tenure as}} the Governor General of Canada was notable {{in that he}} was the first Canadian-born {{individual}} to be appointed to the post; previously, all the viceroys since Confederation had been born in another overseas region of the British Empire and later British Commonwealth. As a widower, he was also the only unmarried person ever to reside at Rideau Hall. Typically, the governor general's wife would be the viceregal consort and act as the hostess and chatelaine of the household. In Massey's case, however, his daughter-in-law, Lilias Massey, fulfilled the role, though she was not accorded the style of <b>Her</b> <b>Excellency,</b> usually given to the viceregal consort.|$|E
25|$|The Squadron Crest was {{designed}} in 1955 by a cadet who subsequently rose to prominence as an architect. In 2010, the unit badge, {{along with that}} of the Queensland University Regiment were sculpted in sandstone for installation in the colonnade of the UQ quadrangle at the St Lucia campus by Dr. Rhyl Hinwood AM. Both badges were unveiled during the Alumni Week of the celebration of the Centenary of the University of Queensland on 3 July 2010, by <b>Her</b> <b>Excellency,</b> Ms. Quentin Bryce AC, Governor General and Commander in Chief of the Australian Defence Force. The Guard for the Governor General comprised members of the Queensland University Regiment and RAAF Gap Year Cadets.|$|E

25|$|As the {{personal}} {{representative of the}} monarch, the governor general follows only the sovereign in the Canadian order of precedence, preceding even {{other members of the}} Royal Family. Though the federal viceroy is considered primus inter pares amongst his or her provincial counterparts, the governor general also outranks the lieutenant governors in the federal sphere; at provincial functions, however, the relevant lieutenant governor, as the 's representative in the province, precedes the governor general. The incumbent governor general and his or her spouse are also the only people in Canada, other than serving Canadian ambassadors and high commissioners, entitled {{to the use of the}} style His or <b>Her</b> <b>Excellency</b> and the governor general is granted the additional honorific of The Right Honourable for their time in office and for life afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|Perhaps Madame de Bernstein {{stayed at}} the {{assembly}} until the very last, not willing to allow the company the chance of speaking of her as soon as her back should be turned. Ah, what a comfort it is, I say again, that we have backs, and that our ears don't grow on them! He that has ears to hear, let him stuff them with cotton. Madame Bernstein might have heard folks say it was heartless of her to come abroad, and play at cards, and make merry when her niece was in trouble. As if she could help Maria by staying at home, indeed! At her age, it is dangerous to disturb an old lady's tranquillity. [...] "Don't tell me!" [...] says Lady Yarmouth. [...] "The Bernstein would play at cards over her niece's coffin. Talk about her heart! who ever said she had one? That old spy lost it to the Chevalier a thousand years ago, and has lived ever since perfectly well without one. For how much is the Maria put in prison? If it were only a small sum we would pay it, it would vex her aunt so. Find out, Fuchs, in the morning, for how much Lady Maria Esmond is put in prison." [...] And the faithful Fuchs bowed, and promised to do <b>her</b> <b>Excellency's</b> will.|$|R

And as for you, you want a woman to bring your slippers and cap, and to sit at your feet, and cry, ‘O caro! O bravo!’ whilst you read your Shakespeares, and Miltons, and stuff. Mamma would have been the wife for you, had you been a little older, though you look ten years older than she does—you do, you glum-faced, blue-bearded, little old man! You might have sat, like Darby and Joan, and flattered each other; and billed and cooed like a pair of old pigeons on a perch. I want my wings and to use them, sir.” And she spread out her beautiful arms, as if indeed she could fly off like the pretty “Gawrie”, whom the man in the story was enamoured of.|$|R
60|$|Intellectual activity, {{though not}} {{directed}} towards books, {{had always been}} my sister's characteristic. It had been displayed early in life, leading her out to solitary musing among her native mountains, causing her to form innumerous combinations from common objects, giving strength to her perceptions, and swiftness to their arrangement. Love had come, as the rod of the master-prophet, to swallow up every minor propensity. Love had doubled all <b>her</b> <b>excellencies,</b> and placed a diadem on her genius. Was she to cease to love? Take the colours and odour from the rose, change the sweet nutriment of mother's milk to gall and poison; as easily might you wean Perdita from love. She grieved {{for the loss of}} Raymond with an anguish, that exiled all smile from her lips, and trenched sad lines on her brow of beauty. But each day seemed to change the nature of her suffering, and every succeeding hour forced her to alter (if so I may style it) the fashion of her soul's mourning garb. For a time music was able to satisfy the cravings of her mental hunger, and her melancholy thoughts renewed themselves in each change of key, and varied with every alteration in the strain. My schooling first impelled her towards books; and, if music had been the food of sorrow, the productions of the wise became its medicine. The acquisition of unknown languages was too tedious an occupation, for one who referred every expression to the universe within, and read not, as many do, for the mere sake of filling up time; but who was still questioning herself and her author, moulding every idea in a thousand ways, ardently desirous for the discovery of truth in every sentence. She sought to improve her understanding; mechanically her heart and dispositions became soft and gentle under this benign discipline. After awhile she discovered, that amidst all her newly acquired knowledge, her own character, which formerly she fancied that she thoroughly understood, became the first in rank among the terrae incognitae, the pathless wilds of a country that had no chart. Erringly and strangely she began the task of self-examination with self-condemnation. And then again she became aware of <b>her</b> own <b>excellencies,</b> and began to balance with juster scales the shades of good and evil. I, who longed beyond words, to restore her to the happiness it was still in her power to enjoy, watched with anxiety the result of these internal proceedings.|$|R

60|$|As for {{the unfortunate}} Princess Anne, crushed under {{a load of}} shame and humiliation, {{she had gone to}} her {{punishment}} in the previous July. The Apostolic Commissary notified her of the sentence which King Philip had confirmed. She was to be transferred to another convent, there to undergo a term of four years' solitary confinement in her cell, and to fast on bread and water every Friday. She was pronounced incapable of ever holding any office, and was to be treated on the expiry of her term as an ordinary nun, her civil list abolished, <b>her</b> title of <b>Excellency</b> to be extinguished, together with all other honours and privileges conferred upon her by King Philip.|$|R
6000|$|Yet though {{lovely and}} full of noble feeling, my poor Perdita (for this was the fanciful name my sister had {{received}} from her dying parent), was not altogether saintly in her disposition. Her manners were cold and repulsive. If she had been nurtured by those who had regarded her with affection, {{she might have been}} different; but unloved and neglected, she repaid want of kindness with distrust and silence. She was submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual cloud dwelt on her brow; {{she looked as if she}} expected enmity from every one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the same feeling. All the time she could command she spent in solitude. She would ramble to the most unfrequented places, and scale dangerous heights, that in those unvisited spots she might wrap herself in loneliness. Often she passed whole hours walking up and down the paths of the woods; she wove garlands of flowers and ivy, or watched the flickering of the shadows and glancing of the leaves; sometimes she sat beside a stream, and as her thoughts paused, threw flowers or pebbles into the waters, watching how those swam and these sank; or she would set afloat boats formed of bark of trees or leaves, with a feather for a sail, and intensely watch the navigation of her craft among the rapids and shallows of the brook. Meanwhile her active fancy wove a thousand combinations; she dreamt [...] "of moving accidents by flood and field"--she lost herself delightedly in these self-created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life. Poverty was the cloud that veiled <b>her</b> <b>excellencies,</b> and all that was good in her seemed about to perish from want of the genial dew of affection. She had not even the same advantage as I in the recollection of her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but her alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt for her; and every error was magnified by them into crimes. If she had been bred in that sphere of life to which by inheritance the delicate framework of her mind and person was adapted, she would have been the object almost of adoration, for her virtues were as eminent as her defects. All the genius that ennobled the blood of her father illustrated hers; a generous tide flowed in her veins; artifice, envy, or meanness, were at the antipodes of her nature; her countenance, when enlightened by amiable feeling, might have belonged to a queen of nations; her eyes were bright; her look fearless.|$|R
50|$|<b>Her</b> father, His <b>Excellency</b> Prince Vatvani Norodom, a third {{cousin of}} both current king Norodom Sihamoni and former Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, was a {{lieutenant-colonel}} in the Khmer Air Force during the Cambodian Civil War assigned as the commandant of Battambang Air Force Base. In 1971 {{he was promoted}} to full colonel and made Cambodian Representative to US Forces in Vietnam. Subsequently, he was stationed as the Military Liaison Officer to the USAF at Udorn in Thailand until the 1975 fall of Phnom Penh when he fled with his family to the United States. Upon his return to Cambodia in 1993, he was made major-general and then lieutenant-general and given the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Air Force, a post which he held until the 1997 Cambodian Coup which resulted in Hun Sen consolidating his power and expelling Ranariddh and his allies.

6000|$|He was {{a fiction}} writer, {{and one of}} Westbrook's old acquaintances. At one time they might have called each other old friends. Dawe had some money in those days, and lived in a decent {{apartment}} house near Westbrook's. The two families often went to theatres and dinners together. Mrs. Dawe and Mrs. Westbrook became [...] "dearest" [...] friends. Then one day a little tentacle of the octopus, just to amuse itself, ingurgitated Dawe's capital, and {{he moved to the}} Gramercy Park neighborhood where one, for a few groats per week, may sit upon one's trunk under eight-branched chandeliers and opposite Carrara marble mantels and watch the mice play upon the floor. Dawe thought to live by writing fiction. Now and then he sold a story. He submitted many to Westbrook. The Minerva printed one or two of them; the rest were returned. Westbrook sent a careful and conscientious personal letter with each rejected manuscript, pointing out in detail his reasons for considering it unavailable. Editor Westbrook had his own clear conception of what constituted good fiction. So had Dawe. Mrs. Dawe was mainly concerned about the constituents of the scanty dishes of food that she managed to scrape together. One day Dawe had been spouting to <b>her</b> about the <b>excellencies</b> of certain French writers. At dinner they sat down to a dish that a hungry schoolboy could have encompassed at a gulp.
