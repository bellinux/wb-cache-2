2500|$|Because of such statements, some adherents {{believe that}} {{caffeine}} is officially prohibited under the Word of Wisdom. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950's,</b> <b>the</b> {{director of the}} food services for Brigham Young University, a college owned by the LDS Church, decided not to sell caffeine on campus. [...] This changed in September 2017 when the current director of BYU Dining Services announced that caffeinated beverages would be sold on campus. Wright said this {{was the result of}} a change in customer preferences. Official church publications have occasionally published articles by medical practitioners that warn of the health risks of consuming caffeine. However, <b>in</b> November 2010, <b>the</b> Salt Lake Tribune noted that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2010 church Handbook, which sets out the official position of the church on health and social issues, no position on drinking Coca-Cola or caffeinated drinks is included. The Salt Lake Tribune concluded that the church [...] "takes no official position on caffeine".|$|R

5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his spirited, unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music.

The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E

When eight players from neighbours Manchester United lost their lives in the Munich air disaster when returning from a European Cup match in February 1958, UEFA wished for City to take United's place in the competition. City rejected the idea out of hand.|$|E
5|$|His {{resting place}} {{is at the}} Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery, in Pyongyang. Today, Cho is {{regarded}} as the founding father of North Korean socialist realist poetry, or indeed poetry in general, or even North Korean literature as a whole. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>mid-1950s</b> many Soviet Koreans, including Cho's close friends, were discredited in purges. According to Gabroussenko, Cho's untimely death in 1951 may have spared him his reputation from that loss of official recognition. With the exception of a period in the 1970s when Cho's name was barely mentioned in official publications, his legacy has benefited from continued popularity in North Korea.|$|E
