2500|$|After {{the conference}} Chauvel ordered the Australian Mounted Division to {{ride back to}} Karm in the {{afternoon}} to ease the water at Beersheba. The division's horses had had their last proper drink at Khalasa on 30 October, as the water supply at Asluj and Beersheba had been restricted. As all the tents had been pulled down the previous day {{in preparation for a}} move, the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance did dressings outside during the morning. Orders were received a noon and after lunch the field ambulance, {{along with the rest of}} their brigade rode out at 14:00 back to Karm where they arrived at 22:00. It was a [...] "terrible ride in the dust ... direct through Beersheba and Buggar. The dust was so thick you could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> camel ahead and follow on. We lost the Brigade and camped for the night at Karm." [...] The Australian Mounted Divisional Train (less the 5th Mounted Brigade's 38 Coy but with 7th Mounted Brigade Train), reached Karm at 23:00 after leaving Beersheba at 16:00.|$|E

60|$|I keep {{straight}} on, {{and come}} in due time to the first on the right: a narrow dull street, where I see a well-favoured man of good stature and military bearing, in a great cloak, standing at a door. Drawing nearer to this threshold, I see it is the threshold of a small wine-shop; and I can <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> in <b>the</b> dim light, the inscription that it is kept by Giovanni Carlavero.|$|R
60|$|At a nimbler trot, as if {{the shovel}} over his {{shoulder}} stimulated him by reviving old associations, Mr Boffin ascended the 'serpentining walk', up the Mound which he had described to Silas Wegg {{on the occasion of}} their beginning to decline and fall. On striking into it he turned his lantern off. The two followed him, stooping low, so that their figures might make no mark in relief against the sky when he should turn his lantern on again. Mr Venus took the lead, towing Mr Wegg, in order that his refractory leg might be promptly extricated from any pitfalls it should dig for itself. They could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> that <b>the</b> Golden Dustman stopped to breathe. Of course they stopped too, instantly.|$|R
50|$|The station {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 2 December 1963, {{a victim of}} the Beeching Axe. Goods traffic continued until 1 July 1964, although the private siding continued in use for some time. Of the first station all that remains is the footbridge (although the deck has been replaced with concrete), but it is <b>just</b> possible to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> old paths down to the platforms. The station master's house is now in residential use.|$|R
60|$|Bathurst {{stepped out}} and looked up. He could but <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figure of Rabda, {{seemingly}} already {{higher than the}} top of the bungalow. Gradually it became more and more indistinct.|$|E
60|$|Wyllard could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> schooner, {{which had}} {{apparently}} followed them, a blurr of dusky canvas against {{a bank of}} haze, and then, as the boat slid down into a hollow, {{there was nothing but}} the low-hung, lowering sky. It was evident to him that if they were to make a landing it must be done promptly.|$|E
60|$|By the aid {{of their}} sword-bayonets the Franc-tireurs soon pierced the wall, and lying at full length a yard apart, replied to the enemy's fire. Through the smoke they could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> upper line of the wall, and as the Prussians stood up to fire picked them off. Henri Vaucour crept along the line urging the men to fire slowly.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} the dam the fox stopped. Sparrer could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> him <b>out</b> through <b>the</b> tangled {{screen of}} brush. For a moment he stood motionless. It seemed to the boy like adding insult to injury. Then with a long graceful leap he landed on the snow of the swamp. A sudden hope caused Sparrer to instinctively tighten his grip on the rifle and catch his breath. Perhaps the fox would come his way! If he should, well, he would at least find a true Scout--he would be prepared.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will not}} do, Giuseppi. The woman {{would refuse to}} speak, and though they could force her {{to do so in}} the dungeons, the girls would be sure to be removed the moment it was known she was captured. We must follow them, and see where they go to. Let us get well behind them, so that we can <b>just</b> <b>make</b> them <b>out</b> in <b>the</b> distance. If they have a {{suspicion}} that they are being followed, they will land her at the first steps and slip away from us." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is <b>just</b> {{possible}} to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{remains of a}} stone jetty and {{the ruins of a}} lime kiln nearby. Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876. The Pill was long associated with smuggling and legend has it that barrels of spirits hidden in the chantry were deliberately set fire to as the revenue men appeared on the scene. Legend also has it that the smugglers' ponies were taught to respond to the commands [...] "whoa" [...] and [...] "gee up" [...] in the reverse sense of the words.|$|R
6000|$|... "How long I slep' I can't go for to say, but w'en I wakened it wos pitch-dark. I {{could only}} <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winder by the pale starlight that shone through it, {{but the moment}} I set my two eyes on it, wot does I see?

60|$|They {{found the}} hollow under the cliff {{to be less}} than two yards deep and of about the same width. The rocks {{overhead}} hung down so that they touched Dave's head. In front was a small snowdrift, looking over which father and son could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> two bears, as they squatted on the ground between the firs. The beasts did considerable growling and did what they could {{to take care of their}} wounds, yet they showed no disposition to leave that vicinity.|$|E
60|$|An hour elapsed {{before any}} {{movement}} was visible. Then Francis {{heard the sound}} of footsteps, and could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figures of persons descending the steps and entering the gondola. Then the boat moved out {{into the middle of the}} canal, where a few boats were still passing to and fro. Francis kept his gondola close by the bank, so as to be in the deep shade of the houses. The boat they were following again passed under the Ponto Maggiore, and for some distance followed the line of the Grand Canal.|$|E
60|$|He moved forward. A {{few steps}} {{took him to}} the doorway. The chamber before him was darker than the corridor, so that he could <b>just</b> indistinctly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> objects in the room. He saw a {{sleeping}} dais near the center, with a darker blotch of something lying on the marble floor beside it. He moved a step farther into the doorway and the scabbard of his sword scraped against the stone frame. To his horror he saw the sleeping silks and furs upon the central dais move. He saw a figure slowly arising to a sitting posture from the death bed of O-Mai the Cruel. His knees shook, but he gathered all his moral forces, and gripping his sword more tightly in his trembling fingers prepared to leap across the chamber upon the horrid apparition. He hesitated just a moment. He felt eyes upon him--ghoulish eyes that bored through the darkness into his withering heart--eyes that he could not see. He gathered himself for the rush--and then there broke from the thing upon the couch an awful shriek, and O-Tar sank senseless to the floor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{beach at}} Kilve was {{described}} by William Wordsworth, the Romantic poet, as [...] "Kilve's delightful shore". Kilve Pill, where the stream from Holford runs into the sea, was once a tiny port, used for importing culm, an inferior type of coal which {{was used in the}} limeburning process. It was also the site for [...] "glatting" [...] which was the hunting of conger eels by dogs. On the shore a Saint Keyne serpent can be seen, which a local legend says is a snake turned to stone, but is in reality an ammonite. It is <b>just</b> possible to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> remains of a stone jetty and the ruins of a lime kiln nearby. Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876.|$|R
6000|$|But the sum was {{honestly}} {{earned by}} hard and wearisome work. Pope was no Greek scholar; it is said, indeed, {{that he was}} <b>just</b> able to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sense of the original with a translation. And {{in addition to the}} fifteen thousand lines of the 'Iliad', he had engaged to furnish an introduction and notes. At first the magnitude of the undertaking frightened him. [...] "What terrible moments," [...] he said to Spence, [...] "does one feel after one has engaged for a large work. In the beginning of my translating the 'Iliad', I wished anybody would hang me a hundred times. It sat so heavily on my mind at first that I often used to dream of it and do sometimes still." [...] In spite of his discouragement, however, and of the ill health which so constantly beset him, Pope fell gallantly upon his task, and as time went on came almost to enjoy it. He used to translate thirty or forty verses in the morning before rising and, in his own characteristic phrase, [...] "piddled over them {{for the rest of the}} day." [...] He used every assistance possible, drew freely upon the scholarship of friends, corrected and recorrected with a view to obtaining clearness and point, and finally succeeded in producing a version which not only satisfied his own critical judgment, but was at once accepted by the English-speaking world as the standard translation of Homer.|$|R
6000|$|Midway up I {{checked and}} looked back across the wide water. The light had grown quite strong by now, and in the east there was a faint pink flush to herald the {{approaching}} sun. Away beyond the river, moving southward, I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Legate's little cavalcade. And then, for the first time, a question leapt in my mind concerning the litter whose leathern curtains had remained so closely drawn. Whom did it contain? Could it be Giuliana? Had Cosimo spoken the truth {{when he said that}} she had gone to Gambara for shelter? ...|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} I was {{crouched}} in some thick underbrush looking {{up into a}} great spruce, when I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> leader standing by an upright branch in sharp silhouette against the glowing west. I had followed his swift flight, and now lay listening again to his searching call as it went out through the twilight, calling his little flock to the roosting tree. From the swamp and the hillside and far down by the quiet lake they answered, faintly at first, then with clearer call and the whirr of swift wings as they came in.|$|E
60|$|She {{had taught}} her {{children}} {{as much as she}} could. Her husband was willing, but his old mother disapproved of learning in that station of life, and aided and abetted her eldest grandson in his resistance, so that though she had died when he was only eleven or twelve years old, Jephthah could do no more than <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> meaning of a printed sentence, whereas Steadfast and Patience could both read easily, and did read whatever came in their way, though that was only a broadside ballad now and then besides their mother's Bible and Prayer-book, and one or two little black books.|$|E
5000|$|Oil was Paul Delaroche’s {{medium of}} choice when {{painting}} The Young Martyr, as oil {{allowed him to}} manipulate the precise details in the painting {{over a long period}} of time, and, therefore, capture a high level of detail for “the appearance of the highest finish.” [...] As such, “the dignity of forms, the striking effect of the chiaroscuro, and those bluish grey tones which seemed to suit so well the touching sadness of the subject,” [...] in The Young Martyr truly begin in the upper left hand corner of the painting, where a viewer can <b>just</b> barely <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figures of a man and a woman, embracing each other in terror upon seeing the drowned Christian. Although the identity of the figures is unclear, it is generally thought that they are the young Christian’s parents. To continue, as the sun sets behind the couple, the last rays of light point directly across the painting towards the Martyr. Also in the upper left hand corner of the painting, a faint white star can be seen in the sky, just above the grieving couple. It is important to note the presence of this star in the painting as its inclusion may allude to other historical or religious narratives. For example, if The Young Martyr was painted as a morning scene, with the rising sun in the far background, the faint star above the grieving parents may allude to the morning star, or Lucifer, from the Bible. As such, this star would suggest the presence of the Devil, or of evil (metaphorically) in the painting. [...] On the other hand, if The Young Martyr was painted as a scene taking place at sunset, then the star in the left hand corner could be seen as the North Star, and, therefore, possibly as an allusion to God or Jesus. [...] Moving on to the Martyr herself, with her hands bound by rope, we see the young Christian gently floating upon the surface of the Tiber. With her body erect (potentially suggesting the rigor mortis), the Martyr, sublimely, appears both dead and alive. Here we can specifically take note of Delaroche’s attention to detail in that, just around the Martyr’s left hand, we can see small, painstakingly delineated ripples, barely emanating from around the crests of the Martyr’s fingers. Moving on, directly above the head of the Martyr is a halo. The Martyr’s halo, almost mathematically precise and crisp, appears surreal in contrast to the rest of the painting; furthermore, this halo helps to stage The Young Martyr as it exists as the primary source of light for the otherwise dimly lit Christian.|$|R

60|$|Here by {{the statue}} {{we took our}} stand, and waited. Sir Henry and I close together, Umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness, so that I could only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> his towering outline leaning on the outline of an axe.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had already}} ascertained that {{the front door}} was locked and bolted, and that he must {{therefore}} enter through the kitchen. They heard the horse stop in front, a moment later the gate was opened, and through the window they could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> figure of a man leading a horse; then the stable door opened, and they heard a movement, and knew that the horse was being unsaddled; they heard it walk into the stable, the door was shut behind it, and a step approached the back door. It was opened, and a voice said with an oath, [...] "The old fool has forgotten to leave a candle burning;" [...] then he stepped into the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|At this Charley cast off, and Yellow Handkerchief sent {{one of his}} men {{forward to}} haul in the line. In the {{gathering}} darkness I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> mouth of San Rafael Creek, {{and by the time}} we entered it I could barely see its banks. The Reindeer was fully five minutes astern, and we continued to leave her astern as we beat up the narrow, winding channel. With Charley behind us, it seemed I had little to fear from my five prisoners; but the darkness prevented my keeping a sharp eye on them, so I transferred my revolver from my trousers pocket to the side pocket of my coat, where I could more quickly put my hand on it.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{sufficiently}} embarrassing situation. I {{put on a}} bold front, however, and not deigning to answer, pushed past him and walked with as much leisure as possible along the banquette in the direction which Nick had taken. As I turned the corner I glanced over my shoulder, and in the darkness I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> man standing where I had left him. In great uneasiness I pursued my way, my imagination summing up for Nick all kinds of adventures with disagreeable consequences. I walked for some time--it may have been half an hour--aimlessly, and finally {{decided it would be}} best to go back to Madame Bouvet's and await the issue with as much calmness as possible. He might not, after all, have caught the fellow.|$|E
60|$|In a {{very few}} seconds it was done, and looking astern, Augusta could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{something}} black that seemed to float {{for a second or}} two upon the water, and then disappear into its depths. It was the shattered hull of the whaler.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not being {{possessed of}} {{the eyes of a}} heagle or a cat, sir, I did not," [...] Burdett replied. [...] "Just you look round and see what sort of a night it is. Why, I can only <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> your outline, sir; {{although}} I've been looking at you this five minutes, I can't see nothing of your face." ...|$|R
60|$|Joe {{was about}} {{to return to the}} mess-hall when he chanced to see two figures sneaking along in the semi-darkness, in the {{direction}} of the woods. He was <b>just</b> able to <b>make</b> <b>out</b> that <b>the</b> pair were Reff Ritter and Gus Coulter when they disappeared behind the trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} occurs to me," [...] said he at last. [...] "As we {{sat at the table}} my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my partner at cards, was facing it. I saw him once look hard over my shoulder, so I turned round and looked also. The blind was up and the window shut, but I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> bushes on the lawn, {{and it seemed to me}} for a moment that I saw {{something}} moving among them. I couldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was something there. When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me that he had the same feeling. That is all that I can say." ...|$|E
60|$|Discussing {{these and}} kindred topics {{they made a}} beeline {{across the back of}} the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or {{something}} like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.|$|E
6000|$|Day {{was just}} {{breaking}} now, {{but it was}} still dark on the water, and the boat rowed very slowly until it became lighter. Percy could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> shores of the creek on both sides; they were but two or three feet above the level of the water, and were evidently submerged at high tide. The creek was about a hundred yards wide, and the lad could not see far ahead, for it was full of sharp windings and turnings. Here and there branches joined it, but the boats were evidently following the main channel. After another half-hour's rowing the first lieutenant suddenly gave the order, [...] "Easy all," [...] and the men, looking over their shoulders, saw a village {{a quarter of a mile}} ahead, with the two junks they had chased the night before lying in front of it. Almost at the same moment a sudden uproar was heard--drums were beaten and gongs sounded.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} {{darkness}} {{appeared to be}} absolutely pitchy, but {{in a few minutes}} our eyes became so far accustomed to it that we could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> each other's presence--very dimly and vaguely, it is true. I could see nothing else in the room--only the black loom of the motionless figures. We were all taking the matter much more seriously than we had ever done before.|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman, after a moment's hesitation, {{lifted the}} latch {{of the door}} {{somewhat}} nervously. I affected to take no notice of him, so breathless was the haste with which our immense business connection compelled me to finger the keyboard: but, {{looking up at him}} under my eyelashes, I could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> he was a peculiarly bland and urbane old person, dressed with the greatest care, and some attention to fashion. His face was smooth; it tended towards portliness.|$|R
60|$|Shaken {{up by the}} {{changing}} moods of passion and tenderness, {{he must have been}} ready for any extravagance of conduct. Knowing the profound silence each night brought to that nook of the country, I could imagine them having the feeling of being the only two people on the wide earth. A row of six or seven lofty elms just across the road opposite the cottage made the night more obscure in that little garden. If these two could <b>just</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> each other that was all.|$|R
