25|$|Jianbing from Shandong {{province}} tastes crispy {{and harder}} as its batter is formed from the <b>flour</b> <b>mixture</b> that mainly contains coarse grains such as corn, sorghum and millet. In the old days, people had Shandong-style jianbing mainly by rolling it with scallions or serving it with meat soup. Nowadays, {{the variety of}} fillings are richer and differ according to one’s preference, for example, sweet potatoes, lettuce and pork are also used as fillings.|$|E
25|$|A common {{addition}} to cholent is kishke or helzel. Kishke {{is a type}} of kosher sausage stuffed with a <b>flour</b> <b>mixture,</b> chicken or goose fat, fried onions and spices. Traditionally, kishke was made with intestinal lining from a cow. Today, the casing is often an edible synthetic casing such as that used for salami or hot dogs. Helzel is chicken neck skin stuffed with a flour-based mixture similar to kishke and sewed with a thread and needle to ensure that it remains intact in long cooking.|$|E
25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the <b>flour</b> <b>mixture</b> to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Three yoghurt-based {{weaning foods}} (WF 1, WF 2 and WF 3) {{designed}} for 1 - 3 years old toddlers which prepared by blending of mung beans (Vigna radiata), soybean (Glycine max) and brown rice (Oryza sativa), were evaluated for their chemical, physical, microbial and organoleptic properties. Proximate compositions of the yoghurt-based weaning foods were varied significantly (P< 0. 05) and fulfilled the nutritional requirements {{given by the}} Protein Advisory Group Recommendations. Water binding capacity and water solubility index were varied significantly (P< 0. 05). Total plate counts obtained separately for yoghurt, extruded grain <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> and freshly prepared yoghurt-based weaning foods were within the recommendations. According to the sensory evaluation data, WF 1 scored higher on average by the panelists than WF 2 and WF 3 in terms of appearance, aroma, mouth feel and color. However, WF 2 was scored highly on average by the panelists in terms of taste and overall acceptability. Therefore, results suggests that yoghurt-based weaning foods are a potential tool for eliminating the protein-energy malnutrition among the children in developing countries which provide sufficient energy with good quality proteins in adequate levels through an cost effective way than conventional liquid-based staple cereal <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the baking}} industry, a {{difficult}} task {{is to keep the}} quality perceived by the consumer as constant as possible, given the inner variability of flour, e. g. due to different wheat mixtures, harvesting time, etc. Here, we evaluated the influence of flour batches properties on bread quality, considering an industrial bread making process. In particular, flour composition in terms of protein fractions (gliadins, glutenins) has been determined by means of RP-HPLC, to assess the inter- and intra-batch variability of <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> deliveries at a baking plant. Multivariate data analysis allowed evaluation of correlation between flour protein composition and technological properties. A great variability within different deliveries of a same flour batch emerged, as well as a considerable seasonal variability. Correlation models among protein sub-fractions, technological properties and bread quality are difficult to establish; however, the role of the protein profile on flour behaviour in bread making could be highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Wheat flour plays {{a pivotal}} role in {{determining}} the overall quality of bread (loaf dimensions, crumb texture and consistency). A precise knowledge of flour chemical and technological properties is of paramount importance for the baking industry, to tune the modifications of the recipe and production parameters. However, it is still common {{to have to deal with}} an empirical, trial and error-based approach, and generally, time consuming techniques are employed to determine the quality indexes for flour. In the context of an industrial bread-making process, this study addresses the evaluation of the effect of a systematic variation in the mixture composition of wheat flours on their properties. The main objective is to offer this field a more rigorous method to evaluate and improve flour properties, by employing experimental design methodologies and interpreting the results in a multivariate way, instead of the common one variable at a time approach. The results show that a careful planning of <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> when testing new varieties and formulation helps to obtain meaningful and easy-to-understand results as far as their properties are concerned...|$|R
40|$|The phase {{transitions}} of extruded corn-lentil snacks {{were investigated}} using different extrusion process conditions, which were feed rate (2. 52 - 6. 84 kg/h), extrusion temperature (170 - 230 degrees C) and feed moisture content (13 - 19 % wb). Lentil flour-corn <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> were used at ratios ranging from 10 - 50 %. Extrusion temperature, feed rate and feed moisture content decreased the specific mechanical energy during extrusion cooking. The sorption isotherm {{at room temperature}} of corn-lentil snacks was described successfully by the GAB model. The glass transition temperature of extrudates (midpoint of the specific heat shift) increased with feed rate, extrusion temperature, and lentil to corn ratio. Water acts as a plasticiser on extrudates, depressing their glass transition temperature. The Gordon-Taylor equation {{was used for the}} plasticisation description and had a good fit with the experimental data. Generally, as the moisture content decreased, the sharpness of glass transition also decreased. The formation of amylose-lipid complexes was confirmed by the presence of an endothermic peak.

In this study, using a completely randomized blocks design in the field, controlling effect of biological agents comprising mustard flour, Trichoderma koningii T 18, T. virens T 59, T. brevicompactum T 30, T. harzianum T 56, mixture of four Trichoderma isolates, mustard <b>flour</b> + <b>mixture</b> of four Trichoderma isolates and two commercial biological product of Trichodermin B and Subtilin were evaluated against wheat common bunt caused by Tilletia laevis. According to the infection index, all treatments were able to reduce infection percentage and showed significant differences (P&lt; 0. 01) compared to control (infected with T. laevis without any biological agent) in which heads infection was 43. 5 %. Treatments of Mustard flour and mustard <b>flour</b> + <b>mixture</b> of four isolates, reduced the disease by 89. 9 % and 87. 4 % respectively.

40|$|Millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is more {{resistant}} to climatic and soil conditions but the yields are lower than in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), therefore its cultivation was given up for decades in Hungary. Millet is a suitable raw material {{for the production of}} pasta products without using eggs and it has other advantageous physiological effects, therefore its cultivation in Hungary is expected again. Millet is a gluten free cereal so it is not able to create viscoelastic protein network. During the biochemical studies the activity of enzymes (peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase) influencing the colour of the <b>flour,</b> <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> (T. aestivum L., Triticum durum L., P. miliaceum L.), and pasta products were examined. Oxidoreductases in wheat flour have always been of interest to cereal chemists. The effects of peroxidase (EC 1. 11. 1. 7) (POX) are much less thoroughly documented, although they are reported to have a relatively high level of activity in different flours. These days there are also insufficient research data on how the millet in dry pasta modifies the enzyme activity and the storage stability and shelf life of dry pasta products...|$|R
40|$|Changes in extractability, {{amount and}} size {{distribution}} of polymeric proteins in the gluten of doughs during mixing were investigated. Ultracentrifugation {{was used as}} a non-destructive method to separate the gluten from the dough. Doughs prepared from commercial <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> of different gluten strengths and mixed for varying periods, were analysed. Proteins were detected using RP- and SE-HPLC. The percentages of large unextractable polymeric protein (UPP), total UPP and large unextractable monomeric protein (UMP) were higher in the gluten phases of all flours at minimum and optimum mixing, compared to the flours. After overmixing, the percentages of large UPP, total UPP and large UMP in the gluten phases of the dough decreased to lower levels than in the flours. Differences in percentages of large UPP, total UPP and large UMP between gluten phases of different flours and mixing times originated from the genetic composition of flour proteins. The extractability of the glutenins in the flours reflected the quality of the specific flour. The protein extractability, especially of gliadins, was different in the gluten phase compared to in the flour. Ionic interactions seem to be important forces in the dough. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{order to}} produce dough with a lower gluten content, more enriched with rice {{components}} and satisfactory rheological properties, the rheological properties, energetic value and cake baking properties of wheat and white or brown rice flour in shares from 3 to 30 % (w/w) were investigated in this paper. The water absorption in wheat-rice <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> was lower and decreased to 53. 5 % and 54. 0 % along {{with the increase of}} the white and the brown rice flour share, respectively, than in wheat flour, where it was 58. 8 %. In the dough made from rice flour, a gluten network had thinner filaments, about 2 and 1 μm in width for white and brown rice flour, respectively, compared to those in the dough from wheat flour only, where it was about 7 μm. The dough from rice flour had almost twice higher gelatinization maximum than the gelatinization maximum of the wheat flour only. The energetic values of the dough from rice flour were smaller than the energetic value of the wheat flour, for only 1. 32 %. Based on Cluster analysis, the white or brown rice flour share of 20 % was pointed out...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative-competitive {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} coupled with slab gel and capillary electrophoresis {{for the detection of}} roundup ready soybean and maize The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop a quantitative-competitive PCR (QC-PCR) method to detect DNA from transgenic herbicide-resistant (roundup ready, RR) soybean and maize. Since no QC-PCR system for the quantification of RR maize had been published at the time of writing, a specific competitor DNA for transgenic event was developed. For the QC-PCR of RR-soybean, a commercially available competitor was employed. These internal standards were calibrated by coamplifying with mixtures containing RR-soybean and maize DNAs. The calibrated QC-PCR systems were applied to certified RR-soybean and maize <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> in order to demonstrate their suitability not only for the quantification of the glyphosate resistance traits in DNA matrices, but also in practically relevant samples. In addition, a special focus of the present work was to compare the detection of QC-PCR products by slab gel and CGE with UV detection. CGE permitted the precise detection of transgenic events also below the equivalence points; while in slab gel electrophoresis, due to the low sensitivity the quantification of genetically modified DNA was allowed only at the equivalence point...|$|R

40|$|A mixture {{design of}} {{experiment}} approach was followed to explore formulation effects on the technological properties of wheat flours optimized for industrial bread-making purposes. Ten different <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> were investigated by means of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to obtain information on flour performance in a critical phase such as dough leavening. For each mixture, a laboratory-scale bread making experiment was carried out according to a standardized recipe and the leavening phase of each dough sample was monitored by means of NIRS at different times. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to highlight the existence of differences among the mixtures {{on the basis of}} NIR spectrum variability with respect to the leavening time. Additionally, the relationship among the 3 -way NIR dataset and some parameters measured on the baked bread loaves (dimensions, volume, weight) was investigated by means of the n-way extension of partial least squares regression (nPLS), in order to evaluate product properties from its leavening step and mixture formulation. The results give better insight on the relationships among wheat flour formulation and its performance in the leavening phase and as far as some properties of the final product are concerned, thus offering a way to monitor the leavening phase and give information on its influence on the final product properties...|$|R
40|$|Whole cereal flours (buckwheat, barley, and oat) {{and wheat}} bran {{were used to}} {{substitute}} 20 % of white bakery wheat flour to prepare round rolls. Round roll quality was evaluated by determining total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, antioxidative capacity, the content of lipid hydroperoxides (primary oxidation products), and sensory profiling. Moreover, {{the stability of the}} phenolic compounds and antioxidant behaviour throughout processing was studied. Technological processing does not cause any significant loss of phenolics (less than 5 %). A significant increase in antioxidants and phenolics of the <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> and final products were observed compared to those of white wheat round rolls (as control). Buckwheat and barley round roll crumbs contained the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and were the most effective in enhancing antioxidant activity, which increased 15 -fold and 8 -fold, respectively, when compared to the control roll. The tested cereals effectively retarded formation of lipid hydroperoxides (from over 50 % to control), which are undesirable from both a nutrition and storage/shelf life perspective.
