In an opiniated article, Anthony Giddens claimed that in contrast to Blairite, the adjective used to refer to the political ideology of Tony Blair, Brownites tend to be less enthusiastic about market driven reforms such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals and more keen {{on the role of the}} state, less critical of Labour's links to the unions and critical of media management techniques such as the use of spin doctors. Will Hutton opined: [...] "Like Tony Blair he Brown is a believer in a pluralist and <b>fair</b> society, social <b>mobility,</b> and marrying economic efficiency with social justice." ...|$|R
50|$|As elsewhere, {{accurate}} {{figures for}} the extent of prostitution in Northern Ireland are difficult to ascertain, given the covert nature of the activities, although the police estimated 40-100 people were working in the sex trade in 2010. As in other countries, street prostitution has declined in favour of off-street prostitution. As with much of Europe, {{there appears to be}} a <b>fair</b> amount of <b>mobility</b> of prostitutes in and out of the territory, particularly in Belfast. While exact numbers are very hard to obtain, the 2014 research suggested between 300 and 350 people working on any particular day, the majority of whom were women, with the commonest age range being 25 - 30. The researchers found that under-age prostitutes were uncommon, and that most prostitutes did not start till they were of legal age.|$|R

This project was initially designed to address the need to share innovative teaching practices through {{the development of}} new methodologies and multidisciplinary approach in teachinglearning processes in the 2 nd and 3 rd cycles of basic education combined with the stimulation of entrepreneurial skills and co-creation of knowledge. From the beginning, the project had the collaboration and support of the Hands-on Science Network Association, having given rise to the submission of an application to the 13 th edition of the contest “Projeto Ciência na Escola” of the Ilídio Pinho Foundation on the topic “Science and Technology at the service of a better world”. This application has been selected for the 2 nd phase of the competition and obtained financial support for the development of activities which gave an added dimension to the project, attracting and further motivating students for learning science and the choice of technology areas. Students were challenged to identify a situation/problem and find a possible solution/answer in the context of educational robotics. Thus, there was the study of the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT programming environment for programming routines or scripts and simultaneously the work methodology hands-on was implemented using participative methodological approaches, enhancing the development of key skills and entrepreneur spirit. At first, students’ creativity was stimulated through the ideas generation process called SCAMPER, channelling it to solve situations/problem where the students' task was to unlock a situation and optimize it. From a simple stick and a simulation of a path for blind people, ideas were collected to innovate this object, in order to promote a more efficient and <b>fairer</b> <b>mobility.</b> With the collection/gathering of ideas/suggestions, a guiding principle for our project was developed giving an intended metacognitive knowledge. Starting with the acquisition of this knowledge, students focus on building and programming robots LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT, developing the prototype of a smart and innovative cane for the blind people. This is an interactive process that combines the concrete and the abstract in solving a problem involving steps such as: design, implementation, construction, automation and control mechanism. In all of these steps the construction of knowledge took place, arising from different scientific fields (science, mathematics, physics, technology), as well as the acquisition of transversal skills. The work focused mainly on the dynamics of the process rather than the products or results. Many citizenship skills were developed when creating a tool to minimize the difficulties and obstacles faced by blind people, enabling the improvement of their quality of life. It was observed, from certain experimental activities, that one can transfer new skills and knowledge acquired at school to everyday life...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{potential}} impact of a World’s <b>Fair</b> on urban <b>mobility</b> in Los Angeles County by 2022. A brief historical account of World’s Fairs, and their impact on technological innovations in transportation will be given in conjunction with the development of transportation in Los Angeles. These accounts will help to contextualize an analysis of current plans to provide Los Angeles with transportation solutions, in light of the oversaturated automobile landscape in place today. Specifically, my research has revealed that the further development of light-speed rail systems paired alongside a mass adoption of autonomous vehicles would both alleviate contemporary transportation issues across Los Angeles County and accommodate the audience of international spectators that future mega-events may attract. Particular attention is paid to the Los Angeles World’s Fair for its ability to galvanize the resources and support that these transportation innovations require. I therefore conclude that the Los Angeles World Fair should direct its focus principally in support of these aforementioned technologies, as opposed to other less feasible transportations solutions such as the Hyperloop...|$|R

A global I_SUM value of 0. 747 confirmed that the city has indeed very positive characteristics regarding sustainable mobility policies. However, some deficiencies were also detected, particularly with respect to non-motorized transport modes. The application has also served to show that a few I_SUM indicators were not able to capture some of the positive aspects of the city, what may suggest the need of changes in their formulation. Finally, the index application in parts of the city suggests that the city provides <b>fair</b> and equitable <b>mobility</b> conditions to all citizens throughout the city. This is certainly a good attribute for becoming a benchmark of sustainable mobility, even if it is not yet the ideal model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} evidence for burial in archaic Rome and Latium {{with a view to}} understanding the nature of urban development in the region. In particular, I focus on identifying those social and political institutions that governed relations between city-states at a time when Rome was becoming the most influential urban center in the area. I examine {{the evidence for}} burial gathered primarily from the past four decades or so of archaeological excavation in order to present first, a systematic account of the data and second, an analysis of these materials. I reveal that a high degree of variation was observed in funerary ritual across sites, and suggest that this points to a complex system of regional networks that allowed for the widespread travel of people and ideas. I view this as evidence for the openness of archaic societies in Latium, whereby people and groups seem to have moved across regions with what {{seems to have been a}} <b>fair</b> degree of <b>mobility.</b> I connect the variety in tomb construction to the more widespread phenomenon of monumentalization, which encouraged the construction in stone of residences, temples and public buildings across the region. I consider the individuals and groups responsible for these types of construction, and how they contributed to the development of and interaction between city-states. I begin with an assessment of the historical reliability of the ancient sources concerning early Rome, since they were written centuries later than the time in question, yet comment on some of the features in the archaeological record. I go on to consider the literary evidence for funerary ritual in early Rome, in order to determine what the ancient sources have to say about the customs of their ancestors and what significance this has for the archaeological evidence. Then, I consider the documentary evidence for funerary ritual, which comes from the legislation of the Twelve Tables. The prohibitions preserved here, if they represent a valid document, illustrate the concerns of lawmakers with regard to funerary activity in and around the city of Rome. In the following section I present the archaeological evidence for burial, and provide a detailed summary of archaic burials according to site, and offer a brief description of each settlement in order to better contextualize the data. I conclude this section with an interpretation of the evidence. Finally, I concentrate on the archaeological evidence from archaic Gabii, which results from my own participation on the excavation of the site. The results of these excavations allow for the study of the intersection between the urban area, burial and landownership...|$|R
