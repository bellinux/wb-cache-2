Also important is the Council's work on approximation of the legal acts in the area of defense and military development.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of {{direct and indirect}} deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated by the World Health Organisation to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age. The multiple interdependencies between malnutrition and infectious diseases {{make it very difficult}} to quantify the portion of malnutrition that is caused by infectious diseases which are in turn caused by unsafe WASH practices. Based on <b>expert</b> <b>opinions</b> and a literature survey, researchers at WHO arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections as a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{modeling}} of maintenance downtime distribution requires sufficient and good quality data. However, {{in the absence}} of those conditions of data, an alternative method using <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> inputs is usually employed. Literature on the applications of <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in modeling maintenance downtime is found fairly limited. This study aims to fill in that gap and suggest a practical way of incorporating <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in the modeling. A case study of an offshore gas compression train system is presented here to describe the approach used in {{modeling of}} preventive maintenance downtime using <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> Using right set of questionnaires and a fractile technique, downtime distributions are successfully elicited from expert. The comparison analysis shows that the downtime distribution derived from <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> is tighter than the one estimated solely based on raw plant maintenance data, indicating that the <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> approach is a good alternative for estimating the downtime measures of maintenance tasks...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{takes an}} argumentation {{approach}} {{to find the}} place of trust in a method for evaluating arguments from <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> The method uses the argumentation scheme for argument from <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> along with its matching set of critical questions. It shows how to use this scheme in three formal computational argumentation models that provide tools to analyze and evaluate instances of argument from <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> The paper uses several examples to illustrate {{the use of these}} tools. A conclusion of the paper is that from an argumentation point of view, it is better to critically question arguments from <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> than to accept or reject them based solely on trust...|$|R

The Internet, {{facilitated by the}} development of search engines, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and <b>expert</b> <b>opinions,</b> thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books, MIT's release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine. In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated. In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the Britannica has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust. Eventually, the Britannica turned to focus more on its online edition.|$|E

500|$|In March 1998 the Crime Commission {{released}} its findings, {{stating that the}} crimes that resulted in convictions occurred substantially in the way described to the courts, that no further charges would be laid as Webster had acted alone in both the murder and the assault that immediately preceded it, and that police had not acted inappropriately in their decision not to charge other persons. It did, however, criticise some police procedures and practices. The review did {{not comment on the}} discrepancies between Webster's confession and the forensic evidence, and it did not clarify whether forensic evidence was ever sent for testing. A representative for the Commission refused to comment on whether Wilson's blood-stained shirt was ever tested. One expert opinion obtained by the Commission wrote that it was [...] "likely [...] engaged in sexual behaviour which demeaned Leigh and to which he will never admit because he is ashamed and embarrassed", and Dr Johan Duflou said that a finger or penis was unlikely to have caused Leigh's severe genital damage. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong stated that these <b>expert</b> <b>opinions,</b> which contradict Webster's confession, raised questions on how the Commission concluded that Leigh's sexual assault occurred in the manner to which he had confessed, also raising doubts about several of the Commission's other findings. The Crime Commission released one of their two reports on the matter; their second unpublished report was handed over to the Police Integrity Commission (PIC) for investigation.|$|E

2500|$|While the season's fashionable use of Vestiges as a {{conversation}} piece in London society avoided theological implications, {{the book was}} read very differently in Liverpool, where it was first made public that men of science condemned the book, and it {{became the subject of}} sustained debate in newspapers. The book was attractive to reformers, including Uniformitarians and William Ballantyne Hodgson, the principal of the Mechanics' Institution who, like Chambers, had become a supporter of George Combe's ideas. In defence of public morals and Evangelical Tory dominance in the city, the Reverend Abraham Hume, an Anglican priest and lecturer, delivered a detailed attack on Vestiges at the Liverpool Literary and Philosophical Society on 13 January 1845, demonstrating that the book conflicted with standard specialist scientific texts on nebulae, fossils and embryos, and accusing it of manipulative novelistic techniques occupying [...] "the debatable ground between science and fiction". At the next meeting two weeks later John Robberds, son of John Gooch Robberds the minister, defended the book as well-intentioned and based on [...] "deep reflection and extensive research", while noting that he considered it inconsistent in distinguishing miracles from natural law, against his Unitarian views. As subsequent debates appeared inconclusive, Hume wrote to leading men of science for authoritative <b>expert</b> <b>opinions,</b> and made the responses public to resolve the dispute. This backfired when a writer in the Liverpool Journal pointed out inconsistencies and contradictions between the various <b>expert</b> <b>opinions.</b> They only agreed on the point that Vestiges was unscientific, and the publication of their letters was considered bad manners as well as tactically unwise. Few of the experts would have allowed any direct reference to the book to be published under their names, and their gentlemanly disagreements to be made public.|$|E

Objective: To examine {{the use of such}} <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in determining comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis/eczema (AD/E), which were assessed as part of a recent third-party payer cost-of-illness study. Design: To identify the disease-related comorbidities that would represent costs associated with AD/E, physicians on an expert panel were asked individually and then collectively to group all International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Edition-Clinical Modification (ICD- 9 -CM) diagnosis codes as Results: The mean prevalence rate of any diagnosis code in the AD/E population was 0. 65 +- 1. 82 % (SD) with a mean odds ratio of 1. 81 +- 0. 96. Comorbidities considered by the expert panel Conclusions: Comparing the result of consensus panels with actual claims histories validated the use of <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in determining comorbidities associated with AD/E. <b>Expert</b> <b>opinion</b> yielded valid results in terms of identifying comorbidities that manifested frequently and disproportionately in the AD/E population. Limited statistical measurements of comorbidities would have been less specific than <b>expert</b> <b>opinion.</b> Future cost-of-illness studies should consider alternative data sources and methodologies to enhance the validity and importance of <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> and to corroborate their findings.
