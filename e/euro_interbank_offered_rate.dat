25|$|On 27 March 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to lend $250 million to BMRC to part-finance Phase 2 of the metro rail project. The loan marked the multilateral lending agency's foray into the urban transport sector in South Asia, the ADB said in a press release. The loan, approved by the ADB Board in March 2011, is the first ADB loan to the urban transport sector without recourse to sovereign guarantees. In 2016, the Agence Francaise De Development (AFD) sanctioned a 1,600 crore loan for the project. The rate of interest on the loan is linked to <b>Euro</b> <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (Euribor) + 130 basis points. In early 2017, the European Investment Bank agreed to loan 3,700 crore to the BMRCL, with a repayment period of 20 years {{at a rate of}} interest lower than the one on the AFD loan.|$|E

40|$|The London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and the <b>Euro</b> <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> (Euribor) are two {{key market}} {{benchmark}} interest rates {{used in a}} plethora of financial contracts with notional amounts running into the hundreds of trillions of dollars. The integrity of the rate-setting process for these benchmarks has been under intense scrutiny ever since the first reports of attempts of manipulation of these rates surfaced in 2007. In this paper, we analyze Libor and Euribor rate submissions by the individual panel banks and {{shed light on the}} underlying manip-ulation potential, by quantifying their effects on the final rate set (the “fixing”). We explicitly take into account the possibility of collusion between several market participants. Our setup allows us to quantify such effects for the actual rate-setting process that is in place at present, and compare it to several alternative rate-setting procedures. We find that such alternative rate fixings, particularly methodologies that eliminate outliers based on the time-series information, and larger sample sizes, could significantly reduce the effect of manipulation. Furthermore, we discuss th...|$|E
40|$|As of 1997, private adjustable-rate loan {{contracts}} must {{be provided}} with a clause governing interest rate changes which meets {{the requirements of the}} Consumer Protection Act. This legal stipulation is of particular importance for private loans granted by banks and for loans to individuals. More than two-thirds of all private loans granted by Austrian banks provide for variable interest rates and are thus subject to fluctuation mechanisms which need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. Most of the private adjustable-rate loans granted by banks since 1997 include an interest rate adjustment clause according to which any change in the interest rate needs {{to be based on the}} arithmetic mean from the Vienna Interbank Offered Rate for three-month funds or (as of the start of Monetary Union) the <b>Euro</b> <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> for three-month funds and the secondary market yield for federal bonds. Empirical evidence obtained from simple correlation and regression analyses supports the assumption that the standard rate covenant fully complies with the relevant criteria of the Consumer Protection Act ("factual justification" or "independence from the entrepreneur's will"). The change of the average obtained from the two interest indicators reflects to a high degree the development of average refinancing costs by the Austrian banks since the mid 1990 s (for database reasons, a comparison with the period before 1995 is not possible). An attractive and relatively simple theoretical approach to justifying the standard rate clause is provided by interpreting it as a rule for sharing macroeconomically caused interest rate risks. Assuming approximately risk-neutral banks, this adjustment mechanism warrants that the non-diversifiable macroeconomic risk of a change in the interest rate is optimally spread between approximately risk-neutral borrowers and investors. In the given context of the model, an optimal situation for all players involved is obtained when banks on balance carry no risk, whereas the borrower and investor share the macro-economic risk of a change in the interest rate at equal parts. Near-risk-neutral banks carry the macroeconomic risk of a change in the interest rate (at 50 percent) only when the borrower and investor belong to different risk preference categories (e. g., the borrower is averse to risk and the investor is more or less risk-neutral, or vice versa).

40|$|In Eurobanking, the London <b>Interbank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate</b> {{is often}} {{assumed to be}} the {{reference}} rate for Eurocurrency loan transactions.
