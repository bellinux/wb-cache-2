5|$|Johann Christoph Denner is {{generally}} believed to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> the clarinet in Germany {{around the year}} 1700 by adding a register key to the earlier chalumeau. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability.|$|E
5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, it {{is common}} for {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> it. After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E

5|$|Charles Redheffer was an American {{inventor}} {{who claimed}} to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> a perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.|$|E
5|$|Many {{countries}} in Europe use pure or hydrogenated rapeseed oil for deep-frying. The deep-fried Mars bar originated in Scotland, with The Carron Fish Bar in Stonehaven claiming to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> {{it in the}} early 1990s. Fish and chips is a very popular deep-fried dish in England since it originated in London in the 19th century and became popular among the working class. Its popularity continues with 229 million portions of fish and chips being sold annually in England.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the themes}} of Hemming's work is the depredations {{suffered}} by his monastery {{at the hands of}} royal officials. One such notorious official from the last decade of King Æthelred's reign is Eadric Streona ("Grasper"), ealdorman of Mercia, blamed for having appropriated land held by the church in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire and for having incorporated the ancient county of Winchcombeshire into Gloucestershire. Hemming may <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> Eadric's byname of Streona, as it is not attested before appearing in Hemming's work.|$|E

5|$|Rishabhanatha is {{credited}} in Jainism to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> and taught fire, cooking, and all skills needed {{for human beings}} to live. In total, Rishabhanatha {{is said to have}} taught seventy-two sciences to men, and sixty-four to women. According to Paul Dundas, Rishabhanatha in Jain mythology is thus not merely a spiritual teacher but one who founded knowledge in its various forms and a form of culture hero for the current cosmological cycle.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

5|$|Jackie's account {{generated}} much media attention, and UVA {{suspended the}} fraternity. After other journalists investigated the article's claims and found significant discrepancies, Rolling Stone issued multiple apologies for the story. Further investigation concluded that Jackie had fabricated the incident. According to multiple media, Jackie may <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> the gang rape story in an unsuccessful attempt {{to win the}} affections of a fellow student {{that she had a}} romantic interest in; other sources suggested that PTSD might be a factor in Jackie's creation of the story. Later, Jackie herself said that she believed her story at the time.|$|E
5|$|Once he was {{sufficiently}} recovered Cragh undertook {{a pilgrimage to}} Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh {{said that he would}} make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.|$|E
5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier piece by writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E

5|$|Although the Greeks and Romans {{did much}} to advance water clock technology, they still {{continued}} to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, is said to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though {{little is known about}} it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.|$|E
5|$|The Gospels {{say that}} Jesus was betrayed to the {{authorities}} by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable. He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God {{as a threat to}} Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed. The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision. Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> the painful death of their leader.|$|E
5|$|The Thomas S. Jones organ {{builders}} {{were based}} at No.25 Pentonville Road between 1860 and 1935. The Dunn & Hewett cocoa factory was established at No.9 Pentonville Road in 1833 by Daniel Dunn, {{who went into}} partnership with Charles Hewett in the 1850s. The business claimed to <b>have</b> <b>invented</b> soluble chocolate and cocoa, and moved to No.136, expanding to No.138 in the 1870s. The building was enlarged and partially rebuilt over the 1880s and 90s, and included a staff tea-room at No.140 by 1907. The factory closed around 1930 and was subsequently sub-let to various businesses. The Ealing Radiator Company was established at Nos.152–154 Pentonville Road in 1936, manufacturing car radiators. A first floor extension was added in 1952, while Nos.136–150 were cleared to accommodate a low metal-framed building. These premises have now been sub-let to various businesses.|$|E
