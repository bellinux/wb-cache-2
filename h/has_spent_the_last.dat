He believes the meeting will be quite simple and quick, but once there he is confronted by Devon Banks (Will Arnett) who has begun working with the federal government. Devon reveals that he <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> year since being fired from GE in [...] "Do-Over" [...] working to get back at Jack by making connections in the Barack Obama administration through a friendship with the president's daughters, Sasha and Malia. Devon leaks Jack's controversial testimony from the hearing, believing that public pressure will force Jack to resign in three days. Jack spends that time asking the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff writers—Frank, Lutz, and James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell)—to come up with an idea [...] "as good as the light bulb" [...] to improve the microwave. They try to incorporate suggestions such as making the microwave bigger or making them break down more often so they require replacement, but Jack eventually abandons the project as a failure. However, instead of leaving GE, Jack convinces Devon to give the company bailout money (which he had previously refused), effectively making Devon Jack's boss.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, he {{starred in}} {{an unusually high}} number of films. He first {{appeared}} opposite Polly Shannon in Direct Action under Sidney J. Furie, portraying Sergeant Frank Gannon, an officer who <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three years on the Direct Action Unit (DAU) task force, fighting gang crime and corruption and after he leaves he is hunted down by former colleagues for betraying the brotherhood. Next he appeared in Ed Bye's Fat Slags, a film adaption of a comic strip The Fat Slags {{which appeared in the}} [...] "alternative" [...] British comic Viz. His role {{was little more than a}} cameo role alongside Geri Halliwell, Naomi Campbell and Angus Deayton. Reviews of the film were so poor that it remains on the IMDb's Bottom 100 as one of the worst movies ever made. He next appeared in Christopher Kulikowski's science fiction picture Retrograde alongside Gary Daniels and Joe Sagal. It tells the story of [...] "a group of genetically unique people who travel back in time to prevent the discovery of meteors containing deadly bacteria." [...] Shot in Italy, the film received the support of the Film Fund of Luxembourg. Finally he made his directorial debut, replacing Sidney J. Furie who got ill during pre-production, [...] with The Defender, in which he also starred alongside Shakara Ledard and Jerry Springer, who played the President of the United States. Lundgren plays Lance Rockford, the bodyguard of the head of the National Security Agency, Roberta Jones (Caroline Lee-Johnson), in a war on terror.|$|E
500|$|The {{bombing was}} {{condemned}} by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by {{individual members of}} parliament (MPs) as a [...] "sickening", [...] "callous" [...] and [...] "barbaric" [...] terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, [...] "This explosion looks like {{the work of the}} IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here". Sinn Féin was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being [...] "struck mute" [...] on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as [...] "a {{slap in the face to}} people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn Féin a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire". [...] The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was [...] "deeply outraged by the bomb explosion" [...] and joined Bruton and Major in [...] "utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism". Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued [...] "it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn Féin and seeking to isolate republicans". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it [...] "sincerely regretted" [...] causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:The British Government <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle. We are still prepared to enhance the democratic peace process [...] but if there is to be a lasting peace [...] then the British Government must put the democratic rights of all of the people of Ireland before its own party political self interest.|$|E

Cha-ok, who hasn't seen her daughter in a decade and is now MSC's nightly news anchor and section chief, fails In-ha at her final interview, saying a reporter with Pinocchio syndrome would be useless. Seeing how hurt In-ha is at her mother's rejection, Dal-po becomes determined to help her achieve her dream and announces that he wants to become a reporter as well. A month later, In-ha and Dal-po apply at YGN's [...] "blind" [...] audition for broadcast news reporters, but only Dal-po gets hired. When confronted by Gyo-dong, now-chief of YGN's news desk, Dal-po confesses his real identity as well as his real motive for taking the job: he wants to find his older brother Jae-myung and clear their father's name. But what he doesn't know is that Jae-myung has taken revenge on the factory workers who lied about their father by killing two of them and framing the third one. Meanwhile, with MSC's credibility rating at an all-time low, Cha-ok hires In-ha, using her Pinocchio syndrome in a publicity stunt. Thus, Dal-po and In-ha become rookies at rival networks, and among their colleagues are Seo Beom-jo, who comes from a rich, sheltered chaebol background and has a connection to In-ha via a wrong cellphone number, and Yoon Yoo-rae, once an idol sasaeng fan who now uses those obsessive and determined traits in her new job.|$|E
