The government of South Korea has implemented <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming</b> that encompasses organic farming. Despite the promotion of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming,</b> it still has a low share in South Korea and partially converted farming has emerged in some districts of South Korea. However, the partially converted farming {{has not yet been}} investigated by the government. Thus, our study implemented a financial analysis to compare the annual costs and net returns of conventional, partially converted and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming</b> in Gangwon Province. The result showed that <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming</b> was more profitable with respect to farm net returns. To find out the factors affecting the adoption of <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming,</b> multinomial logistic regression was implemented. The findings revealed that education and subsidy positively and significantly influenced the probability of farmers' choice on partially converted and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming.</b> Farm size had a negative and significant relationship with only <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farming.</b> This study will contribute to future policy establishment for sustainable agriculture as recommended by improving the quality of fertilizers, suggesting the additional investigation associated with partially converted farmers. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

To this end we first have to identify the production frontier and relative efficiency level for each animal-oriented farm in the sample. The production frontier and efficiency index for each type of farm (assuming no specific production functions) are identified using Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) techniques. We then address the relationship between relative efficiency, <b>farm</b> size, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behavior by carrying out a nonparametric regression of efficiency, on economic size, a proxy for the degree of environmental appropriateness, and regional dummies. Calculations of the efficiency of the farms including direct subsidies are compared with the counterfactual exercise in the case in which direct subsidies are not considered. Finally, we look for relations between subsidies and factors such as farm size, efficiency, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> behavior. One key result shows that, on average direct payments generally tend to increase efficiency. However, in most of the cases the mean efficiency decreases as the percentage of direct payments rises.

40|$|Agri-environmental {{measures}} play {{an important}} role in Italian rural areas, as shown by the financial commitment to the Rural Development programmes. However, in contrast with other European Union (EU) countries, policy-makers still have limited experience on how farmers approach environmental incentive schemes. This paper casts new light on this issue from a northern Italian perspec- tive. The rationale of the farmers’ decision-making process is explored using two multinomial models. The first explains the probability of non-participation or participation in one of three specific agri-environmental measures. The model outcomes show that labour-intensive farming types and high dependency of household income on farming activity constrain farmers’ participation, whereas previous experience, easy-to-implement <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farm</b> practices and adequate compensation of extra costs encourage participation. The second model explores the effect of farmers’ attitudes and beliefs on their predispositions towards participation in any of the schemes. The results highlight that, besides income factors, the farm’s future in the business, and the relationship with neigh- bouring farmers and their opinions on <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> practices all have significant effects on adoption of agri-environmental measures. The paper concludes by suggesting that farmers’ attitudes and beliefs, as well as the local behavioural influences, have to be taken into account when designing and commu- nicating agri-environmental measures...|$|R

40|$|Meeting {{the goals}} of {{sustainable}} growth of food production and reducing rural poverty requires assisting family farmers to develop more productive, profitable, resource efficient and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> <b>farms.</b> Faced with decreasing product prices and increasing production costs {{during the last two}} decades family farmers in south Uruguay tried to maintain their income by intensifying their farms, growing larger areas of fewer crops and increasing the use of irrigation and agrochemicals. Soil degradation was aggravated by this process, limiting crop yields, undermining the farmers’ aim of maintaining their income. A model-aided explorative study had shown that decreasing the area of vegetables, introducing crop rotations, cover crops and manure applications, and including beef-cattle production would be a better strategy. To test this hypothesis, a project was started at the end of 2004 and expanded in 2007, involving farmers, technical advisers and scientists in a co-innovation process that combined systemic diagnosis and redesign of the farm systems, social learning and dynamic monitoring and evaluation. The project involved 14 farms representing a large range of variation in resource endowment. Main problems found on all farms were deteriorated soil quality and low labour productivity, which resulted in low income and high work load. At the end of 2 – 5 years of redesign farmers had been able to implement most innovations planned. Irrespective of endowment with land, machinery, irrigation water or labour resources, re-design increased the per capita family income (FIp) and the income per hour of family labour (IH) on 13 out of 14 farms, by 51 % and 50 %, respectively, averaged over all farms. Soil organic carbon content had increased on 11 out of 14 farms and estimated erosion rates in vegetable fields had halved. Farmers considered ‘multi-year planning’ the most important change introduced into their practice by the project. They concluded that the role of the extension service agents should change from mere consultants of operational–tactical, crop-centred decisions to supporters of the process of farm planning and evaluation. The project showed that even on commercial farms operating under highly competitive conditions, substantial improvements in economic and environmental indicators can be achieved when a whole farm strategic redesign is elaborated...|$|R

However, it also has negative impact on {{human health and the environment}} such as pesticide residues and land degradation. Entering the 21 st century, people's awareness regarding the environment and nature has increased and a “back to nature” lifestyle has emerged. Therefore, organic farming, that does not use chemo-synthetic inputs, has become one of the alternatives, and through maintaining harmony with nature, it can be the means to achieve sustainable agriculture. The objectives of this paper are as follows: (1) to investigate the appropriate approaches for the development and extension of organic farming, (2) to give an overview of the process of organic farming development in case of West Java and North Sumatra, and (3) to investigate the importance of joint marketing of organic produce.

These indexes are at the same level of EU countries and approaching those of the USA. This rapid development has resulted in debt accumulation in Hokkaido and raised the environ-mental issue of manure management. The proper processing of dairy farm manure would solve the water pollution problem and provide a source of organic fertilizer for upland farming. To turn this environmental negative into a positive requires the cooperation of dairy and upland farmers and financial incentives from the government. To secure management stability and <b>environmentally</b> <b>friendly</b> dairy <b>farming,</b> a price policy for processed milk and a direct payment system to farmers are necessary. The basic premise of the price policy is that it will allow the level of milk prices to gradually reach that of advanced dairy farming countries without depleting resources, over-loading the environment with cow waste, resorting to low wages, or the need for low land rents. The original intent of the direct payment system was to supplement incomes due to declining milk prices. To improve the system the government must increase the amount of money allocated for payments and make the system more flexible. Direct payments should reward farmers who increase the planted area of forage per cow, because this will decrease the environmental load and reduce water pollution. Moreover, the system should reward upland farmers who prove that they use manure as fertilizer...|$|R
