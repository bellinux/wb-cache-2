The {{relative importance of}} genetics and the environment in causing schizophrenia is still being debated. Although the high proportion of monozygote cotwins of schizophrenia patients who are discordant suggests {{that there may be}} a significant environmental contribution to the development of schizophrenia, this discordance is predicted by an accumulative multimutation model of schizophrenia onset constructed here implying a genetic origin of schizophrenia. In this model, schizophrenics are viewed as having been born with the genetic susceptibility to develop schizophrenia. As susceptible gene carriers age, they randomly accumulate the necessary mutations to cause schizophrenia, the last needed mutation coinciding with disease onset. The mutation model predicts that the concordance rate in monozygote twin studies will monotonically increase with age, theoretically approaching 100 % given sufficient longevity. In <b>dizygote</b> cotwins of schizophrenia patients, the model predicts that at least 71 % of cotwins are incapable of developing schizophrenia even though every cotwin and their schizophrenic twin shared a similar early environment. The multimutation model is shown to fit all of the monozygote and <b>dizygote</b> concordance rate data of the principle classical twin studies completed before 1970 considered in this paper. Thus, the genetic hypothesis of schizophrenia can be tested by bringing these studies up to date. 1...|$|E

The devebopmemit of frank hemolytic disease in the twin hebongimig to blood group B, {{in the absence of}} recognizable abmiormalities imi the group A twin was the indication for a detailed study of the behavior of the anti-A and amiti-B antibodies in the mother amid irs both infants. The observations were designed to throw light on the question of transplacental passage, specificity and mode of actiomi of maternal antibodies in ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a visual feedback control of eye growth in humans is controversial, as the contributions of genetic and environmental factors are still unknown. To evaluate the heritability of refractive defects, we measured ocular refraction in 19 monozygote and 20 <b>dizygote</b> twin pairs (mean age 5 years). Monozygosity was ascertained by a common chorion, similarity of somatic traits, and identical dermatogliphes and was confirmed in myopes by blood marker diagnosis. Ocular refractive defects and axial length were evaluated by cycloplegic autorefractometry and biometry. By comparing identical and fraternal twins heritability of refractive defects {{was estimated to be}} 0. 08 - 0. 14; this low value indicates that the observed variability in refractive errors is nongenetic in origin. Three monozygote pairs were anisomyopic; differences between eyes in identical twins were related to the increased axial length of myopic eyes. In one eye, myopia was attributed to visual deprivation induced by a congenital cataract, while in five eyes it was correlated directly to the degree of astigmatic defects. The discordant axial length observed in monozygote twins is nongenetic. In agreement with previous findings reported in the literature, it is proposed that visual impoverishment of retinal images may play an early regulatory role in postnatal eye growth...|$|E
40|$|The long {{incubation}} period in leprosy, variable manifestations of disease viz. lepromatous, tuberculoid, indeterminate etc. strongly, indicate the possible role of immune mechanism, particularly so, when M. leprae has low infectivity. Immune mechanism may possibly {{be affected by}} nutritional, genetic, hortnon 2 il and biochemical factors. Chakravarty and Vogal (1973) have examined large number of identical and non-identical twins in endemic areas. They find high incidence of leprosy in monozygotes than in <b>dizygotes</b> twins. In malnutrition, immunity responses are impaired, so also in lepromatous leprosy. Whether malnutrition which is so often present in leprosy patients, aggravate the disease course is a hypothesis.

40|$|Background: Susceptibility to bleomycin-induced {{chromatid}} {{breaks in}} cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes {{may reflect the}} way a person deals with carcinogenic challenges. This susceptibility (also referred to as mutagen sensitivity) {{has been found to}} be increased in patients with environmentally related cancers, including cancers of the head and neck, lung, and colon, and, in combination with carcinogenic exposure, this susceptibility can greatly influence cancer risk. The purpose of this study was to assess the heritability of mutagen sensitivity. Methods: Heritability was determined by use of a maximum likelihood method that employed the FISHER package of pedigree analysis. Bleomycin-induced breaks per cell values for 135 healthy volunteers without cancer were determined. These individuals were from 53 different pedigrees and included 25 monozygotic twin pairs (n = 50), 14 pairs of <b>dizygotes</b> (twin pairs and siblings, n...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{studies showing that}} mutagen sensitivity is a cancer predisposition factor, the heritability of mutagen sensitivity has not been clearly established. In this report, we used a classic twin study design to examine the role of genetic and environmental factors on the mutagen sensitivity pheno-type. Mutagen sensitivity was measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 460 individuals [148 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins, 57 pairs of dizygotic (DZ) twins, and 50 siblings]. The intraclass correlation coefficients were all significantly higher in MZ twins than in <b>dizygotes</b> (DZ pairs and MZ-sibling pairs combined) for sensitivity to four different mutagen challenges. Applying biometric genetic modeling, we calcu-lated a genetic heritability of 40. 7 %, 48. 0 %, 62. 5 %, and 58. 8 % for bleomycin, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide,;-radiation, and 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide sensitivity, respectively. This study provides the strongest and most direct evidence that mutagen sensitivity is highly heritable, thereby validating the use of mutagen sensitivity as a cancer susceptibility factor.

40|$|SAMMENDRAG Med utgangspunkt i data fra et populasjonsbasert utvalg av 7 992 norske tvillinger ble sammenhengen mellom gjentatte ørebetennelser og forhold under svangerskapet studert. Som parametre på intrauterine vekstforhold ble informasjon om fødselsvekt og gestasjonsalder fra Medisinsk Fødselsregister benyttet. Informasjon om rapporterte øreinfeksjoner ble basert på spørreskjemaer som ble besvart av tvillingene i alderen 18 – 25 år. Først studerte vi individuelle effekter av fødselsvekt og gestasjonsalder på forekomsten av {{otitis media}} (OM). Rapportert fødselsvekt hos individer med OM var signifikant lavere enn hos kontrollene, med en gjennomsnittsforskjell på 86 gram. Hos de som rapporterte OM var gjennomsnittlig gestasjonsalder 3 dager kortere enn i kontrollmaterialet. Deretter beregnet vi effekten av fødselsvekt ved bruk av co-twin kontroll metoden. Blant monozygote (MZ) tvillingpar gjenspeiler fødselsvektforskjeller innenfor tvillingparet {{intra-uterine}} miljøforskjeller. Blant <b>dizygote</b> (DZ) par kan vektforskjellen være både genetiske og miljøbetinget. Ved sammenligning av fødselsvektforskjeller innenfor tvillingparene er tvillingen som ikke har gjentatte øreinfeksjoner en matchet kontroll blant OM diskordante par. Resultatene antyder at lav fødselsvekt er en risikofaktor for otitis media. Gjennomsnittlig vektforskjell blant par diskordante for OM var 48 gram, og den av tvillingen som ikke rapporterte OM hadde signifikant høyere fødselsvekt. Kværner KJ, Tambs K, Harris J, Magnus P.   Do pregnancy-related factors influence {{the development of}} otitis media?   Nor J Epidemiol 1997; 7 (1) : 55 - 58.     ENGLISH SUMMARY The association between intrauterine growth, as measured by weight and gestational age, and the occurrence of recurrent ear infections was studied using data from a population based sample of 7992 Norwegian twins. Perinatal measures were collected from the Medical Birth Registry, and reports of recurrent ear infections were based on questionnaires completed when the twins were aged 18 - 25. First, the individual effects of birth weight and gestational age on the occurrence of otitis media (OM) were estimated. Birth weight among individuals who reported OM was significantly lower than for controls, with a mean weight difference of 86 grams. The average difference in gestational age was 3 days shorter among individuals with a positive history of OM. Next, the effect of birth weight was estimated using a co-twin control application. Among MZ twins within pair differences in birth weight reflect environmental differences experienced in utero. Among DZ pairs birth weight differences {{may be due to}} genetic and environmental differences. Among OM discordant pairs, the co-twin without a history of OM is a matched control for comparisons of intra-pair differences in birth weight. When within pair birth weight differences were compared, the co-twin without a history of OM was used as the matched control. Results indicated that lower birth weight may be a risk factor for OM. The average birth weight difference among OM discordant pairs was 48 grams, with the control twin weighing significantly more than the twin with a history of OM. </span...|$|E
40|$|While the {{chimpanzee}} {{remains the}} only animal that closely models human hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, transgenic and immunodeficient mice in which human liver can be engrafted serve as a partial solution {{to the need for}} a small animal model for HCV infection. The established system that was based on mice carrying a transgene for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene {{under the control of the}} human albumin promoter has proved to be useful for studies of virus infectivity and for testing antiviral drug agents. However, the current Alb-uPA transgenic model with a humanized liver has practical limitations due to the inability to maintain non-engrafted mice as <b>dizygotes</b> for the transgene, poor engraftment of hemizygotes, high neonatal and experimental death rates of dizygous mice and a very short time window for hepatocyte engraftment. To improve the model, we crossed transgenic mice carrying the uPA gene driven by the major urinary protein promoter onto a SCID/Beige background (MUP-uPA SCID/ Bg). These transgenic mice are healthy relative to Alb-uPA mice and provide a long window from about age 4 to 12 months for engraftment with human hepatocytes and infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B (HBV) viruses. We have demonstrated engraftment of human hepatocytes by immunohistochemistry staining for human albumin (30 - 80 % engraftment) and observed a correlation between the number of human hepatocytes inoculated and the level of the concentration of human albumin in the serum. We have shown that these mice support the replication of both HB...|$|R
