40|$|Bone {{remodeling}} {{is regulated}} by pathways controlling {{the interplay of}} osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In this work, we apply the method of generalized modeling to systematically analyse a large class of models of bone remodeling. Our analysis shows that osteoblast precursors {{can play an important}} role in the regulation of bone remodeling. Further, we find that the parameter regime most likely realized in nature lies close to bifurcation lines, marking qualitative changes in the dynamics. Although proximity to a bifurcation facilitates adaptive responses to changing external conditions, <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of losing dynamical stability. Some evidence implicates such dynamical transitions as a potential mechanism leading to forms of Paget's disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of analogues of natural compounds {{was the next}} step in the development of new materials for the dyeing industry. Alizarin was the first dye whose structure was determined, thus enabling its synthesis in 1868. The first {{synthesis of}} alizarin was patented by Graebe and Liebermann and was a milestone in the industrial production of dyes and pigments [8, 9]. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> <b>the</b> di-bromination of anthraquinone, followed by fusion with sodium hydroxide. The second, much cheaper, synthetic path was developed in 1869 by Graebe, Liebermann and Caro and independently by Perkin in <b>the</b> same year. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> <b>the</b> treatment of anthraquinone with fuming sulphuric acid, followed by a treatment with sodium hydroxide and potassium chlorate.|$|R
