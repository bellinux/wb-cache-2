25|$|BUSU gained {{attention}} for allowing {{a group of}} students who were dressed as the Jamaican bobsled team into their bar for a Halloween night. Some students in the costume were found to <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> black faces, prompting controversy. BUSU has since begun monitoring costumes entering their bar as a result. This was the third time a black face incident had happened on campus, as former students also won for the bobsled team costume, and one in 2009 won the contest for dressing up as Lil' Wayne.|$|E
25|$|It {{also found}} fault with the railway company's desire {{to run a}} peacetime service to {{maintain}} profits, even though the network was experiencing extra war-time traffic. Citing the pressure this would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> signal staff to maintain the service, it also argued that the local train would not have even been on the main line if the passing loops had not been being used as storage sidings to store extra trains. It also criticised the railway company and the government for using the older wooden stock for the troop train, arguing that it was already known it was unsafe {{and in the process}} of withdrawal, and this was a risk that was not justified even in the environment of war.|$|E

Then he tries to abduct her, but he is immediately set upon by all those in the castle, fights his way to safety and returns alone to Paris to a hero's welcome. Florent is knighted and the listener is treated to another comic scene as Clement worries that he might {{have to pay for the}} feast that the King of France and the Emperor of Rome <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> in Florent's honour.

25|$|Due to {{concerns}} over legal issues WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on their television shows with the ECW belt. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Awesome (a WCW employee and ECW champion) appeared {{a few days}} later at an ECW event in Indianapolis, Indiana, accompanied by WCW's head of security, where he lost the title to Tazz (a World Wrestling Federation employee), who lost it a week later to Tommy Dreamer (a full-time ECW wrestler) (who incidentally lost it approximately 20 minutes later to Justin Credible). In the extreme shoot interview released by Highspots in 2005, Awesome expressed that he would have rather faced off with his former ECW and WWE colleague, Rhyno and suggested that they could <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a more entertaining match regardless of the circumstances {{and the manner in which}} he had left ECW.|$|E

The aquatics center features a 50-meter Olympic-size swimming pool and locker rooms.|$|E
500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced.

500|$|Many reviewers noted {{similarities}} in the song to earlier Jackson songs.

[...] Cori Murray, an entertainment director at Essence magazine, described the track as [...] "not bad," [...] and felt that it sounded [...] "like something" [...] Jackson [...] "could <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> an album." [...] Dan Aquilante, of the New York Post, who described the song as [...] "an optimistic, R ballad with an upbeat, percolating rhythm that has all the bombast {{and power of the}} New Jack Swing period of the early '90s." [...] James Montgomery, of MTV News, felt that the song was the [...] "perfect MJ tune" [...] and that Jackson [...] "was a hell of a singer." [...] He also stated that he felt that Jackson had a [...] "wonderous voice," [...] and the song [...] "a prime showcase for Jackson's prodigious pipes."

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Roar", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it {{contains}} elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically {{it is an}} empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between [...] "Roar" [...] and [...] "Brave" [...] by Sara Bareilles. [...] "Legendary Lovers", a bhangra-based song, deals {{with the ideas of}} karma and infinity. [...] "Birthday" [...] was described by Perry as her own attempt at [...] "writing something Mariah Carey would <b>have</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> her first record". Musically, it is a [...] "fluffy" [...] pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. [...] "Walking on Air", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas Åhlund and Max Martin. [...] "Unconditionally", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a [...] "soaring" [...] power ballad with an [...] "epic chorus". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a [...] "woodblock percussion" [...] as well as [...] "a dramatic bass line" [...] and deemed it the album's [...] "most mature offering". Furthermore, he called it [...] "an ode to love that looks past all flaws" [...] and stated that the song acts as a [...] "compellingly grounded predicate" [...] to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love that could come in all forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling.|$|E
