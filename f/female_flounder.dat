40|$|In {{biological}} effect monitoring programs. induction of biotransformation and detoxification enzymes is used Lis a biomarker for pollution. Yet sex differences are Usually neglected in {{the availability of}} reduction equivalents needed in these metabolic pathways and may affect biomarker responses. For example, <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> have a threefold higher incidence of macroscopic liver nodules than males {{of the same age}} class in polluted environments of the North Sea that progress toward carcinomas, whereas tumors in males virtually never develop into cancer. Evidence is presented in this review that NADPH plays a significant role in this sex-related response to xenobiotics in liver of flounder. The NADPH is needed for biosynthesis, particularly of lipids and lipoproteins, and detoxification processes such as one-electron and two-electron biotransformation and conjugation and, therefore, its availability as substrate determines biomarker responses. Biotransformation of xenobiotics is more strongly induced and conjugation processes are less affected in male flounder liver during exposure. In female liver, NADPH is required for production of the yolk precursor protein vitellogenin for oocyte production. The latter process has a higher priority than the NADPH-requiring, detoxification processes because reproductive success is more relevant in evolutionary perspectives than the survival of the individual female. The data reviewed here suggest that these sex-related differences in NADPH metabolism arc a major cause of the hi. -her incidence of liver cancer in <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> in polluted environment...|$|E

The catecholamines norepinephrine, dopamine and the indoleamine serotonin were found in the brains of these three teleost species. All three monomines were heavily concentrated in the hypothalamus, with norepinephrine being the most concentrated monomine in this area followed by serotonin and dopamine. Norepinephrine concentrations ranged from a low 0. 33 ± 0. 07 (± S. E.

In juvenile fish, livers displayed reversible and irreversible degenerative toxipathic Lesion types but never showed (pre) neoplastic changes. Tumour frequencies up to 70 % were found macroscopically in livers of adult <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> which had progressed to adenomas and carcinomas in the most polluted site. Because mate adult flounder show only up to 50 % of livers containing early preneoplastic foci but never malignancies, we focussed our study on female individuals. (Pre) neoplastic changes ranged from early eosinophilic foci to basophilic foci, adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas. Adenomas were generally eosinophilic whereas carcinomas were mainly basophitic. These phenotypical. sequential changes strongly resemble those found in chemically-induced Liver carcinogenesis in mammals. Characteristic mutations known from mammalian cancers have not been found so far in these flounder livers. Therefore, we investigated whether epigenetic events had induced a metabolic "resistant phenotype" of (pre) malignant cancer cells during hepatocellular carcinogenesis. With a quantitative immunohistochemical. approach, we studied expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) -mediated multixenobiotic resistance (MXR), cytochrome P 4501 A 1, glutathione-S-transferase-A which are key proteins in xenobiotic metabolism and elimination. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) activity, {{the major source of}} the reducing power NADPH which is needed for biotransformation, oxyradical scavenging and biosynthesis, was detected as well. We observed upregulation of G 6 PDH activity already in early preneoplastic eosinophilic foci and subsequent further upregulation in basophilic foci and carcinomas. P-gp started to become overexpressed in basophilic foci and was overexpressed even more strongly in carcinomas and their invasively-growing protrusions (satellites). In carcinomas, P-gp protein was predominantly present in membranes of lysosomes which are the intracellular sites of deposition of xenobiotics. CYP 450 was reduced whereas GST-A was increased in these carcinomas. Progression towards malignancy was positively correlated with levels of mitogenic organochlorines in these livers which are "fingerprint contaminants" of the river Elbe. We conclude that (pre) neoplastic hepatocytes in <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> acquire growth advantages over normal hepatocytes by epigenetic metabolic adaptations during liver carcinogenesis as a result of chronic exposure to (pro) carcinogens in the polluted habitat.

Cell responses were assessed at the level of. (1) stress induction as measured by formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly superoxide radicals, and induction of cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) biotransformation activity; (2) cellular antioxidant defences, both non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione) and enzymatic (DT-diaphorase (DTD) or quinone oxidoreductase, EC 1. 6. 99. 2); (3) detoxification (aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), EC 1. 2. 1. 3); and (4) cellular damage as measured by reduced lysosomal membrane stability and cell death. As there is increasing evidence that 17 -beta-estradiol interferes with certain pathways of xenobiotic biotransformation, we additionally tested the effects of different concentrations of 17 -beta-estradiol (0. 2 - 10 muM) alone and 17 -beta-estradiol (1 muM) in combination with 100 M B[a]p. Parameters were monitored after 1 and 9 days of exposure by quantitative image analysis of chromogenic or fluorogenic reaction products. Our study revealed sex-dependent differences in cellular stress responses. In hepatocytes of <b>female</b> <b>flounder,</b> biotransformation was slower and the capacity of non-enzymatic antioxidant defences and detoxification of toxic aldehydes was lower than in males. Additional administration of 17 -beta-estradiol enlarged these differences between the sexes with respect to biotransformation activity and antioxidant defence in xenobiotic-induced injury.

40|$|Rhythmic {{vertical}} migration {{is a widespread}} feature among teleost species and the ultimate reasons for this behaviour could be as diverse as transport, feeding, predator avoidance or reproduction strategies. A rhythmic {{vertical migration}} implies that a fish will experience associated cyclic pressure changes. We examined the effect of 14 -day exposure to cyclic variations in hydrostatic pressure (HP) and to elevated constant HP on pituitary levels of two types of gonadotropin, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), in maturing but not ovulating <b>female</b> European <b>flounder</b> (Platichthys flesus). Fish were exposed to cyclic HP with a tidal period of 12. 4 h and an amplitude of 600 kPa, between 200 and 800 kPa (environmentally realistic vertical migration), to constant absolute HP of 800 kPa, and to a maximum 1 m height water column. Flounder pituitary FSH content was remarkably higher under cyclic HP conditions than under constant normal or elevated HP conditions. In fact, pituitary FSH levels were undetectable, irrespective of the constant HP regimen. By contrast, pituitary LH levels showed {{no significant differences between}} the different groups at the end of the experimental period. This study describes an important alteration of the brain-pituitary-gonad (BPG) axis provoked by exposure to HP fluctuations, which mimic conditions in nature.

40|$|Comparison of polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) concentrations {{between the sexes}} of mature fish may reveal important behavioral and physiological differences between the sexes. We determined whole-fish PCB concentrations in 23 <b>female</b> summer <b>flounder</b> Paralichthys dentatus and 27 male summer flounder from New Jersey coastal waters. To investigate the potential for differences in diet or habitat utilization between the sexes, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were also determined. In 5 of the 23 <b>female</b> summer <b>flounder,</b> PCB concentrations in the somatic tissue and ovaries were determined. In addition, we used bioenergetics modeling to assess {{the contribution of the}} growth dilution effect to the observed difference in PCB concentrations between the sexes. Whole-fish PCB concentrations for females and males averaged 87 and 124 ng/g, respectively; thus males were 43 % higher in PCB concentration compared with females. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios did not significantly differ between the sexes, suggesting that diet composition and habitat utilization did not vary between the sexes. Based on PCB determinations in the somatic tissue and ovaries, we predicted that PCB concentration of females would increase by 0. 6 %, on average, immediately after spawning due to release of eggs. Thus, the change in PCB concentration due to release of eggs did not explain the higher PCB concentrations observed in males. Bioenergetics modeling results indicated that the growth dilution effect could account for males being 19 % higher in PCB concentration compared with females. Thus, the bulk of the observed difference in PCB concentrations between the sexes was not explained by growth dilution. We concluded that a higher rate of energy expenditure in males, stemming from greater activity and a greater resting metabolic rate, was most likely the primary driver for the observed difference in PCB concentrations between the sexes...|$|R

The {{witch flounder}} has become increasingly important commercially since the 1940 's. There was heavy exploitation of witch flounder by foreign ships in the early 1970 's but with the introduction of Canada's 200 -mile limit in 1977, foreign fishing for the species was reduced and Canada's take increased. [...] This study focused on the adaptation of wild witch flounder to captivity and the development of a captive broodstock. Areas of concentration focused on growth and maturation, with emphasis on the reproductive biology (pattern of oocyte development, endocrinology and gamete analysis) of the witch flounder.

Since there is evidence that 17 -beta-estradiol inhibits certain pathways of xenobiotic biotransformation, we tested also the effects of different concentrations of 17 -beta-estradiol (0. 2, 1 and 2 muM) alone and 1 muM in combination with 100 muM B[a]p on G 6 PDH activity. After short-term (I day) and long-term (9 days) exposure, G 6 PDH activity was quantified in intact living hepatocytes by a tetrazolium salt method using tetranitroblue tetrazolium salt (TNBT). Hepatocytes obtained from male fish generally showed higher G 6 PDH activity than those of females. We observed significant inhibition of G 6 PDH activity by all oxidative stressors and 17 -beta-estradiol in both sexes of fish independently of culture conditions, but inhibition was stronger in cells of females than in cells of males. A cumulative effect of the steroid and B[a]p was not found. Our results indicate a sex-dependent inhibitory effect of all stressors and 17 -beta-estradiol on G 6 PDH activity in flounder hepatocytes independent of prooxidant activity of the specific compound. Consequently, NADPH supply for xenobiotic detoxification and other cellular antioxidative defence mechanisms may be different in livers of female and male flounder. The strongly decreased supply of NADPH in hepatocytes of females may explain the reduced and/or delayed NADPH-dependent activity of xenobiotic biotransformation systems such as cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) and a lower capacity of non-enzymatic defence systems such as reduced glutathione that is particularly observed in <b>female</b> <b>flounder.</b> Moreover, the strong inhibition of G 6 PDII in livers of <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> may explain higher susceptibility for xenobiotic toxicity and, therefore, potentially a higher risk to develop liver cancer.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle in}} teleosts {{is timed to}} guarantee that eggs hatch {{in the right place}} at the right time, with environmental factors playing important roles in entraining and controlling the entire process. The effects of some environmental factors, like temperature and photoperiod, are now well understood. There are only a few studies regarding the effects of hydrostatic pressure (HP) on the reproductive cycle, in spite of its importance as a ubiquitous factor in all biological environments and affecting all living organisms. Hydrostatic pressure is of particular importance in fish because they can also experience rapid and cyclic changes in HP due to vertical movements in the water column. The aim of the present research was to investigate the effects of vertical migrations on the reproductive steroids of maturing <b>female</b> <b>flounder.</b> After a 14 day exposure to cyclic hydrostatic pressure (with a period of 12. 4 h and with a maximum peak of 800 kPa of absolute hydrostatic pressure), fish showed significantly lower plasmatic concentrations of “ 5 β, 3 α” steroids, metabolites of the putative maturation-inducing steroid in flounder (17 α, 20 β-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one).

After optimisation of the arraying process, hepatic mRNA was isolated from flounder caught in the polluted Tyne and relatively unpolluted Alde estuaries. Fluorescent cDNA probes were synthesised from the mRNA and used in dual-colour hybridisations to the microarray. A number of transcripts were differentially expressed between Tyne and Alde <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> but these changes were not significant, due to high inter-individual variation. However, in comparisons between Tyne and Alde male flounder, 11 transcripts were found to significantly differ in expression (PB/ 0. 05).

Four transcripts (Elongation factor 1 (EF 1), EF 2, Int- 6 and complement component C 3) were found to be significantly less abundant in the Tyne male fish. Selected genes were assayed by real-time PCR, then normalised to a-tubulin. These assays confirmed the significance of the array results for CYP 1 A, UDPGT and EF 1, but not for Cu/Zn SOD.

40|$|High {{concentrations}} of vitellogenin (VTG; egg yolk protein) have previously {{been found in}} male flounder (Platichthys flesus) from several UK estuaries; these levels have been ascribed {{to the presence of}} estrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). Gonadal abnormalities, including intersex, have also been recorded in these estuaries. However, there is no firm evidence to date that these two findings are causally linked or that the presence of estrogenic EDCs has any adverse population effects. In the present study, we examined the relationship between {{concentrations of}} VTG and sex steroids (11 -oxotestosterone in males and 17 β-estradiol in females) in specimens of flounder captured from the estuary of the River Mersey. We first questioned whether the high concentrations of VTG in male and immature <b>female</b> <b>flounder</b> were indeed caused by a direct effect of exogenous EDCs and not indirectly via the endogenous secretion of 17 β-estradiol. The data favored the direct involvement of estrogenic EDCs. We then questioned whether the presence of estrogenic EDCs not only stimulated inappropriate VTG synthesis but whether it might also have had a negative effect on endogenous steroid secretion. It {{should be noted that the}} predicted consequences of a drop in steroid secretion include smaller gonads, smaller oocytes, fewer numbers of sperm, and depressed spawning behavior. This question was more difficult to answer because of the strong effect of the seasonal reproductive cycle and stage of maturation on steroid concentrations. However, matched by month of capture and stage of maturation, both 17 β-estradiol in females and 11 -keto-testosterone in males were in most cases significantly lower in those years when VTG concentrations were higher.

This species {{was used as}} a model fish in an effort to understand seasonal gonadal cycles and the pituitary- gonadal axis regulation of reproduction in a seasonally breeding teleost. [...] The natural seasonal reproductive cycle was investigated over a two-year period. In females, rapid ovarian recrudescence which begins in August, was largely completed by December, However, ovarian growth continued throughout the winter as shown by further increases in both gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter. Analysis of oocyte-size frequency distribution indicated that in reproductively active females, previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes are present but just one clutch of vitellogenic oocytes matured per reproductive season. Plasma estradiol increased in parallel with gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter, whereas plasma testosterone remained low during the early stages of ovarian recrudescence. Compared with females, male testicular development was more rapid, with GSI reaching a maximum in October followed by declining values prior to spawning. Plasma testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone levels rose slowly in association with the progress of testicular development. Plasma sex steroids reached their peak values just prior to the spawning period (May/June) in both sexes, while the minimum seasonal hormone values were observed in fish with regressed gonads. [...] Seasonal responses of the pituitary, and indirectly the gonads, to GnRH-A were monitored by measuring plasma androgens and estrogen following in vivo hormone treatment. Both males and females were highly responsive to GnRH-A treatment throughout the gonadal recrudescence period and the prespawning phases; little or no response was observed during the regressed period. Plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone were elevated following GnRH-A administration and the hormone levels were sustained for prolonged periods of time. The effects of GnRH-A treatment on the reproductive cycle were also observed by noting increases in gonadosomatic index and oocyte diameter in fish during the period of gonadal recrudescence. During the prespawning stage, ovulation and spermiation could be achieved following releasing hormone treatment. In contrast, the low gonadosomatic index remained unchanged by GnRH-A treatment during the regressed period.

This {{sterility}} severely restricts the further application of DHs for production of clones, genetic analysis, and breeding. However, sterile DH individuals are good source materials for investigation of the molecular mechanisms of gonad development, especially for studies into the role of genes that are indispensable for fish reproduction. Here, we used the Illumina sequencing platform to analyze the transcriptome of sterile <b>female</b> DH Japanese <b>flounder</b> in order to identify major genes that cause sterility and to provide a molecular basis for an intensive study of gonadal development in teleosts. Through sequencing, assembly, and annotation, we obtained 52, 474 contigs and found that 60. 7 % of these shared homologies with existing sequences. A total of 1225 differentially expressed unigenes were found, including 492 upregulated and 733 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology and KEGG analyses showed that genes showing significant upregulation, such as CYP 11 A 1, CYP 11 B 2, CYP 17, CYP 21, HSD 3 β, bcl 2 l 1, and PRLR, principally correlated with sterol metabolic process, steroid biosynthetic process, and the Jak-stat signaling pathway. The significantly downregulated genes were primarily associated with immune response, antigen processing and presentation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and protein digestion and absorption.

Examination of oocyte size-frequency distributions showed that the oocyte developmental pattern in R. tapirina is multiple group synchrony, and that reproductively mature fish were present at all sampling times. There were no significant temporal variations in the gonadosomatic index (IG), hepato-somatic index (IH), or plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and T during the sampling period, which indicates that reproductive development is not synchronized within the population. Significant increases in IG, IH and plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and T, however, were observed in vitellogenic fish, and in fish undergoing final maturation. A positive relationship was also found between the growth of oocytes and plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and T, although the patterns of increase were different for each variable. Plasma concentrations of Vtg and E 2 rose steadily across oocyte sizes from 100 to 450 孬 but the rate of increase of plasma E 2 was slower than that of Vtg, and both reached a saturated concentration at oocyte sizes of c. 450 孮 In contrast, plasma concentrations of T showed no marked increase until oocytes grewbeyond 400 孮No Full Tex...|$|R

The number of ovulations per female was high, a mean batch number of 14 was seen in 1994, rising to 22 in 1995. Small batch sizes (< 100 000 eggs) dominated batch fecundity distributions, and the data suggested that females increase the number of ovulations rather than increase batch fecundity when egg production increases between years. Egg quality in yellowtail flounder was found to be subject to maternal differences. In addition, females demonstrated significant inter-batch variation in fertilization and hatching rates. An inter-annual increase in egg quality was observed, where mean fertilization rates rose from 38 % to 60 %.

40|$|Arrowtooth {{flounder}} (Atheresthes stomias) has had {{the highest}} abundance of any groundfish species in the Gulf of Alaska since the 1970 s (Matarese et al., 2003; Turnock et al., 2005; Blood et al., 2007); however, commercial catches have been restricted because Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) are caught as bycatch in the fishery. Arrowtooth flounder {{plays a key role}} in the ecosystem because it is a dominant organism within the food web, both as an apex predator of fish and invertebrates, as well as an important prey for walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma; Aydin et al., 2002). Walleye pollock is the dominant groundfish in the Bering Sea, a principal groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska, and the primary prey for marine mammals. The distribution of arrowtooth flounder extends from Cape Navarin and the eastern Sea of Okhotsk in Russia, across the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and south to the coast of central California (Shuntov, 1964; Britt and Martin, 2001; Chetvergov, 2001; Weinberg et al., 2002; Zenger, 2004). Because of the importance of arrowtooth flounder in the marine ecosystem of A laska, a maturity study of this species was undertaken to determine age-at-maturity, which is essential for age-based stock management models. Before these results, management has had to rely upon a length-at-maturity-based estimate (Zimmermann, 1997) to manage stocks in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands.

40|$|The greenback {{flounder}} Rhombosolea tapirina (Pleuronectidae) {{is distributed}} around Southern Australia and New Zealand. There is {{growing interest in}} developing an aquaculture industry for greenback flounder in Tasmania and pilot aquaculture schemes are already underway, however, current programs are limited by unreliable egg production. This study provided baseline information on reproductive events under normal reproductive conditions in wild greenback flounder, the stress response of greenback flounder to common husbandry and laboratory aquaculture practices, developed induced ovulation protocols, examined the mechanism of action of hormone treatment and assessed in vitro effectiveness of putative maturational steroids on ovarian tissue. Oocyte size frequency distributions showed that <b>female</b> greenback <b>flounder</b> are multiple ovulators and have group synchronous oocyte development. Plasma and ovarian levels of testosterone (T) and 17 β-estradiol (E 2) were elevated in association with vitellogenesis. Plasma levels of 17 α 20 β-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17, 20 βP), and 17, 20 βP-sulphate but not 17, 20 βP-glucuronide were significantly elevated in ovulated females, whereas ovarian levels of 17, 20 βP were elevated in association with final oocyte maturation (FOM) and ovulation. Changes in macroscopic testis stage were characterised by few changes in proportions of gamete types between gonad stages, indicating low milt production, even in mature fish. Plasma levels of T were elevated in association with spermatogenesis, but not spermiation. No significant changes in plasma 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT), 17, 203 P, 17, 20 βP-sulphate and 17, 20 β-glucuronide were detected with change in gonad stage of males. The latency of the plasma cortisol response to stress was approximately 10 min. Plasma levels of cortisol were significantly higher in wild fish sampled after capture, confinement and transport, and some routine husbandry practices {{had the capacity to}} stimulate elevated cortisol levels for up to 48 h. Hematocrit (Hct) did not change significantly in response to stress, suggesting that either Hct is not effected by stress in this species, or changes in Hct were not detected within the sampling protocol. After exercise, muscle lactate did not significantly change, however, plasma lactate and muscle [11 +] significantly increased and plasma [H+] significantly decreased, indicating that muscle and blood physiology of greenback flounder do change in response to exercise, but unlike other flatfish, there was little evidence for in situ glycogenesis within white muscle tissue. <b>Female</b> greenback <b>flounder</b> were induced to repeat ovulate using a range of exogenous hormone treatments. Des Gly 10 [D-Ala 6] LHRH ethylamide (LHRH-a) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), significantly increased the number of ovulations above control levels. Co-administration of LHRH-a and the dopamine antagonist PIM provided no significant advantage over treatment with LHRH-a alone. Dopamine appeared to have an inconsistent effect on reproductive function in greenback flounder. Co-treatment of LHRH-a + T significantly enhanced the ovulatory effects of LHRH-a, suggesting steroid feedback enhances pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. In vitro bioassays indicated that ovarian fragments required pre-treatment with hCG before they were receptive to steroids. In most cases, the maturational response to steroids after priming with hCG exceeded the maturational response to hCG treatment alone. Ovarian fragments were receptive to all steroids at all concentrations tested. There was considerable inconsistency in maturational responses to each steroid and each dose, however, 20 a and 20 β- hydroxylated steroids were most effective at inducing maturation, and 5 -pregnene and 5 β-pregnane steroids were least effective...|$|R

The transcript is expressed in <b>female</b> and male <b>flounder</b> gonads as well as in kidney and intestine, although at very low levels.

The open reading frame of IPAN encodes a basic protein of 68 amino acid residues. Immunohistochemistry confined the anti-sense related protein, Ipan, to a submembranous compartment of immature oocytes, suggesting a role in oocyte development. In kidney and intestine Ipan is partly co-localized with the Na/Pi co-transporter, implying a regulatory function for the anti-sense protein.

40|$|The {{yellowtail}} flounder (Limanda ferruginea) once considered a prime candidate for aquaculture, were photothermally manipulated {{in an attempt}} to advance the ovulation time of females of this species. The success of these techniques would be highly beneficial to the broodstock management of {{yellowtail flounder}}. [...] Two groups of <b>female</b> yellowtail <b>flounder</b> were held under compressed photothermal environmental laboratory conditions as an attempt to advance ovulation and spawning time. One group was administered a controlled release gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) in February, the other group was administered a sham pellet in an identical manner. A third group of fish was held under ambient photoperiod and temperature conditions. The experiment ran for two years using a different group of animals for each year. In year two, a sub-group (five females) of the ambient control fish was given a GnRH-a pellet in February. In year one a total of 6 females were used in each of the photothermally advanced group. In year two this number was increased to twelve in both photothermally treated groups. [...] Throughout annual reproductive development the degree of advancement of the females was monitored using both ovarian cannulation and plasma steroids (estradiol- 17 P and testosterone) analysis. No significant advancement was noted in either of the photothermal manipulated groups in the oocyte diameters obtained through the cannulation or in steroid levels. [...] Advanced spawning in the group photothermally manipulated and administered the GnRH-a pellet (PP-GnRH-a) was noted in March in both year one and two. The photothermally manipulated group receiving the sham pellet (PP-Sham) did not spawn in advance of the ambient control group. Egg quality parameters, based on egg viability, fertilization and hatch rates, for the PP-GnRH-a group were excellent and were significantly higher than the PP-Sham group for viability and fertilization. Egg quality for the PP-GnRH-a group was not significantly different from the ambient group of females. The PP-Sham and control group both spawned in June, which is the expected ambient spawning time for yellowtail flounder in captive conditions.

Plasma testosterone (T) increased just prior to the spawning season, peaked after plasma E₂ and decreased {{by the end of the}} spawning season in August. [...] Despite the year-round presence of milt with motile sperm, male yellowtail flounder showed a distinct seasonal change in plasma 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT). 11 KT peaked at the beginning of the spawning season when milt volumes were highest but decreased while milt volumes were still elevated. Plasma T showed a less distinct seasonal cycle than 11 KT and peaked later in the season. [...] Compared to control treated fish, gonadotropin releasing hormone-analogue (GnRHa) treatment delivered either by microspheres or cholesterol pellets successfully increased sperm production and milt volume in mature male yellowtail flounder during the spawning season. Sperm production remained high for 4 weeks after implantation of GnRHa and then decreased in all treatments (including the controls), indicating milt volume increased due to an initial increase in sperm production and remained high due to milt hydration. Plasma levels of T, 11 KT and 17 α, 20 β-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one showed no clear pattern of response to GnRHa treatment. GnRHa treatment did not have a negative effect on sperm fertilizing ability, percentage hatch or larval appearance. Sperm motility and seminal plasma pH was increased by GnRHa treatment. [...] Several aspects of yellowtail flounder sperm physiology were examined. Sperm were activated in buffer with an osmolality greater than 367 mOsm (pH 8. 2 - 8. 8) and diluted seawater with an osmolality greater than 387 mOsm (pH 7. 6 - 8. 2).

Vtg purified from the plasma ofE 2 -treated male animals by gel filtration chromatography had an estimated molecular weight (MW) of 540 kD, and resolved into three bands with estimated MW of 152, 102, 80 kD after SDSp AGE. Western blotting demonstrated that the Vtg consisted of one subunit (152 kD). A polyclonal antibody against the 152 kD band developed from sheep, was used to establish-an indirect antibody-capture competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The validation of the ELISA was confirmed by the parallelism between the standard Vtg curve and serial dilutions of plasma from vitellogenic females, but no cross-reaction was found with the plasma of males, or plasma from a range of other species. In Ez-treated fish, detectable concentrations of plasma Vtg were first found at 48 h, and reached a peak at 96 h post-injection, and increased as the E 2 dose increased, with a threshold of 0. 1 mg E 2 Kg body weight - 1. Multiple injections of E 2 increased the absolute concentrations of Vtg and extended the peak Vtg up to 288 h, but did not change the threshold dose. The time-course and dose response for induction of Vtg by E 2 in the flounder was similar to that seen in other species, however, plasma concentrations of Vtg were generally lower than those found in other teleosts. Oocyte size-frequency distributions from mature females showed that this species has multiple clutch group synchronous type of oocyte development. But that reproductive development is not synchronized within the population. Consistent with this observation, there were no significant seasonal variations in gonadosomatic index (IG), hepatosomatic index (IH), or plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and testosterone (T). Significant increases in IG, IH and plasma concentrations of Vtg, E 2 and T were observed in vitellogenic fish, and in fish undergoing final maturation. Plasma concentrations of Vtg and E 2 rose steadily across oocyte sizes from 100 to 450 μm, and both reached a concentration plateau at oocyte sizes of around 450 μm. In contrast, plasma concentrations of T showed no marked increase until oocytes grew beyond 400 μm. Isolated vitellogenic follicles were incubated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) and gonadal steroid precursors T, 17 - hydroxyprogesterone (17 P) and androstenedione (A) in the presence or absence of Vtg. High concentrations ofVtg suppressed the production of E 2 and T, and the effect appeared to operate at several levels along the steroidogenic pathways. These observations combined with findings of other studies indicate that Vtg might regulate its own production by modulating ovarian steroid synthesis...|$|R
