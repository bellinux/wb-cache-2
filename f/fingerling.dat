5|$|Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania {{stated that}} Long Pond and Round Pond, two ponds in the watershed, {{had a large}} fish population. The creek was stocked with 700 <b>fingerling,</b> yearling, and adult brook trout in 1909.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to its mouth, the stream is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of the stream from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. The stream was stocked with 500 adult and <b>fingerling</b> rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of the stream.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{differentially}} batch-mark several size-groups of fish stocked concurrently in lakes or rivers {{makes it possible}} to compare survival within a single year. We evaluated stocking of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum in Illinois during 1991 – 1996. Ten lakes were stocked with combinations of two or three sizes of walleyes, including fry and small (50 -mm) and large (100 -mm) <b>fingerlings.</b> This permitted a total of 73 lake-year comparisons: fry versus large <b>fingerlings</b> (23 lake-years), fry versus small <b>fingerlings</b> (29 lake-years), and small versus large <b>fingerlings</b> (21 lake-years). Stocked fish were differentially marked with oxytetracycline or fin clips. Electrofishing catch per effort, relative survival, and population estimates were used in conjunction with production costs to compare size-based contributions and survival. Survival generally favored <b>fingerlings</b> over fry (70 % of lake-years for small <b>fingerlings,</b> 67 % for large <b>fingerlings)</b> and small <b>fingerlings</b> over large <b>fingerlings</b> (72 % of lake-years). In some lake-years, fry and large <b>fingerlings</b> had the highest survival. Fish stocked as fry and small <b>fingerlings</b> were larger than large <b>fingerlings</b> beginning their third year of growth. Based on our results, stocking small <b>fingerlings</b> will generally be more cost-effective than stocking fry or large <b>fingerlings.</b> However, if fry or large <b>fingerlings</b> are available, stocking assessment on specific lakes may allow biologists to determine particular lakes where alternative sizes could be economically feasible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [...] We {{evaluated}} {{stress and}} over-winter survival of walleye <b>fingerlings</b> during normal Minnesota harvest and stocking procedures. Blood chemistry showed walleye <b>fingerlings</b> were stressed during {{each stage of}} the process. Blood plasma cortisol generally returned to baseline levels after 24 hours, but blood plasma chloride did not. Over-winter survival of stocked walleye <b>fingerlings</b> ranged from 1 % to 63 % in three lakes where stocked <b>fingerlings</b> averaged about 140 mm, but survival was 99 % in one trial where stocked <b>fingerlings</b> averaged 192 mm. Holding <b>fingerlings</b> in a crib in the lake for 24 hr prior to release did not improve over-winter survival. However, hauling <b>fingerlings</b> at a density of 0. 06 kg/l (0. 5 lb/gal) rather than 0. 12 kg/l (1. 0 lb/gal) did appear to improve over-winter survival...|$|R

40|$|The {{toxicological}} and histopathological {{responses of}} detergents on Clarias gariepinus <b>fingerlings</b> was studied. Twenty-five (25) <b>fingerlings</b> {{were used for}} each aquarium exposed to four (4) different concentrations of the two detergents (Zip and Omo) and the control group. The <b>fingerlings</b> were exposed to 0. 000, 400, 450, 500 and 550 ppm of the two detergents and the experiment was done in duplicate. A total of 400 <b>fingerlings</b> of Clarias gariepinus for each detergent were used throughout the study. The mean <b>fingerlings</b> weight used for the study was 1. 7 ± 0. 2 g. The mortality data trend of <b>fingerlings</b> exposed to different concentrations of the detergents increased with increasing concentration and duration of exposure. The 96 hours LC 50 value of Zip and Omo on C. gariepinus <b>fingerlings</b> were 5. 45 and 5. 60 respectively. The low LC 50 value for the <b>fingerlings</b> exposed to the detergents denoted a high toxicity of the detergents. Zip detergent was slightly more toxic to the test organism. Due to high toxicity of the detergents, careless discharge of effluents of detergents should be prevented, and the Government should sensitize its citizen on the lethal and sub-lethal effects of detergent to the aquatic eco-system. Also, the discharge of detergent effluents into our environment should be discouraged, {{in order to maintain}} a healthy aquatic environment...|$|R
6000|$|The loch {{seems to}} prove that any hill-tarn might be made {{a good place for}} sport, if trout were {{introduced}} where they do not exist already. But the size of these in Loch Beg puzzles me, nor can one see how they breed, as breed they do: for twice or thrice I caught a <b>fingerling,</b> and threw him in again. No burn runs out of the loch, and, even in a flood, the feeder is so small, and its course so extremely steep, that one cannot imagine where the fish manage to spawn. The only loch known to me where the common trout are of equal size, is on the Border. It is extremely deep, with very clear water, and with scarce any spawning ground. On a summer evening the trout are occasionally caught; three weighing seven pounds were taken one night, a year or two ago. I have not tried the evening fishing, but at all other times of day have found them the [...] "dourest" [...] of trout, and they grow dourer. But one is always lured on by the spectacle of the monsters which throw themselves out of water, with a splash that echoes through all the circuit of the low green hills. They probably reach at least four or five pounds, but {{it is unlikely that the}} biggest take the fly, and one may doubt whether they propagate their species, as small trout are never seen there.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fingerling</b> potato is a small, stubby, finger-shaped type {{of potato}} {{which may be}} any {{heritage}} potato cultivars. Fingerlings are varieties that naturally grow small and narrow. They are fully mature when harvested and {{are not to be}} confused with new potatoes. Popular <b>fingerling</b> potatoes include the yellow-skinned Russian Banana, the pink-skinned, yellow fleshed French <b>Fingerling,</b> the Purple Peruvian, and the Swedish Peanut <b>Fingerling.</b> Due to their size and greater expense compared to other potatoes, fingerlings are commonly either halved and roasted as a side dish or used in salads.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} costs associated with yellow perch aquaculture {{is the price of}} feed-trained <b>fingerlings.</b> Four to six <b>fingerlings</b> may be necessary to produce one pound of marketable perch because of their relatively small size at maturity. This can represent 30 - 50 % of all operating costs if producers choose to purchase feed-trained <b>fingerlings</b> from other growers (Malison 1999). Grow-out producers who wish to produce their own feed-trained <b>fingerlings</b> may choose from several methods that have been investigated and developed (Malison 1999). These methods range from collection of egg ribbons (masses) from the wild and incubation in nursery ponds, to induced spawning of broodstock using hormone injections (Kayes 1977; Dabrowski et al. 1994).

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the growth performance of two Indian Major Carps Catla catla, and Cirrhinus mrigala <b>fingerlings</b> for period of 40 days. Nine experimental groups fed commercial pellet diet incorporated with three types of nutritional supplements (Gram positive lactobacil probiotic, Parry’s Spirulina and Vitamin C – Ascorbic acid) at different concentrations (2 %, 4 %, & 8 %) and one control group maintained separately for both <b>fingerlings.</b> The results revealed that the Catla <b>fingerlings</b> showed maximum increase in length (28. 66 ± 0. 70 mm), weight gain (353. 25 mg), FCR (1. 01) and SGR (0. 88) were observed in 4 % probiotic and similar growth parameters were observed with 4 % spirulina and 2 % vitamin C. In mrigal <b>fingerlings</b> fed with 4 % probiotic significant increase in length, weight gain, FCR, SGR were observed (32. 55 ± 1. 94 mm), 447. 78 mg, 0. 80 and 1. 11 respectively.
