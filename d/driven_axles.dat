25|$|Trucks with dual {{tires on}} the rear axle and two <b>driven</b> <b>axles</b> are {{designated}} as 4×4s despite having six wheels because the paired rear wheels behave as a single wheel for traction and classification purposes. True 6×6 vehicles which have three powered axles, and are classified as 6×6s regardless of how many wheels they have. Examples of these with two rear, one front axle are the 6-wheeled Pinzgauer, which is popular with defense forces around the globe, and 10-wheeled GMC CCKW made famous by the U.S. Army in World War II.|$|E
25|$|Traction of the ICE1 {{trainsets}} {{is achieved}} by the eight <b>driven</b> <b>axles</b> of both power cars. Because relatively few axles have traction, the steepness of the grade the trains can safely negotiate are limited. The ICE1 is limited to grades of about 3.5%. Steeper grades cannot be negotiated safely, because the wheels could slip due to the low adhesion under adverse conditions, which {{may lead to a}} stopped train becoming stuck on a grade. This {{is one of the reasons}} the ICE1 is not homologated for the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, which has grades of up to 4%.|$|E

40|$|Keywords-drive axle housing; shell element; solid element; {{finite element}} analysis; stress Abstract. The {{finite element model}} of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively. Vertical bend {{strength}} and stiffness under 2. 5 times of fully load of the <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing were calculated by finite element method. By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing. Because there were fewer elements of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less.

50|$|A {{jackshaft}} is {{an intermediate}} shaft used to transfer power from a powered shaft {{such as the}} output shaft of an engine or motor to driven shafts such as the <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> of a locomotive. As applied railroad locomotives in the 19th and 20th centuries, jackshafts were typically {{in line with the}} <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> of locomotives and connected to them by side rods. In general, each <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> on a locomotive is free to move about one inch (2.5 cm) vertically relative to the frame, with the locomotive weight carried on springs. This means that if the engine, motor or transmission is rigidly attached to the locomotive frame, it cannot be rigidly connected to the axle. This problem can be solved by mounting the jackshaft on unsprung bearings and using side-rods or (in some early examples) chain drives.|$|R
