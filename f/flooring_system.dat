40|$|Experience in {{the design}} of steel and {{concrete}} <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> to control vibrations suggests that a <b>floor</b> <b>system’s</b> vibration characteristics are often fundamental to its acceptable performance. In such cases, serviceability drives the design instead of strength. This is particularly true for laboratory floors that support sensitive equipment and floor girders that fall within certain spans. This paper discusses the initiation of a long-term collaborative research program between Tufts University and LeMessurier Consultants to investigate the vibration characteristics of a variety of <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> Examples include new concrete-steel composite <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> concrete <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> and irregular <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> and <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> that have required remediation. The paper introduces well-known basic floor vibration equations and parameters, and discusses the possibility for developing further the concepts inherent in these equations for the purposes of improved conceptual design of <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> to control vibrations...|$|R

40|$|Light {{gauge steel}} frames (LSF) are {{commonly}} used in <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> The LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> must be designed to serve as fire compartment boundaries and provide adequate fire resistance. However, limited research has been undertaken on LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> particularly on those made of high strength steel joists, and hence {{a thorough understanding of}} their fire resistance behaviour is not available. Recently a new composite <b>floor</b> <b>system</b> was also developed to provide higher fire resistance rating. But its increased fire rating could not be determined using the currently available design methods. This paper presents the details of finite element models of high strength LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> developed to simulate their structural performance under standard fire conditions. The numerical analyses of LSF floor joists were undertaken using the finite element program ABAQUS based on the measured time–temperature profiles obtained from full scale fire tests under both steady state and transient state conditions. Finite element models were calibrated using full scale fire test results and used to further investigate the structural fire behaviour of LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> Numerical analyses provided a good understanding of the structural fire behaviour of LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> and confirmed the superior performance of the new composite <b>floor</b> <b>system.</b> This paper has shown that fire resistance ratings of a range of LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> can be predicted from the critical average joist temperature obtained from finite element analyses...|$|R

40|$|Typical steel deck-concrete slab <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> used in {{multi-story}} {{steel construction}} require intermediate filler or support beams (14 in. or deeper) and {{are limited to}} span of 8 - 12 ft depending on deck depth. The goal of the research was to develop and validate innovative long span <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> capable of spanning up to 30 ft with total depths up to 12 in. or less. Several long-span <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> were conceived and considered. These <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> were evaluated based {{on their ability to}} achieve certain performance objectives. To accomplish these objectives, the project has been conducted in four tasks. The first task focused on conducting a literature review and survey of existing long-span slab systems. This task was conducted to determine the state-of-art for existing <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> in steel construction. It helped in identifying existing solutions that have been proposed or implemented in steel construction. The second task of the research focused on conceptual development and design of long span <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> A suite of different <b>floor</b> <b>system</b> types were developed and proposed. The systems were ranked by the researchers and an oversight committee based on their technical merit and potential to achieve the prescribed performance objectives. The systems were analyzed and designed using analytical tools and methods including the finite element method (FEM), numerical analysis, and existing design codes. Based on the rankings, <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> were selected for further development and experimental validation. The third task for the research project focused on the experimental validation of the <b>floor</b> <b>system</b> candidates. The testing focused on three different aspects for the <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> The aspects included strength and serviceability characteristics at ambient temperature levels, the fundamental heat transfer of certain specimens, and the effects of combined mechanical and thermal loading.

40|$|The use of cold-formed steel as a {{framework}} for <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> in multi-story buildings and single occupancy residences is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to traditional materials and techniques. Builders and designers have recognized that the high strength-to-weight ratio provided by the cross-section of cold-formed steel members permits lighter structures and longer spans. The longer spans and lighter structures associated with cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> can result in vibration serviceability issues if proper design considerations are not made. Providing sufficient damping within the structure is {{the most effective way to}} ensure that occupants are comfortable under typical residential and office service loads. The modern, open-concept interior has open floor plans with few partitions and long spans, which result in inherently low structural damping. Cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> also have less mass than traditional <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> which will increase the amplitude of acceleration response. The vibration problems that may be present in cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> like any other <b>floor</b> <b>system,</b> can be addressed if proper consideration is given by designers. Traditional design approaches for vibration serviceability have proven inadequate, and there are no current methods available to designers for calculating the response of cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> In order to design a <b>floor</b> <b>system</b> to properly address occupant comfort, consideration must be given for the type of dynamic loading, resonance, dynamic response, and stiffness of the <b>floor</b> <b>system.</b> The objective of this thesis is to improve the understanding of the dynamic characteristics of cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> and recommend an adequate model for predicting the dynamic response and modal properties of <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> in order to aid the design process. This thesis presents the results of an extensive laboratory and field study on the vibration of cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>systems</b> built with cold-formed steel TreadyReady® joists and subfloor assemblies containing OSB, FORTACRETE®, sound reduction board, cold-formed steel deck, and LEVELROCK® topping were examined. Previous research has presented the observed influence of construction details on the modal properties of the laboratory <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> tested. This thesis discusses the influence of different details on the transverse stiffness of the <b>floor</b> <b>systems.</b> It was found that effectively restrained strongbacks, and cold-formed steel deck subfloor assemblies provided significant increases in transverse stiffness. Based on the analysis of the field testing data, recommended design damping ratios are provided for <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> constructed with the materials investigated in this study. Floor response that can be compared to serviceability criteria is presented. The peak RMS acceleration from walking excitation was found to be within the acceptable range for the ISO criterion based on residential occupancy, and the static deflection from a 1 kN point load was found to be within the acceptable range of Onysko’s criterion. An adequate design criterion for vibration requires a limiting value, and a means of estimating floor response for comparison. The AISC, ATC, and Smith, Chui, and Hu Orthotropic Plate design methods were evaluated by comparing predicted frequency against measured frequency for the test floors. The ATC and Smith, Chui, and Hu Orthotropic Plate methods were evaluated by comparing predicted deflection against measured deflection for the test floors. The ATC method is recommended as the best method for calculating floor response based on current publications. A design procedure is recommended for cold-formed steel <b>floor</b> <b>systems,</b> using the ATC design guide. The ATC acceleration criterion for walking excitation must be met for floors with fundamental frequencies of less than 15 Hz, and the ATC static deflection criterion must be met for all floors. Proposed modifications to the ATC method to improve the design of cold-formed steel floors include: adopting the recommended design damping ratios from this thesis; adopting the frequency-weighted ISO limiting acceleration and, obtaining several coefficients and empirical expressions that are relevant to cold-formed steel floors from further testing.

50|$|Yuncken Freeman {{carried out}} a series of {{experiments}} for the design proposals of BHP House in the construction processes of their own offices in 1970, located at 411-415 King Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Under the advice of Fazlur Khan, a structural engineer from Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), the design revolves around four basic components in order to reinvent the tower as a ‘cantilever’ and achieve the properties of a ‘giant stiff structural tube’. The four components consist of a steel-framed <b>flooring</b> <b>system,</b> a steel-framed central core, a steel and glass façade, and steel trusses that connect the central core to the façade. Innovative techniques were employed to lay the foundations of the building - a concrete raft which was poured in a single continuous action. The weight of the floor structure was reduced by using steel beams rather than concrete in order to prop up steel decking and a lightweight layer of concrete. Along with cap and belt trusses, this <b>flooring</b> <b>system</b> performed a stiffening effect and allowed structural loads to be transferred down through the central steel-framed core and the outer steel-framed façade, eradicating the need for internal columns and providing flexibility for internal spaces. The design of the building also gained more attention through the ‘total energy system’ which allowed electrical generation using BHP natural gas. BHP House set the standard for many subsequent office buildings and led to the change of Melbourne Town Planning Codes which were altered to cater for increased building heights and floor areas.|$|E

40|$|Buildings {{that are}} not {{designed}} to have fire safety measures {{are not able to}} endure the extreme conditions in a fire event. Hence considerably more attention is being placed on the fire safety of buildings in recent times. Light gauge steel framed (LSF) <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> are commonly used in buildings as they provide significant benefit by reducing weight and cost while increasing construction efficiencies. To obtain a satisfactory fire resistance level, <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> must comply with a number of requirements speciﬁed in codes relating to ﬁre resistance level. However, to understand the heat transfer process within LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> usually requires numerous complex fire tests. These tests are extremely expensive and time consuming. Therefore three-dimensional finite element models were developed and used in this study to investigate the heat transfer in LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> made of different joist sections such as Lipped Channel and Hollow Flange Channel beam sections. Standard fire curve was defined as an amplitude curve following a time-temperature profile based on ISO 834 standard fire curve. The time-temperature curves obtained from the finite element analyses were compared with available experimental results to determine their accuracy in predicting the heat transfer in LSF <b>floor</b> <b>systems</b> made of the two chosen joist sections.
