The research participants were 462 e-learners registered for cyber-lectures through an electronics company in South Korea. The extrinsic variables were sense of teaching <b>presence,</b> sense of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> and usage. According to structural equation modeling, each of these variables and flow significantly affected satisfaction. Although sense of teaching presence and satisfaction significantly affected sense of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> usage and flow did not significantly affect learning persistence. Accordingly, we established a corrected model after removing insignificant paths and investigated again. We confirmed that learning flow significantly intermediated among sense of teaching <b>presence,</b> sense of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> and satisfaction but not between usage and satisfaction. In addition, satisfaction intermediated among sense of teaching <b>presence,</b> sense of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> usage, flow, and learning persistence. These findings demonstrate the importance of sense of teaching <b>presence,</b> sense of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> and usage for e-learners.

Specifically, this paper proposes that high-levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> can be facilitated in online courses, based on the community of inquiry model, by building upon existing research in i) self-regulated learning through externally-facilitated regulation scaffolding and ii) computer-supported collaborative learning through role assignment. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in a fully-online course (N= 82) using six offerings of the course. After performing a quantitative content analysis of online discussion transcripts, a multilevel linear modeling analysis showed the significant positive effects of both externally-facilitated regulation scaffolding and role assignment on the level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence.</b> Specifically, the results showed that externally-facilitated regulation scaffolding had a higher effect on <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> than extrinsically induced motivation through grades.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study was (1) to investigate how student perceptions of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> social presence, and teaching presence in an online Community of Inquiry are related to motivation, (2) how student perceptions of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> social presence, teaching presence, and motivation are related to learning flow, and (3) to explore how individual learners perceive their learning flow experience in courses in an online master’s degree program. A sequential explanatory (QUAN→qual) mixed method design was employed. A total of 77 students participated in this study. Multiple linear regression analysis and path analysis were adopted to identify the relationships among the factors of interest for the quantitative data analyses. Student interviews were administered to provide the qualitative data to support interpretation of the quantitative results. ^ Motivation had a strong positive relationship {{with each of the}} three <b>presences</b> (<b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> social presence, and teaching presence) of the Community of Inquiry framework. Teaching presence, social <b>presence,</b> and <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> statistically significantly predicted students’ perceptions of motivation. Learning flow had a strong positive relationship with motivation and each of the three <b>presences</b> (<b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> social presence, and teaching presence) of the Community of Inquiry framework. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> and motivation statistically significantly predicted students’ perceptions of learning flow. Teaching <b>presence</b> and <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> had a positive direct effect on motivation. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> and motivation had a positive direct effect on learning flow, and there was a partial mediation effect of motivation between <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> and learning flow. The identified key themes that emerged from the data about students’ perceptions of their learning flow experience were as follows: 1) students are deeply absorbed in learning when learning activities or materials are pragmatic and relevant to their real life situation, 2) instructors’ guidance encourages students and promotes their learning flow, 3) students are immersed in learning when they are able to construct and confirm meaning through assignments, 4) weekly online discussions evoke learning flow, 5) collaboration has an impact on students’ learning flow, and 6) distractive learning environments obstruct learning flow. ^ Based on the results, implications for instructional strategies to enhance student learning flow in students 2 ̆ 7 online learning activities were developed.

40|$|Web-based {{learning}} progresses as {{access to}} the Internet grows. As learners and educators in virtual learning communities, we strive for ways to measure how well teachers teach and learners learn. While the literature is replete with articles and books discussing online learning {{from the perspective of}} social and teaching presence, there are few studies that examine the relationship between <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> and learning effectiveness in an online environment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> and learning outcome in an asynchronous discussion forum. Thus, this study examined performance in an online course in relation to student interaction and level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> in the course. The data were collected from students enrolled in 10 sections of an online class taught at a large public university in the Southeastern United States. The study was mixed-method in nature. It consisted both of qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics with Pearson correlations between the dependent variable (student course module grades) and the independent variables (maximum levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> number of messages and message lengths). The study resulted in two key theoretical contributions. The first is that maximum level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> is a better indicator of student learning than mean level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence.</b> The results of the study indicate that students achieved mastery of the subject matter over time. Typically <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> has been measured as a mean score for a course. This strategy is akin to giving the student a pre-test on a body of content at the beginning of the lesson, and a post test at the end, and then averaging these two to determine the student’s grade. Doing so seems to ignore, or at least diminish the fact that learning occurs over time. Student mastery of a content is a better indicator of learning than student progress. Thus, this study suggests that a more appropriate measure of student learning, in terms of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence,</b> is the maximum level reached by every student, rather than the mean level of all students. The second theoretical contribution is that in on-line learning, a student displaying the <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> “Resolution” stage in a discussion may inhibit others from displaying that stage. When a student has posted a message at the resolution stage during a discussion other students are more likely to respond with messages like “I agree” than they are to restate the resolution stage message. The “I agree” type message would not be coded at the resolution stage, thus the student who posted that message would not be seen to have reached that stage, when in fact, he or she may well have done so. This leads to a faulty perception of the overall level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence.</b> It may be difficult to control for this inhibitory effect but some creative structuring of course content and assignments should make it possible. Future studies addressing <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> in online learning environments should take both of these ideas into consideration...|$|R

Ten years ago, Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2000) published an article describing the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework which provided an outline of three core elements that were able to describe and measure a collaborative and positive educational experience in an online learning environment, namely teaching presence (design, facilitation, and direct instruction), social presence (the ability of learners to project themselves socially and emotionally), and <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence</b> (the extent to which learners are able to construct and confirm meaning through sustained reflection and discourse). 	This dissertation extends the body of research surrounding the CoI framework and also the literature on developing critical thinking in online environments by examining and exploring the extent to which teaching and social <b>presence</b> contribute to <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence.</b> The researcher was able to do this by offering 189 learners enrolled in 10 research methods courses and educational research courses an opportunity to use an innovative online resource (Research Design Learning Resource – RDLR) to assist them in learning about educational research and developing research proposals.

In this diagnosis, the following methods and techniques were employed: interview with her mother; Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS), to evaluate MI's mental maturity [35]; Human Figure Drawing (HFD III) [36], to evaluate <b>her</b> <b>cognitive</b> development; and visits {{to the school and}} informal observations. Some PD sessions with MI took place in her school, where the researchers were allowed to carry out some of the research activities. Meetings at school were also convenient for the target user and the other participants of the dev-team, due to logistic reasons.|$|R
30|$|Qualitative {{feedback}} on the seminars shows that collaborative learning took place, suggesting that the practical inquiry cycle was completed in some groups in each seminar, even though not all students commented as such. The most important contribution of the seminars (with 27 quotes) was the application of theory to practice, through applying theoretical concepts in cases of familiar businesses. Students recognised the theoretical models underpinning the subject in existing business. This aspect represents the resolution phase of the practical inquiry model in the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Presence,</b> confirmed by quantitative ratings of the seminars (Table 4). The second most salient theme pointed towards the Integration phase of <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Presence</b> (14 codes), where understanding was at a deeper and more applied level than that resulting from the videos. Connecting their ideas of theoretical proposals to a real live business helped students understand the domain better. Exploration, the second step in <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Presence,</b> was implied as students learnt from different perspectives. Formative feedback from the facilitator clarified student thinking, while the teacher skilfully facilitated discussions in the groups, representing Teaching Presence (5 codes) that also included direct instruction. Two students specifically said that they enjoyed interacting with peers, and how this class engaged everybody; some of the interaction in the cognitive cycle was mediated by peers, and implies some measure of Social Presence.|$|R
40|$|Though online enrollments {{continue}} to accelerate {{at a rapid}} pace, there is significant concern over student retention. With drop rates significantly higher than in face-to-face classes {{it is imperative that}} online providers develop an understanding of factors that lead students to disenroll. This study utilizes a data mining approach to examine course-level disenrollment through the lens of student satisfaction with the projection of Teaching, Social and <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Presence.</b> In comparing the highest and lowest disenrollment quartiles of all courses at American Public University the value of effective Instructional Design and Organization, and initiation of the Triggering Event phase of <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Presence</b> were found to be significant predictors of student satisfaction in the lowest disenrollment quartile. For the highest disenrollment quartile, the lack of follow-through vis-à-vis Facilitation of Discourse and Cognitive Integration were found to be negative predictors of student satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses Garrison, Anderson and Archer’s (2000) Community of Inquiry {{framework}} {{to investigate the}} levels of <b>cognitive</b> and teaching <b>presence</b> within online discussions {{as a component of}} an undergraduate face-to-face course. Online discussion was used to support face-to-face learning and teaching. The student and instructor online postings were analyzed using the indicators of <b>cognitive</b> and teaching <b>presence</b> within the Community of Inquiry framework. Although the instructor actively participated and facilitated online discussions, the course was not designed for pre-service teachers to move through all four phases of <b>cognitive</b> <b>presence.</b> This paper examines the levels of engagement that pre-service teachers who had enrolled in a face-to-face course, utilised non-compulsory online discussion forums to enhance their learning...|$|R
