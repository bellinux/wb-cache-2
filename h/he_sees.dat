60|$|Further, {{though the}} {{fly in the}} web is {{altogether}} incapable of looking for relief, yet this awakened, tempted Christian is not. What must he do therefore?

Shall this man lie down and despair? No. Shall he trust to his duties? No. Shall he stay from Christ till his heart is better? No. What then? Let him NOW look to Jesus Christ crucified, then shall <b>he</b> <b>see</b> his sins answered for, then shall <b>he</b> <b>see</b> death a-dying, then shall <b>he</b> <b>see</b> guilt borne by another, and there shall <b>he</b> <b>see</b> the devil overcome. This sight destroys {{the power of the}} first temptation, purifies the heart, and inclines the mind to all good things.|$|R
