5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal. NCOs are often {{used in conjunction with}} a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) at the output to create a direct digital synthesizer (DDS).|$|E

The Snapdragon system on chip (SoC) was announced in November 2006 and included the Scorpion processor, {{as well as other}} semiconductors. This also included Qualcomm's first custom Hexagon <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processor (DSP).|$|E

In addition to set top boxes, the assistance included any necessary cabling or antenna upgrades needed to achieve a reliable <b>digital</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Delta-sigma (ΔΣ; or sigma-delta, ΣΔ) {{modulation}} is {{a method}} for encoding analog <b>signals</b> into <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> as found in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It {{is also used to}} transfer high bit-count low frequency <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> into lower bit-count higher frequency <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> as part of the process to convert <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> into analog as part of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of processing of <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> has dramatically increased due to {{widespread use of}} digital systems. A new FPGA based technique for processing of two <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> to generate a new signal {{as a product of}} two signals is presented. The technique is based upon the use of orthogonal functions to describe <b>digital</b> <b>signals.</b> © 2010 IEEE. IEE...|$|R
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a <b>digital</b> <b>signal,</b> the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
50|$|For analog signals, signal {{processing}} may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For <b>digital</b> <b>signals,</b> {{signal processing}} may involve the compression, error checking and error detection of <b>digital</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, unless the {{additive}} noise disturbance exceeds a certain threshold, {{the information contained}} in <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> will remain intact. Their resistance to noise represents a key advantage of <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> over analog signals.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{telephones}} use <b>digital</b> <b>signals,</b> while land lines terminate in {{analog signal}} systems. For historical reasons, mobile phone calls that cross network/carrier boundaries use an analog network backbone, and are converted from <b>digital</b> to analog <b>signals</b> on one network and converted back to <b>digital</b> <b>signals</b> {{on the receiving}} network.|$|R
5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E
5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted {{to emulate the}} sound of a Hammond using <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons to emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology. The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

25|$|The direct-broadcast {{satellite}} television signals were earlier analog <b>signals</b> and later <b>digital</b> <b>signals,</b> {{both of which}} require a compatible receiver. <b>Digital</b> <b>signals</b> may include high-definition television (HDTV).

25|$|In {{the domain}} of <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing, the term {{interpolation}} refers {{to the process of}} converting a sampled <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> (such as a sampled audio signal) to that of a higher sampling rate (Upsampling) using various digital filtering techniques (e.g., convolution with a frequency-limited impulse signal). In this application there is a specific requirement that the harmonic content of the original signal be preserved without creating aliased harmonic content of the original signal above the original Nyquist limit of the signal (i.e., above fs/2 of the original signal sample rate). An early and fairly elementary discussion on this subject can be found in Rabiner and Crochiere's book Multirate <b>Digital</b> <b>Signal</b> Processing.|$|E
