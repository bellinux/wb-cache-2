5|$|Pineda was {{selected}} to the All-Star Game on July 10 {{as a replacement for}} Justin Verlander, who was ineligible to pitch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> due to having pitched the day before the All-Star break. He was 8–6 at that point, but with a 3.03 ERA and 113 strikeouts in 113 innings, against only 36 walks. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game,</b> Pineda pitched one perfect inning, striking out Scott Rolen and Rickie Weeks.|$|E
5|$|In his 12 starts {{before the}} All-Star break, Lin {{averaged}} 22.5points and 8.7assists, and New York had a 9–3 record. He {{played in the}} Rising Stars Challenge during NBA All-Star Weekend. He was omitted from the original Rising Stars roster, but was added after his sudden rise to stardom. Some media outlets—including USA Today, Los Angeles Times, and CBSSports.com—stated that he deserved to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game.</b>|$|E
5|$|The NBA began {{offering}} All-Star ballots in three languages—English, Spanish and Chinese—for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Yao was voted to {{start for the}} West over O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards. Yao received nearly a quarter million more votes than O'Neal, and {{he became the first}} rookie to start <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> since Grant Hill in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The Nailers {{had three}} players {{selected}} for the 2009 ECHL All-Star Game, all reserve forwards. Nick Johnson, the only Penguins prospect, was drafted by the team 67th overall in 2004 and signed an entry-level contract with the organization in March 2008. Johnson did not play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> because he finished the season with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.|$|E
5|$|After the rosters were announced, {{a second}} round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was {{commenced}} to determine the occupant of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2013 season, DeAndre Yedlin became the first Sounders Academy player to sign a HGP contract. In his first {{professional}} season with Seattle, Yedlin was part of the United States squad for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the MLS squad for the 2013 MLS All-Star Game. Yedlin appeared in all three of the U-20's games and played 24 minutes against A.S. Roma <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chappuis {{was also}} {{selected}} {{to play for}} coach Frank Leahy on the College All-Star squad against the Chicago Cardinals, who were the 1947 NFL Champions. In the 15th College All-Star vs. NFL Champion match, the Cardinals scored the biggest victory to date with a 28–0 victory. Among the collegians were Lujack and Chuck Conerly. The professional athletes included Paul Christman and Charley Trippi. Supposedly, the 1947 class had a void at fullback, {{which may have been}} the problem with their offense <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>game</b> shutout.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year of}} success, the Devils were in {{the middle}} of the pack for most of the 1995–96 season and barely missed the playoffs. Brodeur played in 74 of his team's 82 games, setting a single-season record for most minutes played by a goalie, while having the 2nd-most shutouts (6) in the league. He was named the starter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> for the Eastern Conference and stopped all 12 shots he faced. He {{finished}} fourth in voting for the Vezina Trophy, which is awarded to the league's top goaltender. Brodeur also played on Team Canada during the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, where Canada lost to the United States in the gold medal finals.|$|E
5|$|After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals {{agreed on}} a new {{contract}} in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year. Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> {{for the first time}} in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award. During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.|$|E

5|$|In the playoffs, the Bulls {{lost only}} {{three games in}} four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, Orlando Magic 4–0). They {{defeated}} the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game,</b> regular season and NBA Finals, Willis Reed having achieved the first, during the 1969–70 season. Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on Father's Day, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Brodeur {{topped the}} 40-win mark {{for the third}} time in his career, despite having an average GAA and save-percentage {{throughout}} the season. He played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> for the 6th consecutive season, and helped the Devils earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round Brodeur recorded two shutouts against the Carolina Hurricanes and the Devils took the series in six games. After struggling to beat 7th-seeded Toronto in seven games, the Devils defeated the 6th-seeded Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals, where Brodeur added two more shutouts, both on the road. In their second straight Stanley Cup finals appearance, the Devils played a back-and-forth series against the top seeded Colorado Avalanche, and lost in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Young {{entered the}} All-Star {{break with the}} major league lead in ERA and {{opponent}} batting average {{as well as an}} undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals. Prior to the announcement of his election, Young dropped his appeal of the five-game suspension. Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All-Star break and the first game afterwards, yet was allowed to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> at AT Park in San Francisco, California. In the fifth inning of the 5–4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher, he surrendered the first inside-the-park home run in All-Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's {{first draft}} pick after being {{selected}} by the Kansas City Athletics. Royce Lewis is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2017. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 have participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game,</b> and three (Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, and Bryce Harper) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, {{and the others were}} drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University and Vanderbilt University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when Ken Griffey, Jr. was inducted with a record 99.3% of votes cast.|$|E
5|$|In June 2001, Ripken {{announced}} he would retire {{at the end of}} the season. He was voted the starting third baseman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> at Seattle's Safeco Field on July 10, 2001. In a tribute to Ripken's achievements and stature in the game, shortstop Alex Rodriguez (unknowingly foreshadowing his own future) insisted on exchanging positions with third baseman Ripken for the first inning, so that Ripken could play shortstop as he had for most of his career. That move allowed Ripken to claim the record of most MLB All-Star Game appearances at shortstop. In the third inning, Ripken made his first plate appearance and was greeted with a standing ovation. Ripken then homered off the first pitch from Chan Ho Park. Ripken ended up with All-Star MVP honors, becoming one of four players in MLB history with multiple All Star Game MVP Awards (1991 and 2001) and the only player to be named All-Star Game MVP in two different decades.|$|E
5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. Iginla {{struggled}} offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling {{to the bottom of}} the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game</b> as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E

5|$|Ruffing pitched for the Yankees during Opening Day of the 1942 season. That year, he {{compiled}} a 14–7 win-loss record. He was again named an All-Star, and again did not pitch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game,</b> which {{was started by}} teammate Spud Chandler. Though teammate Tiny Bonham had a better season, pitching to a 21–5 win-loss record, McCarthy again chose Ruffing as his Game One starter for the 1942 World Series, setting a record with six World Series Game One starts that stood until Whitey Ford started his seventh Game One in the 1963World Series. Ruffing defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in Game One, his seventh World Series victory. This set a record that was surpassed by Ford in 1960. Ruffing pitched again in the Game Five, with the Yankees down three games to one. Ruffing lost the game, as the Cardinals defeated the Yankees to win the series.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{entered the}} All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also {{selected}} to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>game,</b> being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth {{for the first}} time since 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105–103. On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108–100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions {{for the first time}} since 2007. They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced the Nets in the first round of the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2007, when the Nets were located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly advanced to the next round, but Paul Pierce blocked a potential game-winner by Lowry in Game 7.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees started Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season. He {{was again}} named an All-Star during the 1938 season. Yankees' manager Joe McCarthy, who managed the AL team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>All-Star</b> <b>Game,</b> chose {{teammate}} Lefty Gomez {{as the starting}} pitcher. As McCarthy {{did not believe in}} pitching two players from the same team in an All-Star Game, Ruffing did not appear in the game. He led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season. He also tied for the AL lead in shutouts during with three, while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the league, behind only Grove. Ruffing pitched the opening game of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs. He won two games in the series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs. Ruffing finished fourth in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season.|$|E
