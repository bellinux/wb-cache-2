5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E

5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls are <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off. Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E
