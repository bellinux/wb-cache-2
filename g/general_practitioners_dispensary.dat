40|$|The medical {{encounter}} has a {{long tradition}} of being analysed in terms of patient-practitioner relations, but in medical anthropology this frame has been critiqued as too narrow from the earliest days of the field’s inception. One of the first monographs, which was on called “medical pluralism” (Janzen 1978), emphasized that decisions regarding treatment were not usually taken by the patient in consultation with their practitioner. Rather, they involved a wide range of different people, a so-called “therapymanaging group”. Janzen, who worked as a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> in a <b>dispensary,</b> furthermore noted that his consultation with a patient was but one in a long series of visits to diviners and herbalists, conversations with friends and relatives, and participation in large meetings held by prophets and/or village elders...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{ascertain}} {{the contribution of}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> to hospital intrapartum care in 1988. DESIGN [...] Confidential postal questionnaire. SETTING [...] All maternity units in England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Type of <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> unit (if any); number of bookings, transfers, and deliveries by general practitioners; participation of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the policy and audit of the unit. RESULTS [...] 277 (93 %) of 297 units replied. Of 611, 644 deliveries, 36, 043 (5. 9 %) were under <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> care. In all, 228 units permitted <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> to book women under their sole care: 65 were isolated, 29 alongside, and 134 integrated <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> units. Alongside units had significantly more bookings (568), antenatal transfers (69), intrapartum transfers (86), and deliveries (387) compared with isolated units (185, 18, 16, and 125, respectively) and integrated units (106, 18, 18, and 52) (p less than 0. 001 for all differences). The percentage of women booked by <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> transferred either before or during labour was independent of both the type of unit {{and the number of}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> bookings. <b>General</b> <b>practitioners</b> in consultant units were significantly less likely to attend meetings reviewing perinatal mortality (p less than 0. 01), and these units were less likely to have any form of general practitioner-consultant liaison committee (p less than 0. 001) compared with <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> units as a whole. Compared with those in isolated and alongside units, <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in integrated units were less likely to have taken part in deciding the unit's booking policy (p less than 0. 01) and consultants more likely to be the final determinant of whether a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> should be permitted to practice within the unit (p less than 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS [...] Both the number of deliveries booked by <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and the number of isolated <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> units have fallen. Transfer from <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> to consultant care was independent of the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> unit's caseload or the type of unit. <b>General</b> <b>practitioner</b> units differ from consultant units in important ways and differ among themselves as well. Except in remote areas, alongside units may be the ideal type of unit to encourage <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> to continue to provide intrapartum care...|$|R

40|$|Objective: What {{influences}} {{the coordination of}} care between <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and hospitals? In this paper, <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> satisfaction with hospital—GP interaction is revealed, and related to several background variables. Method: A questionnaire was sent to all <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Norway (3388), asking their opinion on the interaction and coordination {{of health care in}} their district. A second questionnaire was sent to all the somatic hospitals in Norway (59) regarding formal routines and structures. The results were analysed using ordinary least squares regression. Results: <b>General</b> <b>practitioners</b> tend to be less satisfied with the coordination of care when their primary hospital is large and cost-effective with a high share of elderly patients. Together with {{the degree to which the}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> is involved in arenas where hospital physicians and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> interact, these factors turned out to be good predictors of <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> satisfaction.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{examine the}} {{concerns}} of singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> working in an inner London area and to compare the views of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in partnerships. DESIGN [...] Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with {{a random sample of}} singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and a sample of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> from partnerships matched for age and sex.

RESULTS [...] The singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> {{were more likely to be}} older, male, and first qualified abroad than <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in partnerships. Their major concerns were inadequate premises, maintaining their singlehanded status, and coping with recent changes to their contract. Most were very satisfied with their solo status and did not see the provision of 24 hour care as stressful. CONCLUSION [...] Singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> saw themselves as providing a unique service for patients, and their status as an alternative for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> who were unhappy in partnerships.

40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} {{adherence}} by senior NHS medical {{staff to the}} BMA guidelines on the ethical responsibilities of doctors towards themselves and their families. Design Postal semistructured questionnaire. Setting Four randomly selected NHS trusts and three local medical committees in South Thames region. Subjects Consultants and principals in general practice. Main outcome measures Personal use of health services. Results The response rate was 64 % (724) for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and 72 % (427) for consultants after three mailings. Most (1106, 96 %) respondents were registered with a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner,</b> although little use was made of their services. 159 (26 %) <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were registered with a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> in their own practice and 80 (11 %) admitted to looking after members of their family. 73 (24 %) consultants would never see their <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> before obtaining consultant advice. Most consultants and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> admitted to prescribing {{for themselves and their}} family. Responses to vignettes for different health problems indicated a general reluctance to take time off, but there were differences between consultants and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and by sex. Views on improvements needed included the possibility of a "doctor's doctor," access to out of area secondary care, an occupational health service for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> and regular health check ups.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Research {{suggests}} that patients are {{more satisfied with}} patient-centred consultations than with doctor-centred consultations and that some health measures are positively influenced by this type of consultation. Research on {{the factors that influence}} the patient centredness of the consultation is sparse but {{suggests that}} women doctors are more patient centred than men doctors. AIM. A study was designed, first, to confirm or reject the suggestion that women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> are more patient centred than men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and, secondly, to determine some of the factors that might influence the patient centredness of a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner.</b> METHOD. The audiotaped consultations of 41 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were analysed using an instrument designed to measure patient centredness. The <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were selected from a group of volunteers to represent both sexes as well as a wide range of age and experience. RESULTS. The results of the analysis showed that women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> particularly trainers, had higher patient-centredness scores than men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> This behaviour is characterized by an increased frequency of open questions and greater attention to patient offers (anything of potential significance that a patient brings to the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> consultation). Additionally, the combination of sexes in a consultation seemed to {{have an effect on the}} interaction, with woman general practitioner/female patient dyads (pairings) having the highest median patient-centredness score, woman general practitioner/male patient and man general practitioner/male patient dyads scoring the same as each other and man general practitioner/female patient dyads having the lowest median scores. CONCLUSION. The results suggest that women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> in this sample, were more patient centred than men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The results also suggest that inherent inequalities exist, with female patients receiving a more patient-centred service from <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> of their own sex than from <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> of the opposite sex. Male patients, on the other hand, seemed to fare equally well, irrespective of the sex of their <b>general</b> <b>practitioner.</b> Training is required to address these inequalities and to improve the level of patient centredness in the consultation...|$|R

A questionnaire survey of 100 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> was undertaken to which 67 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> responded. RESULTS. The provision of practical prescribing advice by representatives and gifts relevant to medicine were seen as desirable activities by many respondents. However, gifts of value considerably greater than suggested acceptable in recent guidelines for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were also highly favoured by some practitioners. CONCLUSION.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the {{recruitment and retention}} of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and changes in their time commitment from 1 October 1990 to 1 October 1994. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of yearly data. SETTING: England and Wales. SUBJECTS: <b>General</b> <b>practitioners</b> in unrestricted practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> moving {{into and out of}} general practice; proportion of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> practising less than full time; proportion of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> having unchanged time commitment over the study period; and proportion of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> leaving <b>general</b> practice in 1991 who were subsequently practising in 1994. RESULTS: Numbers of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> entering <b>general</b> practice (1565 in 1990, 1400 in 1994) fell over the study period as did the numbers leaving general practice (1488 in 1990, 1115 in 1994). The net effect was an increase in both the total and full time equivalent <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> practising from 1 October 1990 (26, 757 full time equivalents) to 1 October 1994 (27, 063 full time equivalents). Numbers of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> practising full time were decreasing whereas part time practice was increasing; women were more likely to practise part time. 35. 5 % (43 / 121) of women practising full time and 17. 8 % (24 / 135) of men practising full time who left practice in 1991 were practising again in 1994. CONCLUSION: Simply using total numbers of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> or net increase to describe workforce trends masks much movement in and out of general practice and between differing time commitments. Recruitment and retention issues need to be separated if reasonable policies are to be developed to assure the necessary <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> workforce for a primary care led NHS...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{conclusions}} of this thesis is that <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> hold to the guidelines regarding the prescribing of medication. The data of patients and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were analyzed making use of the multilevel method. This method {{is related to the}} way in which the data of patients and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> are brought together in one analysis, viz. patients are nested under <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> As well the structure of the data as the structure of the research questions concern two populations, those are patients and <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Examples of these research questions are the relation between the prescribing of medication and the adherence to guidelines, or the relation between the workload of the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> and the patient in his environment. Comparing the variation of the prescribing of the <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> with the variation of patients, it turned out that there were no significant differences between the <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> The multilevel method is preferred to the classic analysis of variance because fewer assumptions have to be made. The expectation is that this technique will be used more frequently in the near future because this multilevel technique implies a lot of advantages and a large number of applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: From Census data, to {{document}} the distribution of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Australia and to estimate the number of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> needed to achieve an equitable distribution accounting for community health need. Methods: Data on location of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> population size and crude mortality by statistical division (SD) {{were obtained from the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics. The number of patients per <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> by SD was calculated and plotted. Using crude mortality to estimate community health need, a ratio of the number of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> per person mortality was calculated for all Australia and for each SD (the Robin Hood Index). From this, the number of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> needed to achieve equity was calculated. Results: In all, 26, 290 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were identified in 57 SDs. The mean number of people per <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> is 707, ranging from 551 to 1887. Capital city SDs have most favourable ratios. The Robin Hood Index for Australia is 1, and ranges from 0. 32 (relatively under-served) to 2. 46 (relatively over-served). Twelve SDs (21 %) including all capital cities and 65 % of all Australians, have a Robin Hood Index > 1. To achieve equity per capita 2489 more <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (10 % of the current workforce) are needed. To achieve equity by the Robin Hood Index 3351 (13 % of the current workforce) are needed. Conclusions: The distribution of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in Australia is skewed.

40|$|BACKGROUND. There is an {{assumption}} {{that men and women}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> adopt different practice styles in the management of gynaecological disorders. However, there is little evidence to support this view. AIM. A study was undertaken to compare the practice styles of men and women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the management of menorrhagia. METHOD. The study took place in 73 general practices in the Oxford Regional Health Authority area. A total of 348 patients who consulted 74 men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and 43 women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> with a complaint of menorrhagia were recruited into the study and completed postal questionnaires nine and 18 months after entry into the study. Main outcome measures were men and women general practitioners' awareness of patients' treatment preferences, treatment received by patients, patients' involvement in treatment decisions and patients' satisfaction with treatment received. RESULTS. There were no statistically significant differences in treatment received by patients of men and women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Fewer patients consulting women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were referred to a gynaecologist compared with patients consulting men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (56 % versus 64 %) and fewer underwent surgery (39 % versus 47 %). More patients consulting women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> reported participation in treatment decisions (63 % versus 53 %) but more patients consulting men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were satisfied with the care they received (66 % versus 55 %).

40|$|Aim: To examine Australian private {{practice}} dietitians' relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and practice nurses {{as a factor}} that influences dietetic referrals. Methods: Semistructured telephone interviews and an online survey were conducted with Australian {{private practice}} dietitians (n = 52 and n = 90, respectively) between April and May 2008. Semistructured questionnaires were conducted with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (n = 11) and practice nurses (n = 12) from the 'GP Access' Division of General Practice between March and July 2007. Results: General practitioners' relationships with dietitians {{were believed to be}} the primary influencing factor on referral, provided by 81 % of survey dietitians and 25 % of interview dietitians. The most common means of initially forming relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were face-to-face introduction (48 %) and introductory letters (37 %). Patient feedback via letter, fax or email was the most popular method of maintaining relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (77 %). Meeting with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in person was believed to be the most effective activity in building relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and increasing referral rates (42 %). Referral was made easier for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> by providing paper (37 %) or electronic (19 %) referral forms and contact details (19 %). The majority of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and dietitians believed that the 'Allied Health Services Under Medicare' made it easier to refer to a dietitian. Conclusions: Dietetic referrals can be encouraged through good relationships between <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> practice nurses and dietitians.

40|$|The {{use that}} 30 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in four group {{practices}} made of open access laboratory and radiological facilities was studied for one year. We were {{particularly interested in}} whether <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> hoped to exclude rather than confirm abnormality when requesting investigations. All {{but two of the}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> studied used investigations to exclude abnormality {{to a greater extent than}} to confirm it. The rate at which the practices investigated patients and the number of investigations requested were appreciably different and were different for individual <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> part time <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> requesting more investigations than trainees and full time <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Haematological investigations accounted for over 30 % of requests for investigations in all but one practice, biochemical investigations being requested as often as bacteriological investigations in two of the four practices. The ratio of expected to unexpected results varied among general practitioners; no <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> had more unexpected results and the range of ratios was similar for full time and part time <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and for trainees. The proportion of patients with abnormalities uncovered by each practice increased disproportionately as the use of investigations increased, supporting a higher rather than lower rate of investigation among <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Compared with the results of other studies the use of the radiological facilities available was low. X ray examinations of the skeleton were requested more than chest and contrast media examinations by three of the four practices.

40|$|Abstract Objective. To {{identify}} {{the attitudes and}} perspectives of the family physician towards the caregivers of demented relatives and to describe the caregivers’ satisfaction. Design. Systematic review. Subjects. The studied population consisted of dementia family and their <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Main outcome measures. Outcome measures were the generic tasks and skills of the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> to improve home care {{from the perspective of}} the family caregiver. Caregivers were assessed on satisfaction regarding the care provided by their <b>general</b> <b>practitioner.</b> Results. The <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> is aware of his/her skills and limits in all aspects of dementia care and his/her role towards the family caregiver. They also acknowledged the importance of an adequate diagnostic process, but they felt uncomfortable disclosing the diagnosis to both the patient and the caregiver. They reported having more confidence in treatment matters than in diagnostic stages. Caregivers’ reports on the attitude of their <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> in the diagnostic process were rated from helpful to poorly empathized. <b>General</b> <b>practitioners</b> found themselves to be highly involved in dementia home care, but caregivers rated their involvement to be insufficient. The lack of appropriate communication skills of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> was also not appreciated by the caregivers. A lack of time and reward was considered by the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> to be a major obstacle in dementia care. Conclusion. The key role of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> as care providers and care planners is consolidated by the family caregivers’ confidence in their skills. Clear guidelines from early diagnosis to adequate referrals should improve the ability of the <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> to support these time and energy-consuming home-care situations. Intervention studies addressing the gaps in the skills of the <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in dementia home care management could be helpful in supporting the family caregiver. status: publishe...|$|R
