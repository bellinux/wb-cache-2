Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, and she needed to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until you should go to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> she only learned to rest.|$|E

50|$|His {{experience}} at the hospital was formative. He worked with patients who were recovering from surgery; some of them {{told him that the}} hospital's treatments didn't make them <b>feel</b> <b>better,</b> even <b>if</b> examinations and test results indicated improvement. Others worried that Western medicine couldn't help them if their illness was a result of witchcraft (brujería). Through observations and conversations with patients and hospital staff—especially a Swedish doctor named Anders Hansson—he concluded that Western medicine did not meet all the needs of the indigenous population. But the limits to the hospital's efficacy were {{not just a matter of}} cultural difference: The indigenous population was contending with serious health problems and constrained medical resources.|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} people's perceptions {{of how they}} would feel if their partners cheated on them by having sex with their relatives, such as if a man's wife had sex with his brother. Kin selection theory suggests that in such situations, victims of infidelity might <b>feel</b> slightly <b>better</b> <b>if</b> their partners had sex with biological relatives (compared to sex with nonrelatives) {{because some of the}} victims' genes could still get passed on through their relatives. In two experiments, participants reported how they would feel in various scenarios involving their partners having sex with participants' relatives and nonrelatives. As expected, participants generally reported being very disapproving of a partner's hypothetical infidelity with both their relatives and nonrelatives. However, contrary to predictions generated by kin selection theory, participants tended to report that they would feel worse if their partners had sex with their relatives. We propose several explanations for the current findings and discuss their implications for kin selection theory...|$|R

[...] In another interview in the same month, Wire said, [...] "I just <b>feel</b> it's <b>better</b> <b>if</b> I don't see novel.

[...] In a November 2010 interview, Wire described {{the premise of the}} book as “really presumptuous...It would be really pious and stupid to try and ban it because we grew up on rock 'n' roll mythology.

40|$|For the {{development}} of a psychosomatic disorder there are three requisites: (1) a psychoneurotic predisposition; (2) an exciting emotional conflict, and (3) restriction of outward expression of the conflict. All individuals, whether normal or psychoneurotic, seek relief from the mental suffering occasioned by disturbing life problems. When emotional tension is expended by outward expression, muscular or verbal, all is well. By taking some form of action or doing something about it, the individual " gets it off his chest " and <b>feels</b> <b>better.</b> But <b>if</b> emotional dissipation is constantly restricted, the tension gradually mounts and, in a psycho-neurotic type of individual especially, {{the development}} of somatic complaints may be the eventual outlet. With the emergence of bodily symptoms the psycho-neurotic tends to focus his attention on them, and thereby is partially relieved from his inner mental tension. The psychophysiologic mechanism by which psychic disturbances are displaced into physical symptoms is not fully understood; undoubtedly it is complex. Recent studies suggest that emotions may affect the autonomic nervous system either directly or through the endocrine system, thereb...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the airflow and heat transfer for mixed convection have been simulated for a model general ward of hospital with six beds and partitions using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). Three different Reynolds numbers 100, 250, and 350 have been considered. Bounce-back condition has been applied at the wall. Results have been represented in three different case studies and the changes have been {{discussed in terms of}} streamlines and isotherms. Code validation has also been included before going through the simulation process and it shows good agreement with previously published papers when the comparison is made on average Nusselt number. Results show that the pattern of indoor airflow is varied in each and every case study due to the effect of mixed convection flow and placement of partition. In addition, the changes in average rate of heat transfer indicate that patients closer to inlet get the most air and <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> and <b>if</b> any patient does not need much air, he or she should be kept near the outlet to avoid temperature related complications...|$|R
50|$|Family {{income is}} one of the most {{important}} factors in determining the mental ability(intelligence) of their children. With such bad education that urban school are offering, parents of high income are moving out of these areas to give their children a better opportunity to succeed. As urban school systems worsen, high income families move to rich suburbs because that is were they <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> education is; <b>if</b> they do stay in the city, they put their children to private schools. Low income families don't have a choice but to settle for the bad education because they cannot afford to relocate to rich suburbs. The more money and time parents invest in their child plays a huge role in determining their success in school. Research has showed that higher mobility levels are perceived for locations where there are better schools.|$|R

After I heard the message from Captain Horn about the pirates, and everything, and as I didn't know exactly what sort of craft we would meet round about Jamaica, I thought we would feel a good deal safer, {{especially}} on account of you and Miss Croup, if we had some firearms aboard. So I put in some repeating rifles and ammunition, and I paid for them out of my own pocket! Such things always come in useful, and while I was commanding the vessel on which you were sailing, Mrs. Cliff, I didn't want to feel that I'd left anything undone which ought to be done.

Some of the crew must have noticed the guns, and as they couldn't think why we wanted them, unless we were going on a filibustering expedition, they got that notion into their heads and so cut the ship.

40|$|Consider the {{following}} dilemma. To get people’s attention and motivate action a charity organization decides to use vivid pictures of orphaned and starving children in Africa along with somber background music. A primary research stream within the affect literature suggests, first, that such stimuli {{are likely to}} put people {{in a bad mood}} and that bad moods produce mood congruent information retrieval and explanatory attributional processes (e. g., “I guess I didn’t like the appeal. ”), all of which could work to the disadvantage of the charity. However, a second research stream proposes that people in bad moods pursue strategies likely to improve their moods, so people could <b>feel</b> much <b>better</b> <b>if</b> they called the 800 number and made a donation to help the children. But which of these opposing outcomes is most likely to occur? In this chapter we apply a unified theoretical conceptualization (see also Andrade, 2005) that includes both informational and goal-directed properties of affect to three important substantive research streams (risk taking, helping others, eating patterns). These behaviors have not previously been brought together to observe their common affective underpinnings. We propose that the integration of these two established affective mechanisms (where informationa...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{maturity}} onset diabetes that {{is poorly}} controlled on maximal doses of oral hypoglycaemic agents {{are difficult to}} treat. A prospective randomised crossover study was performed in 58 predominantly non-obese patients on maximal doses of glibenclamide or metformin, or both, {{to find out if}} insulin would improve control or well being. The patients were given daily injections of up to 48 units of highly purified porcine lente insulin. Glycaemic control was improved by 15 % or more in only 18 patients; 14 others felt better but their diabetes was no better controlled. Those whose control was improved by insulin could not be distinguished by age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, or their own treatment preference. C peptide concentrations, however, did help predict the response to insulin, the fasting C peptide to glucose ratio being considerably lower in those patients whose control was better on insulin. These findings suggest that a simple insulin regimen does not necessarily lead to better glycaemic control in maturity onset diabetes. Nevertheless, a trial of insulin is often justified since it poses few practical difficulties and makes some patients <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> even <b>if</b> their control is not improved. A more complex regimen might improve control in more cases, but it might also be less acceptable to older patients...|$|R
