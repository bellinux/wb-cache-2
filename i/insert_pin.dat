40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of cyclic out-of-plane {{flexural}} experiments of brick wall specimens, reinforced by <b>inserting</b> stainless <b>pins.</b> <b>Inserting</b> stainless <b>pins</b> into unreinforced masonry walls is a technique suitable for the seismic retrofit of historic masonry constructions because of not only its lower cost and shorter construction period but also no external aesthetic alternations. Through the experiments, we examine {{the effectiveness of the}} retrofit method currently in use, present a simple design formula for evaluating the effect of the reinforcement, and determine the pattern of <b>inserting</b> stainless <b>pins</b> that has more stable reinforcing effect...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{lock and}} key device was discovered {{in the ruins of}} Nineveh, the capital of ancient Assyria. Locks such as this were later developed into the Egyptian wooden pin lock, which consisted of a bolt, door fixture, and key. When the key was <b>inserted,</b> <b>pins</b> within the fixture were lifted out drilled holes within the bolt, allowing it to move. When the key was removed, the pins fell part-way into the bolt, preventing movement.|$|R

50|$|Ivins, Thuot and Gemar {{took turns}} {{operating}} the arm {{as part of}} the DEE experiment. The crew gave good reviews to the technology during the morning, testing it by using the 50 foot (15 m) long arm to <b>insert</b> <b>pins</b> into sockets that had progressively smaller clearances, ranging from 3 mm of clearance for the loosest to 0.76 mm for the tightest. Later, a foot (300 mm) wide flat beam was inserted into a slot and then moved back and forth to correlate readings by the force sensor, technology that also was highly complimented by the crew.|$|R

Locking is provided by two frontal lugs which lock into the steel <b>insert</b> <b>pinned</b> inside the stamped steel receiver. The VG 2 rifle is fed from detachable box magazines, originally developed for Gewehr 43. The stock is crudely made from wood and consists of two separate parts: shoulder stock with semi-pistol grip and fore-end. Wood parts are permanently pinned to the receiver. Non-adjustable iron sights are provided for close-range shooting only, and zeroed for 100 m.|$|R

The plinth is 8 ft high with [...] "Churchill" [...] inscribed on it in large capital letters. A proposal to <b>insert</b> <b>pins</b> standing out of the statue's head was turned down in the 1970s - the pins were intended to stop wild birds from sitting on its head.|$|R
50|$|Despite its {{widespread}} adoption, the connector {{does have}} problems. It {{is difficult to}} remove because it is {{held in place by}} friction instead of a latch, and some poorly constructed connectors may have one or more pins detach from the connector during mating or demating. There is also a tendency for the loosely <b>inserted</b> <b>pins</b> on the male connector to skew out of alignment. The female sockets can spread, making the connection imperfect and subject to arcing. Standard practice is to check for any sign of blackening or browning on the white plastic shell, which would indicate the need to replace the arcing connector. In extreme cases the whole connector can melt due to the heat from arcing.|$|R
50|$|Most modern hot-swap methods use a {{specialized}} connector with staggered pins, so that certain pins {{are certain to}} be connected before others. Most staggered-pin designs have ground pins longer than the others, ensuring that no sensitive circuitry is connected before there is a reliable system ground. The other pins may all be the same length, {{but in some cases}} three pin lengths are used so that the incoming device is grounded first, data lines connected second, and power applied third, in rapid succession as the device is <b>inserted.</b> <b>Pins</b> of the same nominal length do not necessarily make contact at exactly the same time due to mechanical tolerances, and angling of the connector when inserted.|$|R

5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by <b>inserting</b> <b>pins</b> and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most of {{the failure}} {{accidents}} of machine equipment {{are related to the}} fatigue crack initiation and growth. Therefore, some research was performed to inspect crack initiation and to repair the cracked materials. Those studies are important for the safe operation of machines and to extend the machine life. We have shown some simple methods for arresting crack growth. Those methods are introduced in the present paper. First, a method of drilling stop holes near the crack tip is shown. In this method, additional holes were drilled {{in the vicinity of the}} main stop hole. Second, the method for <b>inserting</b> <b>pins</b> into stop holes is shown. Third, a method of applying a crack arrester for stopping the growth of long cracks is shown...|$|R
50|$|On August 5, 2011, while {{pitching}} {{in a game}} against the Washington Nationals, Nicasio was struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of Nationals shortstop Ian Desmond. Nicasio lost his balance and fractured a vertebra in his neck when he fell to the ground. During emergency surgery, doctors <b>inserted</b> <b>pins</b> into the fractured C-1 vertebra and secured a metal plate {{to the back of his}} neck. His recuperation was remarkably quick. Eleven days after the incident, he visited the dugout at Coors Field wearing a neck brace and came out on the field to a standing ovation. He continued to improve through physical therapy, and that winter he eased back into {{pitching in}} the Dominican Republic.|$|R

3000|$|Hip {{distraction}} using {{cross joint}} articulated external fixation {{has been used}} by a number of orthopaedic centres for the treatment of osteoarthritis, chrondrolysis, and osteonecrosis, as an alternative to hip arthroplasty or arthrodesis in the adolescent and young adults [...]. The hip, however, is problematic with respect to external fixation, as it lies deep, surrounded by powerful muscles and in intimate contact with major neurovascular structures and intrapelvic organs. The numbers of patients treated by this technique to date remains small and the technical detail and potential complications, with respect to the application of the external fixation, unclear. In this study we used anatomical information from CT scans combined with computer modelling of the hip and pelvis to identify safe screw positions in the periacetabular region. The surgical insertion of the pins was then performed on five cadavers and anatomical dissections undertaken to confirm the structures at risk. This study indicated that whilst {{there are a number of}} anatomic constraints, it is still possible to <b>insert</b> three <b>pins</b> with good divergence into the limited bony corridor of the peri-acetabular region recognising that the more posterior of the laterally <b>inserted</b> <b>pins</b> poses a potential risk to the sciatic nerve if not inclined away from the sciatic notch.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of maxillary expansion is to correct maxillo mandibular transverse discrepancies by skeletal (orthopedic) {{expansion of the}} maxilla while avoiding any dental side effects. [1]. For a rapid maxillary expansion (RME) device, the expansion of maxilla is accomplished through heavy forces {{that are capable of}} separating the midpalatal suture at the rate of 0. 2 to 0. 5 mm per day[1]. This procedure can be done rapidly or slowly depending upon the patient’s age and treatment plan [2]. In this technique, the orthodontist will custom fit an appliance on the upper molars of a patient (Figure 1). Either the patient or the parent will turn the appliance every day throughout a prescribed period. The current expanders are turned by first placing a pin in a tiny hole (capstan). The <b>inserted</b> <b>pin</b> will then push the hole {{to the rear of the}} expander. Naturally, the patient is asked to turn the active part of the screw to a certain counts...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a system to}} record and visualise in-vivo human lumbar spinal kinematics. As well, an extensive method to quantify the system's accuracy and reliability is detailed within. A data acquisition system measures lumbar motion associated with exercises similar to daily activities (gait, ranging, and load lifting). This involves a minimally invasive procedure to <b>insert</b> <b>pins</b> into three spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Three-dimensional electromagnetic position sensors are attached to these pins and stereo radiographs provide the calibration offsets necessary for the calculation of spinal segmental motion from the sensor data. Analysis software was written to aid researchers in extracting descriptive statistics and by displaying 2 -D graphs of the segmental motion. As an adjunct to the analysis software, a method was developed to visualise the subject's kinematics using 3 -D computer animation. This requires the subject to undergo magnetic resonance volume scans which yields vertebral surface data. This data and the previously acquired kinematics from the same person is combined through computer animation resulting in an intuitive visualisation of their spine's motion...|$|R
