40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Currently, the of lack {{information}} on shrub reestablishment following {{fire and the}} wide variability in rates of recovery have lead to uncertainty in using prescribed burning as a management tool in the mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. vaseyana (Rydb.)

This study examined the recovery of shrub density and percent canopy cover of mountain big sagebrush and other associated shrub species across 16 large fires, with between 4 - 49 years of recovery, in southeastern Oregon, northwestern Nevada, and northeastern California. Sagebrush recovery within the interior of these large (400 to 4000 ha each), uniform burns resulted from existing soil seed pools {{and in the absence}} of seed rain from adjacent unburned plants.

40|$|Invasive tunicates are {{creating}} costly fouling problems to the mussel aquaculture industry {{in many regions}} including Prince Edward Island, Canada. These invasive tunicates are also posing {{a threat to the}} ecosystem integrity of native species. There are currently four invasive tunicate species present in waters surrounding Prince Edward Island including: Ciona intestinalis, Styela clava, Botryllus schlosseri, and Botrylloides violaceus. Current monitoring practices for the presence of these species in PEI are conducted by costly and time consuming recruitment plates or via microscopy surveys for egg and larval stages using <b>dissecting</b> <b>microscopes.</b> However, these methods are inadequate for early detection. Recruitment plates only allow for the detection of tunicates once they have already established, and microscopic methods can be inaccurate since it is difficult to distinguish between eggs and larvae of different species of tunicate. In this study, we propose polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based detection as a means to overcome the limitations of current monitoring practices in water samples. For this purpose, oligonucleotide primers were generated to enable the rapid analysis of samples for the presence of invasive tunicates by PCR. Primers were designed from 18 S rDNA and COI gene sequences specific to each species and were evaluated for efficacy, specificity, and sensitivity in detecting target tunicate species. Through efficient detection methods and careful monitoring it is hoped that further invasions of these tunicate species throughout Prince Edward Island waters can be prevented or managed in their early stage...|$|R

30|$|Lichens were {{inventoried}} {{on each of}} {{the selected}} trees within established sampling heights based on three height categories: (1) base (forest floor to 0.3 m up the stem), (2) bole (0.3 m to 2.4 m, or up to the lowest live branch within the tree canopy), and (3) canopy (defined as the lowest live branch, excluding epicormic sprouts). Measurement of lichens on the base and bole sections of the stem were accomplished from the ground, whereas canopy samples were either collected from the ground with a pole saw or required climbing equipment to excise the selected branch. Lichen thalli were identified and recorded in the field within each sampling interval. Voucher specimens for each species identified on a plot were collected. Vouchers were later examined in the lab using compound and <b>dissecting</b> <b>microscopes,</b> chemical spot test, and thin layer chromatography when appropriate. All vouchers were deposited in the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, New York, USA. In addition to abundance (counts for a given species within a sampling height), cover was also visually estimated in the field for each lichen taxon recorded. Cover was placed into five groups as follows: 1 (1 % to 5 %), 2 (6 % to 25 %), 3 (26 % to 50 %), 4 (51 % to 75 %), and 5 (76 % to 100 %). An estimate of total lichen cover for each sampling interval was also made independent of those for the individual taxa. For the purposes of assessing growth form and reproductive mode, a table of all species found during the study was produced and these characters were scored for all taxa using existing references and standard literature. This resulted in the assignment of a growth form (i.e., crustose, foliose, fruticose) and reproductive mode (asexual vs. sexual) to each taxon.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A multifactorial design was used to test the effects of oviposition experience, mating, feeding, age, and foundress number on host-acceptance, number of offspring, and sex ratio in Melittobia digitata. The most important factor expediting oviposition was previous oviposition experience. All factors except for feeding experience affected the number of hours it took for a female to start laying eggs. Oviposition experience, mating, and age affected the number of eggs a female laid in the first 24 hours. The sex ratio was only affected by mating, and total numbers of offspring increased with an increase in mated females and foundresses. There were several complex interactions between various factors. Behavioral studies were conducted of M digitata on Apis mellifera pupae, pupashaped glass dummies, and flat glass to determine if females use shape to identify an object as a host worthy of oviposition. Results indicated that shape {{plays a major role in}} host recognition. In further experiments, M digitata was found to oviposit on artificial hosts, Parafilm(& domes containing artificial diet. It was determined that females preferred artificial hosts containing the agar-based diet to those containing only agar. Further testing ruled out the possibilities of a chemical ovipositional stimulant originating from the parafilm. Results suggest that females respond to the nutritional content of the host when considering an object for oviposition. Larval M. digilata mouthparts were examined in both dead and live specimens, using both light and electron microscopy. Newly hatched M digitata larvae were fed dyed wax and bee pupae to determine how larvae initially feed after hatching and to assess how larvae access food through the host cuticle. After 24 hours, larval guts contained dye, showing that upon hatching the larvae were capable of ingesting both wax and hemolymph fluids through the bee cuticle. Feeding damage was observed on honey bee larvae and pupae using microscopy, histology, and electron microscopy. Behavioral observations were made of feeding larvae under light and <b>dissecting</b> <b>microscopes.</b> This, along with the feeding damage seen in sections and with the electron microscope, suggests that larvae initially feed on the epicuticle, and subsequently suck fluids through the procuticle...|$|R
