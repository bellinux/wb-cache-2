Benzimidazoles {{present a}} {{significant}} group of drugs {{used to treat}} parasitic diseases in veterinary and human medicine. The aim of this thesis was to find suitable conditions for SPE method, especially to find a suitable eluent composition and {{assess the impact of}} pH on the course of the elution phase. Reduced flubendazole and oxibendazole were applied to SPE column and subsequently were eluted from the column by an <b>elution</b> <b>solvent.</b> The obtained elutes were analysed by HPLC. The results of the thesis show us that the least suitable solvent for elution FLUR and OXI from SPE column was formed by 2 parts of the organic phase and 8 parts of the inorganic phase. Using other elution solvents which contain 4, 6 and 8 parts of organic phase the results of elution were comparable. Effect of pH of the <b>elution</b> <b>solvent</b> to the elution process of the adsorbed analyte was not unequivocally evaluated because good results were obtained regardless of using acidic, neutral and alkaline <b>elution</b> <b>solvent...</b>|$|E

The <b>elution</b> <b>solvent</b> was 4 BV of 70 % ethanol and the desorption flow rate can be reached up to 1 mL/min. AB- 8 macroporous resin could be separated and purified of anthocyanins from black beans. The anthocyanins produced by the above conditions was black powder, the color value of purified anthocynins was 17. 72 times {{higher than that of}} the beginning. This study laid foundation for the industrial production of anthocyanin in black hulls of natural pigments, and had a positive {{role in the development of}} health care products...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{fragments}} {{that show}} {{a pattern of}} differential expression on differential display gels must be eluted from the gel matrix and reamplified to enable further analysis. Elution is usually achieved by heating excised gel slices in a small volume of either water or TE. Here we show that this elution step can adversely affect {{the ability of the}} eluted DNA to act as a template for PCR reamplification, probably via the process of depurination. Simply switching to an <b>elution</b> <b>solvent</b> designed to minimise depurination (PCR buffer) facilitates the elution of intact DNA fragments. This improvement is likely to be most beneficial when eluting higher molecular weight fragments (e. g. those > 500 bp), in situations where the amount of DNA in an excised gel slice is limited or when contaminating differential display products co-migrate with the differentially expressed product...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{extraction}} of {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) proteins and peptides from complex biological samples {{plays an important role}} in the discovery of useful biomarkers and signaling molecules. Various methods, such as solid-phase extraction (SPE), ultrafiltration, and size-exclusion chromatography have been developed for such extraction purpose. In this study, we present, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of alkyl-diol@SiO(2) mesoporous material MCM- 41 (alkyl-diol group on the external surface of mesoporous material) for selective {{extraction of}} LMW proteins and peptides from complex biological samples. The adsorption kinetics of LMW proteins, the influence of pH on adsorption and the desorption recovery by different <b>elution</b> <b>solvents</b> were investigated by using standard proteins as model samples. It was demonstrated that the modification of alkyl-diol group on the external surface could efficiently decrease the adsorption of HMW protein and increase the desorption recovery of LMW protein. Furthermore, the mesoporous materials were applied to selectively extract LMW proteins and peptides (< 10 kDa) from crude human plasma. And the modified MCM- 41 material had much better extraction selectivity and efficiency for LMW proteins and peptides than unmodified one. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{was performed in}} order to study the possibilities in using molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as sorbent material in solid-phase extraction (MISPE) for clean-up of clenbuterol from urine. A binding study of clenbuterol in several solvents was performed on a clenbuterol imprinted polymer {{as well as on}} a blank polymer. These binding experiments were used to find suitable loading, washing and <b>elution</b> <b>solvents</b> for the MISPE procedure. Extraction of clenbuterol from calf urine was performed by directly loading a 10 -ml urine sample onto the MIP column. Thereafter the column was washed with 10 mi of acetonitrile containing 1 % acetic acid, and finally clenbuterol was eluted with 6 mi of methanol containing 10 % acetic acid. A recovery of 65 % was obtained. This recovery could be increased up to 75 % if a sample volume of 1 ml was used or up to 100 % if urine was freeze-dried and the residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and spiked with clenbuterol prior to analysis. Chromatograms of the wash and eluate solutions show an efficient clean-up, which supports the potential of MISPE for clean-up of trace amounts of clenbuterol from calf urine.
