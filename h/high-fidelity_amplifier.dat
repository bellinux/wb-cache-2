50|$|In most {{scientific}} and technological, {{as distinct from}} mathematical, applications, something may be described as linear if the characteristic is approximately but not exactly a straight line; and linearity may be valid only within a certain operating region—for example, a <b>high-fidelity</b> <b>amplifier</b> may distort a small signal, but sufficiently little to be acceptable (acceptable but imperfect linearity); and may distort very badly if the input exceeds a certain value, taking {{it away from the}} approximately linear part of the transfer function.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, Alan Blumlein {{originated}} a configuration {{between a}} [...] "triode strapped" [...] tetrode and normal tetrode, {{that connects the}} extra grid (screen) of a tetrode to a tap from the OPT part way between the anode voltage and the supply voltage. This electrical compromise gives a gain and linearity equal to the best traits of both extremes. In a 1951 engineering paper published by David Hafler and Herbert Keroes, they determined that when the screen tap was set to approximately 43% of anode voltage, an optimized condition within the output stage occurred, which they referred to as ultra-linear. By the late 1950s, this design became the dominant configuration for <b>high-fidelity</b> PP <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Engineers {{designing}} {{audio equipment}} for the high-end audiophile or professional recording markets have a limited selection of high-resolution signal amplifiers that will meet end-user demands for both outstanding objective and critical subjective performance. Suitable devices must provide a combination of state-of-the-art specifications for low noise and ultra-low distortion along with high GBP and preferably unity gain stability. While nearly all suppliers develop and provide devices optimized for video, instrumentation, or low power, these applications demand a specification mix that does not necessarily align {{with the needs of}} the high-performance audio engineer. Accordingly, National Semiconductor has developed a series of high-performance, <b>high-fidelity</b> audio <b>amplifiers</b> specifically optimized for these applications. The LME 49710 / LM 4562 are representative of this line o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} detect the arc plasma, an {{in-depth}} analysis {{on the relationship between}} the technology and film properties is conducted in this article. In addition, a fast scanning Langmuir probe diagnostic system suitable for transient plasma diagnosis is also designed, coupled with the design scheme and schematic diagram. Regard the integrated circuit of MAX 038 as the core，and utilize FET to input <b>high-fidelity</b> operational <b>amplifier</b> OPA 604 as well as high power amplifier PA 93 to complete the intelligent saw-tooth wave sweep frequency power with the output amplitude of ± 100 V, output frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 10 MHz as well as the adjustable frequency and duty cycle. Then test the output waveform and the results show that the power module can precisely generate triangle wave, saw-tooth wave, rectangular wave (including square wave) and sine wave signal...|$|R
5000|$|He {{also played}} banjo in a Hawaiian jazz band, before forming his own Hedley Jones Sextet. Inspired by the {{recordings}} of Charlie Christian, {{but unable to}} afford an imported guitar, he built himself a solid-bodied electric guitar, and was featured with it {{on the front page}} of The Gleaner in September 1940, at about the same time that Les Paul was doing similar pioneering work in the US. Jones continued to build guitars for other Jamaican musicians in the years that followed. [...] In 1943 he joined the British Royal Air Force, trained as a radar engineer at the Royal Technical College in Glasgow, and served in Europe during World War II, returning to Jamaica in 1946. He started a radio servicing business in Kingston, and imported jazz records from the US. He began making amplifiers in the late 1940s, and played jazz and Cuban records through them at his record store, Bop City. Jones built powerful amplifiers, with the technologically advanced capacity to distinguish and enhance treble, mid-range and bass frequencies. [...] He later wrote:"The public address system prior to World War II was designed to electronically respond to a limited range of audio frequencies, covering voice and general purposes. As against such limitation, a Jamaican sound system was designed to respond with low surface noise, low distortion and high fidelity, over the complete audio range of frequencies from 15 Hz to 20 kHz: a huge technological difference. The Jones model <b>High-Fidelity</b> audio <b>amplifier</b> of 1947 was designed to perform the function of reproduction of the full audio spectrum; and that was the model Tom Wong acquired and named a Sound System. Before that era noisy PA systems were the norm." ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel technique and system {{for increasing the}} efficiency of dc-dc converters that supply electronic loads, such as modern audio and video equipment and other devices whose power consumption largely depends on the digital data they process. The optimization {{does not require a}} current measurement circuit and is well-suited to portable applications. It is based on a real-time prediction of the dc-dc converter output current from easily accessible digital data streams present in the targeted loads. The result of the prediction is then used for dynamic adjustment {{of the size of the}} power stage transistors and/or for switching into pulse-frequency-mode (PFM) of output voltage regulation, in order to maximize the instantaneous converter efficiency on-the-fly. The use of a segmented power stage allows the effective power transistor size to be changed on-the-fly, and the trade-off between the gate-drive and RMS conduction losses is continuously optimized over the full range of operation. The effectiveness of the optimization is demonstrated on an experimental system including a 1 W digitally controlled 4 MHz, 3. 6 V-to- 1. 8 V buck converter with an integrated segmented power stage and a digital <b>high-fidelity</b> class-D audio <b>amplifier</b> acting as the digital load. The results show a good agreement between the digitally predicted and actual dc-dc converter load current, as well as a reduction in total energy consumption of up to 38 %...|$|R
