5|$|Meanwhile, Black {{realizes that}} a {{painting}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> in Knight's office was a watercolor by Adolf Hitler. He then notices two men watching his house from a car.

5|$|At the portal, Shephard discovers a gene worm, {{a massive}} {{creature}} facilitating the Race X invasion. Shephard {{is able to}} kill the creature, but just afterwards he is teleported onto an Osprey by the G-Man. As the G-Man congratulates Shephard on his accomplishments, the nuclear device detonates in the background, destroying Black Mesa. The game closes with the G-Man detaining Shephard someplace where he can tell no one of what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> and cannot be harmed, pending further evaluation.|$|E
5|$|During a {{field trip}} to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he {{promptly}} throws away without interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss the find, resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{could have}} been more decisive, more final than the clear, simple brevity of the Prince's [...] "No." [...] <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no ice. <b>He</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no ice. <b>He</b> said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no ice.

60|$|The archdeacon said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not,--that was to say, he had,--that was, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not <b>seen</b> {{the opinion}} itself; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> what <b>had</b> {{been called a}} copy, {{but he could not}} say whether of a whole or part; nor could he say that what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> were the ipsissima verba of the great man himself; but what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{contained}} exactly the decision which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> announced, and which he again declared to be to his mind extremely satisfactory.|$|R

5|$|Fluff Cowan {{served as}} Woods' caddie {{from the start}} of his {{professional}} career until Tiger fired him in March 1999. He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts. In June 2011, Woods fired Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> very limited work.|$|E
5|$|Heather has {{had enough}} of Will's pot-and-alcohol-fueled apathy. Despite Will's protestations, she takes the baby and walks out ("Too Much, Too Soon"). Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)").|$|E
5|$|Santosh meets Rajeshwari and apologises to her. He {{also makes}} her {{understand}} his situation. Rajeshwari convinces Ramamoorthy {{that she will}} get a better groom than Santosh. Meanwhile, Subramaniam goes to meet Hasini and apologises to her. Hasini says that her father is angry on her for lying and {{she will have to}} obey her father now. But Govindan does not like Santosh as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> him before drinking with his friends in road. Subramaniam says that he will send Santosh to Govindan’s home for a week so that he will better understand his character. After numerous incidents between Govindan and Santosh, the former finally agrees for Santosh and Hasini's wedding.|$|E
6000|$|If {{he really}} loved, {{and told her}} so, wherein was the self-sacrifice? She had reproached him with coming to her with his suit hotfoot upon his {{knowledge}} of her shameful proffer of herself to another man; of her refusal by him. Could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> been so blind as not to <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> as she did, the shameful aspect of his impulsive act? Surely, if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> thought, <b>he</b> must <b>have</b> <b>seen!</b> [...] . And <b>he</b> must <b>have</b> thought; there had been time for it.

5|$|Throughout the {{subsequent}} period of foreign catastrophe which, to contemporaries, came to symbolise {{the failure of}} Suffolk's government in the late 1440s, Beaumont not only supported the duke's policy but backed him during his impeachment. With Suffolk's fall in 1450, it {{has been described as}} 'rather surprising' that Beaumont did not fall with him, having 'been involved in some of the regime's most unpopular activities.' For instance, he was a close associate and a 'protector' of the 'headstrong' Sir William Tailboys (whom Griffiths also called '-in-chief') when Tailboys attempted to assassinate Lord Cromwell in broad daylight in November 1449. He had also suffered a minor assault on his Boston manor the previous year, but it is likely that he was seen as more impartial at the time than <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> since. Indeed, far from suffering from his patron's fall, he was appointed to Suffolk's old position of Lord Chamberlain of England, although only for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Keith Wilson (Don Marshall), {{his wife}} Dorothy (Janee Michelle), their {{daughter}} Lisa (Venetta Rogers), and Keith's boss, Larry Tate (David White), visit {{the home of}} the Stephens family, with whom Lisa is to spend a few days while Keith is away on a business trip for Larry. The Wilsons are African-American {{and all of the other}} characters are white, including the Stephens family: Darrin (Dick Sargent), his wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), their daughter Tabitha (Erin Murphy), and their son Adam (David Lawrence). Tabitha is glad to be able to spend a few days with Lisa and says they will temporarily be sisters. Darrin is another of Larry's employees at advertising agency McMann and Tate. Darrin is trying to land a million-dollar account from Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer), who owns a toy company. Mr. Brockway visits the Stephens residence unannounced to find out if Darrin has any dark secrets. When Mr. Brockway arrives, Samantha is tending to Adam upstairs, so Lisa answers the door. When Lisa says her father works for McMann and Tate and that she is Tabitha's sister, Mr. Brockway leaves, saying <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> enough.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{finishes}} {{viewing the}} footage, and expresses his disgust {{to the station}} executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage, which only <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen.</b> The final two reels begin with the team locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men film and gang-rape. Faye only tries to intervene when Alan participates. Afterwards, they encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him so the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape, Faye is captured. Alan initially insists that they try to rescue her, but ultimately decides not to. Mark continues to film as she is raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen,</b> he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
5|$|The film {{concerns}} a middle-aged railway pointsman, Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), {{who lives in}} a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen.</b> The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within.|$|E
5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.|$|E

6000|$|On this {{question}} there arose the edifying brow-beating, customary on such points.

Then he was asked if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> her twenty times, to which he replied, 'Certainly--more than that.'

During World War II, {{he was held}} as {{a prisoner of war}} in Dresden, surviving the firebombing, experiences which had a lasting effect on his post-war life. His time travel occurs at desperate times in his life; he re-lives events past and future and becomes fatalistic (though not a defeatist) because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> when, how and why he will die.|$|E

However, she also has commented in interviews that, although it appears they spend little time together, it is simply that nobody sees him publicly. She has commented on Dean's romantic side, saying that he does spontaneous things to surprise her and sometimes even writes poems for her.|$|E
