50|$|A {{carriage}} control tape was a loop of punched tape {{that was used}} to synchronize rapid vertical page movement in most IBM and many other line printers from unit record days through the 1970s. The tape loop was as long as the length of a single page. A pin wheel moved the tape accurately using holes {{in the center of the}} tape. A hole punched in one of the other channels represented a particular position on the page. Channel one was typically used to indicate the top of the page and might be the only channel used. Another channel might indicate the summary line on an invoice, enabling rapid skipping to that line. IBM provides a special manual punch that allowed accurate placement of the channel punches. Skipping occurred under computer control, but a form <b>feed</b> <b>switch</b> on the printer control panel allowed a manual skip to the top of the page. The tapes could be easily changed when new, continuously fed forms were loaded into the printer.|$|E
40|$|A short {{study was}} {{performed}} to demonstrate the beam-squint efiect due to the circular polarization in the beam-waveguide system of DSS 24 and to obtain quan-titative values for this squint. Beam squint occurs when a circularly polarized feed illuminates a re°ector system in an asymmetric or ofiset manner. It occurs in the plane transverse to the plane of asymmetry, and its direction changes {{with the sense of}} polarization. The beam-squint efiect for the nonbeam-waveguide DSN antennas is minimal or nonexistent in the nearly symmetrical conflguration of the re°ectors. In the beam-waveguide systems, however, there are three asymmetric or ofiset-fed mirrors, M 5, M 3, and M 2, that cause beam squint. It is shown that the squint is caused primarily by the M 5 mirror, and the squint caused by the M 3 {M 2 pair of mirrors is mostly canceled due to their mirror-image symmetry. The maximum amount of the calculated squint in the beam-waveguide system is about 2. 75 mdeg, and this translates into a swing value of 5. 5 mdeg when a <b>feed</b> <b>switch</b> from right to left polarization is made. The resulting beam-pointing error can cause a gain loss of about 0. 07 dB and {{must be taken into account}} in the beam-calibration proce-dures. Suggestions are made for future work on the ways to either reduce or entirely remove the squint efiects. I...|$|E

40|$|Petroleum {{refining}} processes {{provide the}} daily requirements {{of energy for}} the global market. Each refining process produces wastes that {{have the capacity to}} harm the environment if not properly disposed of.

In this thesis, system analysis tools are used to design a program that allows for the selection of the optimal control, minimization and treating options for petroleum refinery waste streams. The performance of the developed model is demonstrated via a case study. Optimal mitigation alternatives to meet the emission reduction targets were studied by evaluating their relative impact on the profitable operation of the given facility. It was found that the optimal mitigation steps was to reduce emission precursors by conducting <b>feed</b> <b>switches</b> at the refinery. In all cases, the optimal solution did not include a capital expansion of the emission control facilities and equipment...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-throughput}} (HT) screening platform {{developed at}} hte with the application focus on automotive catalysis is described. hte HT units are configured for performing steady-state testing, {{as well as}} dynamic tests with fast <b>feed</b> <b>switches,</b> such as lean/rich excursions {{for the evaluation of}} NOx storage capacity and efficiency of lean NOx traps (LNT), ammonia storage capacity for selective catalytic reduction (SCR), evaluation of oxygen storage capacity (OSC), as well as lambda sweep tests for screening of three-way catalysts (TWC). Even though catalysts are screened on a rather small scale (~ 100 mg powder), experience showed that dosing rather complex gas mixtures in concentrations close to that found in real exhaust for the given application is mandatory to generate relevant data. The objective of this work is to give additional insight into HT technology. In the industrial research laboratory, HT screening has matured to become a reliable approach for rapid screening of both reaction parameter spaces, as well as material properties relevant for exhaust gas catalyst development. Due to the speed of optimized screening involving 48 parallel reactors, automated handling of primary data is an imported requirement. Software for data reduction, like estimation of light-off temperature, needs to be robust and handle results for diverse sample libraries in an unattended fashion. In combination with the statistical design of experiment and multivariate data analysis, HT testing has become a valuable enhancement to automotive catalyst development...|$|R
