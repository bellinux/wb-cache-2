2500|$|The testing {{system was}} {{originally}} developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in Los Angeles during that era. Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures {{calculated from the}} test. [...] In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule or UDDS) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the <b>Federal</b> <b>Testing</b> <b>Procedures</b> to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports.

40|$|The University of Wisconsin – Madison FutureTruck {{team has}} {{designed}} and constructed a four-wheel drive, charge sustaining, parallel hybrid-electric {{sport utility vehicle}} for entry into the FutureTruck 2003 competition. This is a multi-year project utilizing a 2002 Ford Explorer as the base vehicle. Wisconsin’s FutureTruck, nicknamed the “Moolander, ” weighs approximately 1905 kg and includes a prototype aluminum frame. The Moolander uses a high efficiency, 1. 8 liter, common rail, turbo-charged, compression ignition direct injection (CIDI) engine supplying approximately 85 kW of peak power and an AC induction motor that provides an additional 60 kW of peak power. The 145 kW hybrid drivetrain will out-accelerate the stock V 6 powertrain while producing similar emissions and drastically reducing fuel consumption.

40|$|In mixed-mode braking applications, the {{electric}} motor / generator (M/G) and hydraulic pressure valve are controlled {{to meet the}} driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking demand. Controlling these braking elements is achieved by modulating the current generated by the M/G and adjusting the fluid pressure to the wheel brake cylinders. This paper aims to model and design combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems which, comprise an induction electric machine, inverter, NiMH battery, controller, a pressure source, pressure control unit, and brake calipers. A 15 kW 1500 rpm induction machine equipped with a reduction gear having a gear ratio of 4 is used. A hydraulic brake capable to produce fluid pressure up to 40 bar is used. Direct torque control and pressure control are chosen as the control criteria in the M/G and the hydraulic solenoid valve. The braking demands for the system are derived from the <b>Federal</b> <b>Testing</b> <b>Procedure</b> (FTP) drive cycle. Two simulation models have been developed in Matlab®/Simulink® to analyze {{the performance of the}} control strategy in each braking system. The developed model is validated through experiment. It is concluded that the control system does introduce torque ripple and pressure oscillation in the braking system, but these effects do not affect vehicle braking performance due to the high frequency nature of pressure fluctuation and the damping effect of the vehicle inertia.

50|$|In 2001, five {{separate}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against the US EPA by the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) and several individual trucking industry entities (such as International Truck and Engine Corporation). Each of those lawsuits challenged thelegality and technological feasibility of certain engine emission control standards in EPAregulations now referred to as NTE requirements. In their challenge, EMA stated that to determine whether an engine meets a primary emission standard, engines are tested and assessed using a standardized 20-minute emissions laboratory test known as the <b>Federal</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Procedure.</b> The NTE, by contrast, has no specified test procedure and potentially could apply over an almost infinite number of test conditions. This, in the manufacturers’ view, made it virtually impossible to ensure total compliance with the NTE—since {{there is no real}} or practical way to test an engine under all conceivable conditions—and so made the NTE both unlawful (the CAA authorizes EPA to adopt engine standards AND accompanying test procedures) and technically infeasible.|$|E

Asymptotic, normality of the proposed test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis and under a large class of fixed alternatives. The proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is shown to be consistent against a large class of alternatives. For a sequence of local alternatives, which, converges to the null hypothesis at the rate of n(- 1 / 4), the proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with three existing <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e. the Greenwood-type <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed in (4), which is known to be locally most powerful among all <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> based symmetrically on spacings, a procedure due to (5) and a procedure due to (3)), in terms of the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing s null {{hypotheses}} simultaneously. In {{order to deal with}} the multiplicity problem, the classical approach is to restrict attention to multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> that control the familywise error rate (FWE). The closure method of Marcus et al. (1976) reduces {{the problem of}} constructing such procedures to one of constructing single tests that control the usual probability of a Type 1 error.
