40|$|Angiostrongyliasis is an <b>emerging</b> <b>communicable</b> <b>disease.</b> Several {{different}} hosts {{are required}} to complete {{the life cycle of}} Angiostrongylus cantonensis. However, we lack a complete understanding of variability of proteins across different developmental stages and their contribution to parasite survival and progression. In this study, we extracted soluble proteins from various stages of the A. cantonensis life cycle [female adults, male adults, the fifth-stage female larvae (FL 5), the fifth-stage male larvae (ML 5) and third-stage larvae (L 3) ], separated those proteins using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) at pH 4 - 7, and analyzed the gel images using DeCyder 7. 0 software. This proteomic analysis produced a total of 183 different dominant protein spots. Thirty-seven protein spots were found to have high confidence scores (> 95 %) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Comparative proteomic analyses revealed that 29 spots represented cytoskeleton-associated proteins and functional proteins. Eight spots were unnamed proteins. Twelve protein spots that were matched to the EST of different-stage larvae of A. cantonensis were identified. Two genes and the internal control 18 s were chosen for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and the qPCR results were consistent with those of the DIGE studies. These findings will provide a new basis for understanding the characteristics of growth and development of A. cantonensis and the host-parasite relationship. They may also assist searches for candidate proteins suitable for use in diagnostic assays and as drug targets for the control of eosinophilic meningitis caused by A. cantonensis...|$|E
40|$|Controlling an <b>emerging</b> <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> {{requires}} prompt {{adoption of}} {{measures such as}} quarantine. Assessment of the efficacy of these measures must be rapid as well. In this paper, the authors present a framework to monitor the efficacy of control measures in real time. Bayesian estimation of the reproduction number R (mean number of cases generated by a single infectious person) during an outbreak allows them to judge rapidly whether the epidemic is under control (R < 1). Only counts and time of onset of symptoms, plus tracing information from a subset of cases, are required. Markov chain Monte Carlo andMonte Carlo sampling are used to infer the temporal pattern of R {{up to the last}} observation. The operating characteristics of the method are investigated in a simulation study of severe acute respiratory syndrome–like outbreaks. In this particular setting, control measures lacking efficacy (R 1. 1) could be detected after 2 weeks in at least 70 % of the epidemics, with less than a 5 % probability of a wrong conclusion. When control measures are efficacious (R 0. 5), this situation may be evidenced in 68 % of the epidemics after 2 weeks and 92 % of the epidemics after 3 weeks, with less than a 5 % probability of a wrong conclusion. communicable diseases, emerging; disease outbreaks; epidemiologic methods; population surveillance; SARS virus Abbreviation: SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Extant doctrine in disability and constitutional law provides a lens for examining judicial review of state interventions. The author first sets out the central epidemiological and biological aspects of tuberculosis to demonstrate {{the strength of the}} governmental interest in curtailing the epidemic. Second, he examines the interventions of testing, screening, and confinement of persons with tuberculosis, where he focuses on two congregate settings [...] correctional and health care facilities [...] that present substantial health risks and are principal foci for the exercise of state intervention. Third, he examines the exercise of traditional public health powers of detention, compulsory treatment, and directly observed therapy, where he discusses several conceptual dilemmas that continue to thwart scholars and the judiciary relating to the appropriate boundaries for governmental intervention. The author concludes by arguing that, while the exercise of compulsion targeted against the individual remains a necessary component of disease control, it has been over-emphasized in scholarly discourse and case law. He advances the argument that government ought to be more concerned with aggregate changes in behavior among populations, which, paradoxically, is achieved not by focusing on the actions of individuals, but on broad policies of the state. He states that thoughtfully crafted state programs for education and counseling and economic and social incentives for treatment stand the best chance of curtailing tuberculosis, and other ancient and <b>emerging</b> <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for integrated, sustainable; and cost-effective approaches to the management of infectious diseases. For example, an emerging disease in one country may already be endemic in another country but nearing elimination in a third. A coordinated approach by WHO towards infectious diseases is therefore needed that will facilitate more effective support of on-going efforts for the prevention and control of endemic diseases, intensify efforts against those diseases targeted for eradication and elimination, and result in better preparedness and response to new and re-emerging diseases. In order to meet these challenges, WHO {{has created a new}} Programme on <b>Communicable</b> <b>Diseases</b> (CDS), which will replace the former Division of <b>Emerging</b> and other <b>Communicable</b> <b>Diseases</b> (EMC). The new Programme will better integrate surveillance, prevention, control, and research over the whole spectrum of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> CDS will function as focal point for global data and information exchange on infectious diseases, and inter alia, will reinforce laboratory-based surveillance of bacterial, viral, and zoonotic diseases to ensure early detection of threats to international public health.

The research process is the cornerstone for informed andeffective decision-making, and is integral to countries’ efforts toimprove the health of their populations {{and the effectiveness of}} theirhealth systems, particularly during times of dramatic epidemiological,demographic, and economic changes that profoundly affect healthsystems. Research on (1) health policy and health systems, (2) epidemiology dealing with noncommunicable diseases and existing,new and <b>emerging</b> <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases,</b> (3) reproduction, childhealth and nutrition, including domestic or sexual violence, and (4) social-behaviour, including analysis of peoples’ health seekingprocesses and their beliefs, knowledge and practices about healthand illness, conducted by multi-disciplinary teams will enhancedeveloping countries’ efforts to fight diseases and maintain health forthe public. The manual describes methods for planning and conductingscientific research: from formulation of problems to setting researchobjectives, to designing the study, including methods of data collection,statistical analysis as well as interpretation and dissemination of theresults. The earlier manual, used as resource and guide for the conductof workshops on health research methodology in various countries ofthe Western Pacific Region has been expanded to include more detailson some of the commonly used statistical methods and to clarify thepoints raised during workshops. The discussion on biases has beenexpanded considerably. This manual is expected to be used by the WHO Western PacificRegional Office as a reference guide in training young scientists toconduct health sciences research. It will be used as a starting pointand not as a comprehensive textbook on research methods. Manyexcellent textbooks are available for this purpose and are referencedin the manual. We have tried to use real life examples from theRegion for illustrating the principles and methods used in the manualto make it more relevant to the regional context. The manual will be useful in planning a research project,especially in preparing a research grant application for a donor agency. In particular, the attached copy of the application form of WHO servesas a guide. The issues discussed in the manual will help the researcherto focus on issues of importance before the study is proposed andundertaken. In addition, the manual would also be useful when writinga thesis to meet academic requirements of a degree in the healthfield. We hope that this manual will not only provide basic informationon research methods in the health field, but also stimulate the readerto inquire further into the complex area of research methodology aswell as increase the productivity of the young researcher in the Region.

The focus is on the food and farming sector, where the generation and subsequent transmission of disease can reach pandemic proportions.

40|$|Background: In many {{countries}} public and political interest {{exists on the}} <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects of prison crowding, prompting standards on minimum floor area of sleeping accommodation per person. Yet the extent and reliability of the worldwide evidence on the association between prison cell spatial density and <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> is uncertain. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature for articles that reported on the association between prison cell spatial density and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects in prisoners. Included studies were assessed for quality. A draft report was peer-reviewed by an independent researcher. Some revisions were made in light of reviewer comments. Findings: 3, 532 articles were identified and 6 were included. Studies were conducted in the US (1980 s), Pakistan (2003) and Nigeria (2012, 2013). <b>Communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects/outcomes included pneumococcal disease/acute pneumonia, mycobacterium tuberculosis, infectious skin conditions, and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> reporting to the prison clinic. There was mostly consistent evidence that cell spatial density is associated with <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> The associations and statistical precision observed suggest a ‘slight’ <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> impact of cell spatial density on prisoners. However, {{it is possible that}} these associations are due to confounding, bias and/or chance.

Many epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} about the epidemiology of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in Iran, but less {{attention has been paid to}} generating an atlas of all disease. Some experts believe that mapping diseases such as malaria is the first step toward establishing early warning systems and managing disease control. In this manuscript, we tried to gather information about the <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> of Iran in a geo-database, and draw maps with high accuracy. Methods: Initially reportable cases of diseases were gathered from the Iranian <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> control center. Then, these data were arranged in a geo-referenced database in the Arc-GIS software and then the related maps were generated. Results: Twenty five maps of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> were created in 2008. Some diseases like malaria had considerable foci and some other disease according to their condition did not have a considerable dispersion.

40|$|Threats {{posed by}} new, <b>emerging</b> or re-emerging <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are taking a}} global dimension, to which the World Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat has been {{responding}} with determination since 1995. Key to the global strategy for tackling epidemics across borders {{is the concept of}} global public health surveillance, which has been expanded and formalized by WHO and its technical partners through a number of recently developed instruments and initiatives. The adoption by the 58 th World Health Assembly of the revised (2005) International Health Regulations provides the legal framework for mandating countries to link and coordinate their action through a universal network of surveillance networks. While novel environmental threats and outbreak-prone diseases have been increasingly identified during the past three decades, new processes of influence have appeared more recently, driven by the real or perceived threats of bio-terrorism and disruption of the global economy. Accordingly, the global surveillance agenda is being endorsed, and to some extent seized upon by new actors representing security and economic interests. This paper explores external factors influencing political commitment to comply with international health regulations and it illustrates adverse effects generated by: perceived threats to sovereignty, blurred international health agendas, lack of internationally recognized codes of conduct for outbreak investigations, and erosion of the impartiality and independence of international agencies.
