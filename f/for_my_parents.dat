Her infant brother, John, died {{shortly after his}} birth one year before Diana was born. The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was {{reportedly}} sent to Harley Street clinics in London to {{determine the cause of}} the [...] "problem". The experience was described as [...] "humiliating" [...] by Diana's younger brother, Charles: [...] "It was a dreadful time <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it." [...] Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the Sandringham estate. The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen Elizabeth II. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes Andrew and Edward as a child.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR FRIEND, - I {{have been}} so busy, away to Bridge Of Allan with my father first, and then with Simpson and Baxter out here from Saturday till Monday. I {{had no time to}} write, and, as it is, am strangely incapable. Thanks for your letter. I have been reading such lots of law, and it seems to take away the power of writing from me. From morning to night, so often as I have a spare moment, I am in the embrace of a law book - barren embraces. I am in good spirits; and my heart smites me as usual, when I am in good spirits, about my parents.

My little brother monopolised the name of Evans, and living for some time after I was christened, I got the Dutch appellation of my maternal grandfather, for my share of the family nomenclature, which happened to be Cornelius--Corny was consequently the diminutive by which I was known to all the whites of my acquaintance, for the first sixteen or eighteen years of my life, and to my parents {{as long as they}} lived. Corny Littlepage is not a bad name, in itself, and I trust they who do me the favour to read this manuscript, will lay it down with the feeling that the name is none the worse for the use I have made of it.|$|E
6000|$|Presently the coffee-tent keeper, after {{receiving}} payment, brought us water for ablution. This preamble over, {{we entered the}} principal chapel; an unpretending building, badly lighted, spread with dirty rugs, full of pilgrims, and offensively close. Here we prayed the Isha, or night devotions, and then a two-bow prayer in honour of the Ihram,[FN#24] after which we distributed gratuities to the guardians, and alms to the importunate beggars. And now I perceived the object of Abdullah’s companionship. The melancholy man assured {{me that he had}} ridden out for love of me, and in order to perform as Wakil (substitute) a vicarious pilgrimage <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents.</b> Vainly I assured him that they had been strict in the exercises of their faith. He would take no denial, and I perceived that love of me meant love of my dollars. With a surly assent, he was at last permitted to act for the “pious pilgrim Yusuf (Joseph) bin Ahmad and Fatimah bint Yunus,”—my progenitors. It was impossible to prevent smiling at contrasts, as Abdullah, gravely raising his hands, and directing his face to the Ka’abah, intoned, “I do vow this Ihram of Umrah in the name of Yusuf Son of Ahmad, and Fatimah Daughter of Yunus; then render it attainable unto them, and accept it of them!

It is needless to say that I had no knowledge of medicine, but by securing the service of an eminent forger I obtained a diploma purporting to have been granted by the Royal Quackery of Charlatanic Empiricism at Hoodos, which, framed in immortelles and suspended by a bit of crêpe to a willow in front of my office, attracted the ailing in great numbers. In connection with my dispensary I conducted one of the largest undertaking establishments ever known, and as soon as my means permitted, purchased a wide tract of land and made it into a cemetery. I owned also some very profitable marble works {{on one side of the}} gateway to the cemetery, and on the other an extensive flower garden. My Mourner's Emporium was patronized by the beauty, fashion and sorrow of the city. In short, I was in a very prosperous way of business, and within a year was able to send <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> and establish my old father very comfortably as a receiver of stolen goods--an act which I confess was saved from the reproach of filial gratitude only by my exaction of all the profits.|$|E

60|$|On the 9th day of June, 1709, I {{arrived at}} Nangasac, {{after a very}} long and {{troublesome}} journey. I soon fell into the company of some Dutch sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons. I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke Dutch well. The seamen soon knew whence I came last: they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course of life. I made up a story as short and probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part. I knew many persons in Holland. I was able to invent names <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>parents,</b> whom I pretended to be obscure people {{in the province of}} Gelderland. I would have given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of my calling. Before we took shipping, I was often asked by some of the crew, whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned? I evaded the question by general answers; “that I had satisfied the Emperor and court in all particulars.” However, a malicious rogue of a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told him, “I had not yet trampled on the crucifix;” but the other, who had received instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with a bamboo; after which I was no more troubled with such questions.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Suppose M is a hyperfinite von Neumann algebra with a normal, tracial state ϕ and {a 1, [...] .,an} {{is a set}} of self-adjoint {{generators}} for M. We calculate δ 0 (a 1, [...] .,an), {{the modified}} free entropy dimension of {a 1, [...] ., an}. Moreover we show that δ 0 (a 1, [...] ., an) depends only on M and ϕ. Consequently δ 0 (a 1, [...] .,an) is independent of the choice of generators for M. In the course of the argument we show that if {b 1, [...] ., bn} {{is a set of}} self-adjoint generators for a von Neumann algebra R with a normal, tracial state and {b 1, [...] .,bn} has finite dimensional approximants, then δ 0 (N) ≤ δ 0 (a 1, [...] .,an) for any hyperfinite von Neumann subalgebra N of R. Combined with a result by Voiculescu this implies that if R has a regular diffuse hyperfinite von Neumann subalgebra, then δ 0 (b 1, [...] ., bn) = 1. <b>For</b> <b>my</b> <b>parent...</b>|$|R
