40|$|The diesel <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{problems}} of engine damage. When the hydrogen-diesel dual fuel is used, it may affect the <b>engine</b> <b>vibration.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of hydrogen-diesel dual fuel. The regression analysis is used to find the relations between hydrogen percentage and the <b>engine</b> <b>vibration.</b> The results for all cases found that the relation between the Average Peak Acceleration (APA) and hydrogen percentage (%H 2) can predict by using linear equation with average coefficient of determination (R 2) = 0. 8973 or 2 nd polynomial equation with R 2 = 0. 9592. All graphs are the decreasing function. APA can decrease by increasing %H 2.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} quantitatively the {{influence}} of water emulsified fuel on combustion, <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> and noise, {{and the effect of}} ignition improver on the reduction of vibration and noise. The main conclusions obtained are as follows : (1) With an increase in the water addition rate, ignition delays and the maximum pressure rise rate increases. As a result, <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> and noise increase, in proportion to the pressure rise rate. (2) An increase in ignition delay with the addition of water is closely related to the heat quantity required to evaporate water in the fuel spray under a high temperature and high pressure condition. (3) Increases in <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> and noise due to the addition of water can be reduced by adding a small amount of ignition improver without aggravating engine performance...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{are used in}} many applications. The same engine type may have different components mounted to it depending upon its use. These engine mounted components need to be designed against fatigue in order to withstand the <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Measured <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> are commonly used as input data for fatigue estimation. The focus in this thesis is set on heavy-duty diesel engines, typically used in trucks, buses and industrial applications. All of the appended papers use <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> measurements to evaluate the proposed methods. In Paper A, the engine block motion is described with a seven degree of freedom kinematic model. These degrees of freedom consist of six rigid body modes and one assumed twisting degree of freedom. With this description, measured <b>engine</b> block <b>vibrations</b> {{can be used to}} accurately predict the vibration in positions that have not been measured. Relating the measured <b>vibrations</b> of an <b>engine</b> mounted component with the projected motion of the engine block at that same position, makes it possible to identify local dynamic phenomena. In Paper B, the kinematic model of Paper A is extended with three assumed bending deformation mode shapes. For the current engine type, all of the assumed deformation modes are ranked within the 10 - 300 Hz frequency range. The deformation mode of highest importance is the engine block twist. Including bending deformation increases the accuracy of the <b>engine</b> block <b>vibration</b> description but it also increases the demands on instrumentation. In Paper C, the possibility to modify measured <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> signals, for addition or removal of engine mounted components, is investigated. For this purpose, <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> measurements were performed with and without a 29 kg brake air compressor mounted to the engine. For the task of removing the effect that this engine mounted component has on the engine block, the two cases of knowing, and not knowing the vibration of the component are both considered. The proposed methodology successfully predicts the changes in <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> due to system modification. The proposed method {{can also be used to}} estimate the time response of a component's centre of gravity. In this study the component's dynamic properties are derived from measurements but they could also be produced using finite element analysis. This can be useful early in the design process to find critically stressed areas due to base excitation. QC 20171222 </p...|$|R

In this thesis, the main propose is to find a signal analysis method to predict the fretting damages on fuel pump connector induced by <b>engine</b> <b>vibration.</b> The data of the fuel pump connector is studied from a vibration test of the four-cylinder engine and the dominating frequencies are used in the fretting test to verify the analysis method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{computational}} models for commercial vehicle <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> dynamics are presented. The first model is conventional elastomeric {{engine mounting system}} comprising elastic, viscous and friction functional components which expresses the nonlinear behaviour of the dynamic stiffness and damping of the engine mounts as functions of both the frequency and amplitude of excitation. The second model is based on adding actuators, sensors and a controller to the elastomeric mounts making the engine mounting system an adaptronic one. Parameter optimization of the proposed adaptronic engine mounting system has been done. Computational models are implemented in Matlab /Simulink with GUI suitable for <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> dynamics analysis under different engine excitations and realistic road inputs. Simulations of <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure are presented which are obtained by using both computational models for the same inputs of engine and road excitations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} vibration analyses {{performed on}} a diesel engine {{mounted on a}} test chassis. Four methods were used in analyzing <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> on the test chassis. Static <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis was an experimental method used to identify natural engine frequencies and modes shapes on the test chassis. In this technique, the non-running engine was excited by an external input force. A running engine {{analysis was used to}} determine engine resonance frequencies. In this analysis, the engine was excited by the running dynamics of its components. Engine speeds at those resonance frequencies were also determined in this test. Thirdly, lumped mass modeling was used in analyzing <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations.</b> In this analysis, the engine was analytically modeled as a rigid block. Thus, only inelastic mode shapes of the engine were determined. Finite Element Analysis was the last method performed. In this analysis, both the <b>vibration</b> of the <b>engine</b> and its test chassis were analyzed by finite element modeling. Thus, dynamic mode shapes were determined.

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the study of {{degradation}} of volatile organic compounds in surface discharge catalysed by TiO 2. Volatile organic compounds are dangerous both for human beings and the environment. Therefore it is necessary to eliminate volatile organic compounds. Plasma technology is one of the options how to reach their efficient removal. The experiment was carried out in the plasma reactor with electrodes for surface discharge. One or two layers of TiO 2 catalyst were deposited on one of the electrodes. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas and it was mixed with air before entering the reactor. The radiation emitted by the discharge during the degradation of VOC was transmitted via optical fibre to the optical emission spectrometer Jobin Yvon TRIAX 550. Toluene, hexane, cyklohexane and xylene were used as model VOCs. During the experiment the impact of input power on catalysed or non-catalysed degradation of VOC by the discharge has been monitored. Using optical emission spectrometry it is possible to determine some important parameters of surface discharge, such as rotation and <b>vibration</b> <b>temperature.</b> The values were determined for each measurement in the range from 650 to 1050 K for rotation temperature and from 1600 to 1950 K for <b>vibration</b> <b>temperature.</b> The average error of determination was 100 K for rotation temperature and 120 K for <b>vibration</b> <b>temperature.</b> It was found, that the catalyst is without effect on the rotation and <b>vibration</b> <b>temperature.</b> In contrast, change of discharge input power significantly influenced both rotation and <b>vibration</b> <b>temperature.</b> Significantly different values of rotation and <b>vibration</b> <b>temperature</b> were obtained in the presence of particular compound for lower input power, while these values were similar for higher input power. Further, the spectral bands of nitrogen, oxygen and NO were identified from emission spectra. The obtained results may be used as a fundament for further study of volatile organic compounds decomposition in surface discharge...|$|R
