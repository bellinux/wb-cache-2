50|$|According to Amnesty {{international}} {{annual report}} 2015-2016, <b>Huthis</b> and allied forces loyal to former President Saleh have expanded their arbitrary arrests, detentions and abductions of government supporters, activists, {{and human rights}} defenders. The international organization said that many detainees were held in an inappropriate and unofficial detention center. In October, Armed men belonging to Houthi militia arrested at least 25 men while attending a meeting at Ibb hotel. Most of them were released later after being tortured.|$|E
50|$|On 5 January 2014, {{two days}} of clashes between Shia rebels and Sunni tribesmen {{fighting}} alongside hardline Salafists in northern Yemen killed at least 23 people, sources said on Sunday. Fighting has centred for months on a Salafist mosque and Koranic school in Dammaj, which has been besieged by the Shiite rebels known as <b>Huthis.</b> But the conflict has spread in the northern provinces, embroiling Sunni tribes wary {{of the power of}} the <b>Huthis,</b> who have repeatedly been accused of receiving support from Iran. On Sunday, at least 10 people were killed in Al Jawf Governorate in clashes between rebels and armed men from the Daham tribe, a tribal chief told AFP. Seven people were killed at Harf Sufyan, in the northern Amran Governorate, another tribal chief said on Sunday, while two others died in shelling of Dammaj, in Saada Governorate, Salafist websites reported. Four people died in fighting that took place in Al Jawf Governorate on Saturday, another tribal chief said.Huthi rebels this week took over positions evacuated by Salafist gunmen in the area of Kitaf wa Al Boqe'e District, north of Sa'dah city, witnesses said, adding the rebels demolished the Salafist Dar al-Hadith religious school and 20 houses. The rebels have also warned border guards to evacuate the Bart al-Anan crossing point with Saudi Arabia, in Al Jawf Governorate, according to the head of the force, Colonel Qassem Thawaba.|$|E
5000|$|Amnesty International {{denounced the}} {{recruitment}} of young boys {{under the age of}} 17 at hands of the Yemen's Houthi armed group to fight as child soldiers {{on the front lines of}} the Yemeni Civil War. In mid-February 2017, four boys, aged between 15 and 17, were recruited by <b>Huthis</b> in Sana'a; the total numbers of the boys recruited is unknown. Since the children have been excited to shoot Kalashnikovs and guns and wear military uniforms, Houthis have run local centers that hold activities such as prayers, sermons and lectures where they have been encouraged to join front-line battles to defend Yemen against Saudi Arabia. As the report clarified, they always take one recruit from each family because of the few fighters at the front-line combats because of the few fighters at the front lines in the combats and when son dies, a monthly salary, estimated between 20,000 and 30,000 Yemeni Riyals, has been given to the family. According to the UN agencies, nearly 1,500 cases of children were recruited by all parties to the conflict since March 2015.|$|E
5000|$|After Sheikh Abdullah's death, his son Sadiq {{inherited}} {{the leadership of}} the confederation, with other sons - Hamid Al Ahmar, a prominent businessman and Yemeni opposition leader in the Muslim Brotherhood, and Himyar Al Ahmar, the former deputy speaker of parliament - becoming influential members. With the beginning of the Arab Spring, this new tribal leadership sided with the protesters and launched a Hashid insurgency, which played an essential role in the revolution against President Ali Abdullah Saleh in May 2011, culminating in the Battle of Sana'a and mass protests that eventually forced President Saleh to step down in February 2012 after 33 years in power. [...] However, the resulting rift between the al-Ahmar clan and Saleh - who retained loyalty of some Hashid tribes - led to the divisions within the Hashid confederation. This, along with the suspension of financial support by Saudi Arabia over al-Ahmar's continued alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood, had contributed to their defeat in the ensuing conflict with the Houthis (<b>Huthis)</b> and led to the subsequent loss of Hashid leadership as many tribes (Bani Suraim, Usaimat, Uzer, etc.) reached a peace agreement or sided with the rebels.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWhy have Yemen’s counterinsurgency and counterterrorism polices been less effective against the Huthi movement compared to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) ? This paper {{finds that the}} military’s poor counterinsurgency and counterterrorism policies, the international effort to combat AQAP, the Huthi’s ability to recruit and mobilize large numbers of followers, and the Huthi leadership’s pragmatic alliances gave the <b>Huthis</b> the advantage over AQAP and the Republic of Yemen. Yemen faces multiple security problems. Foremost, the country faces threats from various groups including the Huthi Movement, AQAP, Hirak, and tribal elements with the <b>Huthis</b> recently capturing Sanaa. The country’s oil supply will soon to run out, which is {{the main source of}} government revenue. The country is {{still in the process of}} transition required by the Gulf Cooperation Council-negotiated agreement after the Arab Spring. These problems are exacerbated by corruption, social, and economic problems. Finally, state failure remains a real possibility, with the various groups battling for control. In this case, Yemen could become the next Somalia. The worse scenario for the U. S. would for Yemen to become a safe haven for a group intent on attacking U. S. citizens and interests.

40|$|In the {{regional}} backdrop {{to the war}} in Yemen Iran is a pivotal actor. Saudi Arabia has made clear that it sees the conflict in Yemen as the extension of its struggle with the Islamic Republic. This paper analyses the view from Iran as found in Iranian news and political analysis websites. It ar-gues that different political and ideological orientations converge in opposition to the Saudi-led military operation in Yemen, deepening {{the regional}} logjam. The study also shows that revolution-ary-ideological interpretation frames coexist with legal-democratic suggestions to end the crisis. Overall, the Iranian debate runs contrary to Saudi Arabia’s understanding of the crisis. Saudi Arabia argues that the Huthi takeover in Sanaa represents a ‘disruption of normalcy ’ and a dangerous usurpation of power. From Iran’s vantage point, it is the natural consequence of the Yemeni government’s repression and external relations. Saudi Arabia justifies its military opera-tion by deposed President ‘Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi’s call for protection of Yemen and its people. Iran contests Mansur Hadi’s legitimacy and considers the military intervention arbitrary and illegal. Saudi Arabia sees the <b>Huthis</b> as a proxy of Iran, united by a common Shia identity. Iran perceives the <b>Huthis</b> ’ Zaydi creed as religiously different but associates their cause with its own political agenda...|$|E
