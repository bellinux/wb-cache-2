40|$|There are two {{different}} methods for making banana chips. One of these is to deep fry thin slices of banana <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>in</b> {{the same way as}} potato chips or crisps. The other is to dry slices of banana, either in the sun or using a solar or artificial dryer. The products made by the two methods are quite different...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to experimentally verify the diffusion coefficients proposed by the various researchers. To validate these coefficients, drying experiments were carried out on impregnated and nonimpregnated paper and on pressboard samples. Taking into account the characteristics of the tested samples, two different experiments were performed: For nonimpregnated insulation, thermo-gravimetric experiments were performed determining the weight of a sample while being dried.. For impregnated paper, drying experiments were carried out <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> which samples were periodically extracted and analyzed by the Karl Fischer method. The drying experiments were simulated using a diffusion model, solved by finite element analysis. The simulations were carried out using the diffusion coefficients proposed by the various researchers. Finally, the experimental results were compared with the simulated ones, and the accuracy and the range of application of the various coefficients were determined. This work was financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology under the project DPI 2009 - 07093 Publicad...|$|E

50|$|Bread flour is {{not part}} of the basic diet, but has been {{imported}} for some years, so there are various bread recipes that have become part of the national food. The most common are dumplings (matlebekwane), flat cakes (diphaphatha) and fat cakes (magwinya). For these, the flour is made into dough which is cooked in different ways such as boiling with meat, cooking <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> or <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> coals.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the effect of temperature on thermal softening behavior of black sweet-bamboo culms <b>in</b> linseed <b>oil.</b> Pressing test rig with a length scale and a pointer indicating specimen height was constructed. This apparatus was used to apply a compressive force to bamboo specimen immersed <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> linseed <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> a boiler. Half circular cross-section specimens with thickness of 3 mm and length of 150 mm were dipped into water at room temperature to attain water saturated condition prior to immersing into linseed oil at various temperatures under the load of 20 N. Specimen height, used to calculate the degree of flatness, was measured as a function of time. The values of the final degree of flatness and the rate of degree of flatness were used for the analysis of thermal softening behavior of bamboo <b>in</b> linseed <b>oil.</b> It was found that thermal softening behavior of bamboo culms <b>in</b> linseed <b>oil</b> was divided into two temperature regimes with the glass transition temperature at 115 ºC. At low temperature regime, deformation occurred slowly and showed only a single stage of deformation, corresponding to deformation in the glassy state. At high temperature regime, specimens deformed slowly in the first stage followed by a rapid deformation in the second stage, corresponding to deformations in the glassy and rubbery states, respectively. Effect of temperature on the rate of softening was well described by means of the Arrhenius equation with the activation energy ranging from 18 kJ/mole to 32 kJ/mole...|$|R

40|$|Bamboo culm is a {{hygroscopic}} lignocellulosic material. Hygroscopic properties may be disadvantageous in bamboo material if {{applied in}} certain applications and modes {{where and when}} extreme moisture variations are likely to occur. This study was aimed at evaluating the moisture absorption and resistance including dimensional stability properties of neem seed oil-treated split bamboo samples using two methods of treatment. Split bamboo samples from the same source were oven-dried at 103 ± 2 oC, conditioned to 11. 76 % mean moisture content, and treated by completely soaking them <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours and by soaking <b>in</b> <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> at 60 oC for 4 hours, with untreated samples as control.
