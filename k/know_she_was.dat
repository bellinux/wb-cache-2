5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He was adamant {{that she was not}} to <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October 1989, IRA members {{opened fire}} on the car of RAF {{corporal}} Mick Islania. The corporal had just returned to the car from a petrol station snack bar in Wildenrath. Also in the car were his wife Smita and their six-month-old daughter Nivruti. Corporal Islania was hit by multiple rounds and died instantly; his daughter {{was killed by a}} single shot to the head. Smita Islania suffered shock. The IRA expressed regret for the child's death and claimed its members did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in the car.|$|E
25|$|Nels Rasmussen told Nuttall about Lazarus' {{continued}} {{contact with}} his daughter, which {{had not been in}} the files, despite him mentioning it frequently during Mayer and Hook's interviews. Realizing that Lazarus was now their prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing they would have to do so without getting a warrant, which would have let Lazarus <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> under investigation for the murder. While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 2004 Rau {{arrived at}} the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and {{travelling}} alone. Since it was the wet season, {{and she did not}} have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions of her story, identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation and said there was no-one else in Australia who would <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> missing.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{determined}} to confront her fear, Psylocke began rigorous training to prepare herself {{for their next}} encounter. She returned to Earth-616 to let Brian <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alive. Almost immediately both the Exiles and Excalibur were called {{to the defense of}} Otherworld, under attack by an army of Furies created by a resurrected Mad Jim Jaspers; though the heroes prevailed, the Exiles were left as the Omniverse's primary defenders until the devastated Captain Britain Corps could be rebuilt. Choosing to remain with the Exiles, Betsy traveled to several realities. Upon arriving on a certain Earth, Psylocke had a mental breakdown due to this world's Psylocke counterpart's psyche being at war with Betsy's own psyche in order to control her body. This reality's Ogun approached Psylocke and offered to train her so she could avenge the death of his apprentice, who was killed by Slaymaster. Psylocke eventually tracked him to Earth-616 and killed him. Betsy returned to the Crystal Palace, became involved with teammate Sabretooth, and promised to honor her mission as an Exile.|$|E

On the cover Madonna wears a shorts with a whip, while a phrase reads; [...] "The shorts says: 'let's have dinner!'. The whip says, 'but you must pay for'". A contest sponsored by Keep Walking Brazil project selected 30 proposed covers, and Sapienza was chosen by Madonna after being among the ten finalists. The creator {{said she did not}} <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> participating in a cover contest and explained, [...] "My work is connected to the status of women.

500|$|Inspired by the film, baroque {{pop singer}} Lana Del Rey {{recorded}} a cover version of Bobby Vinton's classic {{rendition of the}} song [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] in 2012. Used to endorse clothing line H, a music video accompanied the track and aired as a television commercial. Filmed in Post-war Americana, the video drew influence from Lynch and Blue Velvet. In the video, Del Rey {{plays the role of}} Dorothy Vallens, performing a private concert similar to the scene where Ben (Dean Stockwell) pantomimes [...] "In Dreams" [...] for Frank Booth. Del Rey's version, however, has her lip-syncing [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] when a little person dressed as Frank Sinatra approaches and unplugs a hidden Victrola, revealing Del Rey as a fraud. When Lynch heard of the music video, he praised it, telling Artinfo: [...] "Lana Del Rey, she's got some fantastic charisma and—this is a very interesting thing—it's like she's born out of another time. She's got something that's very appealing to people. And I didn't <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> influenced by me!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ginsburg dissented in the Court's {{decision}} on Ledbetter v. Goodyear, , {{a case where}} plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter {{filed a lawsuit against}} her employer claiming pay discrimination based on her gender under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] In a 5–4 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every pay period, even if a woman did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates. As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend Title VII to undo the Court's decision with legislation. Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law. Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.|$|E
500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E

500|$|Rathbun {{was arrested}} on three occasions, with each arrest {{bringing}} increased local, national, and international media attention to the medical cannabis movement. [...] Her grandmotherly appearance generated public sympathy for her cause and undermined attempts by the district attorney's office to prosecute her for possession. [...] The City of San Francisco eventually gave Rathbun permission to distribute cannabis brownies to people with AIDS. [...] Her arrests generated interest {{in the medical community}} and motivated researchers to propose one of the first clinical trials to study the effects of cannabinoids in HIV-infected adults., DEA. : [...] "I spent about a year or so trying to find researchers willing to invest their time in this, and I couldn't find anybody. And then there was a report in the paper about a woman in California who, she was called [...] "Brownie Mary." [...] She made marijuana brownies for AIDS patients to help them with appetite. And she was arrested at—while she was getting marijuana to make into these brownies, and she worked at San Francisco General Hospital at the AIDS ward. And so I called doctors there, and I said one of your volunteers has just been arrested. Would you be interested in trying to do some research to show whether she was doing something that might actually have been helpful to these patients? She probably thought that it was helpful since, you <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> permitted on the ward to do this. And so I spoke to a Dr. Donald Abrams {{and he said that he}} would be interested in trying to do research in this area, and so we started to collaborate"; Sheehy, 2000: [...] "According to Donald Abrams, MD, lead author of the study and professor of clinical medicine in the UCSF Positive Health Program at San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center, this was the first attempt to study the effects of marijuana in people with HIV and one of the most comprehensive studies about the effects of marijuana on the immune system." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later {{when asked}} why he had perpetrated the killings, White claimed that they were carried out to strike fear into the Catholic {{community}} after the IRA's 1973 Coleraine bombings.

2500|$|Burton helped Taylor {{make her}} stage debut in A Poetry Reading, a recitation of poems by the couple {{as well as}} anecdotes and quotes from the plays Burton had participated in thus far.

A Poetry Reading opened at the Lunt-Fontanne on 21 June 1964 to a packed house; the couple received a standing ovation {{at the end of}} their performance.

It is her first album without producer Arif Mardin, {{who died in the}} summer of 2006. Jones described the sessions as [...] "fun, relaxed and easy" [...] and without a deadline; Blue Note executives reportedly did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> recording an album.

And she'd stay as long as she wanted. And all the kids in all the shows on the Strip would come that night. They'd hear that she's in town and it would be packed just for her performance". According to Richard S. Ginell at AllMusic: [...] " [...] was at once one of the most beloved and controversial singers of the mid-20th century – beloved to her fans, devotees, and fellow singers; controversial to critics who still accuse her of selling out her art to commerce and bad taste. Her principal sin, apparently, was to cultivate a distinctive vocal style that was at home in all kinds of music, be it R, blues, jazz, middle of the road pop – and she probably would have made a fine gospel or country singer had she the time. Hers was a gritty, salty, high-pitched voice, marked by absolute clarity of diction and clipped, bluesy phrasing..." ...|$|E
