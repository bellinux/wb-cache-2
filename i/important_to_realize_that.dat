Furthermore, as the oldest geological periods of the Moon are based exclusively on the times of individual impact events (in particular, Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale), these punctual events will most likely not correspond to any specific geological event on the other terrestrial planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{the word}} problem {{is in fact}} {{solvable}} for many groups G.

On the other hand {{the fact that a}} particular algorithm does not solve the word problem for a particular group does not show that the group has an unsolvable word problem. For instance Dehn's algorithm does not solve the word problem for the fundamental group of the torus. However this group is the direct product of two infinite cyclic groups and so has a solvable word problem.|$|E

Consequently, several analysis tools are used to conceive a specific use case. For this reason, mosaik is a central component in the testing of controller interactions. This co-simulation framework allows the orchestration of power system analysis tools, for the evaluation of the grid dynamics, and a communication simulator to integrate the effect of poor quality of service for the associated ICT elements (e.g. when considering a combination of wide area and decentralized control).|$|R

Step by step, the mechanisms of activation and selective infiltration of eosinophils are now being unraveled. Important herein are the concepts of priming and activation. During priming the eosinophil becomes more prone to activation without actually producing damaging mediators, while during activation secretion of mediators actually takes place.

On the transmission system level, DSA has been addressed in numerous projects and studies (Panciatici et al. 2014; Morison and Glavic 2007) that tackle these computational issues, finding a trade-off between computation speed, accuracy and flexibility, with the objective of approaching an on-line, real-time security assessment. These efforts have proved successful with existing implementation of DSA applications in power systems in China, The United States, Japan, Brazil, Canada and New Zealand (Sun et al. 2016).|$|R

This allows the fraction of dR derivatives with one hydrogen atom enriched to exceed the level of enrichment found in the body water, as we and others have previously described. 4, 5 Taken together, we think the issues raised by Tofts et al do not affect the interpretation of our results.

We also compare the predictions of several bibliometric indicators on the promotions of about 600 CNRS researchers.
