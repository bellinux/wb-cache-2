5000|$|... "Red-billed quelea" [...] {{has been}} {{designated}} the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The bird's name is usually pronounced [...] in American English and [...] in British English.Other names in English include black-faced <b>dioch,</b> cardinal, common <b>dioch,</b> Latham's weaver-bird, pink-billed weaver, quelea finch, quelea weaver, red-billed <b>dioch,</b> red-billed weaver, Russ' weaver, South-African <b>dioch,</b> Sudan <b>dioch</b> and Uganda <b>dioch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The species epithet erythrops {{derives from}} the Greek word ἐρυθρός (eruthros), meaning [...] "red" [...] and ὄψ (ops) meaning [...] "eye" [...] or [...] "face", {{referring}} to the rufous or red face. Ludwig Reichenbach gave the species its first English name in 1863: red-headed <b>dioch.</b> Other vernacular names in the English language include pokerhead, and red-headed weaver. Its vernacular name in Swahili is kwelea kichwa-chekundu.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-billed quelea}} (Quelea quelea), {{also known as}} the red-billed weaver or red-billed <b>dioch,</b> is a small, {{approximately}} 12 cm long and weighing 15-26 g, migratory, sparrow-like bird of the weaver family, Ploceidae, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It was named by Linnaeus in 1758, who considered it a bunting, but Ludwig Reichenbach assigned it in 1850 to the new genus Quelea. Three subspecies are recognised, with Quelea quelea quelea occurring roughly from Senegal to Chad, Q. q. aethiopica from Sudan to Somalia and Tanzania, and Q. q. lathamii from Gabon to Mozambique and South Africa. Non-breeding birds have light underparts, striped brown upper parts, yellow-edged flight feathers and a reddish bill. Breeding females attain a yellowish bill. Breeding males have a black (or rarely white) facial mask, surrounded by a purplish, pinkish, rusty or yellowish wash on the head and breast. The species avoids forests, deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern South Africa. It constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches, sugar cane or reeds. It breeds in very large colonies.|$|E
40|$|Quelea quelea is {{probably}} the most important avian pest of cereal crops in the sahelian areas of Africa. Its depredations reduce the cereal production of many African nations that lie within its range. To prevent this damage, bird control organizations carry out campaigns to reduce their numbers. Frequently these efforts have given poor crop protection for the cost of control because of inadequate control technology. Factors contributing to the difficulty of carrying out this kind of control are the migrations of the birds which are still incompletely understood, the inaccessability of many nesting areas, the relatively high reproductive potential of Quelea, and the vastness of the territory involved. (The generic name is used throughout this paper to denote the Red-billed (or Sudan) <b>Dioch,</b> Quelea quelea.). In consequence, a general population reduction seems impossible. However, within a broad program of crop protection there are some places and times when destruction of concentrations of Quelea could be a practical means of control. In particular, this is true in situations where nesting colonies are located near agricultural schemes with high-value cash crops...|$|E
40|$|The Av-Alarm is {{a device}} for {{producing}} loud intermittent sounds which are sometimes effective in repelling pest birds or mammals. (Av-Alarm is manufactured by Av-Alarm Corp, P. O. Box 2488, Santa Maria, California 93454.) The sound {{is intended to}} irritate or cause anxiety in animals, perhaps by interfering with normal sound communication sufficiently to repel them from the area. Boudreau(1972) and Stewart (1974) report factors relating to alarm stimuli in bird control. Stewart (1974), HcCracken (1972) and Palmer (1976) reported the use of Av-Alarm in repelling pests under several different situations. However, Jeffrey Jackson (pers. comm.) has reported the use of Av-Alarm in a Red-billed <b>Dioch</b> (Qualea qaelea) breeding colony with no apparent success in interfering with reproduction. In Somalia there are several bird pest species that attack grain crops. The greatest pests to rice are Quelea and the Red Bishop (Euplectes orix). In experimenting with various methods of protecting rice in Somalia, I used one Av-Alarm unit to determine the effectiveness in repelling Quelea in the long rainy season of 1975 and repeated the experiment in 1976...|$|E
40|$|The {{importation}} of live birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians into the United States {{is a growing}} problem to law enforcement agencies of the Federal and State governments. Importation of the above types of animals into the United States is supervised by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, of the U. S. Department of the Interior. The function is of a regulatory nature: 1. to insure that no prohibited species enter the United States; 2. to enforce compliance with certain Federal Acts such as (a) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, (b) the Lacey Act, Title 18 USC, Sec. 42, 43 and 44, (c) the Bald and Golden Eagle Act; 3. {{to assist in the}} enforcement of State laws and regulations concerned with entry of undesirable species of wildlife not afforded Federal prohibition. Restricted species of birds and mammals prohibited entry into the United States by Federal laws are: Birds: Java Sparrow, Padda oryzivora; Sudan <b>Dioch,</b> Quelea quelea; Rosy Pastor, Sturnus roseus; and the Red-Whiskered Bulbui, Pycnonotus jococus; Mammals: Mongoose, any species of the genera Atilax, Cynictis, Helogale, Herpestes, Ichneumia, Mungos and Suricata; Bats of the genus Pteropus; Multimammate Rat of the genus Mastomys; the East Indian Wild Dog of the genus Cuon. The above named birds and mammals were declared undesirable for entry into the United States because of their destructive habits to agriculture and our native wildlife...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{completion of}} the rainy season and nesting of granivorous birds between October and November in the Sudano-sahelian region of Senegal often results in very extensive bird damage to cereal crops. This occurs from both increased bird populations, due {{to the presence of}} juveniles as well as from their accompanying change in diet from insects to seeds. The damage is caused by several species of birds, most notable the Red-billed <b>Dioch</b> (Quelea quelea) and the Village and Black-headed Weavers (Ploceus cuculiatus and Ploceus capitalis). The Buffalo Weaver (Bubalornis albirostris) and the Glossy Starling Lamprotornis chalybaeus) also are at times serious crop depredators. Traditionally, farmers employ many different frightening techniques to chase or scare birds from their crops. The methods provide at best only temporary relief and require considerable time and energy. A possible solution to the bird problem involves the use of chemical repellents applied directly to the ripening grain. The purpose of the trial reported here was to evaluate methiocarb or Mesurol [4 -(methylthio) - 3, 5 xylyl N - methylcarbamate] as a bird repellent on ripening sorghum. The study was undertaken {{as a part of the}} Regional UNDP/FAO Project “Research into the Control of Grain-eating Birds,” aimed at the development and improvement of control techniques to prevent or reduce bird damage to cereal crops. The effectiveness of methiocarb as a nonlethal bird repellent has been demonstrated on several types of crops, among them cherries (Guarino, et al., 1974), blueberries (Bollengier, et al., 1973), sorghum (Mott and Lewis, 1975) and rice (DeHaven, et al., 1971). Trials by DeGrazio and DeHaven (1974) on wheat and rice in eastern Africa also have shown promise. Likewise, the Quelea Project has obtained some success with it against Passer Iuteus, Quelea quelea, and ploceus capitalis when applied to both ripening millet and rice (Bruggers, 1975, 1977) ...|$|E
