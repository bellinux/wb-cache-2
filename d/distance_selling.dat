25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Parliament passed its first {{comprehensive}} incursion into {{the doctrine of}} contractual freedom in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. The topic of unfair terms is vast, and could equally include specific contracts falling under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Legislation, particularly regarding consumer protection, is also frequently being updated by the European Union, in laws like the Flight Delay Compensation Regulation, or the Electronic Commerce Directive, which are subsequently translated into domestic law through a statutory instrument authorised through the European Communities Act 1972 section 2(2), as for example with the Consumer Protection (<b>Distance</b> <b>Selling)</b> Regulations 2000. The primary legislation on unfair consumer contract terms deriving from the EU {{is found in the}} Consumer Rights Act 2015. The Law Commission had drafted a unified Unfair Contract Terms Bill, but Parliament chose to maintain two extensive documents.|$|E

50|$|Fairs in Scotland {{have been}} held from the early Middle Ages, and {{traditionally}} brought together the important elements of medieval trade and a festival. Many of the common markets and fairs are rooted in ancient times, from the medieval period or earlier, and {{are said to be}} 'prescriptive fairs'. Other fairs will have been granted a royal charter to cement their importance and secure their future, and these are known as Charter fairs. In the Middle Ages the Royal charters gave the fairs legal status and developed their economic importance. The majority of fairs held in Scotland {{and the rest of the}} British Isles can trace their ancestry to charters granted in the medieval period. Traders would travel long <b>distances</b> to <b>sell</b> their goods, as did travelling musicians and entertainers who kept both the traders and customers entertained. In the thirteenth century, the creation of fairs by royal charter was widespread. Between 1199 and 1350 charters were issued granting the rights to hold markets or fairs. Kirkcaldy links market remains the premier funfair in Scotland, evolving from a charter granted by Edward I in 1304. By the early 18th century the main aspect of these Scottish charter fairs had diminished and shifted to that of amusement with the advent of technology, and had evolved into the modern day travelling fairs.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} smallholder farmers' level of perception about climate change, {{source of information}} on climate change, types of adaptation strategies, factors influencing adaptation choices and barriers to adaptation in Eastern Hararghe Zone, Ethiopia. The surveyed farm households {{in the study area}} perceived at least one aspect of climate change primarily through their life experience. Planting trees is the major adaptation measure and 89. 1 percent of the farmers took this adaptation strategy. Most farmers (96 percent) believe that deforestation is the main cause of climate change and the choice of farmers to plant trees as an adaptation strategy may be partly a mitigation strategy. However, the majority (49. 6 percent) of the households employed at least one adaptation response on top of tree planting. The other adaptation strategies include: early planting, terracing, irrigation and water harvesting. The main source of information for these adaptation strategies for 58. 4 percent of the respondents is from extension advice. Results of a multinomial logit model showed that non-farm income, farmer- to-farmer extension, access to credit, <b>distance</b> to <b>selling</b> markets, <b>distance</b> to purchasing markets, and income affect the choice of adaptation strategies. Finally, the study identified lack of information as the most important barrier to climate change adaptation. The other barriers include: lack of farm inputs, shortage of land, lack of money, lack of water and shortage of labor...|$|R

The technological perspective of innovation is analyzed by taking into account all types of channels, not just those at the retail distribution level. This perspective can be divided into an area of innovation in vertical relationships between channel members and an area of innovation in relationships with final demand. The main fronts of innovation in vertical relations between firms are: logistics, the joint management of supplying activities, and those joint activities {{with a high level of}} integration among partners, such as Vendor Managed Category Management. As regard to relationships with final demand main innovation fields are: checkout technologies, electronic and mobile payments, <b>distance</b> and on-line <b>selling,</b> and self-service technologie...|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} security, {{shoulder surfing}} {{is a type}} of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder. This attack can be performed either at close range (by directly looking over the victim's shoulder) or from a longer range by, for example by using a pair of binoculars or similar hardware. To implement this technique attackers do not require any technical skills; keen observation of victims' surroundings and the typing pattern is sufficient. Crowded places are the more likely areas for an attacker to shoulder surf the victim. In the early 1980s, shoulder surfing was practiced near public pay phones to steal calling card digits and make long <b>distance</b> calls or <b>sell</b> them in the market for the cheaper prices. However, the advent of modern-day technologies like hidden cameras and secret microphones makes shoulder surfing easier and gives more scope for the attacker to perform long range shoulder surfing. A hidden camera allows the attacker to capture whole login process and other confidential data of the victim, which ultimately could lead to financial loss or identity theft.|$|R

Primary {{data were obtained}} from 150 arable crop farmers in the zone. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis were used to analyze data collected. The result reveals that majority of farmers were getting old and there is low social capital accumulation among arable crop farmers.

The study recommends that Akwa Ibom state government should further subsidize the price of fertilizer to make fertilizer more affordable to small holder farmers. In addition, arable crop farming households in the state should be sensitized on the current method of family planning as this would help to reduce non-farm cost and help increase fertilizer procurement. Furthermore, the extension unit of the state ministry of Agriculture should be strengthened to educate arable crop farmers more on fertilizer usage...|$|R

An independent double hurdle model was {{used to analyze the}} objectives of the study on the assumption that adoption and optimal use of fertilizer by respondents were two independent decisions influenced by different factors. Empirical estimates of the first hurdle reveals that family size, farm size, perceived price of fertilizer, years in farming business, value of crop output, extension agent visit, number of goats and sheep kept by farmers, and decision to own poultry are statistically significant decision variables that influenced the probability of adopting fertilizer by farming household heads in the study area. Estimates of the second hurdle revealed that, the decision to use optimum intensity of fertilizer by farming household heads was influenced by age, gender, farm size, purpose of crop production, perceived price of fertilizer, crop output, number of goats and sheep kept by respondents, and <b>distance</b> to fertilizer <b>selling</b> point. To encourage fertilizer adoption and it optimal usage, the price of fertilizer should further be subsidized and extension unit in the state strengthened to educate farmers more on the importance of fertilizer.

But {{when they came to}} it they saw that five or six of the houses were chalked in the same manner. The guide was so confounded that he knew not what answer to make, and when they {{returned}} he was at once beheaded for having failed. Another robber was dispatched, and, having won over Baba Mustapha, marked the house in red chalk; but Morgiana being again too clever for them, the second messenger was put to death also. The Captain now resolved to go himself, but, wiser than the others, he did not mark the house, but looked at it so closely that he could not fail to remember it. He returned, and ordered his men to go into the neighboring villages and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight leather jars, all empty except one, which was full of oil. The Captain put one of his men, fully armed, into each, rubbing the outside of the jars with oil from the full vessel. Then the nineteen mules were loaded with thirty-seven robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and reached the town by dusk. The Captain stopped his mules in front of Ali Baba's house, and said to Ali Baba, who was sitting outside for coolness: [...] "I have brought some oil from a <b>distance</b> to <b>sell</b> at to-morrow's market, but it is now so late that I know not where to pass the night, unless you will do me the favor to take me in." [...] Though Ali Baba had seen the Captain of the robbers in the forest, he did not recognize him in the disguise of an oil merchant. He bade him welcome, opened his gates for the mules to enter, and went to Morgiana to bid her prepare a bed and supper for his guest. He brought the stranger into his hall, and after they had supped went again to speak to Morgiana in the kitchen, while the Captain went into the yard under pretense of seeing after his mules, but really to tell his men what to do. Beginning at the first jar and ending at the last, he said to each man: [...] "As soon as I throw some stones from the window of the chamber where I lie, cut the jars open with your knives and come out, and I will be with you in a trice." [...] He returned to the house, and Morgiana led him to his chamber. She then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to set on the pot to make some broth for her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile her lamp went out, and she had no more oil in the house. [...] "Do not be uneasy," [...] said Abdallah; [...] "go into the yard and take some out of one of those jars." [...] Morgiana thanked him for his advice, took the oil pot, and went into the yard. When she came to the first jar the robber inside said softly: [...] "Is it time?" ...|$|R

These were regulated under the Unsolicited Goods Act 1971 but the Consumer Protection (<b>Distance</b> <b>Selling)</b> Regulations 2000 are stricter in every respect rendering the 1971 Act largely redundant from a consumer law perspective, although there is no express repeal.
