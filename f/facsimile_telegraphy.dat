5000|$|As an {{engineer}} at Bell Laboratories, Nyquist did important work on thermal noise ("Johnson-Nyquist noise"), {{the stability of}} feedback amplifiers, <b>telegraphy,</b> <b>facsimile,</b> television, and other important communications problems. With Herbert E. Ives, he helped to develop AT&T's first facsimile machines that were made public in 1924. In 1932, he published a classic paper on stability of feedback amplifiers. [...] The Nyquist stability criterion can now be found in all textbooks on feedback control theory.|$|R

The first satellite, ARABSAT- 1 A, has already been launched in a geostationary orbit and placed at 19 degree East longitude. The second in this series will be located around 26 degree East longitude, while the third will be stored in the ground. One of the two satellites in orbit will act as a standby, but {{may be used to}} provide additional services if required. Each of the two satellites in orbit can provide services such as telephony, telex, data transmission, <b>telegraphy,</b> <b>facsimile,</b> radio and television broadcasting. This satellite system will provide educational broadcasting, video teleconferencing and emergency communicationsIEEE, New York, NY, US...|$|R
