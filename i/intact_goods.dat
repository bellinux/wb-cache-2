40|$|Dyspraxia {{is often}} {{defined as a}} {{disorder}} or immaturity {{in the development of}} motor skills and organized, voluntary movements in the objective space. Considering speech as a motor activity of high specificity and complexity, dyspraxic disorders can also affect the control of oral-buccal-lingual movements and produce problems in oral expression. Developmental verbal dyspraxia is the developmental speech and language disorder that is manifested in the difficulty of programming sequential speech movements, and therefore the production of meaningful verbal messages and its accompanying nonverbal elements. It is diagnosed if the child has no detected peripheral organ damage, severe sensory disturbances, nor muscle weakness or dysfunction. Also, an intellectual functioning is within normal range ande receptive language skills are <b>intact.</b> <b>Good</b> results in the treatment of developmental dyspraxic disorders are achieved by using techniques of psychomotor reeducation method, a kind of developmental therapy that achieves reintegration of practognostical skills and psychomotor activity by using speech, body movements and tonic dialogue as authentic means of communication. This paper will describe certain types of exercises of general psychomotor re-education which can be used in the treatment of developmental verbal dyspraxia, as a supplement to speech and neuropsychological therapy...|$|R
50|$|The Stitt House {{has been}} {{occupied}} by three individuals {{whose lives were}} either closely connected {{with the history of}} Hot Springs or whose achievements transcended the local level and received national recognition.

40|$|Obesity, a {{major concern}} for equine welfare, is highly {{prevalent}} in the leisure horse population. Skeletal-muscle and adipose tissues are important determinants of maintenance energy requirements. The myostatin and perilipin pathways play key roles in the regulation of muscle mass and lipolysis respectively and have both been associated with obesity predisposition in other mammalian species. High quality samples, suitable for molecular biology, are an essential prerequisite for detailed investigations of gene and protein expression. Hence, this study has evaluated a) the post-mortem stability of RNA extracted from skeletal-muscle and adipose-tissues collected under commercial conditions and b) the tissue-specific presence of myostatin, the moystatin receptor (activin receptor IIB, ActRIIB), follistatin and perilipin, genes and proteins {{across a range of}} equine tissues. Objectives were addressed using tissues from 7 Thoroughbred horses presented for slaughter at a commercial abattoir; a) samples were collected at 7 time-points from Masseter muscle and perirenal adipose from 5 minutes to 6 hours post-mortem. Extracted RN was appraised by Optical Density analysis and agarose-gel electrophoresis. b) Quantitative real time PCR and Western Blotting were used to evaluate gene and protein expression in anatomically-defined samples collected from 17 tissues (6 organs, 4 skeletal muscles and 7 discrete adipose depots). The results indicate that, under the present collection conditions, <b>intact,</b> <b>good</b> quality RNA could be extracted from skeletal-muscle for up to 2 hours post-mortem. However, RNA from adipose tissue may be more susceptible to degradation/contamination and sample...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} vector-axialvector mixing {{in a hot}} medium and its {{evolution}} toward the chiral phase transition using different symmetry restoration scenarios based on the generalized hidden local symmetry framework. We show {{that the presence of}} the a_ 1 meson reduces the vector spectral function around ρ meson mass and enhances it around a_ 1 meson mass. The coupling strength of a_ 1 to ρ and π vanishes at the critical temperature due to the degenerate ρ-a_ 1 masses. This feature holds rigorously in the chiral limit and still stays <b>intact</b> to <b>good</b> approximation for the physical pion mass.
