5000|$|... 4-IPO is a {{specific}} lethal toxicant which mainly targets bronchiolar exocrine cells in the smaller bronchioles of rodent and cattle lungs. With an increased <b>dosis</b> {{it is also possible}} to affect other cells and the airway of organisms. Covalent binding of 4-IPO to members of the CYP family (mainly CYP4B1) eventually leads to biotransformation of 4-IPO into an enedial intermediate, which is able to bind to a variety of proteins. These binding events are permanent and responsible for 4-IPO toxicity. This will result in cytotoxicity and eventually necrosis of bronchiolar exocrine cells, while ciliated bronchiolar cells and other epithelial lung cells are not affected, due to lower levels of cytochrome proteins. Necrotic patches, also called lesions or primary pathological changes, can develop into edemas, resulting in thickening of the alveolar septum, congestion, and hemorrhage (secondary and tertiary pathological changes). Lethality is probably due to pulmonary edema. Prior to death the dogs also showed rapid and shallow respiration, while in rats labored respiration and lymphocyte depletion can be observed. The LD50 dose varies between different species. In female mice 21 mg/kg/day 4-IPO are sufficient while in male mice 35 mg/kg/day were necessary. 15 mg/kg 4-IPO intravenously administered into rats is lethal and in dogs this dose is 12 mg/kg. It is possible to increase the LD50 by 2-4.5 fold when individuals are treated with multiple non-toxic doses beforehand.|$|E

The accident of position caused the Genoas loss to be very heavy; her list of killed considerably exceeded that of any other ship in the fleet, and included Bathurst. It is sufficiently well known that the Lord High Admiral was to a great extent personally responsible for this action having been fought, and that he felt the most lively interest in the result; he was thus prompted to write, with his own hand, a letter of condolence to Bathurst's widow, the mother of five children.
