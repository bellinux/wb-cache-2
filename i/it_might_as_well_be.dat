Listener Jeremy Dylan then took this title and produced posters, a trailer and, eventually, an independent film based on the concept, with Stephen Fry as narrator.

[...] The Boston Heralds Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was [...] "a personal story, not a political one". In The New York Times, Mike Hale commented, [...] "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence.

[...] Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the Los Angeles Times, wrote at About.com, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is [...] "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." [...] She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, {{due to the lack of}} a director calling the shots.

During this trip, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and Roosevelt Cliff. The Wilson Glacier he {{named in honor of}} Woodrow Wilson for being the World War I president. He named Victory Ridge in honor of the victory achieved in World War I. Roosevelt Cliff he named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, who had been a champion of conservation. In another error in cartography, the name was later moved from its intended landform. In Tales of a Western Mountaineer, Rusk describes his original intent as [...] "ust beyond the southernmost ice-fall of Wilson Glacier rises a high abrupt precipice and we agreed that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> christened ‘Roosevelt Cliff.’" [...] This is the ridge that divides the Wilson Glacier in two. Rusk made three exploratory attempts up the east side of Adams. The first was up Victory Ridge. They climbed up the ridge to over , but were blocked from further progress by a dangerously narrow section of the ridge. Rusk camped here for the night to test how a climbing party that might have to spend the night on the mountain would fare at that altitude. The next attempt was up the northern arm of the Wilson Glacier. On this attempt, Rusk was able to reach an elevation of about , but turned back for fear of avalanches and his concern for Green’s safety. As Rusk and Green continued to the north, they passed through the area of Devils Gardens and Rusk named it as such because of the curious lava formations. The final attempt was up the Lava Ridge. On this attempt, they reached the lower extreme of the summit ice cap somewhere near , but were turned back again by falling rocks that Rusk described as hurtling [...] "down the slope with the speed of a rifle-ball."
