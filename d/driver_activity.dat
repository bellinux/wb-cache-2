50|$|The 3rd-generation Octavia is {{the first}} Škoda car to feature front radar and a {{multi-function}} camera. The radar sensor in the front bumper monitors the area {{in front of the}} vehicle and continually evaluates the distance, direction and speed of all nearby objects (not only traffic). This radar provides data for two assistants in the Octavia: Front Assistant (forward collision warning and emergency braking) and Adaptive Cruise Assistant (adaptive cruise control). A monochromatic fixed-focus multi-function camera is mounted on the windscreen in front of the rear mirror, and allows function of Lane Assistant (lane keeping system), Intelligent Light Assistant (automatic control of the high beams) and Traffic Sign Recognition (recognises and shows traffic signs on displays of both on-board computer and satellite navigation).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a new system}} that analyses tachograph charts. These circular charts are legal records {{of information on the}} different types of <b>driver</b> <b>activity</b> (driving, other duty, standby and rest) and vehicle data (speed and distance travelled). As each driver of each passenger and goods vehicle over a certain capacity must use a chart for every 24 -hour period, there is a significant need for automated analysis (currently, tachograph charts are analysed manually). The system starts by determining the shape parameters of the chart (location of the centre and radius). The position of the start of the 24 -hour period (radius from centre to 24 hour tick mark) is then estimated. Finally the <b>driver</b> <b>activity</b> trace (recorded in a circular manner) is extracted, converted into a linear representation and recognised. Results from the evaluation of the system against professionally prepared ground truth indicate at least 94 % accuracy in reading the driving time even on difficult (with scratches and marks) charts. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The early reset merged {{capacitor}} switching algorithm (EMCS) is proposed as an energy reducing switching technique for a binary weighted, capacitive successive approximation (SAR) {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC). The method uses the merged {{capacitor switching}} (MCS) architecture and optimizes {{the use of}} the VCM level during the SAR conversion.

The MCS and EMCS approaches are analyzed mathematically and the EMCS energy consumption is shown to be lower than or equal to that of the MCS technique for every digital code. Static linearity improvements for this structure are also shown with the integral non-linearity (INL) reducing by a factor of two due to the utilization of the MCS three level DAC.

30|$|One might raise another {{possibility}} that, the electron auroral beading and brightening during the TSSO is purely an ionospheric process, {{and does not}} necessarily correspond to a <b>driver</b> <b>activity</b> in the equatorial magnetosphere. While this hypothesis occasionally existed in the literature (e.g., Sakaguchi et al. 2009), and we may not entirely exclude this possibility within our current knowledge of TSSO, {{it is fair to}} say that such a hypothesis does not have a definite observational support so far. To say the least, the results in Motoba et al. (2012) on the conjugacy between the shape and motion of auroral beads in the northern and southern hemispheres clearly favor an equatorial magnetospheric origin of the auroral beads. So far to the authors’ knowledge, the view that TSSO has a magnetospheric driver prevails among substorm researchers.

40|$|When {{considering}} {{long-haul transport}} requests, the durations of rest periods and breaks highly influence the overall time needed for fulfillment. In the European Union, Regulation (EC) No 561 / 2006 defines {{the rules for}} the number, duration and time intervals when rest periods and breaks have to be taken. The present study proposes two mixed integer linear programming models and optimization strategies that, together with a transformation algorithm, allow to plan <b>driver</b> <b>activities</b> in compliance with this regulation for a given sequence of customer locations and other stops to be visited. One of the models considers all rules, including extended rules, while the other {{takes into account the}} regular requirements.

A special feature is the consideration of "soft" time windows which has not been studied in this context so far.

In online re-planning, lateness can be revealed at an early stage such {{that it is possible to}} reorganize the schedule or to negotiate arrival times with customers before communication effort and costs increase and further delays or cancellations are unavoidable. In addition to the mathematical models, a myopic algorithm was developed that can only "see" the route until the next customer stop and the corresponding customer time window in advance and plans <b>driver</b> <b>activities</b> accordingly.
