5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music. This usage can <b>have</b> <b>health</b> applications {{in the case of}} individuals struggling with over-stimulation or sensory processing disorder. Also, white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Vietnam says that 4 {{million of its}} citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, {{and as many as}} 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include their children who were exposed. The Red Cross of Vietnam estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or <b>have</b> <b>health</b> problems due to contaminated Agent Orange. The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and <b>have</b> <b>health</b> {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and the original, , are {{identical}} in gameplay and plot. The {{game is a}} first-person shooter with portions of vehicular combat taking place from a third-person perspective. The plot follows the player character and protagonist Master Chief, a supersoldier, as he fights the alien Covenant on the mysterious ancient ringworld Halo. Players are equipped with a recharging energy shield that absorbs damage; players also <b>have</b> <b>health</b> {{that can only be}} replenished by health packs scattered across the game's levels. A variety of human and alien weapons and vehicles can be used.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not <b>have</b> <b>health</b> insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Oklahoma ranked 45th in {{physicians}} {{per capita}} and slightly {{below the national}} average in nurses per capita, but was slightly over the national average in hospital beds per 100,000 people and above the national average in net growth of health services over a 12-year period.

5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may <b>have</b> <b>health</b> benefits, similar to the hot springs of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to <b>have</b> <b>health</b> problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
