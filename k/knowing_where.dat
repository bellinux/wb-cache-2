5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard to the gold and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E
5|$|With {{no way of}} <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the boy {{had been}} taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, {{supported}} by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode {{as an example of}} papal tyranny.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} {{understand}} that it is over with Gustav--finished--" [...] He stopped dead, seeing at once that he had gone wrong, and not <b>knowing</b> quite <b>where.</b> Gyp had simply smiled. A flush coloured his cheeks, and he said: ...|$|R

5|$|At Mulder's apartment, Scully {{announces that}} because of Mulder's odd behavior, she {{realized}} Mulder's body contains Morris Fletcher. Scully demands {{to know how to}} restore Mulder to his own body. Mulder's informant calls again and Scully forces Fletcher to take the call and set up a meeting. Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a flight data recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the flight data recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> they are from or how they work.|$|E

60|$|Phineas {{said that}} he would, and then went on, not <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>where</b> he was going. He had one desire,--to find Violet Effingham, but when he should find her he could not carry her off, and sit with her beneath a haycock.|$|R
5|$|Young {{now had to}} {{lead the}} Saints into the far west, without <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>where</b> to go or where they would end up. He insisted the Mormons should settle in a place no one else wanted and felt the {{isolated}} Great Basin would provide the Saints with many advantages.|$|R
60|$|We murmured some banality {{about not}} <b>knowing</b> a place <b>where</b> one could better come from than Boston. But he brushed it by without notice.|$|R
25|$|Abousfian felt it {{necessary}} to state why he didn't list the names of his supporters {{in a letter to the}} editor of Globe and Mail,"On the urging of my lawyers...I had earned the money by reciting alms. I had not wanted to invite scrutiny of those who paid me, <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> guilt by association can lead".|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, {{the police}} sent Woodard before the local judge, who found him guilty and fined him fifty dollars. The soldier requested medical assistance, {{but it took}} two more days for a doctor {{to be sent to}} him. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> he was and suffering from amnesia, Woodard ended up in a hospital in Aiken, South Carolina, receiving substandard medical care.|$|E
25|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>where</b> Periwinkle {{possibly}} could be, Papa searches {{for him and}} eventually comes across the tent. Inside, he reminds his son that no one lives at the old Bellflower home any more. But, when Papa tells him of a housewarming at their new place, Periwinkle cheers up, {{and the two of}} them head back over the hill to join in the fun.|$|E
6000|$|For {{some little}} time he {{leaned on the}} tomb {{thinking}} of this dead man of his own blood, and {{of the house in}} Devonshire; then, nodding to the plains: [...] "Yes; it's a big work all of it even my little share. He must have been worth <b>knowing....</b> Bukta, <b>where</b> are my people?" ...|$|R

60|$|When Anna {{left him}} the night before, he had wandered {{about in the}} dark, not <b>knowing</b> quite <b>where</b> he went. Then the moon came up, {{and he found himself}} sitting under the eave of a barn close to a chalet where all was dark and quiet; and down below him the moon-whitened valley village--its roofs and spires and little glamorous unreal lights.|$|R
25|$|Short {{of water}} and feed for the horses, not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> his supply boats were, and {{receiving}} divided opinions from his senior officers, Banks ordered a rapid retreat downriver to Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. Both sides at the Battle of Pleasant Hill suffered roughly equal casualties of 1,600. It was a tactical victory for the Federals, but a strategic Confederate one because the Union army retreated following the battle.|$|E
25|$|His speculations were {{in foreign}} currencies, {{equities}} and derivatives {{and he also}} signed loan agreements with governments not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the funds would be coming from. For example, the majority stake he had bought in a chemical company in Griesheim, Germany returned 15 times his investment after two years when the company became part of I. G. Farben. Part of his attraction for investors were the high dividends Kreuger & Toll paid. Therefore, he also {{had to make sure}} that he had money to pay those dividends.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September and 3 October, Rossini {{wrote to}} Santocanale in Palermo {{providing}} very detailed accounts {{of all that}} he had done immediately following Bellini's death as well as what had taken place on 2 October. Initially, Rossini regarded burial in Père Lachaise cemetery as a short-term arrangement, not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the final resting place would turn out to be. Despite attempts over many years to have Bellini's remains transferred to Catania, that did not take place until 1876, when the casket containing his remains was taken to the cathedral in Catania and reburied.|$|E

50|$|According to the Stephen Donovan, one {{day when}} she was thirty-four, she {{attended}} Mass in {{the church of the}} Franciscan Friars, she seemed to hear a mysterious voice that bade her say an Our Father and a Hail Mary at least once with fervour and attention.

25|$|Safavid Iran was {{disturbed}} {{by the death of}} king Abbas a few months after Shirley's death. Abbas' grandson, Safi, succeeded him and his religious toleration varied widely. The khan of Shiraz' favourite, who still wanted to marry Teresia, sent his servants to the Carmelites in Isfahan to capture her. The priests denied <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> she was, and advised her to take refuge in the Church of Saint Augustine in New Julfa (the Armenian quarter in Isfahan); they were brought to the favourite's house and threatened with torture before they were released.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, Westwood had no {{interest}} in doing a straight adaptation of the film as either a shoot 'em up or traditional point-and-click adventure game. As a result, the team decided to write a new story set within the fictional milieu of the film – a story in which players would play not as Rick Deckard, but as a new character, Ray McCoy. This allowed fans of the film the experience of seeing {{the sights and sounds of}} the movie, but without <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the story is heading.|$|E
25|$|Keleon {{explains}} {{that if the}} trio defeat Eldrith, it will mean {{the destruction of the}} Tower itself, as well as freeing the ghosts within. However, as they cannot leave the tower the way they entered, it will most likely lead to their own deaths. They find Eldrith alone {{on the roof of the}} Tower guarding another portal. She reiterates her plans for the destruction of Baldur's Gate. They fight and defeat her, and as she dies, she repents her actions and asks forgiveness. With the tower crumbling around them, the heroes enter the portal, not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> it leads.|$|E
6000|$|While Allen stood {{close to}} the rocky wall he reached the {{conclusion}} that his uncle must have come there by the river, but whether a voluntary or involuntary passenger he could not decide. He knew Uncle Barnaby was exceedingly fearless, but was there any human being who would take the awful risk of a journey on that underground river, not <b>knowing</b> to <b>where</b> it led? ...|$|R

25|$|Lucinda Spiderwick– The {{daughter}} of Arthur Spiderwick and the cousin of Helen Grace's mother, making her the Grace children's great aunt.

In adulthood, she was attacked by Mulgarath's army and subsequently put in a clinic for the insane. Because she tasted the food of the faeries, she can no longer eat regular food, only being kept alive by the fruits given to her by the sprites she played with as a child.|$|E
25|$|That morning, Federal patrols {{detected}} both threats. Not <b>knowing</b> <b>where</b> the Confederate {{main body}} was located, Curtis sent Dodge's brigade of Col. Eugene A. Carr's 4th Division northeast up the Wire Road {{to join the}} 24th Missouri Infantry at Elkhorn Tavern. But Dodge, still worried about {{the threat to the}} Federal rear, had disobeyed orders and pulled his brigade back to Pratt's Store, available to immediately reinforce Elkhorn. Curtis also sent a task force under Col. Peter J. Osterhaus north to reconnoiter along Ford Road. Osterhaus' force consisted of Col. Nicholas Greusel's brigade of his own 1st Division, several cavalry units led by Col. Cyrus Bussey, and twelve cannons.|$|E
25|$|At Zakynthos, {{the commandant}} ordered Metropolitan Bishop Chrysostomos and Mayor Lucas Carrer {{to submit a}} list {{with the names of}} all the Jews that lived on the island, {{together}} with details of their assets within 24 hours. They gave him an envelope with only their names (bishop’s and the mayor’s). Not a single Jew of the 275 that lived on Zakynthos was deported.

50|$|Retrievers are {{constructed}} (typically by evil mages, warlords or demons) to find, capture or recapture lost or desired objects, runaway slaves, wanted criminals, or such.

In order for this to work, however, the master has to have either seen or touched the item/being to be retrieved.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course you}} must not suppose that all the fathers and mothers who had lost {{children}} made no attempts to find them, but the forest was so large, and the witch was so cunning in <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>where</b> {{they were going to}} search, that it was very easy for her to keep out of the way. Besides, there was always the chance that the children might have been eaten by wolves, of which large herds roamed about in winter.|$|R
