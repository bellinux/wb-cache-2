5|$|In 1995, Toriyama {{detailed}} the equipment he used for Dragon Ball. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not press down hard. Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old <b>fine</b> <b>point</b> Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E

Los Angeles already had a <b>fine</b> <b>point</b> guard in Norm Nixon, making Moncrief potentially a wonderful complement at off guard. However, Cooke liked Johnson's smile and playing style. In one of Cooke's last acts as Lakers owner, the Lakers drafted the point guard Johnson.|$|E

25|$|The <b>fine</b> <b>point</b> of what {{constitutes}} an asterism {{may be seen in}} two examples. Theta Orionis (θ Ori) is embedded in, and illuminates, the Orion Nebula (M42). Looked at telescopically, it resolved into four stars arranged in a trapezoid, and they were nicknamed the Trapezium. The asterism retained this name even when it was discovered that there were yet more stars in the group. However, it has since been determined that the Orion Nebula is a stellar nursery and that the Trapezium is actually an Open Cluster. Thus it is no longer an asterism. On the other hand, M73 in Aquarius, which was thought to be an Open Cluster, turns out to be composed of unrelated stars, and may now be considered to be an asterism.|$|E
25|$|In a {{laboratory}} environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, {{which uses a}} microscope objective lens to focus the light down to a <b>fine</b> <b>point.</b> A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned {{with respect to the}} fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.|$|E

In general, the aftershaft is absent; however, small ones on some tail and wing feathers {{may be present}} [...] Body feathers have very dense, fluffy bases, are attached loosely into the skin, and drop out easily.

500|$|Upon hatching, the tadpoles {{are around}} 2.5–3mm in snout-vent length (SVL) and about 5–6mm {{including}} the tail. Tadpoles in captivity increase exponentially {{over time in}} total length; their SVL increases from about 3 to about 9mm within five weeks, and it triples again {{in the next five}} weeks. In all, the growth rate is 0.2mm per day in the first five weeks. The tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are large, reaching [...] in length, but size varies greatly and most are much shorter. The body is usually as wide across as it is deep. The fin has a yellow tinge and is considerably arched. The musculature is moderate and tapers to a <b>fine</b> <b>point,</b> as does the fin. The body wall is translucent yellow with darker areas over the abdomen. Just before its limbs form, the tadpole begins to develop the greenish colouration of the adult. Tadpoles usually swim within 30cm of the water surface, or remain stationary at the bottom. They often move together in groups akin to schools of fish.|$|E
500|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, Arkhangelsk was bombed by the Luftwaffe, and Shanina and other townspeople were involved in firefighting and mounted voluntary vigils on rooftops to protect the kindergarten. Shanina's two elder brothers had volunteered for the military. In December 1941, a death notification was received for her 19-year-old brother Mikhail, who had died during the Siege of Leningrad. In response, Shanina went to the military commissariat to ask for permission to serve. Two more of Shanina's brothers died in the war. At that time the Soviet Union had begun deploying female snipers because they had flexible limbs, and {{it was believed that}} they were patient, careful and cunning. In February 1942, Soviet {{women between the ages of}} 16 and 45 became eligible for the military draft, but Shanina was not drafted that month as the local military commissariat wanted to pinion her out of war's way. She first learned to shoot at a shooting range. On 22 June 1943, while still living in the dormitory, Shanina was accepted into the Vsevobuch program for universal military training. After Shanina's several applications, the military commissariat finally allowed her to enroll in the Central Female Sniper Academy, where she met Aleksandra [...] "Sasha" [...] Yekimova and Kaleriya [...] "Kalya" [...] Petrova, who became her closest friends, with Shanina calling them [...] "the vagrant three". Honed to a <b>fine</b> <b>point,</b> Shanina scored highly in training and graduated from the academy with honours. She was offered to stay as an instructor there, but refused due to a call of duty. In 1941–1945 a total of 2,484 Soviet female snipers were deployed for the war and their combined tally of kills is estimated to be at least 11,280.|$|E

2500|$|Radium was {{formerly}} used in self-luminous paints for watches, nuclear panels, aircraft switches, clocks, and instrument dials. A typical self-luminous watch that uses radium paint contains around 1 microgram of radium. In the mid-1920s, a lawsuit was {{filed against the}} United States Radium Corporation by five dying [...] "Radium Girl" [...] dial painters who had painted radium-based luminous paint on the dials of watches and clocks. The dial painters routinely licked their brushes {{to give them a}} <b>fine</b> <b>point,</b> thereby ingesting radium. Their exposure to radium caused serious health effects which included sores, anemia, and bone cancer. This is because radium is treated as calcium by the body, and deposited in the bones, where radioactivity degrades marrow and can mutate bone cells.|$|E

Of the approximately 400 dorsal fin rays, the first 10 to 13 are elongated to varying degrees, forming a trailing crest embellished with reddish spots and flaps of skin at the ray tips. The pelvic fins are similarly elongated and adorned, reduced to one to five rays each. The pectoral fins are greatly reduced and situated low on the body. The anal fin is completely absent and the caudal fin may be reduced or absent, as well, with the body tapering to a <b>fine</b> <b>point.</b> All fins lack true spines.

2500|$|Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) (1999) is {{a single}} work {{composed}} of fifteen photographic offset lithographs, each 30 1/2 x 41 1/2". It is {{in the collection of}} the Museum of Modern Art [...] It was commissioned around 1998, and Horn has noted that it came about at the same time as the end of a long love relationship. Each of the 15 lithographs features a photograph of the surface of the River Thames that has been annotated with many small white numerals that correspond to a bar of footnotes that runs along the lower border of each image. In one footnote, Horn puts a <b>fine</b> <b>point</b> on the lens through which this project looks at the river, [...] "(41) The Thames has the highest rate of suicides of any urban river. Maybe it's not the highest but it's close. It doesn't really matter because even if it doesn't, it looks like it does." [...] Horn describes these annotations as footnoting [...] "whatever I was thinking of at the time, what the river provoked in me, and what was in the river itself." [...] The result is a mixture of poetic fragments, reports culled from interviews and newspaper clippings about deaths (primarily planned suicides) by drowning in the Thames, references to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, questions about identity and consideration of the subject of water from many different perspectives. In most cases, the photographs were taken with such exactitude that the moving surface of the water is stopped in highly detailed topographies, so that the substance of water is shown in more sculptural views than can usually be observed by the naked eye.|$|E
