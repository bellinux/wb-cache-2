25|$|Though Opas {{claimed that}} the staff duty roster was {{virtually}} meaningless {{on the day of}} the shooting because prison officers were taking turns sitting in for their colleagues while they attended the annual staff Christmas party, Newman said he returned to his tower (3) at 1.45pm and later signed statements for the police.

500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> stayed with {{what remains of the}} Avengers {{at the end of the}} film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] (2002), Ashley Laurence {{returns to}} play Kirsty Cotton. In the opening moments, {{she and her}} husband, Trevor (Dean Winters), {{end up in a}} car {{accident}} that kills Kirsty. One month later, Trevor wakes up in a hospital, but because of a head injury, his memory is uncertain and he cannot distinguish between fantasy and reality. As he begins to uncover evidence that he was having a series of affairs, he also comes under suspicion for orchestrating the crash that killed his wife. Pinhead appears in the end, and informs Trevor that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> died in the car crash: his own plot to murder Kirsty for her inheritance backfired when Kirsty offered the Cenobites the lives of Trevor, his mistresses and his co-conspirators in exchange for her own.|$|E
2500|$|An {{agent of}} Fei Wang Reed, [...] is first {{introduced}} in Jade Country {{as a doctor}} who was helping the village with their problems around the time the children started vanishing. Despite appearing {{to be a kind}} person, it is then revealed that out that through hypnotism <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> sends the children to the old castle to dig out Sakura's feather. Due to interference from Syaoran's group, Kyle loses the feather, and disappears with the destruction from Princess Emerald's castle. He reappears various times throughout the series, following Syaoran's group until kidnapping the Sakura's soulless body and taking it to Fei-Wang. When the original Syaoran's group manages to get to Fei-Wang and get their chance to kill him, Kyle is used to save him, dying at the moment. Following his death, his body disappears as Fei-Wang comments he was an artificial being. He is voiced by Mitsuru Miyamoto in Japanese and Troy Baker in English.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} side, on March 20, 1964, some 10 {{days before the}} coup, Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco, {{chief of staff for}} the army, {{circulated}} a letter to the highest echelons of the military warning of the dangers of communism. Two cables from the U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon reveal his suspicions of President Goulart's communist sympathies, and his urging of the CIA to prepare to aid the revolt. The first, dated March 27, 1964, accuses Goulart of actively working with the Brazilian Communist Party, and recommends that the U.S. prepare to support anti-Goulart forces with arms and fuel, especially the General Castello Branco. [...] In the same cable, Gordon mentions that several anti-Goulart groups had approached him {{in the past two years}} about the U.S. supporting a coup. [...] He says that, out of all of them, General Branco was easily the best. [...] In Gordon's opinion, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. should put their weight behind. [...] He is very urgent in his message, saying that he is afraid of Brazil becoming, [...] "The China of the 1960's". [...] Finally, he urges for arms to be sent via an unmarked submarine (at night) as soon as possible. [...] In a second cable, sent two days later on March 29, takes a more urgent tone as Ambassador Gordon reports that the situation had [...] "worsened" [...] and [...] "possibly shortened time factors," [...] and advised that [...] "earliest possible action would achieve optimum results." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ye see, 'The Brilliant' {{she was a}} tight little sloop in the {{government}} service: 'twas in the war-times, ye see, and Commodore Tucker that is now (he was Cap'n Tucker then), he had the command on her,--used to {{run up and down}} all the coast takin' observations o' the British, and keepin' his eye out on 'em, and givin' on 'em a nip here and a clip there,' cordin' as he got a good chance. Why, your grand'ther knew old Commodore Tucker. It was he that took Dr. Franklin over Minister, to France, and dodged all the British vessels, right in the middle o' the war. I tell you that 'are was like runnin' through the drops in a thunder-shower. He got chased by the British ships pretty consid'able, but he was too spry for 'em. Arter the war was over, Commodore Tucker took over John Adams, our fust Minister to England. A drefful smart man the Commodore was, but he most like to 'a' ben took in this 'ere time I'm a tellin' ye about, and all 'cause he was sort o' softhearted to the women. Tom Toothacre told me the story. Tom <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> got me the berth on the ship. Ye see, I used to know Tom at Newport; and once when he took sick there my mother nussed him up, and that was why Tom was friends with me and got me the berth, and kep' me warm in it too. Tom he was one of your rael Maine boys, that's hatched out, so to speak, in water like ducks. He was born away down there on Harpswell P'int; and they say, if ye throw one o' them Harpswell babies into the sea, he'll take to it nateral, and swim like a cork: ef they hit their heads agin a rock it only dents the rock, but don't hurt the baby. Tom he was a great character on the ship. He could see farther, and knew more 'bout wind and water, than most folks: the officers took Tom's judgment, and the men all went by his say. My mother she chalked a streak o' good luck for me when she nussed up Tom.|$|E
6000|$|My {{father was}} a St. Bernard, {{my mother was a}} collie, but I am a Presbyterian. This is what my mother told me, I do not know these nice distinctions myself. To me they are only fine large words meaning nothing. My mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and see other dogs look {{surprised}} and envious, as wondering how she got so much education. But, indeed, it was not real education; it was only show: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room when there was company, and by going with the children to Sunday-school and listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it over to herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was a dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off, and surprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which rewarded her for all her trouble. If there was a stranger he was nearly sure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her what it meant. And she always told him. He was never expecting this but thought he would catch her; so when she told him, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> looked ashamed, whereas he had {{thought it was going to}} be she. The others were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her, for they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience. When she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the right one; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another thing, where could they find out whether it was right or not? for she was the only cultivated dog there was. By and by, when I was older, she brought home the word Unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty hard all the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and despondency; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and flashed out a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had more presence of mind than culture, though I said nothing, of course. She had one word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a life-preserver, a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely to get washed overboard in a sudden way--that was the word Synonymous. When she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks before and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a stranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes, then he would come to, and by that time she would be away down wind on another tack, and not expecting anything; so when he'd hail and ask her to cash in, I (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her canvas flicker a moment--but only just a moment--then it would belly out taut and full, and she would say, as calm as a summer's day, [...] "It's synonymous with supererogation," [...] or some godless long reptile of a word like that, and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack, perfectly comfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane and embarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy.|$|E
