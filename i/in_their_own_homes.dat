40|$|Introduction and purpose: Aging is {{a natural}} and {{inevitable}} process that every human being go thorugh. Elderly residing at nursing homes experience more stress and depression that eventually affect {{their quality of life}} compared to elderly living <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> Meanwhile, social support can promote elderly’s quality of life. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to compare quality of life, social support and depression among old people living <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> and nursing home residents. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in Gilan, north of Iran, 2014 to 2015. Participants in this study were collected using convenience sampling method and composed of 108 individuals (equal numbers of elderly living <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> and nursing home residents). Data were collected using three questionnaires including SF- 12 Quality of Life, Voux Social Support Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA. (Finding: Results of the present study revealed that elderly living <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> had better quality of life (F= 288. 358, p< 0. 01), higher social support (F= 185. 589, p< 0. 01) and lower Depression (X= 302. 266, p< 0. 001) in comparison to elderly residing in nursing home. Conclusion: According to the results of the current study, it is better to accommodate elderly <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> till last day of their life. This is due to the fact that old people are more dynamic <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> would be able to take care of children, maintaine their relationships and receive support from family members...|$|R

25|$|Hospice {{care is a}} type of {{care and}} {{philosophy}} of care that focuses on the palliation of a chronically ill, terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional and spiritual needs. In Western society, the concept of hospice has been evolving in Europe since the 11th century. Then, and for centuries thereafter in Roman Catholic tradition, hospices were places of hospitality for the sick, wounded, or dying, as well as those for travelers and pilgrims. The modern concept of hospice includes palliative care for the incurably ill given in such institutions as hospitals or nursing homes, but also care provided to those who would rather spend their last months and days of life <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>homes.</b> The first modern hospice care was created by Cicely Saunders in 1967.|$|E

The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) {{who are unable to}} manage their conditions without assistance.|$|E

25|$|Burmese folk {{religion}} and Buddhism are very {{closely tied to}} each other. Oftentimes {{it is common to}} see a Buddhist offering, and a nat-sin (or nat shrine) besides it. In Burma there are varying degrees of reliance on nats versus Buddhist doctrine. The beliefs and practices of folk faith vary widely across Burma, so it is difficult to define this religion exactly. Several scholars in the 19th and 20th century have done field research in villages in Burma, their findings have then been reported by themselves, as well as recently by others in various books and articles. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} what the precise beliefs and practices are, these anthropologists found several common trends that help give us a better picture of Burmese folk religion. In many instances folk faith was practised directly alongside Buddhism. It wasn’t uncommon to see families who had both Buddhist shrines and nat shrines <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>homes.</b> There were also plenty of Buddhist monks, who simultaneously believed in the nats. Several quotes from various scholars in Burma exemplify the relationship between Buddhism and nat worship.|$|E
25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>homes,</b> but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E
