40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years, {{on all the}} French {{territory}} and more specifically in the Alps area, net-fences {{have been set up}} to protect roads, railroads or houses against rock falls. If these works often fulfil correctly their functions, various levels of disorder are observed after rock impacts. Raised pathologies prove to have several different kinds of origin that can act in independent or combined ways. The disorders strictly link to the impact of the blocks (<b>functional</b> <b>request),</b> and with a satisfying operation of the work, will be often proportional to the energy level of the blocks impacting the fence. The pathology level will be related to the adequacy between the risk level and the parade. Maintenance or repairs to be realized on the protection will require a precise diagnosis. Some other disorders, which we can be consider as non-normal, result from an environmental impact which can affect the geometry or the structure of the protection as well as its constitutive materials. In other rather frequent cases, the quality of the implementation on site, and the assembly of the different components, can be responsible. In all these cases, the role of prevention and control become dominating. All the observations, carried out by the CETE of Lyon* during several decades and in agreement with the project of European Technical Approval for these works, have resulted in setting up particular rules and procedures to ensure the durability of the protections...|$|E
40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are spontaneously formed out of {{a number}} of mobile devices that communicate thanks to short-range wireless communication capabilities (e. g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). In many ad hoc networks deployed in real conditions, mobile nodes can exhibit highly dynamic behaviors of mobility and volatility. Because of their behavior, the devices in such network environments form so-called "islands" whose topology evolves continuously, rather than a single fully connected network. In this work, I focus on this class of MANETs which I refer to as disconnected MANETs. Network-wide communication in disconnected MANETs is still a challenge, namely because routing techniques designed for fully connected MANETs cannot be applied. The store-carry-and-forward approach provides a solution. With this approach, a message can be stored temporarily on a node, in order to be forwarded later when circumstances permit. Mobility then becomes an advantage as it facilitates message propagation. Messages are therefore forwarded from one network node to another when these nodes have the opportunity to meet. The service-oriented computing (SOC) model seems suited for ad hoc environments because it emphasizes the decoupled nature of its entities. Effectively, the decoupling between a client entity and a provider entity becomes essential in mobile environments with a fluctuating availability of providers, and where end-to-end communications are not guaranteed. Still, in existing service-oriented systems, providers are usually supposed to be always available (e. g. Web services). Providers are also assumed to be continuously reachable in wireless mobile environments, where local connected networks can be created using Wi-Fi hotspots, or by creating ad hoc networks using proximity one-hop or routed multi-hop protocols. Therefore, implementing distributed services for such networks still poses several challenges. Not only network-wide communication features must be provided, in spite of constant network fragmentation, but aspects such as the unpredictable reachability of the providers, or potential communication delays, {{must be taken into account}} at the service level. I propose a service platform for mobile nodes that supports the execution of service-oriented applications in disconnected MANETs. The service platform is implemented as a middleware composed of two layers: a communication layer, and a service layer. The communication layer provides mechanisms to decouple two service entities in terms of temporaneous interaction, synchronous behavior, and mutual knowledge. For this layer, I use an opportunistic and content-driven protocol (DoDWAN). The service layer provides mechanisms that decouple service providers and clients in terms of interoperability and service contract. For this layer, I propose solutions for service discovery and invocation. The elements that construct the discovery protocol are the description and advertisement at the provider side, and collection and selection at the client side. Description uses functional and non-functional service properties, as well as context properties. Discovery is based on a peer-to-peer architecture, where a client collects only interesting services. Content-based invocations are used to benefit from the service replication, where a multitude of providers can be offering the same business service. A client creates a <b>functional</b> <b>request</b> according to a discovered provider, then publishes its content-based request message to the attention of all compatible providers. After being satisfied, the client can initiate the healing of residual request and response messages from the network. The healing of response messages can also be initiated by the providers themselves according to the reliability of these responses. Using a prototype implementation of the middleware, I conducted simulations in a disconnected MANET environment. The performances of discovery is directly related to those of the underlying communication layer. Simulations confirm the benefits of content-based invocations in providing faster response times and better client satisfaction. Simulations also show the drastic reduction of redundant and leftover messages when applying the healing mechanisms. LORIENT-BU (561212106) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

Besides being safe, children will need an urban environment with reasonable mobility, where they themselves can reach destinations with reasonable effort. This paper presents the results of two expert questionnaires focusing on the potential safety and mobility benefits to child pedestrians of targeted types of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Five different types of <b>functional</b> <b>requests</b> for children were identified based on previous work. The first expert questionnaire was structured to collect expert opinions on which ITS solutions or devices would be, and why, the most relevant ones to satisfy the five different <b>functional</b> <b>requests</b> of child pedestrians. Based on the first questionnaire, fifteen areas of interest (problem areas) were defined. In the second questionnaire, the experts ranked the fifteen areas, and prioritized related ITS services, according to their potential for developing ITS services beneficial to children. Several ITS systems for improving pedestrian quality are discussed. ITS services can be used when a pedestrian route takes them to a dangerous street, dangerous crossing point or through a dangerous neighbourhood. An improvement of safety and other qualities would lead to increased mobility and a more sustainable way of living. Children would learn how to live to support their own health and a sustainable city environment. But it will be up to national, regional and local governments, through their ministries and agencies and public works departments, to promote, fund, and possibly mandate such systems. It is clear that we need to offer an acceptable level of convenience, efficiency, comfort, safety and security to pedestrians but it is less clear if society will prioritize resources towards this...|$|R

The weight of the spongy bone and the compact bone differs from maxilla to mandible and, at the same time, from zone to zone.

It is assumed that on-line control, {{in contrast to the}} test one, is char- acterized by the limited control completeness, but does not require the stopping of computational process. The aim of re- search is to create models that optimize intervals of test control initialization by the criterion of probability maximization for system stay in the ready state to secure fulfillment of the <b>functional</b> <b>requests</b> and minimization of the dangerous system states in view of the uncertainty and intensity variance of the destructive impacts. Variants of testing intervals optimization are con- sidered depending on the intensity of destructive impacts by the criterion of the maximum system availability for the safe execution of queries. Optimization is carried out with and without adaptation to the actual intensity change of destructive impacts. The efficiency of adaptive change for testing periods is shown depending on the observed activity of destructive impacts. The solution of optimization problem is obtained by built-in tools of computer mathematics Mathcad 15, including symbolic mathematics for solution of systems of algebraic equations. The proposed models and methods of determining the optimal testing intervals can find their application in the system design of computer systems and networks of critical applications, working under conditions of destabilizing actions with the increased requirements for their safety...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Aphasia is a {{commonly}} treated language disorder; however there is discrepancy among professionals regarding classification and assessment practices (Code 2 ̆ 6 Petheram, 2011; McNeil 2 ̆ 6 Pratt, 2001). Current research focuses heavily on acute treatment; chronic aphasia is severely under-represented. A {{review of the}} literature revealed a wide array of standardized and non-standardized tests used to evaluate both acute and chronic aphasia cases. Overall, there appears to be variance in evaluation practices, especially among SLPs (Bland et al., 2013). Aims: The present study aims to quantify two variables that may account for this inconsistency in evaluation procedures: 1) years of clinical experience and 2) professional interest. Methods: SLPs with membership to either ASHA Special Interest Group 2 or the ABAI Speech-Pathology Interest Group were contacted to participate in a survey. They were presented with a demographic questionnaire and hypothetical vignettes detailing chronic aphasia cases. The data was collected through SurveyMonkey and exported to R for statistical analysis. Months of clinical experience were subsequently correlated to specific survey responses measuring the following variables: decision to reassess, decision of what clinical constructs to address, selection of assessments, and opinion regarding generalization of naming to <b>functional</b> <b>requesting</b> behavior. Results: Due to lack of participation, the professional interest variable was eliminated. A Spearman Rho test revealed statistical significance for 5 variables. The majority of participants supported reassessment, inclusion of functional assessments, and use of confrontational naming to target requesting. Further research is warranted on the subject, including possible development of a valid functional language assessment for chronic aphasia patients.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{integrate}} and synthesize, using meta-analytic methods, the extant research literature on the effectiveness of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) interventions in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. According to recent estimates 25 % to 61 % of individuals with ASD are functionally non-verbal and will not develop gestural or any other non-verbal form of communication without systematic and ongoing AAC intervention. Many AAC approaches for this population lack empirical support and their effectiveness has not been well documented. Thus, the aim of this meta-analysis was to carefully examine experimental research literature and to review the existing evidence. ^ A comprehensive literature search for research studies, which included data on the effects of AAC, was conducted using a combination of electronic and hand searches. Retrieved intervention studies ranged from 1976 to April 2006 and included published articles and book chapters in addition to unpublished doctoral theses. Inclusion criteria were applied to 325 documents obtained from the search to ensure the methodological soundness of experiments included in this review. This resulted in the identification of 44 single-subject research studies and one group study that met inclusion criteria. Intervention outcomes were evaluated by using the Percentage of Non-overlapping Data (PND) for single-subject research designs and appropriate effect size indices for group designs. Sufficient data were found for inferential analyses of outcomes related to (a) effects of providing speech output via speech-generating devices, (b) teaching <b>functional</b> <b>requesting</b> skills, and (c) effects of AAC on natural speech production. Other intervention outcomes with limited data support were reported descriptively. Limitations of the current literature were another major finding as they precluded further in-depth analysis of study outcomes. Theses shortcomings concerned the small number of participants in the studies, the wide variety in participant characteristics and descriptions, the heterogeneity in AAC interventions, the range of outcome measures used, and methodological weaknesses. Based on these findings gaps in the existing research literature were revealed and directions for future research were derived. ...|$|R
40|$|The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is an augmentative and {{alternative}} communication program (Frost & Bondy, 2002). Although PECS has been effectively {{used to teach}} <b>functional</b> <b>requesting</b> skills for children with autism, mental retardation, visual impairment, and physical disabilities (e. g., Anderson, Moore, & Bourne, 2007; Chambers & Rehfeldt, 2003), there are limited studies examining the effectiveness of PECS to teach requesting skills for children with multiple disabilities including visual impairment (Lund & Troha, 2008). This study explored the effectiveness of combining tangible symbols and other adaptations with PECS to teach requesting skills to students with multiple disabilities. Specifically, the participants were four students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment who also had many challenges in communication skills. The research design was the multiple probe design across subjects, a variation of a multiple baseline design. A notable benefit to this design {{is that there was}} no need to collect continuous recordings of baseline measures, because a strong a priori assumption of stability and the possibility of causing strong participant reactions existed before introducing the intervention. Instead, the researcher made periodic recordings of baseline levels to insure no significant changes have occurred before introducing the intervention. The study included four parts: (a) the assessment of reinforcers, (b) baseline, (c) the implementation of the intervention, which was teaching the three PECS phases and conducting generalization sessions, and (d) the maintenance condition. Three important research questions were posed: 1. 	Can students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment learn to make requests for preferred items using adapted PECS materials and procedures? 2. 	Can students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment generalize requesting skills for preferred items using adapted PECS from training rooms to classrooms? 3. 	Can students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment maintain requesting skills after training?The results indicated that all four participants learned requesting skills using adapted PECS, generalized the newly acquired skills to their classrooms, and maintained the requesting skills after training. Results of this study provided preliminary evidence that PECS with adaptations could be used effectively to teach requesting skills for students with multiple disabilities including visual impairment...|$|R

40|$|Background Patients with {{functional}} {{neurological disorders}} often report adverse physical events {{close to the}} onset of functional symptoms. However, the mechanism via which a triggering event may set off a functional condition is lacking. One possibility is that patients make abnormal inferences about novel information provided by physical triggering events. In this study, the authors aimed to specifically investigate whether patients with functional movement disorders have abnormalities in probabilistic reasoning. Methods The authors used a well-studied probabilistic reasoning paradigm, ‘the bead task’, in 18 patients with functional movement disorders and 18 healthy agematched controls. The authors assessed the number of beads that participants needed to reach a decision {{and changes in the}} certainty of their decisions when confronted with confirmatory or contradictory evidence. Findings Patients with <b>functional</b> movement disorders <b>requested</b> on average significantly fewer beads before reaching a decision than controls (3 vs 6 beads). When confronted with potentially disconfirmatory evidence, patients showed a significantly greater reduction in confidence in their estimates than controls. 40 % of patients reached a decision after one or two beads whereas no controls showed this bias. Interpretation Patients with <b>functional</b> movement disorders <b>requested</b> less information to form a decision and were more likely to change their probability estimates in the direction suggested by the new evidence.

40|$|The Nursing Service, {{in order}} to ensure the {{delivery}} of high quality care and advanced clinical research, the appropriate nursing sector organisation and adequate human resources, demands a large number of information related to nursing personnel and patient needs. Thus, the key for effective administration and management of the Nursing Service of a Hospital, is the availability of reliable, valid, and qualitative information. This fact predicates the appliance of Nursing Information Systems, and makes indisputable their superiority against the manual procedure. However, this valuable information, is disposed to the Nursing Service without any kind of categorization or computerization.

The evaluation of that system is following, depended on the demands that all the Information Systems developed for that area must fulfill. The method of the Life Cycle Model was decided as the most appropriate {{for the development of the}} proposed Information System. According to this method, all the necessary information and data requirements are firstly defined and clarified by the user. In the next phase, a detailed analysis of the current manual system was carried out, which included its entire peculiarities and functional problems. In the next phase the proposed system was designed. The <b>functional</b> <b>requests,</b> the imported and exported from the Nursing Service data, and the User Interface was designed. The electronic dialog between the system and the user was given special emphasis, {{in order to}} ensure the friendliness’ requirements. Finally, a detailed description of the database been used by the system was included, in accordance with the entity-relationship diagrams that describe it, and the documentation of its files. Furthermore, the system’s design phase, dealt with the requirements related to the precision of the included data, their security, transference, availability and the maintenance confinements, {{in order to ensure}} its regular operation. The new system was codified using the relational database software package Personal Oracle for windows. This tool was the most appropriate because it can be used with the most popular computer operating system the Microsoft Windows, providing the same functionality with other relational database development tools designed for larger platforms. All the data related to the structure of the hospital, the nursing record, the shifts, the holidays, the days off and the nursing educational programs are stored in the system’s database. The Information System accomplishes the process and the categorization of these data in a quick and easy way, and in the same time it conducts their permanent storage in separate backup files for their future retrieval. Also, by using these data, it can produce detailed reports, offering a detailed picture of the current status of the hospital to the management. It is worth mentioning that the operation and maintenance of the system are not objectives of this thesis. However, useful information and methods for their successful achievement, are proposed. Finally, the testing, the approval and the evaluation of the Information System are carried out, by a survey among the students of the Nursing Department of the University of Athens and the Nursing personnel of different Hospitals. Useful conclusions have been inferred concerning its future readjustments and improvements, and also concerning the general perception of the nursing personnel towards the Nursing Information Systems. ...|$|R

Two main challenges for Web services are the aggregation of services into new (complex) business applications, and the adaptation of services presenting various types of interaction mismatches. The ultimate objective of this thesis is to define a methodology for the semi-automated aggregation and adaptation of Web services capable of suitably overcoming semantic and behaviour mismatches in view of business process integration within and across organisational boundaries. We tackle the aggregation and adaptation of services described by service contracts, which consist of signature (WSDL), ontology information (OWL), and behaviour specification (YAWL). We first describe an aggregation technique that automatically generates contracts of composite services satisfying (behavioural) client requests from a registry of service contracts. Further on, we present a behaviour-aware adaptation technique that supports the customisation of services to fulfil client requests. The adaptation technique can be used to adapt the behaviour of services to satisfy both <b>functional</b> and behavioural <b>requests.</b> In order to support the generation of service contracts from real-world service descriptions, we also introduce a pattern-based compositional translator for the automated generation of YAWL workflows from BPEL business processes. In this way, we pave the way for the formal analysis, aggregation, and adaptation of BPEL processes...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Web {{services}} are interface elements which allow applications to render <b>functional</b> services to <b>requesting</b> clients using open standard protocols. A lecture method combines both social association and urban processing as course design and delivery is termed as Interface Learning. Many Interface learning services is presenting through online. To make an online tutoring scheme more effective, the previous study used web services and application programs like instant messaging based on {{environments in which}} students reside. But {{the downside is that}} it is difficult to maintain the service request queues online. The services and data storage processes are inefficient. Approach: To overcome all the above issues, a Learning Software Component Model (LSCM) framework is formed in the present study to build a component model based on communication services available on the network. In addition to this, the proposed software component modeled with Learning Object (LO) aspects integrates the related sub hierarchical components with the main component object framework. Based on LSCM, training schedules are identified efficiently. Results: The proposed LSCM framework is experimented to show the performance improvement with the previous online tutoring scheme based on web services in terms of delivery report, maintenance of tutoring sessions and reliability. Conclusion: Compared to an existing online tutoring through web services, the proposed LSCM framework performance is 75 % better in providing learning services to the providers...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{comparative}} efficacy {{study was to investigate}} the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and a speech-generating device (SGD) in developing requesting skills, social-communicative behavior, and speech for three elementary-age children with severe autism and little to no <b>functional</b> speech. <b>Requesting</b> was selected as the primary measure while social-communicative behavior (eye contact, smiling, and physical proximity) and speech were selected as ancillary measures. A multiple baseline design (Baer, Wolf, 2 ̆ 6 Risley, 1968) was combined with an alternating treatment design (Barlow 2 ̆ 6 Hayes, 1979) to evaluate the treatment effects across participants and between modalities for each condition. A 3 -stage preference assessment was conducted to systematically identify food reinforcers prior to treatment. Training conditions for both treatment modalities included the implementation of PECS phase 1 (how to communicate), phase 2 (distance and persistence), and phase 3 (picture discrimination). PECS followed the traditional protocol as outlined by Bondy and Frost (1994) and the ProxTalker, a device developed to closely follow the principles of PECS, used a modified PECS protocol. ^ Results demonstrated increases in requesting behavior for all participants across conditions and treatment modalities, however, difficulties were evident with picture discrimination. Statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences between PECS and the SGD for any participant. Results for social-communicative behavior were mixed although an increasing trend was present in phase 2 for all participants and treatment modalities. However, no significant differences between modalities were found. Data for speech outcomes did not reveal any increases across participants and no statistical differences between treatment modalities were found. ^ Findings suggest PECS and the ProxTalker device are equally appropriate for developing initial requesting skills. Results on social-communicative behavior are inconclusive however; data patterns suggest phase 2 is conducive to encouraging social-communicative behavior. The lack of speech emergence supports previous research. Based on the current findings, successful implementation of either modality is achievable when appropriate teaching strategies are used. Further research is needed to address difficulties in picture discrimination, mixed results in social-communicative behavior, and the non-emergence of speech. Non-significant differences between modalities suggest the behavioral principles inherit in the PECS protocol are responsible for the findings in this study; therefore, future research directions are provided. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} instruments that claim to detect submaximal capacity when maximal capacity is requested in patients with chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain. Summary of Background Data. Several instruments {{have been developed to}} measure capacity in patients with chronic pain. The detection of submaximal capacity can have major implications for patients. The validity of these instruments has never been systematically reviewed. Methods. A systematic literature search was performed including the following databases: Web of Knowledge (including PubMed and Cinahl), Scopus, and Cochrane. Two reviewers independently selected the articles based on the title and abstract according to the study selection criteria. Studies were included when they contained original data and when they objectified submaximal physical or functional capacity when maximal physical or <b>functional</b> capacity was <b>requested.</b> Two authors independently extracted data and rated the quality of the articles. The included studies were scored according to the subscales “Criterion Validity” and “Hypothesis Testing” of the COSMIN checklist. A Best Evidence Synthesis was performed. Results. Seven studies were included, 5 of which used a reference standard for submaximal capacity. Three studies were of good methodological quality and validly detected submaximal capacity with specificity rates between 75 % and 100 %. Conclusion. There is strong evidence that submaximal capacity can be detected in patients with chronic low back pain with a lumbar motion monitor or visual observations accompanying a functional capacity evaluation lifting test...|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{position}} as {{the main source of}} national income, the tourism and hospitality service industry in Thailand is now highlighted as an area to watch in terms of its value for continued national economic growth. Chiang Rai Rajabhat University (CRU) a university in the tourist area in the North of Thailand, {{plays a key role in}} hospitality service education and has a significant influence in the sector because it produces graduates for service in the workforce of this industry. Given the industry's competitive climate, decisions to increase the number of workers, or practitioners, need to take into account the quality of the workers. In this time of globalization, when English is used widely, particularly in the intercultural context ofhospitality service businesses, the quality of English must be seriously considered. Business English (BE) graduates, as prospective employees, need to be highly competent in English language skills. This demand for effective English users in hospitality service workplaces means that there is a need to give serious consideration to the ability of Thai graduates to become competent users of English in real workplaces, and to develop an understanding of how they may achieve the high level of competence required of them. This study investigates the English language skills Thai students used in intercultural communication in hospitality service workplaces. The aim was to determine what essential language skills were used, to explore how these skills were implemented while giving services to international tourists, and to use the results to reflect on English for Hospitality Services (EHS) study in order to provide some recommendations for teaching and learning in those courses. The project was designed as an ethnographic case study. Multiple research tools were used, but particularly participatory observations of student workplace interactions, and semi-structured interviews that included interviews with workplace staff, such as managers, heads of departments, business owners and on-site supervisors. There were additional sources of information used, including students' diaries and other documents relevant to internship. The data collected were then examined using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The participants were 15 volunteers and were fourth-year students in the Business English (BE) program at CRU. The case study involved an examination of data collected from ten workplaces in four hospitality service areas. The observation transcriptions were quantitatively scrutinized for the most essential functional language units used in the hospitality services. The significant findings indicate that the <b>functional</b> language of <b>requests</b> and responding to requests was the most frequently used unit in this hospitality services area. This result confirms previous studies that have found that the <b>functional</b> language of <b>requests,</b> including responding to requests, is the most essential functional pattern in hospitality services. Thanking, offering help/services, and refusing are counted as the second, third and fourth essential units used. However, apologizing and responding to complaints, which are generally considered important in the service area, were very much less frequently used in this study. There was no evidence that significant breakdown or major problems in communication occurred during hospitality service procedures examined; however, the findings suggest that the language proficiency of Thai students was very low in terms of language accuracy. From the results of the study, it is recommended that those responsible for EHS teaching and learning give serious consideration to increasing the level ofcommunicative competence of Thai BE students in terms of English language skills, and to improving the cultural awareness of graduates who expect to be involved in intercultural communication in the hospitality services industry...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden {{there are}} 34 schools that offers {{agricultural}} education at highschool level. Most {{of these schools}} have a farm with animal production. The main objective of this Masters Thesis is to penetrate questions associated with the design of animal buildings at farming schools. It is done as a case study. The initiative was taken by teachers at the Uddetorp school. The goal is to propose a layout plan for a piggery at Uddetorp Estate. Other objectives are to: - identify the interested party, persons and groups that have opinions about the piggery, - identify the goals that the piggery will be a mean to achieve, - to point out target groups for the piggery, - to describe the activities for these target groups, - to document experiences from other farming schools, - to specify the functional demands that different activities pose, - to sketch a proposition for a piggery at Uddetorp. The work is mainly based upon interviews and visits since literature on this subject is missing. Altogether I have done 27 interviews with teachers, staff, students, farmers and representatives for different farming organisations and associations. A reference of the interviews are presented in the thesis. The piggery is or could be a mean to reach the following main goals: - Education of students at the school - Recruiting of new students to the school - Public education about modem animal production - Research activities performed by The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), The department of animal health and welfare. - Demonstration for students at SLU The above mentioned goals have been analysed. To {{be able to reach}} these goals functional requirements are posed on the building design. They are proposed by the interested party for the piggery at Uddetorp, and staff and building advisors from other farming schools. Further functional demands are given by the slaughterhouse’s quality program and adjustment to existing buildings. Following <b>functional</b> <b>requests</b> are posed on an animal house for educational purposes: - The most important is to make the students interested in pig production. This pose qualitative demands on a good work environment, a modern production system, an aesthetical design and a well kept stable. - Preventive health care is important in modem animal production. Basic requirements are animal welfare, "all in - all out" production, "transfer room”, and a farm quarantine. - The purpose of the education is to deal with the complete life cycle of the sow and pig. This requires an integrated production with own recruitment of gilts. - The production should be high. That enforces the reliability of the education. - The production system should be easy to understand. - The work demand should be evenly divided between and during the weeks. No students should have to work during a week with no special "events”. That would be both boring and less educating. The students are assumed to work for periods of one week each time. - The housing system should be common. Feeding and manure systems should be easy to understand and handle. - Inside the piggery a group of students should be able to simultaneously both hear and see, animals and teachers. - The teachers should easily be able to overlook the entire building. - The farm work should be able to divide for two students with equal responsibility. Public guiding (public education and student recruitment) through the piggery requests: - The piggery should look like a normal production unit - The entire cycle of production should be on display all the time, e. g. always having suckling pigs. - The building should have a representative entrance hall. 15 people should have space enough to put on protecting clothes. To make it possible for scientists from SLU to run experiments, the requirements are: - A research section that does not border to sections with other animals. - The animal records should be in order - The number of sows should not be less than 60 Further education offered for farmers and farm workers, primarily use teachers and classrooms. The stable should be well kept. To achieve this requires: - A rational management, e g automatic feeding procedures - The stable should be easy to keep tidy and on a high sanitary level Finally a design for a piggery at Uddetorp Estate is proposed, see appendix 5, 6 and 7. All parts for pig production away from finishing pigs are housed in a new building attached to the old sowhouse. A smaller classroom, service-, research- and studentareas are localised to half of the existing sowhouse. The other half is not used. The total number of sows is 112. In the planning concept it is stated that an "all in - all out” production should be used at Uddetorp. With each group consisting of 16 sows one of the existing sections for finishing pigs could be filled with growing pigs from one group. Only 2 of 5 groups of finishing pigs are raised at Uddetorp, the rest are sold as growing pigs. A farrowing interval of 22 weeks is recommended, 5 weeks suckling time. (The Animal Welfare Act requires at least 4 weeks suckling time). A group interval of 3 weeks is recommended (one group of sows farrow every third week). In this way; weeks with no special events are avoided, sows that repeat their heat are easily incorporated with the following group and there always will be suckling pigs in the piggery. The housing system is based on special pens and rooms for growing pigs. A new tank for slurry is proposed since most pens have slatted floor. The slurry from the finishing pigs should also be stored in the new tank. The pregnant sows are kept on a deep straw bedding. The manure is stored on the existing storage area. To lower the risk for contagious diseases to spread from other farms a transfer room and a farm quarantine are built. Windows between different rooms and the corridors facilitates supervisions of the work, guiding and communication. A big entrance hall for 30 people, changing-room for students, classroom, office, pause-room for students etc are placed in what is presently used as sowhouse...|$|R
