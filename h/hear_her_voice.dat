25|$|Barbara Wright first {{appears in}} the first Doctor Who serial, An Unearthly Child (1963), where she is {{teaching}} history at Coal Hill School in London in 1963, working with science teacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell). They are curious about their student Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), who shows an unusually advanced knowledge of science and history, but a rudimentary knowledge of other subjects. In an attempt {{to learn more about}} Susan, Barbara and Ian follow her home to a junkyard, where they <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> coming from {{what appears to be a}} police box. During a confrontation with her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara rushes in to the police box, only to discover that its exterior hides the much larger interior of the TARDIS. After the Doctor reveals to Barbara and Ian that he and Susan are aliens exiled from their own planet, he tells them he cannot risk their revealing information about the TARDIS to their contemporary world, and dematerialises the craft against Susan's protests. At this point in the series the Doctor had no control over where or when it would land, making a return to London in 1963 impossible to co-ordinate. They are transported back in time to 100,000 BCE Earth, where they are captured by a prehistoric tribe seeking the secret of fire. Once they escape back to the TARDIS, their second trip takes them to the planet Skaro, where they encounter the Daleks for the first time. At the end of the first episode of that serial, Barbara becomes separated from her fellow travellers and is threatened by an unseen creature with a metal arm, marking the first appearance of a Dalek.|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Captain Beefheart and the acoustic, one-man blues of Lead Belly and Robert Johnson, {{were among the most}} noteworthy influences. Frusciante cites R singer Brandy as a musical inspiration and admires her voice, calling it “multidimensional” and “inspiring.” In describing her voice and signature sound, he said, “You can't hear [...] with your conscious; you have to <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> with your subconscious.” He also mentioned that Brandy was the “main inspiration” behind the guitar work on Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2006 album, Stadium Arcadium.|$|E
500|$|Genevieve Stuttaford of Publishers Weekly {{called the}} essays in Journey [...] "quietly {{inspirational}} pieces". [...] Anne Whitehouse of The New York Times {{wrote that the}} book would [...] "appeal to readers in search of clear messages with easily digested meanings". Patterson-Rabon stated that the book [...] "sings" [...] like the song from which it got its title. Journey made an emotional impact on Clark, who stated: [...] "The reader can almost <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> through the written words." [...] Paul D. Colford of the Los Angeles Times said that the essays in the book [...] "pass as easily as an evening breeze".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, miss," [...] said she, as Henrietta {{opened the door}} just before her, and Mrs. Frederick Langford, on <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> called out, [...] "O Judith! is that you? I was in hopes you were coming to see me." ...|$|R
500|$|With {{the advent}} of the modern feminist movement, women as {{politically}} dissimilar from each other as Virginia Woolf and Emma Goldman embraced Wollstonecraft's life story. By 1929 Woolf described Wollstonecraft—her writing, arguments, and [...] "experiments in living"—as immortal: [...] "she is alive and active, she argues and experiments, we <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and trace her influence even now among the living". Others, however, continued to decry Wollstonecraft's lifestyle. A biography published in 1932 refers to recent reprints of her works, incorporating new research, and to a [...] "study" [...] in 1911, a play in 1922, and another biography in 1924. Interest in her never completely died, with full-length biographies in 1937 and 1951 ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E
500|$|On 26 May 2012, it was {{reported}} that Cheryl would perform [...] "Call My Name" [...] with live vocals on The Voice UK, following allegedly pre-recorded performances that occurred the previous year on The X Factor UK. It was also reported that The Voice executives always edit the vocals for every artist on the show, and they would [...] "provide some finishing touches to her singing prior to it being broadcast." [...] As the performance began, Cheryl swan-dived onto her backing dancers before they performed a highly ellaborated routine. Following the broadcast, Cheryl received mixed comments from viewers, with a few who accused the singer of lip synching, while others, including pop singers Emma Bunton and will.i.am, praised the performance. In an interview with BBC News, Cheryl addressed the negative comments, and said that [...] "if you think my live vocal sounds so good it must be mimed, I'm happy, I take it as a compliment." [...] She performed the track again on The Graham Norton Show on 8 June 2012, and was also accused of lip synching. Cheryl also performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Capital FM Summertime Ball on 9 June 2012 in front of 80,000 fans at the Wembley Stadium, she was a surprise artist. During the energetic performance, the singer sported an outfit designed by Pam Hogg, and was accompanied by 12 backing dancers. Colette Fahy of the Daily Mail accused Cheryl of lip synching and stated that [...] "it was evident to the crowd that [...] was miming." [...] Cheryl performed [...] "Call My Name" [...] at Stand Up to Cancer. However, the performance was also subject of controversy after technical errors with her microphone occurred, meaning that viewers could only <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> faintly singing along to a musical backing track. Cheryl also performed the track on a T4 special, at The Voice Denmark, and at the 2012 Jingle Bell Ball. [...] "Call My Name" [...] was also performed on Cheryl's debut headlining solo concert tour, named A Million Lights Tour, in October 2012.|$|E
