5000|$|The {{recorders}} {{described by}} Virdung have cylindrical profiles with flat heads, narrow windows and long ramps, ring-like turnings on the feet, {{and a slight}} <b>external</b> <b>flare</b> at the bell (above, far left and middle left). Virdung depicts four recorders together: a [...] "baßcontra" [...] or [...] "bassus" [...] (basset) in F3 with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C4 and a [...] "discantus" [...] (alto) in G4. According to Virdung, the configurations F-C-C-G or F-C-G-G {{should be used for}} four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that the player must blow into the instrument and [...] "learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers." ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{academic}} libraries {{are struggling}} with collections size reaching or exceeding building capacity. Meanwhile, the movement of twenty-first-century libraries calls for user-centered space. The combination of these two factors has challenged libraries to identify ways to eliminate physical collections without losing access to content. The academic libraries in the State of Florida, including the University of Central Florida (UCF), have discussed and developed plans for a shared print repository for several years. For {{the past few years}} a statewide Shared Storage Task Force was convened with representation from the state university libraries, and eventually formed the Florida Academic Repository (FLARE) under the leadership of the University of Florida. In 2012, FLARE received the first large shipment from a participating library, the University of Miami. After a few months of active planning, UCF implemented its project preparing materials to send to FLARE and is poised to be the next library contributing to FLARE. As presented, the UCF FLARE project requires tremendous coordination and collaboration within the multiple units in the Technical Services Division at UCF and with the <b>external</b> <b>FLARE</b> Team in Gainesville. Policies and procedures were developed with guidance from the FLARE Team, and internal workflow was designed to ensure accurate processing. This presentation focused on providing an overview of the FLARE project with a specific focus on the UCF experience in selecting and processing materials...|$|E

These unusual oscillations are analyzed to investigate the excitation mechanism responsible for their initial inwardly directed anti-phase behavior. The transverse oscillations are analyzed by constructing space-time diagrams from cuts made parallel to the projected loop displacements. The displacement time oscillation profiles are background subtracted and fitted with a damped cosine curve that includes a linear change in the period with time. The local magnetic topology of the active region is modeled using potential field source surface extrapolation. It reveals that the loops are anchored in different topological regions with foot point locations identified {{on either side of}} the EUV flare peak emission source. In this context, the oscillation characteristics indicate that the excitation mechanism is closely linked to the local magnetic field topology and the reconnection generated wave dynamics in the active region rather than following an <b>external</b> <b>flare</b> blast wave.

40|$|X-ray flares {{are very}} common {{features}} in GRB light curves, and occur from similar to 100 s up {{to thousands of}} seconds after the burst, when the prompt-to-afterglow transition is taking place. In the context of <b>external</b> shock, X-ray <b>flares</b> can be ascribed to a thick-shell fireball produced by a long-duration central engine activity. The X-ray flare photons are expected {{to interact with the}} forward shock electrons by inverse Compton thus producing high-energy flares that potentially will be detected by GLAST LAT. Such high-energy components could explain the delayed GeV emission detected by EGRET in GRB 940217. Observations with GLAST LAT will give useful information to constrain the origin of X-ray flares...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of bright X-ray flares superimposed on the regular afterglow decay in Swift gamma-ray bursts has triggered theoretical speculations on their origin. We study the temporal properties of flares due to internal dissipation and external shock mechanisms. We first show {{that at least}} a sizable fraction of the flares cannot be related to external shock mechanisms, since <b>external</b> shock <b>flares</b> evolve on much longer time scales than observed. We then study flares from internal dissipation, showing that the temporal properties allow us to distinguish the emission of slow early shells from that of late faster shells. We show that, due to the rapid evolution of the detected flares, it is most likely that the flares are produced by relatively fast shells ejected by the central engine shortly before they are observed. This implies that the central engine must be active for, in some cases, {{as long as one}} day. We finally discuss the constraints and implications that this observation has on the properties and physics of the inner engine, and we elaborate on possible future observational tests on the flare sample to further understand their origin and physics.

40|$|We examine four {{candidate}} {{mechanisms that}} {{could explain the}} high surface temperatures of magnetars. (1) Heat flux from the liquid core heated by ambipolar diffusion. It could sustain the observed surface luminosity L_s≈ 10 ^ 35 erg/s if core heating offsets neutrino cooling at a temperature T_core> 6 × 10 ^ 8 K. This scenario is viable if the core magnetic field exceeds 10 ^ 16 G and the heat-blanketing envelope of the magnetar has a light element composition. We find however that the lifetime of such a hot core should be shorter than the typical observed lifetime of magnetars. (2) Mechanical dissipation in the solid crust. This heating can be quasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic stresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal stresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the crust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent L_s≈ 10 ^ 35 erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario of mechanical deformations triggered by <b>external</b> magnetospheric <b>flares.</b> (3) Ohmic dissipation in the crust, in volume or current sheets. This mechanism is inefficient {{because of the high}} conductivity of the crust. Only extreme magnetic configurations with crustal fields B> 10 ^ 16 G varying on a 100 meter scale could provide L_s≈ 10 ^ 35 erg/s. (4) Bombardment of the stellar surface by particles accelerated in the magnetosphere. This mechanism produces hot spots on magnetars. Observations of transient magnetars show evidence for external heating. Comment: 22 pages, 15 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Based on the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph observations, {{we study}} the {{response}} of a solar sunspot light wall to <b>external</b> disturbances. A <b>flare</b> occurrence near the light wall caused material to erupt from the lower solar atmosphere into the corona. Some material falls back to the solar surface and hits the light bridge (i. e., {{the base of the}} light wall), then sudden brightenings appear at the wall base followed by the rise of wall top, leading to an increase of the wall height. Once the brightness of the wall base fades, the height of the light wall begins to decrease. Five hours later, another nearby flare takes place, and a bright channel is formed that extends from the flare toward the light bridge. Although no obvious material flow along the bright channel is found, some ejected material is conjectured to reach the light bridge. Subsequently, the wall base brightens and the wall height begins to increase again. Once more, when the brightness of the wall base decays, the wall top fluctuates to lower heights. We suggest, based on the observed cases, that the interaction of falling material and ejected flare material with the light wall results in the brightenings of wall base and causes the height of the light wall to increase. Our results reveal that the light wall can be not only powered by the linkage of p-mode from below the photosphere, but may also be enhanced by external disturbances, such as falling material...|$|R
40|$|Smoking flares {{have always}} {{represented}} the visible symbols of pollution escaping from the world's oil and petrochemical industries. Only in recent years, however, has the increasing size of such complexes begun to cause acute environmental problems. During normal operations, these valuable off-gases {{ought to be}} conserved, either by gas liquifaction or by re-injection plants but, in an emergency, flares remain necessities as 'plant safety valves'. Essentially, smokeless flaring is an aerodynamic mixing problem. The large volume air requirement for clean combustion has to be induced into the flame by some kind of high pressure gas or steam entrainment system. A novel method of effecting this mixing, rapidly, is to utilise the 'Coanda Effect'. This is the name given to the tendency of a fluid jet to adhere to an adjacent surface, thereby causing enhanced entrainment, actually up to 25 times the original air inflow into the jet. The object {{of this research was}} to study and thus improve the performance of one design of Coanda, <b>external</b> surface, steam <b>flare,</b> developed and marketed by BP under the trade name Stedair. The investigation of this flare system was conducted in two parts; physical modelling of the entrainment at the flare tip, followed on by confirmatory measurements, on a 76 mm pilot scale, propylene doped, methane-steam flare, A slice (two-dimensional) water model of a Stedair flare tip was constructed, to examine the effectiveness of Coanda surface geometry, as an entrainer and mixer. The neutralisation reaction between solutions of HCl and NaOH was used to imitate the combustion reactions between oxygen and hydrocarbons, the neutralisation being made visible by the use of phenolphalcin as an indicator. Adjustment of the concentrations cuid flows simulates fuel stoichiemetry and excess air requirements, producing a 'flare envelope' corresponding to the 'mixed is burnt criterion. The second phase of the investigation consisted of a series of combustion tests on the largest (76 mm) Stedair steam flare that could b 6 safely operated within a high ceiling (7. 6 m) laboratory. Temperature and CO profiles within the flame were measured on 3 flare heads, with 4 slot widths/head and at 3 steam flows/slot width, the gas flow being kept constant. Smoke Points, Blow-off and Coanda Breakaway Points were also measured at varying gas flows. The Coanda principle is inherently such an excellent entrainment device that combustion on these flare tips is nearly always good, provided that the jet slot width remains uniform. Whilst noise and radiation levels can only be measured on real flares, combustion quality and entrainment rates are best measured on slice water models of such flares. The experimental flare built by the author demonstrated this point very well. The pulsations and oscillations of this turbulent jet, even in the wind-free laboratory environment made obtaining consistent measurements very difficult. A Coanda flare behaves like an enclosed rather than a free jet, thus the similarity criteria developed by Craya and Curtet can be applied and when it is, Jenkins and Coworkers have shown that, water model results do correspond to those measured on real flare trials...|$|R
