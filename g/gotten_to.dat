By rubbing a pencil over the envelope containing the tape case, Mulder finds a phone number which connects him to the Syndicate's office. Mulder speaks to the Well-Manicured Man, who offers to meet with him. The Well-Manicured Man tells Mulder that a UFO was sunk during World War II and that a cover story of a sunken atomic bomb was used to cover up its attempted recovery. He reveals that anyone can be <b>gotten</b> <b>to,</b> causing Mulder to ask Scully to check on Skinner.|$|E

After further review, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop and was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> four wins in any season in his professional career.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E
5|$|While garnering the {{anticipation}} for the album, Big Sean released the mixtape Detroit on September 5, 2012. The mixtape consisted of previously unreleased songs. The mixtape features guest appearances from fellow rappers J.

Production {{was provided by}} Hit-Boy, Da Internz, Lex Luger and Key Wane. Before the album's release, Big Sean released a handful of his inspirational video blogs, which gets in touch on how far he has <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> where he’s at throughout his career and what he plans on doing to further his position in music. Most of his vlogs feature cameo appearances from Kanye West, 2 Chainz, Pusha T, Common, No I.D., Rita Ora, Trey Songz, Wale, Wiz Khalifa, Lupe Fiasco, Teyana Taylor and T-Pain, among others. Starting on February 23, 2013, Sean began a European tour in promotion of the album, which continued until March 13, 2013.

25|$|As bishop, Palafox {{arrived in}} Veracruz on June 24, 1640.

That same ship brought an Irishman, William Lamport, known in New Spain as Don Guillén de Lombardo y Guzmán, who played a role in {{political}} turmoil during the 1640s. Palafox was also named Visitador (royal inspector, representative of the king), to investigate the two previous viceroys.

25|$|This World Series win had {{significance}} for McCarver and Harry Kalas. Both had been Phillies broadcasters in , but neither had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> call that year's World Series. McCarver was a backup commentator for Game of the Week on NBC, {{but he was}} not part of the network's Series announcing team. For Kalas, MLB radio-broadcasting regulations forbade local stations from producing live coverage of World Series games, instead forcing them to air the national CBS Radio feed of the games. Philadelphia fans were so outraged about this afterward that they started a letter-writing campaign to the Commissioner's Office, demanding a change to the rule. The following year, MLB amended its broadcasting contracts to allow World Series teams' flagship radio stations to air the games with local announcers, due at least in part to this outcry from Philadelphia fans. In 2008, both called the Phillies' World Series win.|$|E

25|$|As for the Chargers, the {{implications}} of their defeat were worse in hindsight as this remains as the only Super Bowl the Chargers had ever played in and including the pre AFL-NFL merger, the 3rd championship game the Chargers lost, since they previously won the AFL Championship in 1963. That championship remains to this day as the only major sports championship the city of San Diego has won (and also the longest championship drought for any city that has at least two major sports franchises), so {{even though they were}} heavy underdogs, the loss still had a great significance. The Chargers would also not win another playoff game since then until the 2007 season, when they reached the AFC Championship, but lost to the then 18-0 New England Patriots, 21–12. This remains the closest the Chargers have <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> returning to the Super Bowl as of the 2016 season.
