What Mr. Le Breton really wants is not Egypt, or old wine, or Sir Antony, or anything of the sort, but relief from this pressing load of anxiety and responsibility.

5000|$|I've {{taken this}} time {{to look back at}} where I was and {{realized}} I've broken through a personal barricade, which is why I've named the album 'Breakthrough.' —Caillat explaining the album's title. Breakthrough was defined as an album about growing up, experiencing life, love, making mistakes and learning from them, with particular emphasis on love and making mistakes, with [...] "most of the mistakes Caillat chronicles have to do with matters of the heart", as noted by Plugged In's Adam R. Holz. Caillat stated that she [...] "wanted to make music that people could listen to while driving on a long road trip, while dancing at a party with friends, while laying out at the beach or sitting at their desk at work. I wanted to give people songs that they could fall in love to, lay down & cry to, songs & stories that they can relate to so they feel like they aren't the only ones going through whatever it is they are going through in life. Music is for you to listen to & forget about your worries. These songs can mean whatever you want them to mean, they are now yours." [...] She further elaborated over the album's themes and the inspiration behind it, explaining:"I recently learned something about myself. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> when life gets hard to deal with & keep up with, it becomes easier to give up on & let go of. I found myself doing that a lot & I was slowly falling apart. But...I woke up from it. I realized I wasn't happy settling for less or letting myself become someone I wasn't supposed to be due to laziness. I had to Breakthrough my fears, my insecurities & my self doubt. There are so many battles that we all have to go through in life that are for us to learn from, we grow stronger from them. I just learned this. I want to remind myself & everyone out there that we have to Breakthrough all the little things we tell ourselves we can't do because we are scared, & just step up & do them. This record is about becoming the person you want to be, having will power & letting nothing hold you back. So try not to let great things pass you by, start making things happen that you really want in life!." ...|$|E

40|$|Integrating {{theories}} {{drawn from}} biological, social, and developmental perspectives, Bugental’s program of research tracked the outcomes experienced by children born with medical or physical disorders. At risk children who experienced harsh parenting manifested a low {{ability to cope}} with stress (e. g., they showed cortisol hyper-reactivity and low habituation). In contrast, at risk children who experienced supportive parenting showed adaptive hormonal responses and an exceptional ability to habituate to stress. Children who were not at risk manifested significantly less reactivity to their parenting history. Harsh parenting, in response to at risk children, was found to be moderated by parents ’ perceived powerlessness. A cognitively-based home visitation program yielded reductions in child maltreatment and the enhancement of health among infants born at medical risk. Kurt Lewin was an important influence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> within our early professional lives. There was much appeal to the idea that the individual and the environment in which the individual is embedded operate as an interdependent system. Although we have moved to extend the parameters involved within such systems, the notion of interdependence is one that has been incorporated in many disciplines. Finally, the notion of integrating scientific theory, empirical research, and community action had enormous appeal then and it still does. The “story ” that I will relate here suggests one such integrative effort.
