40|$|<b>Intelligent</b> <b>assistants</b> are {{handling}} increasingly critical tasks, {{but until}} now, end users {{have had no}} way to systematically assess where their assistants make mistakes. For some <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistants,</b> this is a serious problem: if the assistant is doing work that is important, such as assisting with qualitative research or monitoring an elderly parent’s safety, the user may pay a high cost for unnoticed mistakes. This paper addresses the problem with WYSIWYT/ML (What You See Is What You Test for Machine Learning), a human/computer partnership that enables end users to systematically test <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistants.</b> Our empirical evaluation shows that WYSIWYT/ML helped end users find assistants’ mistakes significantly more effectively than ad hoc testing. Not only did it allow users to assess an assistant’s work on an average of 117 predictions in only 10 minutes, it also scaled to a much larger data set, assessing an assistant’s work on 623 out of 1, 448 predictions using only the users’ original 10 minutes’ testing effort...|$|R

40|$|In {{the revised}} {{literature}} {{we have not}} identified any existing approach, which could convert data from semi-structured (websites) or unstructured web sources to the RDF form and consequently integrate into a Linked Data cloud. Therefore, our motivation and objective was to develop <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> for extracting semi-structured web data. This <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> should automatically identify and select part of web data, some of those web data should be selected by business user without any technical skills and we have automatically prepared wrapper for extracting these web data. We implemented the prototype, which automatically identifies main search form, repeated results with specific algorithms on the website, identifies data inside these results and their details data. It also allows additional selecting data and automatically propose name of those data. With <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> we can also export data to the RDF form. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> allows us extracting data from very dynamic websites (websites with many lines of JavaScript and AJAX code), where similar approaches have many issues. We have evaluated the functioning of <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> {{in such a way}} that we tried to extract web data from many different websites. As different websites we consider very dynamic, static and secured against extracting websites, etc. We have found out that our approach has advantages over others in extracting web data from very dynamic websites and it allows explicit conversion of web data in the forth or fifth level on five star Linked Data ranking, where others in most cases convert web data in third level only. Besides that it allows automatic identification of repeated results on website with specific algorithm, which is one of the features of our approach and most of others do not offer this option...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAfter {{the success}} and {{rejection}} of the first expert systems, we {{are now on the}} road to designing and developing real <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> systems, i. e. intelligent systems that use context explicitly. Such systems are called context-based <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> systems. With the accumulated experience gained from large projects (in our cases two 6 -year applications), it is possible to learn from our past failures and the solutions adopted to fill the gaps. First, we developed a successful expert system for a French power company. However, its use in different locations was too strongly constrained by contextual cues. For solving these problems, we concluded that an intelligent system must have a configuration module and a simulation module in addition to the module developed for the main task (e. g. diagnosis or incident management). From a second application for a subway company in Paris (France), we first validate the initial hypothesis about the need of configuration and simulation modules, and then point out the absolute need to make context explicit. This constituted the input for the context-based <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> system paradigm and its related representation as contextual graphs. In this paper we present the lessons learned from our two applications as well as the main characteristics of context-based <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistant</b> systems with an emphasis on the need to make context explicit. We point out the role of incremental knowledge acquisition, learning and explanation in such context-based systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistants</b> has largely {{benefited from the}} adoption of decision-theoretic (DT) approaches that enable an agent to reason and account for the uncertain nature of user behaviour in a complex software domain. At the same time, most <b>intelligent</b> <b>assistants</b> fail to consider the numerous factors relevant from a human-computer interaction perspective. While DT approaches offer a sound foundation for designing intelligent agents, these systems need to be equipped with an interaction cost model in order to reason the impact of how (static or adaptive) interaction is perceived by different users. In a DT framework, we formalize four common interaction factors — information processing, savings, visual occlusion, and bloat. We empirically derive models for bloat and occlusion {{based on the results}} of two users experiments. These factors are incorporated in a simulated help assistant where decisions are modeled as a Markov decision process.
