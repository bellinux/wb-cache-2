40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{facility for}} testing combined cooling/heating and power (CHP) or more currently {{referred to as}} Integrated Energy Systems (IES) has been commissioned at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The scope of the facility is to test distributed generation (DG) with thermally-activated (TA) technologies for waste heat recovery. The designation of the IES Laboratory Facility as a “National User Facility ” provides industry with greater access and control to various IES testing that can be conducted at the laboratory. The IES laboratory test facility is concluding the testing of a 30 kW microturbine generator (MTG) with a first generation heat recovery unit (HRU), direct and indirect-fired desiccant dehumidification systems and an indirect-fired 10 -ton single-effect absorption chiller. The MTG has been operated individually to obtain its baseline performance characteristics {{as well as in}} combination with various waste heat recovery configurations to test an MTG-based IES. The dynamic and steady-state electrical, thermal, and emissions performance of the MTG has been measured over the power output range of 3 to 30 kW as well as during startup and shutdown. The heat recovery process has been found to reduce the energy efficiency and power output of the MTG slightly due to the increased backpressure on the MTG’s exhaust. However, the overall MTG-based IES system produces a 35 - 60 % efficiency vs. the ~ 23 % efficiency of the individual MTG. A number of key results have been produced by the laboratory and are leading to <b>IES</b> <b>recommendations.</b> Also, performance issues related to the MTG have been identified and are being addressed...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to improve on}} the quality of psychological research focus on good practices required for statistical significance testing. The scrutiny of theoretical reasoning, though superordinate, is largely neglected, as exemplified here in a common misunderstanding of mediation analysis. Although a test of a mediation model X -> Z -> Y is conditional on the premise that the model applies, alternative mediators Z′, Z″, Z‴ etc. remain untested, and other causal models could underlie the correlation between X, Y, Z, researchers infer from a single significant mediation test that they have identified the true mediator. A literature search of all mediation analyses published in 2015 in Sciencedirect shows {{that the vast majority of}} studies neither consider alternative causal models nor alternative mediator candidates. Ignoring that mediation analysis is conditional on the truth of the focal mediation model, they pretend to have demonstrated that Z mediates the influence of X on <b>Y.</b> <b>Recommendations</b> are provided for how to overcome this dissatisfying state of affairs...|$|R

40|$|To resist {{environmental}} infection pressure, {{a newborn}} calf must {{build up a}} good passive immunity in its fi rst 24 h of life by absorbing a suffi cient amount of immunoglobulin from colostrum. Considerable economic losses are incurred by the beef industry each year due to high calf mortality and morbidity. To counteract high feeding costs, feeding is restricted during the suckler cows's dry period. However, an overlay aggressive restriction can weaken {{the quality of the}} dam s colostrum and lower calves' vital serum IgG (S-IgG) concentration. Our goal was to determine the effect of pre-partum feed restriction on suckler cow colostrum quality, live weight and condition. Live weight gain of calves and their S-IgG concentrations were also monitored. We studied 32 Hereford-crossed dam-calf pairs. The dams were fed 90 days prior to partum with wilted silage according to feeding <b>recommendations</b> (<b>Y)</b> or 75 % of recommended feeding levels (A). A-dams tended to have lower condition score at calving than Y-dams (p< 0. 10) while feeding had no effect on colostrum IgG concentration. A-calves had approximately 4 g/l less S-IgG than Y-calves (p< 0. 01). In conclusion, although A-dams had lower condition scores and live weight than Y-dams, colostrum quality remained unaffected. The slightly lower S-IgG concentration of calves of restricted-feed dams may, however, be a risk factor on problem farms. v 2004 o...|$|R

40|$|The Amateur Swimming Association (ASA), {{along with}} a number of partner organisations, has been {{implementing}} a health intervention in the region of the City of Kingston upon Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire. This report represents a summary of evaluation carried out upon this scheme during its first year. Descriptive statistics of the groups with whom evaluation research has taken place are presented. A number of issues begin to emerge from these; the predominance of British women in all groups, the short distances travelled on average by the groups to leisure centres and the prevalence of swimming as a favoured leisure time activity among several groups. These statistics also allude to the differences found between swimming and non-swimming groups, which are discussed below. Analysis of the timescales taken to implement activities with each of these groups was undertaken. This highlights a number of issues, including; a) the longer timescales required in building completely new partnerships compared with existing ones, b) that the level of ‘buy-in’ among partner organisations can have a large effect on the timescales taken to implement services and c) that a number of developments had to be held back early in the scheme as needs assessments were completed. The location of Swim for Health activities to date was examined. This (examination) demonstrated the geographical centrality of current services, which are largely centred on the City of Hull. This was ascribed to several reasons: a) the utilisation of existing service provision (e. g. GP referrals), which led to specific sessions in Hull, but more general actions across the East Riding, b) the relative ease of access to certain centres for Swim for Health staff compared with others and c) the level of ‘buy-in’ and support of centre managers, which tended to be high in many centres in the City of Hull. Analysis of the processes inherent {{in the development of the}} scheme was undertaken. The ‘Programme theory’ of January 2006 was re-appraised in light of the ‘Project Brief’ produced in July 2006. A number of developments are noted, for example the introduction of a fourth gateway group. Impact theory, Service Utilisation plan and the Logic Model produced in the ‘Programme theory’ are re-appraised and the scheme’s developments situated within each. Groups with whom work was discontinued are included. These analyses highlight how work in several areas has progressed well (e. g. GP referral Hull, Surestart), while in others there remains much to be done (Employees). The methods used to formulate goals are described. Goals were defined by stating a target percentage of a specific group’s population that could access a certain session. Appraisal of objectives in the Project Brief of July 2006 was completed. Comments were made regarding each. Again, this analysis highlights how work is at an advanced stage for several gateway groups (e. g. People with a range of health needs), whereas with others it is lagging behind (e. g. people in full time employment). Comments are made regarding the need to make goals more specific, defensible and measurable. In addition, the need to make one group in particular more distinct (people aged 50 +) is noted in order to make accurate assessment. Potential weaknesses in the intervention are also posited, including the need for adequate staff training courses and the difficulty of engaging with employing organisations. A number of ‘lessons learned’ from the project are noted in brief. These include reasons for; a) the variable level of uptake and knowledge of the scheme among staff in partner organisations, b) the large proportion of women involved in the scheme (attributed to both the large number of ‘aqua aerobic’ type sessions introduced and the demographics of the groups currently contacted to date), c) the need to bridge the wide disparities in attitudes between current participants and non-participants in order to encourage ‘new’ participants and d) how a number of environmental and social barriers have been tackled in the scheme (self-consciousness and self-monitoring, time constraints and cost). A number of future plans are also outlined in brief. Developments are outlined for each gateway group in turn. Again, this highlights how work is at an advanced stage for some groups, whereas for others it remains at an early stage. Also, the potential for involvement in groups not already within the project’s remit are noted (e. g. school taster sessions for Y 10 and <b>Y</b> 11 students). <b>Recommendations</b> and conclusions are also drawn from the report. The need to produce more measurable goals is noted, as is the need to work in a wider geographical area. The need to allow adequate allocation of time for developments to occur is also made clear, as is the need to factor in the ‘lag’ between session implementation and increasing participation. This must be considered if the impact of the scheme is to be accurately assessed. Caution is also advised about future expansion from the project remit. Expansion could well detract from the level of impact on existing target groups should resources be redirected. The degree to which the project depends upon partner organisations and their staff is also noted, as is the level of power held by individual centre managers in directing the amount and type of activities in a locality. The need to share best practice across the region and enlist the support of these staff is paramount. This is linked to the greatest challenge faced by the scheme; that of changing perceptions of aquatic activity in both staff and participants...|$|R
