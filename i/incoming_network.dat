50|$|The {{asymptotic}} throughput (less formal asymptotic bandwidth) for a packet-mode {{communication network}} {{is the value}} of the maximum throughput function, when the <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> load approaches infinity, either due to a message size as it approaches infinity, or the number of data sources is very large. As other bit rates and data bandwidths, the asymptotic throughput is measured in bits per second (bit/s), very seldom bytes per second (B/s), where 1 B/s is 8 bit/s. Decimal prefixes are used, meaning that 1 Mbit/s is 1000000 bit/s.|$|E
50|$|Polling is an {{alternative}} to interrupt-based processing. The kernel can periodically check {{for the arrival of}} <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> packets without being interrupted, which eliminates the overhead of interrupt processing. Establishing an optimal polling frequency is important, however. Too frequent polling wastes CPU resources by repeatedly checking for incoming packets that have not yet arrived. On the other hand, polling too infrequently introduces latency by reducing system reactivity to incoming packets, and it may result in the loss of packets if the incoming packet buffer fills up before being processed.|$|E

50|$|Before {{satellites}} {{were widely}} used in U.S. broadcast television, network affiliates in many smaller markets had to arrange their own network connections. KELP-TV leased mountain tops between Phoenix and El Paso to create these relays. It picked up Phoenix ABC affiliate KTVK (now an independent station) and the network's Tucson affiliate KGUN-TV off-air, and fed them over several microwave relay towers, which landed back at the mountain top transmitter of KELP-TV. For a time, this required the transmitter operator at the site to switch between the studio feed {{and that of the}} <b>incoming</b> <b>network</b> feed. Later, the station added a backhaul link to allow the network feed to be transmitted directly to the studios, allowing the studio operator to preview network shows before broadcasting them on the station.|$|E

It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of [...] "good" [...] traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Some IDS have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system.|$|E

Our method associates origin information with each process in the system process table, and enhances the audit information by logging the origin and destination of network sockets.

Furthermore, given the size of the anomalies, it is theoretically possible that data such as email addresses, the server salt, and the salted password hashes were copied from the LastPass database. To address the situation, LastPass decommissioned the [...] "breached" [...] servers so they could be rebuilt, and on May 4, 2011, they requested all users to change their master password. However, the resulting user traffic overwhelmed the login servers and, temporarily, administrators were asking users to refrain from changing their passwords until further notice, having judged that the possibility of the passwords themselves being compromised was trivially small.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new dynamic {{adaptive}} virtual network resource allocation strategy named Adaptive-VNE {{to deal with}} the complexity and the inefficiency of resource allocation. The proposal coordinates virtual node and virtual link mapping stages. The main idea behind the proposal is take advantage of unused bandwidth with respect to the occupancy rate of embedded virtual links. Hence, the unused bandwidth will be reassigned to <b>incoming</b> virtual <b>network</b> requests. To do so, Adaptive-VNE adopts the “divide and conquer” strategy. It divides the virtual network request topology into many star topologies. Then, the mapping of each piece within the whole topology is formulated as a K-supplier problem and resolved by an approximation bottleneck algorithm. To generate the global virtual network topology, Adaptive-VNE uses a backtracking algorithm in order to minimise the global mapping cost. Note that the proposal forecasts usage rate of virtual links and adapts their bandwidth reservation. Adaptive-VNE was validated by simulations and compared to the related strategies found in literature. The results obtained show that, contrarily to static bandwidth allocation approaches, the adaptive strategy maximises substrate bandwidth usage while the virtual links' bottleneck rate is minimised. Moreover, the congestion periods are minimised and during the bottleneck the bandwidth satisfaction is maximised. Finally, Adaptive-VNE improves performances in terms of acceptance rate of virtual networks and revenue of infrastructure providers...|$|R
