5|$|A {{portrait}} of Marie closely resembling a photograph by Krøyer {{was completed in}} 1891. The following year, it {{was added to the}} frieze in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel which had become the artists' favourite meeting place. Placed next to Krøyer's own portrait, it confirmed Marie's position as an accepted member of the Skagen Painters. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> was designed by the architects Ulrik Plesner and Thorvald Bindesbøll in connection with the first major expansion of the hotel in 1892. At Krøyer's suggestion, it was decided to incorporate Degn Brøndum's art collection into its decoration. Over the years it became a custom that visiting artists donated portraits of each other to the hotel owner and these were placed in a frieze just under the ceiling. Today the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> together with its frieze forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} of the palace's many rooms to be {{completed}} was the main <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> built from 1830 to 1834. The principal central wing of the mansion was constructed from 1831 to 1837. Between 1841 and 1842, a billiard room was constructed adjoining the <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> From 1838 through to 1844, the guest wing, the east wing, towers, the service wing, and the front entrance were completed. The final wing built of the mansion was the library wing; this was under construction from 1842 to 1844. The remaining four years of building works were spent on the palace's interior decoration.|$|E
5|$|The main portion (the center) {{contains}} the entrance, facing west. To its {{left is the}} chapel and to its right is the schoolroom. Both rooms originally were smaller, with bedrooms located {{at the ends of}} building, but a 1910 restoration eliminated those walls to enlarge the rooms. Two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen (which was added at a later date), and the servants' <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> are in the north wing, while the south wing has three bedrooms and the family <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The house is topped by a cupola from which bullfights and festivals in the adjacent plaza could be seen.|$|E

5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there had been when Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

The master and matron, for instance, received six times the amount of food given to a pauper.|$|R
40|$|This BA thesis {{deals with}} luxury <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> in ancient Roman world. It {{describes}} different variations of <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> and their transformation {{over the time}} based on the archaeological remains {{with regard to the}} preserved literary and iconographic sources. Different architectural types of these rooms are portrayed as well as their furnishing and decorations. Several chapters are devoted to course of banquet in Roman society and its importance. The thesis also mentions some types of Greek <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> and their layout because in the early ages, thanks to the Etruscans and Greek colonies in southern Italy, these became a model for Romans. But soon Romans adjusted Greek practices to suit their own needs and thus created many completely new variations. From geographic perspective this thesis focuses mainly on Italy, but also provides evidence from Roman provinces (for example Spain and North Africa).

5|$|The porch {{leads into}} the great hall which has a Minton tile floor and a large stone chimney piece. In the east wing is the long gallery which has oak panelling, a chimney-piece and a {{panelled}} ceiling. Behind the long gallery is an irregularly-shaped billiard room and the drawing room. To the south {{of these is the}} library. Behind the great hall is the main staircase. The circular tower at the north-west corner contains the octagonal <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> with a Minton tile floor, two fireplaces, and a vault of eight radial ribs running to a central boss. The room contains an oak sideboard with a carved Green Man. Below the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is a wine cellar. On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E

5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak paneling, {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E

5|$|After being {{purchased}} by the Guellers in 2004, the restaurant was redecorated and modernised, the décor having become shabby under previous owners. The new decorations included recessed lighting and fabric-covered walls. There is a fireplace in {{the centre of the}} <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> with an 18th-century settle (a type of bench) beside it. Elements from the Reid and Long era remain, with the bar and ceilings still being recognisable from their time at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the <b>dining</b> <b>room,</b> while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
