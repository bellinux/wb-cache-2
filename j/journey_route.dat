30|$|Algorithm  1 is {{applicable}} {{to a general}} TVG. We now consider a very special type of TVG with specific temporal restrictions that correspond {{to the type of}} network that we analyze in this paper. One such peculiarity is given by instant edges (edges that appear only during a unique time interval). Another characteristic is zero latency (i.e., edges that can be traversed instantaneously). Finally, in this setting, we base betweenness computation on increasing <b>journey</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{counting}} {{algorithm is}} simple and {{it is based on}} multiple Depth-First Search (DFS) traversals. It consists of visiting every <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> of G starting from s, incrementing the appropriate counters every time a newly encountered journey is foremost. We remind that a node can reappear more than once in a <b>journey</b> <b>route,</b> with various occurrences corresponding to different times. This means that we need to store the time when a node is visited in the <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> so that, if it is visited again, we can determine whether the subsequent visit corresponds to a later time and thus the node has to be considered again. Note that this is the main difference with respect to a DFS in a static graph, where instead every node is visited exactly once.|$|E
30|$|More precisely, when a <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> (in {{this case}} a {{foremost}} <b>journey</b> <b>route)</b> from s to x (s x) is a prefix of a <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> x y {{at a later time}} snapshot, we perform a procedure called SpecialCount (Algorithm  3). The special count procedure involves aggregating the values of Count_s[v,x] with Count_x[v',y], for all nodes (resp. v, v') occurring in the journey routes between s and x and between x and y (see Algorithm  3). Algorithm  3 simply calculates the product of the number of foremost journeys between two routes s x, and x y, if they do not share any vertex (lines 4 – 9). If instead they share some vertex v, the calculation is slightly more complicated: let a be the number of foremost journeys from s to y where v is visited at least once on the route between x and y; let b be the number of foremost journeys from s to y where v is visited at least once on the route between s and x; and let c be the sum of a and b. c represents the number of all foremost journeys from s to y that pass through v. However, c counts the <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> passing through v multiple times if v happened to exist in both Count_s[v,x] and Count_x[v,y], and we need to remove such multiple counting of journeys, which is done along with the update to Count_s[v,y] in line 13.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} where y stays in the current {{snapshot}} (lines 15 – 22), we push its adjacent nodes into the stack S and determine whether the route ending at y is foremost.

30|$|We also notice that, due to zero latency, edges {{spanning}} {{only one}} interval, {{and to the}} fact that edges never disappear once created, any shortest <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> in G is equivalent to a shortest path on the static graph corresponding to its footprint; moreover, the notion of fastest journey does not have much meaning in this context, because on any route corresponding to a journey, there would be a fastest one.

40|$|Older people {{driving motor}} homes are {{increasingly}} commonplace on our roads. This {{research focuses on}} senior New Zealanders who identify themselves as ‘movanners’ as opposed to ‘house truckers’ or ‘tourists’; and in particular on single full-timers. These mobile, single seniors communicate constantly regarding their locations and future plans. They often travel familiar paths, repeating the same <b>journey</b> <b>route</b> and utilising as their ‘places’ the well-known margins of the road, unnoticed by other traffic and beneficial to senior movanners’ mobility. This study argues that they have appropriated ‘cool’ new technologies (as opposed to the technologies of disability and deterioration often associated with older people), to retain their independence, enable their journeys and achieve ageing wellbeing in mobility. Senior movanners exploit connections to build network capital resulting in concrete benefits for their successful mobile lives. The field research was conducted over three years and consisted of interviews and less formal conversations with senior movanners, auto-ethnography, as I hired motorhomes to travel myself, and mobile participant observation in the motorhome {{of one of my}} single female participants. In addition, I collected quantitative data by tracking two key informants who each carried a GPS device which enabled me to view their journey tracks retrospectively and collaboratively. Family relationships are well maintained, although reconstructed to fit in with their mobility. Through network capital and technology utilisation they have recreated the ‘roadlands’ as a social space, forming causeways for what I have termed ‘The Movanner Archipelago’...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} a Sundanese {{story of}} hajj or pilgrimage to Mecca during the Dutch colonial period. It was {{expressed in the}} form of Sundanese metrical verse which was called dangding or guguritan. The author of the dangding was Haji Hasan Mustapa (1852 - 1930). He is one greatest Sundanese poets as he wrote more than 10 thousand cantos on Sufism from 1900 - 1902. He went to Mecca three times (1860 - 1862, 1869 - 1873, 1880 - 1885). One of his hajj stories was Kinanti Munggah Haji. Mustapa told about the hajj <b>journey</b> <b>route,</b> his experiences of suffering, and he also provided an interpretation of inner meaning of hajj according to the Sufi perspective. The paper uses an intertextual approach with an analysis of social history and Sufism. It shows that hajj in the colonial period was very difficult. In addition to the storm in the sea, the pilgrims found other difficulties in the Holy Land. However, Mustapa assumed that the meaning of hajj was not only the hajj ritual physically but also the inner-side of feeling (alaming rasa). Hajj will led to the true happiness. Beware if your hajj is just a physical matter. It can be nothing. The paper tries to confirm both van Dijk and Chambert-Loir’s works on other Sundanese stories of hajj such as Raden Panji Nagara, Moehammad-Hoesen, and R. A. A. Wiranatakoesoema. Mustapa’s interpretation of the mystical meaning of hajj shows his peculiarities as a sufi. His willingness to endure some difficulties in the journey is not just associated with his internal feeling in the sense of spiritual life, but also his satisfication to join in what Habermas called as a "public space" where Muslims could create a community without being constrained by Colonial rule...|$|E
