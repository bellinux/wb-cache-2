40|$|Undoubtedly, the {{detection}} of peripheral objects and pedestrians while driving is an important visual task. However, there are few data that describe the impact of parameters such as headlamp illumination, peripheral angle and target reflectance upon the speed and accuracy with which one can detect peripheral targets. The present paper outlines a framework {{for the development of}} a model that predicts reaction times and detection percentages to small targets of varying reflectance, and located at various positions in the field of view. The preliminary model closely matches data from independently-performed field studies using halogen and high intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>headlamp</b> sets having illumination characteristics that conform to North American and European requirements for headlamp beam patterns. The modeling approach discussed in the paper allows characteristics such as the effective field of view to be described. Further, the approach could be extended to incorporate driver age, target size, visual clutter, spectral power distribution, glare and ambient roadway illumination into the model predictions. Such a model could serve as a useful complement to existing models of on-axis (foveal) visual performance in driving context...|$|E

50|$|On September 12, 2013, GM {{released}} {{photos and}} press {{release of the}} fourth-generation Tahoe and Yukon. Like its larger siblings Suburban and Yukon XL, the front fascias of the Tahoe and Yukon are distinct, but {{from the base of}} the A-pillars back, they share most of the same styling cues. This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics and fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels now are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight. A more-efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 powertrain coupled with improved aerodynamics help increase fuel economy for the SUVs. Both fourth-generation SUVs do not share a single piece of sheetmetal or lighting element with the brands' full-size pick-up trucks, and the front grilles of both vehicles are slightly altered to give them their own identity. The front headlights features projector-beam headlamps that flanks the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille - chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while the LTZ trims feature high-intensity <b>discharge</b> <b>headlamps</b> and light-emitting diode daytime running lamps.|$|R
