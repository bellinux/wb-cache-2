5|$|With Glennon behind center, the Virginia Tech offense {{utilized}} {{several different}} wide receivers {{in the passing}} game. Eight different players caught at least one pass, and the leading receiver, Justin Harper, <b>hauled</b> <b>in</b> fourcatches for 64yards and a touchdown. Receiver Josh Morgan, meanwhile, caught threepasses, bringing him to 122receptions for his career, passing Antonio Freeman for second place all-time at Virginia Tech. Ernest Wilford remains first in the Virginia Tech record book, with 126receptions.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the mine's {{production}} peaked with {{an export}} of 2.4million tonnes and 1,000 employees. In 1984, {{to improve the}} workplace environment, a used Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA)-built T45 locomotive was bought from Sweden. However, it suffered several breakdowns and was retired in 1989. As a replacement, a new G 1203 BB was bought from Maschinenbau Kiel and was delivered to Kirkenes on 8 February 1991. In 1988, {{the first part of}} the Kirkenes plant was closed, and the mining company drastically reduced production because its owner, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, would no longer subsidize operations. All mining ceased in the spring of 1996, and the last load of ore was <b>hauled</b> <b>in</b> April 1997. After operations closed, the oldest G12 was transferred to Sør-Varanger Museum.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two bower anchors, which were {{threatening}} to capsize the ship, were <b>hauled</b> <b>in.</b> During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too far away in the prevailing weather conditions to be accessible, so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that gathered around the ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration of rum to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in animal care. The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are <b>hauled</b> <b>in</b> dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E
5|$|Though {{hampered}} {{by the need to}} work inside his own end zone, Marcus Vick completed an 11-yard pass to tight end Jeff King for a first down. The play was the sole positive gain for the VT offense, however, and Virginia Tech was forced into its sixth punt of the game. The kick was a poor one, and traveled only 28yards before flying out of bounds. Thanks to the bad kick, Weatherford was able to start his offense inside Virginia Tech territory, and took advantage of the situation. On the first play after the punt, Weatherford completed a 41-yard throw downfield to Willie Reid, who <b>hauled</b> <b>in</b> the ball at the Virginia Tech three-yard line to give the Seminoles a first and goal. After a failed quarterback sneak, however, Florida State was penalized 10yards for holding and Weatherford was sacked for a loss of threeyards on the next play. Although unable to cross the goal line for a touchdown, FSU did send in kicker Gary Cismesia for his second field goal attempt of the day. The kick, a 41-yarder, was good and gave Florida State a 203 lead with 4:23 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5|$|In Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008, the New York Giants {{defeated}} the New England Patriots 17–14. The biggest {{play of the}} game was on third down on the Giants 44-yard line with 1:15 remaining. They were down 14–10 After the snap, Manning ran back and was surrounded by a cloud of defenders. Escaping three near sacks, he made a miraculous pass to David Tyree, who caught the ball against his own helmet, while being covered by veteran defender Rodney Harrison. This set up the Giants' final touchdown to win. Eli Manning was named MVP, completing 19 of 34 passes for 255 yards along with two touchdowns. The Giants pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history by handing the New England Patriots their first loss of the season and preventing them from becoming only the second team in the Super Bowl era to finish undefeated.Plaxico Burress <b>hauled</b> <b>in</b> the game-winning touchdown pass with 35 seconds left to play to give the Giants their first Super Bowl win since 1990. This game was also a rematch of their final regular season game, in which the Patriots came back from a 12-point deficit to finish the regular season 16–0.|$|E
