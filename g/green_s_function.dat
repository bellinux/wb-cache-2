A linearized form of Lilley's equation governs the non-causal <b>Green</b> <b>s</b> <b>function</b> of interest, with the non-linear terms on the right hand side identified as the source.

Results presented for unheated jets in the Mach number range of 0. 51 to 1. 8 suggest that near the peak radiation angle of high-speed jets, a different source/Green s function convolution integral may be required in order to capture the peak observed directivity of jet noise.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is the {{applications}} of generalized function (GF) theory to the wave equation in aeroacoustics. We start with a tutorial on GFs with particular emphasis on viewing functions as continuous linear functionals. We next define operations on GFs. The operation of interest to us in this paper is generalized differentiation. We give many applications of generalized differentiation, particularly for the wave equation. We discuss the use of GFs in finding <b>Green</b> <b>s</b> <b>function</b> and some subtleties that only GF theory can clarify without ambiguities.

We will show how we can use the imbedding method to find the Kirchhoff formulas for stationary and moving surfaces with ease and elegance without the use of the four-dimensional Green s theorem, which is commonly done. Other subjects covered are why the derivatives in conservation laws should be viewed as generalized derivatives and what are the consequences of doing this.

We first invert GPS measurements and DInSAR interferograms to image the coseismic slip distribution on the fault planes in a layered half space for the two earthquakes that occurred on September 26, 1997 at 00 : 33 UTC (Mw = 5. 7) and 09 : 40 UTC (Mw = 6. 0) near Colfiorito. We also invert DInSAR interferograms to infer the slip distribution during the subsequent earthquake that occurred on October 14, 1997 at 15 : 23 UTC (Mw = 5. 6) in the SE section of the seismogenic zone near Sellano. We also explore the set of acceptable solutions using a genetic algorithm to have information on the available resolution of geodetic data. The slip models obtained by geodetic data inversion are used to perform a forward modeling of strong motion waveforms for all three events. We adopt a constant rupture velocity of 2. 6 km/s and a constant rise time of 1 s. Our results show that these rupture models provide an acceptable fit to recorded waveforms. Finally, we invert the recorded ground displacements, collected during the September 26 th 09 : 40 main shock and the October 14 th Sellano earthquake, to constrain the rupture history.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that at present exact {{averaging}} of the equations of flow and transport in random porous media have been realized for {{only a small number of}} special fields. Moreover, the approximate averaging methods are not yet fully understood. For example, the convergence behavior and the accuracy of truncated perturbation series are not well known; and in addition, the calculation of the high-order perturbations is very complicated. These problems for a long time have stimulated attempts to find the answer for the question: Are there in existence some exact general and sufficiently universal forms of averaged equations? If the answer is positive, there arises the problem of the construction of these equations and analyzing them. There are many publications on different applications of this problem to various fields, including: Hydrodynamics, flow and transport in porous media, theory of elasticity, acoustic and electromagnetic waves in random fields, etc. Here, we present a method of finding some general form of exactly averaged equations for flow and transport in random fields by using (1) some general properties of the <b>Green</b> <b>s</b> <b>functions</b> for appropriate stochastic problems, and (2) some basic information about the random fields of the conductivity, porosity and flow velocity. We present general forms of exactly averaged non-local equations for the following cases: (1) steady-state flow with sources in porous media with random conductivity, (2) transient flow with sources in compressible media with random conductivity and porosity; and (3) Nonreactive solute transport in random porous media. We discuss the problem of uniqueness and the properties of the non-local averaged equations for cases with some type of symmetry (isotropic, transversal isotropic and orthotropic), and we analyze the structure of the nonlocal equations in the general case of stochastically homogeneous fields...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} century sea level rise {{strongly}} increased compared to sea level change in the last 2000 years. The present study investigates global and regional sea level change, simulated with the finite element sea-ice ocean model (FESOM). The major goal is to separate sea level change into steric and eustatic contributions and to estimate the influence of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet melt on global and regional sea level. Modeled steric height variations show realistic regional geophysical patterns compared with steric height variations derived from altimetry measurements and GRACE. Compared to the time before the 1990 s, an increased global trend in steric sea level rise is found in estimates derived from the model and from satellite measurements. Modeled ocean mass exhibits reasonable spatial structures. However, the trend in the global model mean cannot be trusted in FESOM as it strongly depends on the mass budget of the model, which is determined by uncertain mass fluxes. To account for this, global mean ocean mass variations need to be optimized to realistic values. To this end results from GRACE in combination with GPS data is used. Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet melting influence the global sea level mainly through the additional mass. The eustatic sea level rises by about 0. 3 mm/yr for 100 Gt/yr of melt water. Additionally, the fresh water causes local steric variations in sea level that are transported farther by ocean currents. The ice sheet mass loss yields a decrease in gravitational attraction causing a sea level fall near the source of mass loss but also to a slight increase at long distance. This effect is computed for the Greenland ice sheet mass loss using <b>Green</b> <b>s</b> <b>functions.</b> It leads to a decreased sea level near the Greenland coast and to a slightly increased sea level in the Southern Ocean.
