John Walker of MTV News {{described the}} song's refrain as [...] "infectious". Mike Wass from Idolator praised the song's catchiness, describing {{it as an}} [...] "infectious gospel club-banger" [...] and {{an invitation to the}} dance floor for listeners. Further, he called it [...] "possibly the first twerk-inducing song of praise". He concluded his review, writing, [...] "those harmonies remain unrivaled and the chorus is a monster. Trust me, [...] will be stuck in your head after the first listen." [...] In another review he felt that the song managed {{to bridge the gap between}} gospel and popular music.

Rolling Stone writer Jon Blistein described the horn stabs as [...] "heavenly" [...] and praised the trio's [...] "always potent harmonies".|$|E
500|$|... "Applause" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "It's good. Maybe even slow clap good. Because while so many (too many!) of Gaga's songs {{have been designed}} to boost the esteem of her flock, this song finds her openly pining for the mass-adulation that all superstars need to survive." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard lauded the song's hook and remarked, [...] "As always, Gaga has turned a lofty idea into a jingle for the masses." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, stating that [...] "Lady Gaga makes no secret that she's after mass adoration, and as far as lead singles go, her next grand spectacle is off to a strong start." [...] Carl Williot of Idolator praised the track, saying that it [...] "ticks all the right boxes when it comes to being a balls-to-the-wall pop delight ... this is pop doing what good pop songs should do, which is grab you by the collar from the first listen and make you fall in love on the spot." [...] The Huffington Post writer Baggers described it as [...] "pop at its best: instant, euphoric, joyful and impossible to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head".|$|E
2500|$|Writing for USA Today, Ann Oldenburg {{enjoyed the}} track and called it a [...] "dance-ready single". Glenn Gamboa, writing for the {{magazine}} Newsday, labelled it a [...] "pure fizzy dance pop... and a chorus you can't <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> head." [...] In a similar review, Cameron Matthews from AOL Music said the song [...] "is sure to be an instant hit!". Cameron Adams wrote for the Australian newspaper Herald Sun, and stated that [...] "hile it is not instant as most Kylie singles, repeated listens implant the 'woooh' hook firmly." [...] In a separate review at PopCrush, Amy Sciarretto named [...] "Timebomb" [...] {{one of the best}} dance songs of 2012 and concluded, [...] "The 'Timebomb' may be ticking, but the remaining minutes of Minogue's career are not." ...|$|E

Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
