Mixtures in suspension of <b>guar</b> and xanthan <b>gums</b> at low concentrations (1, 000 ppm) and different proportions were processed by microfiltration with membrane of nominal pore size of 0. 4 mu m. The rheological behavior of the mixtures was investigated in rotational viscometers at two different temperatures, 25 and 40 C, {{at the beginning and}} at the end of each experiment. The shear stress (t) in function of the shear rate (gamma) was fitted and analyzed with the power-law model. All the mixtures showed flow behavior index values (n) lower than 1, characterizing non-Newtonian fluids (pseudoplastic). The samples of both mixtures and permeates were also analyzed by absorbency spectroscopy in infrared radiation.

The in-depth investigation of the rheological properties of the guar/IL solutions emphasized that the shear viscoelastic properties can be finely tuned by IL chemical structure, concentration and molecular weight of guar chains {{as well as by}} temperature changes. Under suited conditions, highly elastic physical ion gels were formed as a result of multiple guar/IL, guar/guar and IL/IL interactions. Such synergistic associations were usefully exploited to elaborate films dually composed of guar chains and entrapped IL molecules. Their thermomechanical properties, which revealed a solid-state behavior, were closely controlled by the structural parameters of the constituents.

Acceptability was evaluated by 100 consumers using a 9 -cm hedonic scale, and the level of sample creaminess was evaluated using a 9 -point just-about-right (JAR) scale.

To maintain a similar texture {{to that of}} commercial desserts without fibres, the composition of thickening (corn starch, xanthan and <b>guar</b> <b>gums)</b> and gelling (carrageenan) agents in the basic formulation was also studied. Dietary fibres of bamboo, inulin, wheat, apple, Psyllium and chitosan were tested. Sensory characteristics were evaluated by a non-trained panel.

Texture and surface colour were analysed by a Texture Analyser-xT 2 i and a tristimulus colourimeter (Minolta CR 300). Sensory attributes showed significant differences among treatments. The dessert with chitosan gave the lowest sensory scores. For stress at rupture, the dessert with Psyllium fibre showed the highest value, while the one with chitosan gave the lowest.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 90 - 95. The {{recovery}} of Platinum Group Minerals (PGM) and associated sulphides by froth flotation from the Bushveld Igneous Complex {{is complicated by}} the presence of naturally floatable gangue minerals such as talc. Although talc is present in small quantities it has a disproportionate effect on concentrate grade by enhancing froth stability and increasing the entrainment of other gangue minerals. However, there is an indication that some of the other gangue minerals, which are normally considered to be hydrophilic, such as chromite and pyroxene, report to the concentrate as floatable particles. Polysaccharide depressants, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and modified <b>guar</b> <b>gums</b> are used to reduce the floatability of naturally floatable gangue and may also be able to reduce the floatability of activated gangue. This study examines the copper activation of a range of minerals found in the Bushveld Complex (namely pyroxene, feldspar, chromite and talc as well as the classical oxide, quartz) using zeta potential measurements, adsorption and microflotation tests. The effect on floatability is evaluated after activation and collector adsorption {{in the presence of a}} modified guar and a CMC depressant. Although quartz is not a major gangue component in PGM ores it was selected since it is a strongly negatively-charged mineral in the alkaline range and therefore likely to respond to copper activation.

Viscoelastic measurements provide information about the microstructure of the system. The objectives of this work were: a) to determine the viscoelastic behavior of two different low in fat oil-in-water food emulsions: a gel like and a fluid type emulsions stabilized with hydrocolloids (gellan gum and xanthan-guar mixtures respectively) b) to model and predict the mechanical relaxation spectrum for both emulsions and continuous aqueous phases. Low-in-fat oil-in-water emulsions (20 g/ 100 g) were prepared using sunflower oil and Tween 80 (1 wt. %). Fluid emulsions containing xanthan and <b>guar</b> <b>gums</b> were formulated using a synergistic ratio 7 : 3, with total hydrocolloid concentration ranging between 0. 5 to 2 wt%. The aqueous phases contained NaCl (2 wt. %) and acetic acid (2 wt. %). The effect of hydrocolloids was studied using oscillatory measurements (G’ and G” vs. frequency) within the linear viscoelastic range previously determined by stress-sweeps. Time-Concentration Superposition principle was applied to find the master curves that describe the mechanical spectra of the viscoelastic materials. Superposition allows to obtain {{a wide spectrum of}} nearly ten decades of frequencies in emulsions containing xanthan–guar mixtures, whereas gellan gum systems did not show a significant frequency displacement. Viscoelastic behavior of the systems was satisfactorily modeled using Baumgaertel-Schausberger-Winter (BSW) equation. This empirical model was used to predict the mechanical relaxation spectrum for both emulsions and continuous aqueous phases. Validation of the predicted spectra was carried out through creep compliance data for emulsion-filled gels and steady-state flow curves for emulsions containing xanthan–guar mixtures...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 35 - 39). Talc is {{a common}} siliceous gangue mineral found in ore bodies beneficiated by flotation. Talc is a layered anisotropic mineral, with a mineral structure comprising of basal planes and edges. The basal planes of talc are considered completely neutral, while the edges of talc are thought to undergo a change from positive to negative at a highly acidic pH. Talc is highly floatable, requiring polymeric depressants {{to be added to}} flotation pulps in order to prevent it from entering the concentrate and reducing its grade. Various polymers such as non-ionic <b>guar</b> <b>gums</b> and anionic Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) depressants are employed for this purpose. However, the industrial use of these reagents is still inefficient. One of the factors affecting the performance of these polymers as depressants is the water quality of the flotation medium, specifically the concentration and type of electrolyte present. The objective of this thesis was to investigate of the surface properties and structure talc, and its effect on the adsorption mechanisms of different types of polymeric depressants in the presence of varying types of metal cations in solution in the context of mineral flotation. The surface potential of talc was investigated using rheological, titration and electron microprobe analyses. It was found that the rheological behaviour of talc is inconsistent with the premise that the talc basal planes carry no electrical charge. Furthermore, potentiometric titration measurements showed that the point of zero charge of talc does not correspond to the electrophoretic isoelectric point of talc. The discrepancy was attributed to the unsuitability of zeta potential measurements for evaluation of anisotropic plate-like minerals...|$|R
