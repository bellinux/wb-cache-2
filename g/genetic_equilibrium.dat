In general, BLM initially focused on how many horses the range could support and in maintaining conformity to the Pryor Mountains standard. [...] However, {{with the development of}} DNA testing in the mid 1980s, the focus changed to include maintaining the herd's genetic viability. In 1988, researchers at Washington State University authored a paper which raised concern that the herd exhibited a lack of genetic diversity, and could be suffering from genetic drift and/or a population bottleneck. BLM contracted with Cothran (then at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Kentucky, but now at the Texas A College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences) to take random genetic samples of the herd in 1994, 1997, and 2001. Cothran's analysis found [...] "no evidence of a bottleneck". Genetic diversity was actually above the mean for feral horse herds in the United States, and just below the mean for domesticated breeds. The BLM, however, interpreted these studies in 2009 to indicate that the genetic diversity of the Pryor Mountains herd is [...] "well above" [...] the mean for domestic breeds. Cothran considered the herd to be in <b>genetic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> although he cautioned that a minimum of 120 breeding-age animals should be kept on the range to maintain the genetic health of the herd. Research by biologists and veterinarians at Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky, and other colleges found that there is little inbreeding in bands, as the stallions tend to drive off colts when they are about two years old.|$|E

40|$|Predictions {{are made}} of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>genetic</b> variances and {{responses}} in a metric trait under the joint effects of directional selection, mutation and linkage in a finite population. The "infinitesimal model" is analyzed as the limiting case of many mutants of very small effect, otherwise Monte Carlo simulation is used. If the effects of mutant genes on the trait are symmetrically distributed and they are unlinked, the variance of mutant effects is not an important parameter. If the distribution is skewed, unless effects or the population size is small, the proportion of mutants that have increasing effect is the critical parameter. With linkage the distribution of genotypic values in the population becomes skewed downward and the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>genetic</b> variance and response are smaller as disequilibrium becomes important. Linkage effects are greater when the mutational variance is contributed by many genes of small effect than few of large effect, and are greater when the majority of mutants increase rather than decrease the trait because genes that are of large effect or are deleterious do not segregate for long. The most likely conditions for "Muller's ratchet" are investigated...|$|R
40|$|The role of linkage in {{influencing}} heritable variation maintained through {{a balance between}} mutation and stabilizing selection is investigated for two different models. In both cases one trait is considered and the interactions within and between loci {{are assumed to be}} additive. Contrary to most earlier investigations of this problem no a priori assumptions on the distribution of genotypic values are imposed. For a deterministic two-locus two-allele model with recombination and mutation, related to the symmetric viability model, a complete nonlinear analysis is performed. It is shown that, depending on the recombination rate, multiple stable equilibria may coexist. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>genetic</b> and genic variances are calculated. For a polygenic trait in a finite population with a possible continuum of allelic effects a simulation study is performed. In both models the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>genetic</b> and genic variances are roughly equal to the house-of-cards prediction or its finite population counterpart as long as the recombination rate is not extremely low. However, negative linkage disequilibrium builds up. If the loci are very closely linked the <b>equilibrium</b> additive <b>genetic</b> variance is slightly lower than the house-of-cards prediction, but the genic variance is much higher.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} a formal {{framework}} for the biological-evolutionary study of human economic behaviour. Femina economica is a hypothetical parthenogenetic species with a simple economy. Individuals make decisions about labour supply and fertility subject to time and resource constraints. Labour is of differing types and a parent determines the type of her offspring’s labour. Wages are determined as marginal productivities from an economy-wide production function. Three propositions are proved, of which the first shows that under very general conditions there exists a population <b>genetic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> in which individuals ’ decisions {{are assumed to be}} under genetic control. The second shows that at a population <b>genetic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> individuals have the same behaviour as they would at an economic equilibrium, in which individuals are assumed to maximise a common utility function. The third proposition shows that if the common utility function fulfils certain conditions, the attainment of an economic equilibrium brings about the same behaviour as a population <b>genetic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> This suggests a way in which evolutionarily stable behaviour can be brought about without the necessity for changes in gene frequencies. Demographic implications include the possibility of interpreting in Darwinian terms the reductions in offspring number that occur in fertility transitions, and the weak or even negative correlation in economically developed societies between control of resources and offspring number. There are implications for economics of deriving utility maximisation from population genetics. � 1998 Academic Press 1...|$|E
