30|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{properly}} understand the relationship between customer and producer with regard to product characteristics, and the role of <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspection</b> in the economic system, something also dealt with in Acemoglu and Verdier (2000), Koch and Peyrache (2011). To achieve these objectives, we use the combination of principles and methods used in the <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspection</b> system. To improve our results, we also consider the implications of a repairable system, and so obtain a good understanding of the intervals of the product lifetime and product repair time under such a system. In this case, the customer and producer guarantee the quality and price of the goods.|$|R
40|$|The <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspection</b> of {{construction}} by Fluor Daniel Hanford (FDH) is performed to provide assurance that fabrication, construction, and installation are {{in accordance with}} approved contract documents. Approved contract documents used to perform inspections may include specifications, drawings, and contractor submittals such as fabrication drawings, procedures, etc. The amount or degree of inspection activity is tailored to the project {{as determined by the}} project team so that the effort and cost expended are commensurate with the importance of the facility in terms of function and safety. Inspections are documented to provide verification of the acceptability of the work performed. This document identifies the inspections and documentation forms to be provided. It is prepared and implemented with the understanding that the construction contractor is fully responsible for compliance with contract documents and for the quality of work performed. Inspections performed are in accordance with approved procedures. The Manager of <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Inspection</b> is responsible for the implementation of this plan and assignment of personnel for the work. Inspections are conducted by personnel who are qualified and certified, to perform their assigned task. The <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Inspection</b> Plan is organized in the Construction Specification Institute (CSI) format to cross reference design specification sections with sections of the AI Plan. In each AI Plan section the applicable specification section subject will be identified followed by the appropriate inspection requirements. General surveillances will be listed when applicable. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>Inspection</b> Reports are provided to document inspections not documented on a test report (i. e., Soil Test Data, Concrete Test Report, NDE/Weld Record, Leak/Pressure Test Certification, Backflow Device Test Report, Nonconformance Report, Deficiency Report, and/or Contractors testing forms) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper，the author {{introduced}} incremental profit {{functions of}} the <b>acceptance</b> sampling <b>inspection</b> plan，thereby determining inspection plans which assure the maximum profit of a company. This paper is also concerned with the optimal number and positions of screening processes，to get the maximum profit，using the concept of incremental profits from the total manufacturing processes. When sampling inspection plans are examined from the economical view point，most of them have heretofore been determined so as to minimize the cost of inspection. However，in case the demand exceeds the production capacity，the sales amount being dependent on <b>acceptance</b> <b>inspection</b> plan，a solution to get the maximum profit does not always coincide with that to get the minimum cost solution. This is the reason of which profit was chosen as our objective function. As {{a result of this}} study，the contents of the total loss due to defective units in the accepted lot，were determined quantitatively，under the tw...|$|R
