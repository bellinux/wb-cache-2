5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by <b>ear</b> <b>wax,</b> ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective <b>ear</b> <b>wax.</b> The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E

[...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the external auditory canal either by tight fitting diving equipment or <b>ear</b> <b>wax.</b> [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{years ago}} I (<b>ear)</b> <b>waxed</b> lyrical on the deep, {{seemingly}} indelible ties {{of the sounds}} of Dartmoor with its inhabitants. In this bucolically-inclined endeavour I added a sonic turn to Tuan’s topophilia: “fleeting visual pleasure; the sensual delight of physical contact; the fondness for place because it is familiar, because it is home and incarnates the past, because it evokes pride of ownership or of creation; joy in things because of animal health and vitality. " (Tuan 1974) My topophonophilia stressed what I had witnessed on Dartmoor as, the affirmative relationship between place, the sensation of sound and sentiment. Those of us who research and practice everyday soundscapes tend to tacitly extol the positive attributes of sound and hearing with relation to space and place, where listening is prioritised over hearing. We talk of how through sound we connect, locate, embody, discern and immerse. From the findings of my more recent research I am obliged to propose that the contrary is also a reality for many: sound isolates, excludes, disconnects, disembodies and dislocates from the material and social world. Sound hurts! Bringing audiology into the fore, in this talk I will propose a new paradigm for situating hearing that extends from an idealized clinical model of hearing, the otologically normal (BS ISO 226 : 2003), to a socio-cultural concept of the auraltypical. In conclusion I will call for a new agenda of auraldiversity and aural relativism within sound studies, sound practice and acoustics...|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of alleles for dry <b>ear</b> <b>wax</b> and odorless sweat is most concentrated in East- and Northeast Asia, most notably Korea, China, Mongolia, and western Japan.

A downward gradient of dry <b>ear</b> <b>wax</b> allele phenotypes can be drawn from northern China to southern Asia and a east-west gradient can also be drawn from eastern Siberia to western Europe.

40|$|Background: irrigating <b>ears</b> {{to remove}} <b>wax</b> is a {{time-consuming}} procedure in UK primary care. In {{many other countries}} bulb syringes are used for self-clearance of earwax but evidence of their effectiveness is lacking. Aim: to compare the effectiveness of self-treatment bulb syringes with routine care. Design of study Open, randomised, controlled trial. Setting Seven practices in Hampshire, UK. Method: participants were 237 patients attending their GP or practice nurse with symptomatic occluding earwax. A further 128 patients {{did not want to}} be part of the randomisation but allowed their data to be analysed. Patients randomised to intervention (n = 118) were given ear drops, a bulb syringe, and instructions on its use. Patients in the control group (n = 119) received ear drops, followed by ear irrigation by the GP or practice nurse. Main outcome measures were symptoms (on a 7 -point scale), wax clearance, need for further treatment, and the acceptability of treatment. Results: comparing patients using the bulb syringe with those treated with conventional irrigation, the change in mean symptom score was - 0. 81 and - 1. 26 respectively (difference - 0. 45, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = - 0. 11 to - 0. 79) and, regarding the proportion requiring no further irrigation, 51 % and 69 % respectively. Although irrigation was preferred by more patients, most patients using the bulb syringe would use it again (75 % versus 100 %) and were satisfied with treatment (71 % versus 99 %). Conclusions: advising patients with <b>ears</b> blocked by <b>wax</b> to try bulb syringing before irrigation is effective and acceptable, and could significantly reduce the use of NHS resource...|$|R
50|$|The ABCC11 gene {{is present}} in the human genome as two alleles, differing in one {{nucleotide}} also known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A SNP in the ABCC11 gene on chromosome 16 at base position 538 of either a guanine or adenine controls for multiple distinct phenotypes. These respectively code for glycine and arginine in the gene's protein product. Dominant inheritance of the GG or GA genotype is observed while the AA genotype is recessive. The phenotypes expressed by the genotypes include cerumen type (wet or dry <b>ear</b> <b>wax),</b> osmidrosis (odor associated with sweat caused by excessive apocrine secretion), and breast cancer risk, although there is ongoing debate on whether if there is a real correlation of the wet <b>ear</b> <b>wax</b> phenotype to breast cancer susceptibility. The GG or GA genotype produces the wet <b>ear</b> <b>wax</b> phenotype (sticky and brown colored) and acrid sweat odor and is the dominant allele. Note this phenotype requires only the presence of one guanine. The homozygous recessive AA genotype produces the dry <b>ear</b> <b>wax</b> phenotype (dry and flaky) and mildly odored sweat.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} establishing a correlation between ear pathology and hearing aid (HA) user complications. I documented all adverse complication in ear pathology, HA user and parent’s attitude towards their children's benefits from using HA, as a continuous follow-up of the hearing impaired (HI) at AL-Amal Institutions in Riyadh, between January 1998 (unpublished) and continued until 2003. In the first study (1) 700 (boys and girls) Saudi students (85, 43 %) were using HA only (61. 6 %) obtained benefit from HA while (38. 4 %) did not get any benefit, as it was concluded from the questionnaires filled by children and their parents. In the sconed study in AL-Amal Institutions i added to my work a clinical part to additional measurement of ear pathology since March 2001 out of 150 boys of the sconed study (2), the result was 55 ears were type B Tympanometry, 18 <b>ears</b> with compact <b>wax</b> and 3 children had perforations and discharge in the ear and of the part in the questionnaires, only (50. 6 %) of them showed benefit of using hearing aid with no big difference between boys in comparison to my first study of the institutions.

5000|$|The story briefly {{discusses}} and re-analyzes {{the famous}} journey of Ulysses {{in which he}} confronts the deadly Sirens. Canonically, Ulysses tied himself to his ship's mast {{so that he could}} experience the Sirens without being driven mad and jumping into the sea. He ordered his crew to stop their <b>ears</b> with <b>wax,</b> so {{that they would not be}} tempted by the siren song to steer the ship into the rocks on which the creatures perched. In Kafka's version, however, Ulysses puts wax in his own ears, and is then tied to the mast. Kafka's telling asserts that the Sirens' silence is an even more deadly weapon than their song, and further states that the Sirens fell silent when they saw the expression of [...] "innocent elation" [...] on Ulysses face. thinks here of Keats's [...] "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard / Are sweeter" [...] ("Ode on a Grecian Urn"). Yet because Ulysses' strategem involved stoppering his ears to block out their singing, Ulysses didn't realize that the Sirens were silent. Finally, Kafka mentions an additional possibility that has been [...] "handed down": that Ulysses knew the Sirens were not singing, but pretended not to notice it in order to protect himself from divine wrath over his victory. But Kafka admits that the human understanding is beyond its depths on this issue.|$|R

5000|$|Characters have {{symbolic}} {{roles to}} fulfill. Though Heracles is abandoned {{at the end}} of Book 1, he continues to haunt the narrative as a background figure, glimpsed in the distance and reported as an active presence, thus symbolizing the way traditional epic offers the poem a literary background. As one scholar recently observed: [...] "This is just the way in which old epic with its generic conventions and its ideology is present in the Argonautica: dimly visible...but still present." [...] Characters also function as the poet's alter ego. Homer in the Odyssey also uses the device, through the singers Demodocus and Phemius. In Argonautica, the role is performed by the doomed seers Mopsus and Idmon, and especially the singer Orpheus. Whereas the companions of Homer's Odysseus pass the Sirens in safety by stuffing their <b>ears</b> with <b>wax,</b> the Argonauts are saved from the Sirens by the music that Orpheus plays to drown them out. Two types of song are represented here, one from the Homeric world, voiced through the Sirens, and the other from the world of Ptolemaic Alexandria, through the identification Orpheus=Apollonius. The contest symbolizes the updating of epic. Apollonius takes the symbolic role of characters further than Homer. The seers Idmon and Mopsus, able to interpret signs, might also be understood to represent the ideal audience, able to interpret symbols. Other characters however can also fulfill this role, such as Peleus, who successfully interprets Jason's encounter with the Libyan nymphs, thus leading to the Argo being carried across the desert. By this means the audience is encouraged to interpret the poet's own complex meanings'heroes' like Peleus are people just like us and their powers of insight are ours too.|$|R

The dog runs at the bread, drags out the mandrake root, and falls dead, killed by the horrible yell of the plant. The root is now taken up, washed with wine, wrapped in silk, laid in a casket, bathed every Friday, 'and clothed in a little new white smock every new moon.' The mandrake acts, if thus considerately treated, as a kind of familiar spirit. 'Every piece of coin put to her over night is found doubled in the morning.' Gipsy folklore, and the folklore of American children, keep this belief in doubling deposits. The gipsies use the notion in what they call 'The Great Trick.' Some foolish rustic makes up his money in a parcel which he gives to the gipsy. The latter, after various ceremonies performed, returns the parcel, which is to be buried. The money will be found doubled by a certain date. Of course when the owner unburies the parcel he finds nothing in it but brass buttons. In the same way, and with pious confidence, the American boy buries a marble in a hollow log, uttering the formula, 'What hasn't come here, come! what's here, stay here!' and expects to find all the marbles he has ever lost. {145} Let us follow the belief in magical roots into the old Pagan world.|$|R
