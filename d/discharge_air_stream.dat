40|$|Biddle is an {{international}} manufacturer and supplier of climate control and climate separation products. The best selling product is the comfort <b>air</b> curtain which <b>discharges</b> a vertical <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> and therefore separates the climate. There is an increasing demand for vertical air curtains and therefore Biddle wants to have an advice about the design direction they should follow in the near future. Therefore, three concepts have been developed and these concepts are compared with each other at four main criteria; construction, flexibility, feasibility and costs. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the concepts are made clear. This gives Biddle insight in different constructions and will lead to an advice about which concept prefers further development and will give Biddle the best future benefits. ...|$|R

Our research is mostly focused on the cross flow velocity influence to flame aerodynamics. The flow simulation is performed as three dimensional along a Cartesian coordinates system. In order to simulate the combustion process, a fast–chemistry model with a 1 –step global irreversible reaction to form CO 2 and H 2 O is used.

5000|$|A thermal wheel {{consists}} of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat-absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and exhaust <b>air</b> <b>streams</b> of an air-handling system. As the thermal wheel rotates, heat is picked up from the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> in {{one half of the}} rotation and given up to the fresh <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> in {{the other half of the}} rotation. Thus waste heat energy from the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> is transferred to the matrix material and then from the matrix material to the fresh <b>air</b> <b>stream,</b> raising the temperature of the supply <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> by an amount proportional to the temperature differential between <b>air</b> <b>streams,</b> or [...] "thermal gradient", and depending upon the efficiency of the device. Heat exchange is most efficient when the streams flow in opposite directions, since this causes a favourable temperature gradient across the thickness of the wheel.

40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} an infl uence of <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> fl ow rates in a modifi ed separator with vertical <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> on purifi cation and separation of selected grain mixture. An {{analysis of the}} obtained data on vertical <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> fl ow intensity revealed great variability of grain separation and purifi cation effi ciency. It was found that both <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> intensity and the way and rate of mixture supply into the working area of the separator had the largest infl uence on the course and effi ciency of particular mixture components separation (particularly of light substances). It was observed that precise regulation of <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> fl ow and its wide variability range allowed for an achievement of very good results of purifi cation and separation of the studied grain mixture. The obtained effects resulted in a positive evaluation of the proposed construction of laboratory separator with vertical <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> for effi cient separation of particular components of grain mixture.

We repeated these experiments, under laminar airflow conditions on a flat surface in a wind tunnel, thereby avoiding variation in wind speed and odour concentration.

40|$|During summer, a {{large number}} of air-conditioners at the same time could be rejecting {{condenser}} heat into a recessed space formed by the external walls outside many high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. Prediction of the temperature and flow field of a powerful rising hot <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> formed in a 30 -story high recessed space is performed by using FLUENT 5. 0, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. For a 30 -story high recessed space of "I" type with four window-type air-conditioner units per story, this paper describes the findings for two depths of the recessed space. For the buoyant <b>air</b> <b>stream,</b> the results show that the mass-flow rate and temperature inside the recessed space are not significantly influenced by the recessed space depth.

In the experiments, achievement of a two-dimensional structure of the smolder zone was attempted, and spread rate, cross-sectional views, and temperature profiles of the smolder zone were examined. It was observed that for forward smolder spread as the <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> velocity increases, the dependence of the spread rate on the <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> velocity increases at first, but above a critical <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> velocity the spread rate becomes almost independent of the <b>air</b> <b>stream</b> velocity and ultimately complete extinction of the smolder zone occurs. This variation is closely related with the variation {{of the structure of}} the smolder zone as seen in cross-sectional views. From the comparison of experimental data, it is inferred that the heat balance around the intersection between the exposed, inclined surface of the char oxidation zone and the top surface of the virgin part of the bed is very important to the smolder spread behavior in a thin and high density fuel layer. The aerodynamic effects in the boundary layer over the smolder zone surface control the spread behavior through heat transfer processes. Key Words...|$|R
