40|$|My use of “integrative ” means {{bringing}} into {{balance the}} 5 significant areas of our functioning making up our experience and existence in this world: physical, emotional, mental, social, and moral. The term integrative <b>is</b> <b>in</b> {{contrast to the}} common current {{use of the term}} meaning mixing, eg, natural medicine with convention-al medicine or chemotherapy with herbs. The current concept underlying medicine, natural science, and psychology is that of cause and effect, or what is known as “determinism. ” For example, the conventional medical frame-work posits that the pneumococcus causes pneumonia. This is a straightforward cause-effect statement blithely accepted without question by the general populace, as well as by other natural sci-entists who champion this model. However, what if the response of the patient upon hearing this “authoritative ” statement was,“By the way, doctor, my dog died this week, my wife left me, I lost my job, and my stock portfolio crashed. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> and have <b>been</b> weeping at all these losses.

I told you what the cause is: it’s the pneumococcus!” The response of the “patient ” highlights the different model I alluded to above. This paradigm is an acausal, non-deterministic model of healthcare, where conclusions are not drawn. Rather, the parts are put together to form a whole picture, where the pieces are integrated, like a mosaic where the different elements are brought together to form a whole. The consequence of this approach promotes healing and overall health benefits.
