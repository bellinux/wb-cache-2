25|$|Dance (from Old French dancier, {{perhaps from}} Frankish) {{generally}} refers to human movement either {{used as a}} form of expression or presented in a social, spiritual or performance setting. Dance is also used to describe methods of non-verbal communication (see body language) between humans or animals (bee dance, mating dance), and motion in inanimate objects (the leaves <b>danced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind). Choreography is the art of creating dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer.|$|E

25|$|During British rule, in the Indian subcontinent, kings {{who were}} the patrons of temples and temple arts lost their power. As a result, devadasis were left without their {{traditional}} means of support and patronage. During colonial times, reformists worked towards outlawing the devadasi tradition on grounds that it supported prostitution. Colonial views on devadasis are hotly disputed by several groups and organizations in India and by western academics. The British were unable to distinguish the devdasi from the girls who <b>danced</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets for the reasons other than spiritual devotion to the deity. This caused socio-economic deprivation and perusal of folk arts.|$|E
25|$|The dances {{accompanying}} theatrical performances {{represent only}} a fraction of the myriad diverse dance styles found across the island. Dance remains a living art and new styles are continually emerging. Many have lent their name to the style of music to which they are <b>danced.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 19th century royal court, the quadrille was danced to Malagasy-influenced piano tunes; the last of these Malagasy quadrilles, called the Afindrafindrao, was composed shortly before colonization and accompanies a specific partner dance. The tune and the dance were revived upon national independence as a distinctly Malagasy tradition now commonly performed to commence festivities such as weddings and concerts.|$|E
