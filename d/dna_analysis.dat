40|$|Background: Primary high-risk human {{papillomavirus}} (hrHPV) testing in cervical cancer screening shows relatively low specificity, which makes triage testing necessary. In this study, <b>DNA</b> methylation <b>analysis</b> was compared with cytology for triage testing in hrHPV-positive women. Moreover, feasibility of <b>DNA</b> methylation <b>analysis</b> directly on brush-based self-sampled specimens was assessed. Methods: Non-responding women from population-based screening {{were invited to}} self-collect a cervico-vaginal specimen for hrHPV testing; hrHPV-positive women were referred to a physician for triage liquid-based cytology. <b>DNA</b> methylation <b>analysis</b> was performed on 128 hrHPV-positive physician-collected triage samples and 50 matched brush self-samples with QMSP for C 13 ORF 18, EPB 41 L 3, JAM 3 and TERT. Results: In physician-taken triage material, <b>DNA</b> methylation <b>analysis</b> of JAM 3 showed the highest combined specificity (88 %) and sensitivity (82 %) for detection of CIN 3 +, whereas cytology showed a specificity of 48 % and a sensitivity of 91 %. Out of 39 women with abnormal cytology and normal histology (false-positive by cytology), 87 % were negative for JAM 3 and 90 % for C 13 ORF 18 methylation. Agreement between <b>DNA</b> methylation <b>analysis</b> performed directly on the matched self-sampled material and physician-taken samples was 88 % for JAM 3 (kappa = 0. 75, P Conclusions: <b>DNA</b> methylation <b>analysis</b> as a triage test in hrHPV-positive women is an attractive alternative to cytology. Furthermore, DNA methylation is feasible directly on brush-based self-samplers and showed good correlation with matched physician-taken samples. Direct molecular triage on self-collected specimens could optimise the screening program, especially for non-responders, as this would {{eliminate the need for}} an additional physician-taken scraping for triage testing...|$|R

5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> {{shows that}} the first three form {{monophyletic}} clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E
5|$|Extinct North American cats {{resembling}} the cheetah had historically {{been assigned to}} Felis, Puma or Acinonyx.

However, in 1998, a <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that Miracinonyx inexpectatus, M.studeri, and M.trumani (early to late Pleistocene epoch), found in North America, are not true cheetahs; in fact, they are close relatives of the cougar.|$|E

40|$|Transcriptional {{activation}} {{and repression}} {{are a key}} step in the regulation of all cellular activities. The development of comprehensive analysis methods such as DNA microarray has advanced {{our understanding of the}} correlation between the regulation of transcription and that of cellular mechanisms.
