The versatility and plasticity of their reproduction and growth are major advantages {{as well as}} draw backs in their use as culture species. The culture of tilapias in ponds, cages, pens and raceways are described and a comparison of <b>extensive</b> and <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> is made.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{bacterial}} canker in plum trees (Prunus domestica) is {{a serious}} and recent problem in plum production. Bacterial canker, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) and pv. morsprunorum (Psm), {{is a serious}} disease of stone fruit, and occurs in all major stone fruit producing areas of the world. The trunks of the affected plum trees are girdled by bacterial cankers resulting in sudden death of infected trees. Rapid tree death has been observed in several orchards 2 - 4 years after planting. Disease incidences can be very high, and sometimes complete orchards have to be removed. Recently, plum cultivation in the Netherlands has changed from a relatively <b>extensive</b> into an <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> This {{was made possible by}} the use of a weak rootstock, Krymsk® 1 (VVA- 1). The lack of chemicals to fight bacterial diseases in the orchards created a need for alternative methods of disease control. To achieve this, methods such as prevention, biological control and plant resistance must be explored and control strategies to manage plum decline have to be developed.

5000|$|A {{summary of}} land {{legislation}} enacted during the Civil Administration shows the efforts made {{to fulfill the}} Mandatory obligation in this matter. The Commission point to serious difficulties {{in connection with the}} legislation proposed by the Palestine Government for the protection of small owners. The Palestine Order in Council and, if necessary, the Mandate should be amended to permit of legislation empowering the High Commissioner to prohibit the transfer of land in any stated area to Jews, so that the obligation to safeguard the right and position of the Arabs may be carried out. Until survey and settlement are complete, the Commission would welcome the prohibition of the sale of isolated and comparatively small plots of land to Jews.Up till now the Arab cultivator has benefited on the whole both from the work of the British Administration and the presence of Jews in the country, but the greatest care must now be exercised to see that in the event of further sales of land by Arabs to Jews the rights of any Arab tenants or cultivators are preserved. Thus, alienation of land should only be allowed where it is possible to replace <b>extensive</b> by <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> In the hill districts there can be no expectation of finding accommodation for any large increase in the rural population. At present, and for many years to come, the Mandatory Power should not attempt to facilitate the close settlement of the Jews in the hill districts generally.The shortage of land is due less to purchase by Jews than to the increase in the Arab population. The Arab claims that the Jews have obtained too large a proportion of good land cannot be maintained. Much of the land now carrying orange groves was sand dunes or swamps and uncultivated when it was bought.Legislation vesting surface water in the High Commissioner is essential. An increase in staff and equipment for exploratory investigations with a view to increasing irrigation is recommended. Report of the Palestine Royal Commission, July 1937 ...|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{bacterial}} canker in plum trees (Prunus domestica) is {{a serious}} and recent problem in plum production. It is caused by Pseudomonas syringae pathovars syringae and morsprunorum. The trunks of the affected plum trees are girdled by bacterial cankers resulting in sudden death of infected trees. A rapid death was observed in several orchards 3 - 4 years after planting. Disease incidences can be very high, and sometimes complete orchards have to be removed. Similar observations have been described in Switzerland (Vignutelli & Hasler, 2001) and Germany (Hinrichs-Berger, 2004). Also, {{in the summer of}} 2011, after a period of hot and dry weather, extensive sudden death was observed in sweet cherry trees (Prunus avium) in commercial orchards. From these trees the Pseudomonas syringae pathovars syringae and morsprunorum were isolated. Recently, plum cultivation in the Netherlands has changed from a relatively <b>extensive</b> into an <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> This was realized by the use of weak rootstocks (e. g. VVA- 1 and St- Julien A). Also, some new plum varieties have been developed (e. g. ‘Lazoet’). However, due to the risks of losses of trees due to bacterial canker, growers are reluctant to plant new plum orchards. Although several control measures are advised in the Netherlands, e. g. cultivation measures at the planting site, careful pruning with disinfection of pruning tools, and removal of heavily infected trees, in practice no control measures are taken. In general nurseries and fruit growers are not familiar with bacterial diseases and lack knowledge in order to prevent infections. Therefore, control strategies to manage plum decline have to be developed. In 2010 a project was started to study the epidemiology and possible control of plum decline. The project will focus on plum decline in commercial plum orchards and plum nurseries. Factors such as root stocks and cultural practices will be evaluated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to assess the soil quality by aggregate indices using the Relative Soil Quality Index (RSQI) proposed by Ho Ngoc Pham. RSQI is integrated from the individual indices into a simple formula for overall assessment of the soil quality. RSQI is different from other approaches. Particularly, the individual indices and the weighting factors of Pham are calculated from the analytical laboratory data and the environmental standards, respectively, and not self-regulated as in methods of some other authors. In this paper, the authors applied the RSQI to assess the Soil Environmental Quality of rice <b>intensive</b> <b>cultivation</b> areas through a case study in Haiduong province in 2013. The RSQI is calculated for sampling points in 12 districts and simulated the Soil Environmental Quality on GIS map.

40|$|Good {{nutritional}} quality {{is a key}} for a successful Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) juvenile producer. Copepods are the natural prey for marine fish larvae, and its nutritional composition {{is believed to be}} optimal for the marine fish larvae. Despite the suitability for copepods in cod cultivation, only a few hatcheries have used this technique. When cultivating cod larvae and copepods intensively they can be produced in larger quantities and year-round, compared to the seasonal <b>extensive</b> <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Intensive</b> produced copepods have yet to be used in large-scale cod hatcheries. It has several times been documented that nutrition is important for survival, growth and the general quality of cod larvae. Even though these variables are something many farmers of juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) are struggling with, there has still not been developed any standard evaluation of quality. Codeggs were divided and after hatching given 4 different feeding regimes (3 - 28 dph). One was fed the copepod Acartia tonsa, a second fed the rotifer Brachionus ibericus enriched, a third fed Brachionus ibericus unenriched and a last with a mixture of copepods (7 days) and enriched rotifers. This was done to better see the effect of copepod feeding compared to the rotifer effect, and if there could be some benefits from only feeding with copepods for a small period. All treatments were fed Artemia sp. (20 - 40 dph) and dry feed (36 - 60 dph). In addition to growth and survival, the quality of the fish larvae was assessed. This was done by using the following quality parameters: Larval feeding activity, resistance to handling stress, skeletal deformations and shape variation. The study showed a clear trend where the larvae fed mostly copepods were the most successful in terms of growth, survival and quality, followed by those fed copepods for 7 days, and enriched and unenriched rotifers at the end. These results clearly showed that intensively cultivated copepods successfully could be used during <b>intensive</b> cod <b>cultivation.</b> All quality parameters gave results and combined gave a broad picture of the general quality of the cod larvae...|$|R
