50|$|Marla brings some herbals for Jessica, as Jessica {{is somehow}} {{affected}} by the dollhouse and is not well, and sneaks one of the voodoo-dolls from the chest in the dollhouse. Todd takes his girlfriend Dana to the shed near their house. There Dana discovers a newspaper clipping, which explains that Bill has built a house {{on top of one}} that burnt down, leaving the fireplace and the chimney as they were. As the teenagers are going to make love, a strange fly comes from the ceiling and bites Dana, and she leaves in hysterics. As Todd tries to kill the fly, he bumps his head on the table and the fly gets into his ear. Luckily, Dana brings Bill just in time to save Todd and get the fly out. The next day, Bill and Claire go out, and Todd is left to babysit Jimmy and Jessica. He sends them to bed and invites Dana over for drinks. While Todd is mixing cocktails in the kitchen, Dana observes the fireplace as bizarre markings appear on her arm. As if in gruesome reply to Jessica's earlier taunt, the dollhouse strikes out again, this time causing Dana's head to burst into flames. Todd is finally able to hear her agonized hysterics over the noise of the blender and rushes to save her, putting out the flames. But he is too late: hideous, disfiguring burns cover Dana's scalp and much of her face. Critically injured, she is taken to the hospital. Anguished and furious, Todd blames his father for the freak accident, as it was believed to be a faulty coil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>line.</b> Later that night, Todd arrives back from the hospital and informs Claire that Dana has entered a coma {{as a result of her}} grievous injuries (it is implied she will not survive the night). Meanwhile, Marla and Tobias are making some kind of witch-craft, using the doll she took from the dollhouse. During the session, the voodoo-doll sits up inside the pentagram (or something else on the table) and makes objects fly around, explode and hit Marla and Tobias. Marla gets hit with a bookcase, and Tobias manages to pierce the doll with his knife. To his surprise, a large fly is extracted from the body of the doll. He rushes to help Marla out from under the bookcase, and as she is freed, she tells him to get to the Martins' immediately.|$|E

A numerical model to predict the temperature field in a hermetic reciprocating compressor for household refrigeration appliances is presented in this work. The model combines a high resolution three-dimensional heat conduction formulation of the compressorâ€™s solid parts, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach for the gas line domain and lumped formulations of the shell gas and the lubrication oil. Heat transfer coefficients are determined by applying CFD to the gas line side and correlations from the literature on the shell gas and oil side, respectively. The valve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>line</b> simulation is modelled as a parallel moving flat plate. By means of an iterative loop the temperature field of the solid parts acts as boundary condition for the CFD calculation of the gas line which returns a cycle averaged quantity of heat to the solid parts. Using an iteration method which is based on the temperature deviation between two iteration steps, the total number of iterations and consequently the computational time can be reduced. The loop is continued until a steady-state temperature field is obtained. Calculated temperatures of the solid parts are verified against temperature measurements of a calorimeter test bench.

The furnace operates by allowing a short natural gas flame to burn over the face of a wall of porous fire brick on two sides of the furnace. Each firing wall uses two main burners and a pilot burner to heat the porous fire brick to a luminous glow. Regulators and orifice valves are used to provide a minimum gas pressure of 4 in. water column at a rate of approximately 1, 450 scf/h to the burners. The gas flow rate was calculated by determining the gas flow appropriate for the instrumentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>line.</b> Observed flame length and vendor literature were used to calculate pilot burner gas consumption. Air for combustion, purging, and cooling is supplied by a single blower. Rough calculations of the air-flow distribution in piping entering the furnace show that air flow to the burners approximately agrees with the calculated natural gas flow. A simple on/off control loop is used to maintain a temperature of 1, 000 F in the furnace chamber.

A single prototype telescope, named MeerLICHT, will already be commissioned early 2017 in Sutherland to provide an optical complement for the MeerKAT radio array. The BG array consists of, initially, a set of 3 robotic 65 -cm wide-field telescopes. Each telescope {{is equipped with a}} single STA 1600 CCD detector with 10. 5 k x 10. 5 k 9 -mum pixels that covers a 2. 7 square degrees field of view. The cryostats for housing these detectors are developed and built at the KU Leuven University. The operational model of BG requires long periods of reliable ands-off operation. Therefore, we designed the cryostats for long vacuum hold time and we make use of a closed-cycle cooling system, based on Polycold PCC Joule-Thomson coolers. A single programmable logic controller (PLC) controls the cryogenic systems of several BG telescopes simultaneously, resulting in a highly reliable, cost-efficient and maintenance-friendly system. PLC-based cryostat control offers some distinct advantages, especially for a robotic facility. Apart of temperature monitoring and control, the PLC also monitors the vacuum quality, the power supply and the status of the PCC coolers (compressor power consumption and temperature, pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> <b>lines,</b> etc.).

Even with a gas mixture of Ar:CO 2 (93 : 7), which was selected for its good ageing properties, ageing effects were observed in test systems.

Electron and argon atom densities of about 8 x 10 to the 16 th and 1 x 10 to the 19 th/cu cm, respectively, were achieved at the relatively low temperature of around 7500 K by vaporizing a cesium powder that had been added to the shock tube as a solid aerosol <b>in</b> argon <b>gas.</b> <b>The</b> measured <b>line</b> widths were predominantly Stark broadened by the electrons and ions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plasma, although Doppler, van der Waals, instrument function and optical depth effects had to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} ozone {{additive}} on {{the enhancement of}} the burning velocity for premixed methane-air flames is investigated by both experimental measurements and kinetic simulations. Laminar burning velocities with and without O(3) were directly measured using the Heat Flux method. The O(3) molecules were introduced into the system by a dielectric-barrier-discharge ozone generator installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> O(2) <b>gas</b> <b>line,</b> which provided prompt control of on/off of the O(3) feed into the system, enabling a precise comparison of the measured burning velocity with and without ozone additives. Noticeable burning velocity enhancement was observed at off-stoichiometric conditions rather than stoichiometric conditions. With 3730 ppm O(3) additive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oxidizer, experimental data shows similar to 8 % burning velocity increase in fuel-rich mixtures and similar to 3. 5 % burning velocity increase for the stoichiometric mixture. With 7000 ppm ozone additive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oxidizer, maximum similar to 16 % burning velocity increase was observed at fuel-lean conditions while similar to 9. 0 % was found at fuel-rich conditions. An O(3) kinetic mechanism involving 16 elementary reactions together with the GRI-Mech 3. 0 was composed and validated through CHEMKIN calculations, which gives good predictions of the burning velocities with and without O(3) additives. Extra O radicals contributed by O(3) molecules <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pre-heat zone initiate and accelerate the chain-branching reactions and consequently increase the burning velocity.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that each {{thruster}} on the SPHERE produces slightly different thrust and behaves differently (see [Chen] and [Berkovitz]). Some methods were developed by [Chen] to compensate for <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> thrust between thrusters and improve the open-loop performance of the SPHERE, but they were yet to be demonstrated. An experiment was performed onboard NASA’s KC- 135, during microgravity periods, to demonstrate the scheme used to compensate for <b>the</b> difference <b>in</b> thrust from each thruster. Objective: 1. Demonstrate the thruster ON-time scaling scheme developed by [Chen] to correct for variations in thrust strength for two thrusters 2. Make <b>the</b> SPHERE translate <b>in</b> a straight line when firing two thrusters on each side of its center of mass Theory: Each SPHERE is equipped with 12 thrusters located on its faces (see figure 1). The thrusters are ON/OFF type (the thrust strength cannot be controlled, but the duration of firing can be controlled). Each thruster produces slightly different thrust because of <b>the</b> small variation <b>in</b> their nozzle exit area and other uncharacterized effects like opening and closing delays and restrictions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gas</b> distribution <b>lines</b> for example. The simple model that will be developed assumes that: 1. The center of mass of the SPHERE corresponds to its geometric center 2. The thrust vectors are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the SPHERE faces 3. The thruster positions are symmetric with respect to the geometric center 4. The thrust vectors produces a moment around only one axis 5. The opening and closing delays of the thrusters are negligibl...|$|R
40|$|A Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 08 Fe 0. 2 O 3 -delta (BSCF) based cathode {{intermediate}} temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) was fabricated and tested. The effect {{of carbon dioxide}} {{on the performance of}} BSCF cathode was evaluated at temperatures ranging from 450 to 750 degrees C. The current density was recorded at a constant discharge of voltage value and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of CO 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oxidant <b>gas</b> <b>line</b> (cathode). It was found that the presence even of relatively small quantities (0. 28 - 3. 07 %) of CO 2 negatively affects the H- 2 -IT-SOFC performance. It was shown that as the CO 2 content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cathode side increases and as the operation temperature decreases, the fuel cell performance is seriously aggravated up to 550 degrees C in a reversible way. A further decrease of the operation temperature deteriorates the SOFC performance irreversibly. However, the cell performance can be recovered after treatment at 800 degrees C in pure oxygen. It was also shown that as the CO 2 content increases, the rate of oxygen electrochemical reduction decreases and the corresponding apparent activation energy increases linearly. The EIS results show that the interface resistance increases dramatically after carbon dioxide is added into <b>the</b> oxidant <b>gas</b> <b>line.</b> It is believed that carbon dioxide and temperature, acting in a synergetic way, decrease at least the cathode activity for oxygen reduction. This behaviour could be attributed to the strong carbon dioxide adsorption on the BSCF surface and to the formation of carbonates at temperatures as low as 500 and 450 degrees C. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.
