40|$|The Queensland Court of Appeal {{recently}} heard a {{case that}} raised the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> on fit injuria. By a majority of 2 : 1 the court held in Leyden v Caboolture Shire Council [2007] QCA 134 (20 April 2007) that the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> was established and defeated the action in negligence for damages for personal injury. The {{facts of the case}} were quite simple. The plaintiff was 15 years old when he was injured at the Bluebell Park which was controlled and managed by the Caboolture Shire Council (the defendant). The park had a BMX track – built and maintained by the defendant. At trial it was held that although the defendant owed a duty of care to entrants, a duty was not owed to the plaintiff. The judge found that the plaintiff was different to other entrants who used facilities provided by a council in a public park. The plaintiff was not relying upon the defendant to provide a BMX track with jumps that were reasonably safe as the evidence was that the track was regularly altered by third parties and the plaintiff knew that. Therefore it was reasoned that the plaintiff was relying upon the ability of the third parties who modified the jump and his own ability to use it, not the ability of the defendant to provide a reasonably safe track (at [10]). The trial judge also held that if a duty was owed, the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> applied so as to defeat the claim for damages. This was based upon the evidence that the plaintiff knew of the modification of the jump by third parties and knew of the risk. It was held that the plaintiff ‘had the appropriate subjective appreciation of the risk’ (at [11]) ...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common defense for the torts of {{trespass}} to the person is that <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria, literally, [...] "to a willing person, no injury is done", but shortened to [...] "consensual privilege" [...] or [...] "consent". If a plaintiff participates in a sporting activity in which physical contact is ordinary conduct, such as rugby, they are considered to have consented. This {{is not the case}} if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected, {{such as the use of}} hand gun during a fistfight, as in Andrepont v. Naquin, or where the injuries were suffered not from the plaintiff's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken, as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control Ltd. Where the plaintiff and defendant voluntarily agree to participate in a fight, some jurisdictions will deny relief in civil action, so long as the injuries caused are proportionate: [...] "in an ordinary fight with fists there is no cause of action to either of combatants for any injury suffered". Other jurisdictions refuse to recognize consent as a defense to mutual combat and instead provide relief under the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> comparative negligence.|$|R
50|$|Woodley v. Metropolitan District Railway Co.: Woodley was set {{to repair}} a wall in a darkened railway tunnel in which trains {{continued}} to run, without warning or dedicated lookout, and with barely sufficient clearance between train and wall for the workman to make himself safe when a train passed. Woodley was seriously injured when he reached across the rail for a tool and {{was struck by a}} passing train. Cockburn CJ held that the employer was not liable, invoking the principle <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria.|$|R
5000|$|In English law, the {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria applies {{not only to}} participants in sport, but also to spectators and to any others who willingly engage in activities {{where there is a}} risk of injury. Consent has also been used as a defense in cases involving accidental deaths during sex, which occur during sexual bondage. Time (May 23, 1988) referred to this latter example, as the [...] "rough-sex defense". It is not effective in English law in cases of serious injury or death.|$|R
50|$|This {{distance}} is typically both determined and {{constrained by the}} proximate edge of clear visibility, {{but it may be}} attenuated to a margin of which beyond hazards may reasonably be expected to spontaneously appear. The rule is the specific spatial case of the common law basic speed rule, and an application <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria. The two-second rule may be the limiting factor governing the ACDA, when the speed of forward traffic is what limits the basic safe speed, and a primary hazard of collision could result from following any closer.|$|R
50|$|The {{court held}} that both drivers had been negligent, and that the {{negligence}} of each was equally to blame. Vorster had been volens in respect of the mechanical hazards, over which the drivers had no reasonable or immediate control; {{he had not been}} volens, however, in respect of the acts of negligence {{on the part of the}} two drivers. The court found, on the evidence, that the collision had been caused by these acts of negligence, not by any defects in the cars themselves; accordingly, the defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> non fit injuria failed.|$|R
50|$|The defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> is now {{excluded}} {{by statute}} where a passenger was injured {{as a result}} of agreeing to take a lift from a drunk car driver. However, in a well-known case of Morris v Murray 1990 3 All ER 801 (Court <b>of</b> Appeal), <b>volenti</b> was held to apply to a drunk passenger, who accepted a lift from a drunk pilot. The pilot died in the resulting crash and the passenger who was injured, sued his estate. Although he drove the pilot to the airfield (which was closed at the time) and helped him start the engine and tune the radio, he argued that he did not freely and voluntarily consent to the risk involved in flying. The Court of Appeal held that there was consent: the passenger was not so drunk as to fail to realise the risks of taking a lift from a drunk pilot, and his actions leading up to the flight demonstrated that he voluntarily accepted those risks.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the first}} case, the {{plaintiff}} was an instructor who was injured while teaching the defendant to drive. The defence <b>of</b> <b>volenti</b> failed: that is, because the plaintiff specifically inquired if the defendant's insurance covered him before agreeing to teach. In the second case, a doctor {{went in to}} try to rescue workmen who were caught in a well after having succumbed to noxious fumes. He did so despite being warned of the danger and told {{to wait until the}} fire brigade arrived. The doctor and the workmen all died. The court held that it would be [...] "unseemly" [...] to hold the doctor to have consented to the risk simply because he acted promptly and bravely in an attempt to save lives.|$|R

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John. Therefore it is necessary to study the terms which mean sin or describe certain aspects of sin in order to discern John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole...|$|R
