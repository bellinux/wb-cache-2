5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

25|$|Hierarchical {{ordering}} of architecture {{is commonly used}} to emphasise particular elements of a design and to create drama. In the Taj Mahal, the hierarchical use of red sandstone and white marble contributes manifold symbolic significance. The Mughals were elaborating on a concept which traced its roots to earlier Hindu practices, {{set out in the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana, which recommended white stone for buildings for the Brahmins (priestly caste) and red stone for members of the Kshatriyas (warrior caste). By building structures that employed such colour-coding, the Mughals identified themselves with the two leading classes of Indian social structure and thus defined themselves as rulers in Indian terms. Red sandstone also had significance in the Persian origins of the Mughal empire where red was the exclusive colour of imperial tents. In the Taj Mahal the relative <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> building in the complex is denoted by the amount of white marble (or sometimes white polished plaster) that is used.|$|E

2500|$|Tectonic {{plates are}} able to move because the Earth's {{lithosphere}} has greater mechanical strength than the underlying asthenosphere. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection; that is, the slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. Plate movement {{is thought to be}} driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from spreading ridges due to variations in topography (the ridge is a topographic high) and density changes in the crust (density increases as newly formed crust cools and moves away from the ridge). At subduction zones the relatively cold, dense crust is [...] "pulled" [...] or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by tidal forces of the Sun and Moon. The relative <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, {{there is}} {{extensive}} statistical evidence from so-called [...] "fingerprint" [...] studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as {{each person has}} a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate {{changes that have occurred}} {{since the start of the}} Industrial Revolution are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} feature of a FROG measurement is that many more data points are collected than are strictly necessary to find the pulse electric field. [...] For example, say that the measured trace consists of 128 points in the delay direction and 128 points in the frequency direction. [...] There are 128×128 total points in the trace. [...] Using these points, an electric field is retrieved that has 2×128 points (128 for magnitude and another 128 for the phase). [...] This is a massively overdetermined system, meaning {{that the number of}} equations is much larger than the number of unknowns. [...] Thus the <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> individual data point being absolutely correct is greatly reduced. [...] This is very helpful for real-world measurements that can be affected by detector noise and systematic errors. [...] Noise is extremely unlikely to affect the measured trace in a way that could be confused with a physical phenomenon in the pulse. [...] The FROG algorithm tends to “see through” these effects due to the amount of extra information available and the use of a mathematical form constraint in finding a solution. [...] This means that the error between an experimental FROG trace and a retrieved FROG trace is rarely zero, although it should be quite small for traces without systematic errors.|$|E
