60|$|A <b>hand-lamp</b> was lit and {{the boys}} began a {{systematic}} inspection of the Lodge. They found nothing disturbed {{in most of the}} rooms, but when they inspected the library all set up a shout.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Westover, {{and the boy}} hulked {{in before}} him, {{vanishing}} into {{the dark of the}} interior, and presently appeared with a lighted <b>hand-lamp.</b> He led the way upstairs to a front room looking down upon the porch roof and over toward Zion's Head, which Westover could see dimly outlined against the night sky, when he lifted the edge of the paper shade and peered out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou wilt have no Mystery and Mysticism; wilt {{walk through}} thy {{world by the}} {{sunshine}} of what thou callest Truth, or even by the <b>hand-lamp</b> of what I call Attorney-Logic; and 'explain' all, 'account' for all, or believe nothing of it? Nay, thou wilt attempt laughter; whoso recognizes the unfathomable, all-pervading domain of Mystery, which is everywhere under our feet and among our hands; to whom the Universe is an Oracle and Temple, {{as well as a}} Kitchen and Cattle-stall,--he shall be a delirious Mystic; to him thou, with sniffing charity, wilt protrusively proffer thy <b>hand-lamp,</b> and shriek, as one injured, when he kicks his foot through it?--Armer Teufel! Doth not thy cow calve, doth not thy bull gender? Thou thyself, wert thou not born, wilt thou not die? 'Explain' me all this, or do one of two things: Retire into private places with thy foolish cackle; or, what were better, give it up, and weep, not that the reign of wonder is done, and God's world all disembellished and prosaic, but that thou hitherto art a Dilettante and sand-blind Pedant." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{refilled}} {{the shallow}} <b>hand-lamps,</b> and while I did so Orme took some hasty observations {{of which he}} jotted down the results in his pocket-book.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the running}} of fast through trains at full speed through such a storm..without the {{adoption}} of extra precautions, such as the detention of slower trains, the use of <b>hand-lamps</b> in the signal-cabins, and the employment of platelayers at the signals ...|$|R
60|$|Hurriedly {{they carried}} their few {{belongings}} into the cave. First they took {{most of the}} little store of food that remained, the three <b>hand-lamps</b> and all the paraffin; there was but one tin. Then returning they fetched the bucket, the ammunition, and their clothes. Afterwards, as {{there was still no}} sign of Meyer, they even dared to drag in the waggon tent to make a shelter for Benita, and all the wood that they had collected for firing. This proved a wearisome business, for the logs were heavy, and in his crippled state Mr. Clifford could carry no great burden. Indeed, towards the end Benita was forced to complete the task alone, while he limped beside her with his rifle, lest Jacob should surprise them.|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} gone, and Lydia and Staniford had said good-night, and Miss Maria, {{coming in from}} the kitchen with a <b>hand-lamp</b> for her father, {{approached}} the marble-topped centre-table to blow out the large lamp of pea-green glass with red woollen wick, which had shed the full radiance of a sun-burner upon the festival, she faltered at a manifest unreadiness in the old man to go to bed, though the fire was low, and they had both resumed the drooping carriage of people in going about cold houses. He looked excited, and, so far as his unpracticed visage could intimate the emotion, joyous.|$|E
60|$|Messire de Maletroit bowed, and {{proceeded}} to limp about the apartment, clearing his throat the while with that odd musical chirp which had already grown so irritating in the ears of Denis de Beaulieu. He first possessed himself of some papers which lay upon the table; {{then he went to}} the mouth of the passage and appeared to give an order to the men behind the arras; and lastly he hobbled out through the door by which Denis had come in, turning upon the threshold to address a last smiling bow to the young couple, and followed by the chaplain with a <b>hand-lamp.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It was a janitress, large, fat, {{with her}} arms wound up in her apron, who {{received}} them there. Mrs. March gave her a succinct but perfect statement of their needs. She failed to grasp the nature of them, or feigned to do so. She shook her head, and said that her son would show them the flat. There was a radiator visible in the narrow hall, and Isabel tacitly compromised on steam heat without an elevator, as the flat was only one flight up. When the son appeared from below with a small kerosene <b>hand-lamp,</b> {{it appeared that the}} flat was unfurnished, but there was no stopping him till he had shown it in all its impossibility. When they got safely away from it and into the street March said: [...] "Well, have you had enough for to-night, Isabel? Shall we go to the theatre now?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly {{there was}} the all-pervading stench and the {{intolerable}} heat of the place, since no breath of air could penetrate that forest of reeds, while a minor trouble {{was that of the}} multitude of leeches which fastened on to our bodies. By looking one could see the creatures sitting on the under side of leaves with their heads stretched out waiting to attack anything that went by. As wayfarers there could not have been numerous, I wondered what they had lived on for the last few thousand years. By the way, I found that paraffin, of which we had a small supply for our <b>hand-lamps,</b> rubbed over all exposed surfaces, was to some extent a protection against these blood-sucking worms and the gnats, although it did make one go about smelling like a dirty oil tin.|$|R
6000|$|The talk {{went on as}} lopsidedly as before, and I {{began to}} get sleepy. I made bold to yawn, but Alderling did not mind that, and then I made bold to say that I thought I would go to bed. He {{followed}} me indoors, saying {{that he would go}} to bed, too. The hall was lighted from a hanging-lamp and two clear-burning <b>hand-lamps</b> which the widow had put for us on a small table. She had evidently gone home, and left us to ourselves. He took one lamp and I the other, and he started up stairs before me. If he were not coming down again, he meant to let the hanging-lamp burn, and I had nothing to say about that; but I suggested, concerning the wide-open door behind me, [...] "Shall I close the door, Alderling?" [...] and he answered, without looking round, [...] "I don't shut it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. [...] "Let him learn Arithmetic, Mathematics, Artillery,--Economy to {{the very}} bottom." [...] And, in short, useful {{knowledge}} generally; useless ditto not at all. [...] "History in particular;--Ancient History only slightly (NUR UBERHIN);--but the History of the last hundred and fifty Years to the exactest pitch. The JUS NATURALE and JUS GENTIUM," [...] by way of <b>hand-lamp</b> to History, [...] "he must be completely master of; as also of Geography, whatever is remarkable in each Country. And in Histories, most especially the History {{of the house of}} Brandenburg; where he will find domestic examples, which are always of more force than foreign. And along with Prussian History, chiefly that of the Countries which have been connected with it, as England, Brunswick, Hessen and the others. And in reading of wise History-books there must be considerations made (sollen beym Lesen kluger Historiarum Betrachtungen gemacht werden) upon the causes of the events."--Surely, O King! ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was more}} than three weeks before the {{contents}} of the library were all packed and carried away. And Romola, instead of shutting her eyes and ears, had watched the process. The exhaustion consequent on violent emotion is apt to bring a dreamy disbelief in the reality of its cause; and in the evening, when the workmen were gone, Romola took her <b>hand-lamp</b> and walked slowly round amongst the confusion of straw and wooden cases, pausing at every vacant pedestal, every well-known object laid prostrate, with a sort of bitter desire to assure herself that there was a sufficient reason why her love was gone and the world was barren for her. And still, as the evenings came, she went and went again; no longer to assure herself, but because this vivifying of pain and despair about her father's memory was the strongest life left to her affections. On the 23rd of December, she knew that the last packages were going. She ran to the loggia {{at the top of the}} house that she might not lose the last pang of seeing the slow wheels move across the bridge.|$|E
60|$|He went boldly to {{the door}} and knocked with an assured hand. On both {{previous}} occasions, he had knocked timidly and with some dread of attracting notice; but now when he had just discarded the thought of a burglarious entry, knocking at a door seemed a mighty simple and innocent proceeding. The sound of his blows echoed through the house with thin, phantasmal reverberations, as though it were quite empty; but these had scarcely died away before a measured tread drew near, a couple of bolts were withdrawn, and one wing was opened broadly, as though no guile or fear of guile were known to those within. A tall figure of a man, muscular and spare, but a little bent, confronted Villon. The head was massive in bulk, but finely sculptured; the nose blunt at the bottom, but refining upward to where it joined a pair of strong and honest eyebrows; the mouth and eyes surrounded with delicate markings, and the whole face based upon a thick white beard, boldly and squarely trimmed. Seen as it was by the light of a flickering <b>hand-lamp,</b> it looked perhaps nobler than it had a right to do; but it was a fine face, honourable rather than intelligent, strong, simple, and righteous.|$|E
6000|$|... 'His {{feet were}} glued to that remote spot {{and his eyes}} to their indistinct group bowed {{together}} and swaying strangely in the common torment of fear. A <b>hand-lamp</b> lashed to a stanchion above a little table rigged up on the bridge--the Patna had no chart-room amidships--threw a light on their labouring shoulders, on their arched and bobbing backs. They pushed at {{the bow of the}} boat; they pushed out into the night; they pushed, and would no more look back at him. They had given him up as if indeed he had been too far, too hopelessly separated from themselves, to be worth an appealing word, a glance, or a sign. They had no leisure to look back upon his passive heroism, to feel the sting of his abstention. The boat was heavy; they pushed at the bow with no breath to spare for an encouraging word: but the turmoil of terror that had scattered their self-command like chaff before the wind, converted their desperate exertions into a bit of fooling, upon my word, fit for knockabout clowns in a farce. They pushed with their hands, with their heads, they pushed for dear life with all the weight of their bodies, they pushed with all the might of their souls--only no sooner had they succeeded in canting the stem clear of the davit than they would leave off like one man and start a wild scramble into her. As a natural consequence the boat would swing in abruptly, driving them back, helpless and jostling against each other. They would stand nonplussed for a while, exchanging in fierce whispers all the infamous names they could call to mind, and go at it again. Three times this occurred. He described it to me with morose thoughtfulness. He hadn't lost a single movement of that comic business. [...] "I loathed them. I hated them. I had to look at all that," [...] he said without emphasis, turning upon me a sombrely watchful glance. [...] "Was ever there any one so shamefully tried?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The railway workers {{involved}} {{were badly}} shaken - some admitted {{it took them}} {{a few minutes to}} fully gather their wits [...] but the guards (whose duty it was to 'protect their train') were affected to a lesser extent. The guard of the express walked back up the up line towards Wood Walton, laying fog-signals (detonators) on the rails to warn any further trains to stop. Despite the signals showing 'all clear', the Manchester express stopped in response to the Wood Walton signalman using a <b>hand-lamp</b> to show a red light from his signal-box. It finally pulled up beyond the Wood Walton down distant signal; the Abbots Ripton up distant signal could be seen ahead showing the clear white “all clear”. It then proceeded cautiously towards Abbots Ripton, being stopped successively by the Scotsman guard waving a red <b>hand-lamp</b> and then by a platelayer, eventually drawing up {{at the rear of the}} wrecked Scotsman.|$|E
5000|$|The Scotch express {{had left}} Peterborough at 6.24, about 6 minutes late. It did not slacken speed {{for the bad}} weather; it passed through Holme at about 6.37, the signals all showing clear, and arrived at Wood Walton at 6.40. The {{signalman}} there had set his signal levers to put his signals to 'danger' to protect the shunting at Abbots Ripton, but had not left his levers to set detonators at the home signal, nor did he supplement his fixed signals by displaying a <b>hand-lamp</b> from the signal box. He told the inquiry he was busy stopping a train of empty coal wagons on the down line, {{and because of the}} weather he did not hear the express until it ran past his cabin at full speed. At 6.44 the Scotsman reached Abbots Ripton, its driver having seen [...] "nothing but white lights all the way from Peterboro". It was at full speed (40-45 mph) when it crashed into the coal train, which had not yet cleared the main line. Some coal wagons were smashed, but the coal train engine itself was largely unscathed. The express engine derailed and veered to the right. It ended up lying on its side, beyond the down line. Behind it, its tender and two passenger carriages were obstructing the down line.|$|E
