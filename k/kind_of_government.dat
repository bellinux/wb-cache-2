25|$|Charles {{inherited}} the Portuguese Restoration War {{and soon after}} his accession Spain was plunged into the War of Devolution with France in the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté. As regent, Mariana managed the country's affairs {{through a series of}} favourites ("validos"), whose merits usually amounted to no more than meeting her fancy. Her validos included her confessor, Juan Everardo Nithard, whom she made Grand Inquisitor in 1666, and which gave him access to the Regency Council, from where he became the most important person of the Spanish Court. From then on he was the de facto prime minister or valido of Spain. The sheer size of the kingdom at that time made this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> increasingly damaging to the realm's affairs. By 1668, Nithard was desperate to reduce Spain's military commitments at almost any price, and to end the Portuguese Restoration War; so he accepted the loss of the Crown of Portugal and formally recognized the sovereignty of the House of Braganza by signing the Treaty of Lisbon. The treaty ceded the North African enclave of Ceuta to Spain, but marked the loss of Portugal and the Portuguese colonies. To end the War of Devolution, Nithard signed the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). However, the members of the Councils and in particular Charles's illegitimate half-brother John, a popular military commander, started intriguing to overthrow the queen-regent's favorite. In February 1669, a military revolt in Aragon and Catalonia led by John, who then proceeded to march toward Madrid, brought about Nithard's dismissal.|$|E
500|$|The Zhuangzi vigorously opposes formal government, which Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have felt was {{problematic}} at its foundation [...] "because of the opposition between man and nature." [...] The text tries to show that [...] "as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness." [...] It is unclear if Zhuangzi's positions were [...] "tantamount to anarchy, and he {{was by no means}} in favor of violence." [...] The political references in the Zhuangzi are more concerned with what government should not do rather than what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> should exist.|$|E

Although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have, through self-betterment, the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> which “governs not at all”, he distanced himself from contemporary “no-government men” (anarchists), writing: “I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Thoreau is {{sometimes}} referred to as an anarchist. Though [...] "Civil Disobedience" [...] seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—"I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government"—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism: [...] "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> which they will have." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Podemos {{wanted to}} avoid being singled out as the main party {{responsible}} for triggering new elections, Podemos' leaders adopted a rapprochement and reconciliation strategy with PSOE. After a brief meeting with Sánchez to resume negotiations on 30 March, Iglesias {{announced that he was}} willing to give up the post of Deputy Prime Minister in any prospective PSOE–Podemos coalition government in order to ease relations between the two parties. Podemos also accepted a three-way negotiation with C's, although PSOE and Podemos still differed in their visions of the role Rivera's party should take. While Podemos still refused to enter or support any government in which C's was directly involved, they accepted that they could work together on given issues. PSOE, for its part, maintained its wish for a [...] "broad spectrum government" [...] with the support of all three parties, though still without clarifying what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> was being sought or if all three parties would be part of it. The three parties agreed to hold a meeting on 7 April to start government formation talks, to which Iglesias would attend himself.|$|E

This access will help to better the welfare of the citizens. In addition, the advancement of information and communication technology spurs economic growth by making the market more efficient, which ultimately generates more income for the poor and reduces poverty in the economy.|$|R
60|$|The second <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> is deliberative; {{but in its}} deliberation, {{representative}} only of {{the thoughts}} and {{will of the people}} or nation, and liable to be deposed the instant it ceases to express those thoughts and that will. This, whatever its form, whether centered in a king or in any number of men, is properly to be called Democratic. The third and highest <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> is deliberative, not as representative of the people, but as chosen to take separate counsel for them, and having power committed to it, to enforce upon them whatever resolution it may adopt, whether consistent with their will or not. This government is properly to be called Monarchical, whatever its form.|$|E

40|$|Two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> {{intervention}} in the land market are considered. The first is the control of development, of which the most studied form is zoning, but we also consider the designation of conservation areas {{and the effects of}} growth controls. Growth control may raise the price of land, allowing an infrastructure charge to be made or growth may be limited by charging impact fees. The second <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> intervention aims to increase the supply of land, either by direct action, as in the Netherlands, through compulsory purchase or eminent domain, or through the reallocation of land ownership as in land readjustment schemes. ...|$|R

And, in that blessed State, police will be as much a superfluity as every other <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

Local war-lords should pop up all over the place. We want to have weapons available for them and ships starting now to reach them in time. Eventually we hope to provide a unifying principle around which the colonies can all collect. Our interest is more economic than political.

6000|$|I heartily {{accept the}} motto, [...] "That {{government}} is best which governs least"; and I {{should like to}} see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe--"That government is best which governs not at all"; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure.|$|E

60|$|The Carrib {{mother who}} squeezes her child's head into a shape {{like that of}} the chief; the young savage who makes marks on himself similar to the scars carried by the warriors of his tribe (which is {{probably}} the origin of tattooing); the Highlander who adopts the plaid worn by the head of his clan; the courtiers who affect greyness, or limp, or cover their necks, in imitation of their king; and the people who ape the courtiers; are alike acting under a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> connate with that of Manners, and, like it too, primarily beneficial. For notwithstanding the numberless absurdities into which this copyism has led the people, from nose-rings to ear-rings, from painted faces to beauty-spots, from shaven heads to powdered wigs, from filed teeth and stained nails to bell-girdles, peaked shoes, and breeches stuffed with bran,--it must yet be concluded, that as the strong men, the successful men, the men of will, intelligence, and originality, who have got to the top, are, on the average, more likely to show judgment in their habits and tastes than the mass, the imitation of such is advantageous.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{a strange}} fallacy running at this time through all [...] talk about free trade. It is {{continually}} assumed that every [...] <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Government</b> interference takes away liberty of trade. [...] Whereas liberty is lost only when interference hinders, not [...] when it helps. You do not take away a man's freedom by [...] showing him his road--nor by making it smoother for him (not [...] that it is always desirable to do so, but it may be); nor [...] even by fencing it for him, {{if there is an}} open ditch at the [...] side of it. The real mode in which protection interferes [...] with liberty, and the real evil of it, is not in its [...] "protecting" [...] one person, but in its hindering another; a [...] form of interference which invariably does most mischief to [...] the person it is intended to serve, which the Northern [...] Americans are about discomfortably to discover, unless they [...] think better of it. There is also a ludicrous confusion in [...] many persons' minds between protection and encouragement; [...] they differ materially. [...] "Protection" [...] is saying to [...] the commercial schoolboy, [...] "Nobody shall hit you." [...] "Encouragement," [...] is saying to him, [...] "That's the way to [...] hit." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{these three}} forms are not only, in practice, {{variously}} limited and combined, but capable of infinite difference in character and use, receiving specific names {{according to their}} variations; which names, being nowise agreed upon, nor consistently used, either in thought or writing, no man can at present tell, in speaking of any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> whether he is understood, nor in hearing whether he understands. Thus we usually call a just government by one person a monarchy, and an unjust or cruel one, a tyranny; this might be reasonable if it had reference to the divinity of true government; but to limit the term [...] "oligarchy" [...] to government by a few rich people, and to call government by a few wise or noble people [...] "aristocracies," [...] is evidently absurd, unless it were proved that rich people never could be wise, or noble people rich; and farther absurd because there are other distinctions in character, as well as riches or wisdom (greater purity of race, or strength of purpose, for instance), which may give the power of government to the few. So {{that if we had}} to give names to every group or kind of minority, we should have verbiage enough. But there is one right name--"oligarchy." ...|$|E
50|$|Despite recent {{controversy}} on this topic, {{the conclusions}} {{that can be}} drawn are in keeping with economic intuition. Environmental and revenue-raising taxes are complementary tools for achieving two different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> goals: the provision of public goods with revenue-motivated taxes {{and the protection of}} environmental quality with corrective taxes. Indeed, the joint pursuit of these two goals through taxation can enable government to justify doing more of each by making the optimal environmental tax higher than it would be otherwise, and by lowering the distortionary cost of financing the provision of public goods.|$|R
60|$|A fourth fact, {{akin to the}} foregoing, is, {{that these}} several <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> not only decline together, but corrupt together. By the same process that a Court of Chancery becomes a place not for the {{administration}} of justice, but for the withholding of it--by the same process that a national church, from being an agency for moral control, comes to be merely a thing of formulas and tithes and bishoprics--by this same process do titles and ceremonies that once had a meaning and a power become empty forms.|$|R
