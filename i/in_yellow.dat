5|$|In {{addition}} to {{meeting the needs}} of the British forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like Violet Club were no longer required, as Project E weapons could do the job pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only lighter than the British Green Grass warhead used <b>in</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sun, but remarkably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version of the Mark 28 was developed, known as Red Snow, and a Yellow Sun Mark 2 using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with Green Grass.|$|E

Whales historically seen <b>in</b> <b>Yellow</b> Sea could have been distinct from outer Pacific populations due to their smaller size of around 20m or more at near maximum, and breeding season in these regions was mainly in winter.|$|E

40|$|The {{insufficient}} {{water and}} excessive sediment, {{along with the}} non-harmonious combination of their processes, {{cause a lot of}} problems for the Yellow River and its reservoirs, including the severe sedimentation in Sanmenxia reservoir, the rising of Tongguan elevation, the perched river <b>in</b> the lower <b>Yellow</b> River. How to lower the Tongguan elevation and alleviate the sedimentation <b>in</b> the lower <b>Yellow</b> River becomes {{one of the most important}} issues <b>in</b> managing the <b>Yellow</b> River. This paper gives an overall summary of the recent researches on the key problems of sediment <b>in</b> the <b>Yellow</b> River by the authors and tries to form a comparatively complete conception of managing sedimentation <b>in</b> the <b>Yellow</b> River and reservoirs. The paper is firstly to give a brief introduction to the numerical model and its calibration and verification. Its applications in solving the key sediment problems <b>in</b> the <b>Yellow</b> River are then illustrated, which include the relationship between the operational modes of Sanmenxia reservoir and the change of Tongguan elevation, the effect of large-scale hydraulic projects on the sedimentation reduction <b>in</b> the lower <b>Yellow</b> River, and the critical equilibrium index of sedimentation <b>in</b> the lower <b>Yellow</b> River...|$|R
5|$|Kashyap's {{production}} company Anurag Kashyap Films released its first film Udaan (2010)—a critical success that {{earned him the}} Filmfare Award for Best Story and Best Screenplay. He then directed one of the short films in the anthology film Mumbai Cutting. In 2011, he acted in Tigmanshu Dhulia's crime thriller Shagird, portraying {{the role of the}} antagonist. After directing the thriller That Girl <b>in</b> <b>Yellow</b> Boots (2011), the two-part crime film Gangs of Wasseypur (2012) was his next release, which garnered him the Filmfare Award for Best Dialogue. In 2013, he directed a short film on eve teasing titled That Day After Everyday, and directed one segment of the anthology film Bombay Talkies (2013). In 2013, he co-produced The Lunchbox, a film that was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and the biographical drama Shahid. In 2011, Kashyap started another {{production company}} Phantom Films, whose first feature was the period drama Lootera (2013).|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} {{for use as}} gemstones {{are grown}} by HPHT or CVD methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market. However, {{there are indications that}} the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale. They are available <b>in</b> <b>yellow</b> and blue, {{and to a lesser extent}} colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue color comes from boron. Other colors, such as pink or green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels. Boron {{is used in}} pyrotechnic initiator compositions (for igniting other hard-to-start compositions), and in delay compositions that burn at a constant rate. Boron carbide {{has been identified as}} a possible replacement for more toxic barium or hexachloroethane mixtures in smoke munitions, signal flares and fireworks. Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; <b>in</b> <b>yellow</b> smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E

5|$|The time in Arles {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich <b>in</b> <b>yellow,</b> ultramarine and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E
5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether lipids, whereas bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester lipids. The {{difference is the}} type of bond that joins the lipids to the glycerol moiety; the two types are shown <b>in</b> <b>yellow</b> in the figure at the right. In ester lipids this is an ester bond, whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids, but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not a major part of their membranes.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting <b>in</b> <b>yellow</b> discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
