40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to support the development of the commercial vehicle <b>electric</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake.</b> Though nowadays widely used on passenger cars, <b>electric</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> applications on commercial vehicles present completely different challenges. With the brake mass, thermal capacity and required clamp forces an order of magnitude higher, safe parking demands much more attention. In the first instance, the priority is placed upon predicting heat dissipation from the brake disc only. The research is presented in two parts; part one (presented here) focuses on analytical modelling and experimental verification of predicted disc temperatures over long cooling periods, with part two investigating the air flow, velocities and convective heat transfer coefficients using computational fluid dynamics modelling, also followed by experimental validations. To begin the analytical analysis, a study was conducted into the variance in mean local convective heat transfer coefficients over a simplified brake disc friction surface, by investigating typical dimensionless air properties. A nonlinear equation was derived for the average surface convective heat transfer coefficient (h conv hconv) variability with temperature drop for the entire cooling phase. Starting from fundamental principles, first-order differential equations were developed to predict the bulk disc temperature. By including variation of the convective and radiative heat dissipation throughout the cooling period, a good correlation was achieved with measured values, to within 10 %. Experiments were conducted on a specifically designed thermal rig which uses 15 [*]kW induction heater to heat the disc. Numerous experiments proved the results are very repeatable, throughout the cooling period. It was established, for the grey cast iron brake disc with a fully oxidised surface, the emissivity value are practically constant at ɛ[*]=[*] 0. 92. Although {{the research}} is being conducted on a brake disc, the results have generic application to any disc geometry, whatever the application...|$|E
40|$|Following {{from the}} {{analytical}} modelling presented in Part 1, this paper details a comprehensive {{computational fluid dynamics}} modelling of the three-dimensional flow field around, and heat dissipation from, a stationary brake disc. Four commonly used turbulence models were compared and the shear stress turbulence model {{was found to be}} most suitable for these studies. Inferior cooling of the anti-coning disc type is well known but the core cause in static conditions was only now established. The air flow exiting the lower vane channels at the inner rotor diameter changes direction and flows axially over the hat region. This axial flow acts as a blocker to the higher vane inlets, drastically reducing convective cooling from the upper half of the disc. The complexity of disc stationary cooling is further caused by the change of flow patterns during disc cooling. The above axial flow effects slowly vanish as the disc temperatures reduce. Consequently, convective heat transfer coefficients are affected by both, the change in the flow pattern and decrease in air velocities due to reduced air buoyancy as the disc cools down. As in Part 1, the special thermal rig was used to validate the computational fluid dynamics results quantitatively and qualitatively. The former used numerous thermocouples positioned strategically around the brake disc, with the latter introducing the concept of laser generated light plane combined with a smoke generator to enable flow visualisation. Predicted average heat transfer coefficients using computational fluid dynamics correlate well with the experimental values, and even two-dimensional analytical values (as presented in Part 1) reasonably closely follow the trends. The results present an important step in establishing cooling characteristics related to the <b>electric</b> <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> application in commercial vehicles, with future publications detailing heat transfer from the entire brake assembly...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{expected}} that these systems will incorporate other features in the future. Jaguar, Landrover, BMW, Renault, Subaru and VW already have a system where the <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> engages when the engine is stopped and is released when the gas pedal is pressed. An extension of this system, called the hill-hold function, prevents roll-back when stopping and starting on a hill. The OEM can easily turn off the system. Some <b>electric</b> <b>park</b> <b>brakes</b> function similar to [...] "park" [...] on an automatic transmission and will not engage when the vehicle is in motion, there is no emergency brake in this case.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>park</b> brakes: The [...] "hill hold" [...] {{functionality}} takes {{input from}} the car's tilt sensor (also used by the burglar alarm) and the road speed sensors (also used by the ABS, engine control and traction control) via the CAN bus {{to determine if the}} car is stopped on an incline.

25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes.</b> Power assisted <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional <b>parking</b> <b>brakes,</b> but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> easier. When releasing the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} important safety subsystems in a vehicle. Its main function is to hold a vehicle in position when parks on a flat or slope road. A typical problem of the mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system is that it requires a driver to apply sufficient or sometimes high pulling force to keep the vehicle stationary at any road slopes. Insufficient pulling force may cause the vehicle to move away or known as rollaway phenomenon. In order to overcome such an issue, an electro-mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> (EMPB) is proposed and developed. The EMPB system is then tested using in-house <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> test bench. It is found that the EMPB takes within 0. 6 s to fully engage and within 0. 5 s to disengage the system, respectively at 11. 3 degrees of the road slope. Thus, current design of an EMPB system can prevent rollaway problem and also can be used as alternative replacement for the existing fully mechanical <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> system...|$|R

25|$|Power {{operated}} <b>parking</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|R
