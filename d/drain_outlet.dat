40|$|Phosphorus {{eutrophication}} {{of lakes}} and streams, coming from drained farmlands, {{is a serious}} problem in areas with intensive agriculture. Installation of phosphate (P) sorbing filters at <b>drain</b> <b>outlets</b> may be a solution. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the understanding of reactions involved in P sorption by three commercial P sorbing materials, i. e. Ca/Mg oxide-based Filtralite-P, Fe oxide-based CFH- 12 and Limestone in two particle sizes (2 - 1 mm and 1 - 0. 5 mm), by means of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), sorption isotherms, sequential extractions and SEM-EDS. The results indicate that P retention by CFH is due to surface complexation by rapid formation of strong Fe-P bonds. In contrast, retention of P by Filtralite-P and Limestone strongly depends on pH and time and is interpreted due to formation of calcium phosphate precipitate(s). Consequently, CFH can unambiguously be recommended as P retention filter material in <b>drain</b> <b>outlets,</b> whereas the use of Filtralite-P and Limestone has certain (serious) limitations. Thus, Filtralite-P has high capacity to retain P but only at alkaline pH (pH≥ 10) and P retention by Limestone requires long-time contact and a high ratio between sorbent and sorbate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Unsealed {{roads are}} {{necessary}} infrastructure required to manage forested catchments. They form linear {{features in the}} landscape that intersect, concentrate and redirect flow paths which can alter catchment hydrology and in-stream water quality. However, water quality is only affected if runoff and sediment generated on the roads are delivered to the streams. Road runoff and eroded sediment can enter the stream at 1) stream crossings, 2) via gullies at drain outlets that concentrate the flow {{all or part of}} the way to the stream, or 3) via diffuse overland flow. Hairsine et al. (2002) developed a simple probabilistic model for diffuse overland flow. It uses the concept of the ‘volume to breakthrough’, which is the volume of runoff required to enter an area before discharge is observed at the downslope boundary of that area. The model only requires variables of distance of <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> from the stream, road contributing area (or road length), road infiltration rate and a designer rainfall event to calculate runoff volume. The model has been applied to a number of forest catchments to assess the adequacy of road drainage. Where road drainage is determined to be inadequate, the model can be used to determine the location of “new drains ” by maximizing contributing road area as determined by the distance the <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> is from the stream. However, this method results in many new drains being placed close to existing drains along road segments. The aim of this paper is to describe a new model that optimizes the placement of new drains along unseale...|$|E

As a result, there is an urgent need in the mining industry for proper understanding of underground filling practices and in particular the use of hydraulic filling.

A bacterial strain being capable of degrading O,O-dialkyl phosphorothioate and O,O-dialkyl phosphate insecticides, designated as G 1, was isolated from sludge collected at the <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> of a chlorpyrifos manufacture plant. Physiological and biochemical characteristics and 16 S rDNA gene sequence analysis suggested that strain G 1 belongs to the genus Stenotrophomonas. At an initial concentration of 50 mg/L, strain G 1 degraded 100 % of methyl parathion, methyl paraoxon, diazinon, and phoxim, 95 % of parathion, 63 % of chlorpyrifos, 38 % of profenofos, and 34 % of triazophos in 24 h. Orthogonal experiments showed that the optimum conditions were an inoculum volume of 20 % (v/v), a substrate concentration of 50 mg/L, and an incubation temperature in 40 °C. p-Nitrophenol was detected as the metabolite of methyl parathion, for which intracellular methyl parathion hydrolase was responsible. Strain G 1 can efficiently degrade eight organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) and is a very excellent candidate for applications in OP pollution remediation...|$|E
40|$|Unsealed {{roads and}} tracks are {{acknowledged}} {{as the major}} sources of sediment pollution in forested catchments. In particular, road to stream connectivity via gullied pathways as well as via diffuse overland flow can contribute to significant fine sediment inputs to forest streams. At present in the State forests of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, road drainage spacings are determined {{on the basis of}} road slope. In this study forest road surveys were conducted across seven coastal catchments near Coffs Harbour on the sub-tropical NSW mid north coast to determine connectivity between gravel roads and streams via channelised and diffuse pathways under a range of rainfall intensities. A total of 10. 82 km of representative road sections was assessed, comprising 129 relief pipes and 22 mitre drains. Of the 151 drains surveyed, gullies were evident at the outlets of 26 relief pipes (20. 2 %) but at none of the mitre drains. Relationships previously derived between contributing road length and hillslope gradient, and between contributing area and hillslope gradient adequately predicted thresholds of gully formation at <b>drain</b> <b>outlets.</b> During lower intensity storms with average recurrence intervals of 10 years or less, less than 20 % of drains are connected to streams via overland flowpaths. However, the degree of diffuse connectivity increases when contributing area takes account of table drains and cut batters, as well as with increasing rainfall intensity. We conclude that when constructing new roads or reassessing drainage on existing roads in forest environments, in addition to preventing erosion of the road surface, gully formation and connectivity with streams via diffuse overland flow should be avoided. This requires factoring in contributing area, hillslope gradient at <b>drain</b> <b>outlets</b> and distance to the nearest stream. Preventing or reducing road-to-stream connectivity is essential for reducing impacts on water quality across all land tenures...|$|R

The concentrations of Nickel, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, and Zinc in water samples have been studied during December 2013 –August 2015. The overall mean concentration of heavy metals was observed in the following order Fe > Cu > Zn > Ni > Cr > Pb > Cd. Correlation analysis formed two distinct groups of heavy metals highlighting similar sources.

When tunnelling in this section, {{it is easy}} to bring about gush of water and sand, which will cause the ground surface to settle. Therefore, a two-staged helical conveyer was used to control this phenomenon during tunnelling. First, both the dregs outlets of helical conveyer are turned off to prevent water and sand from rushing forth, then foam material is injected into the earth cabin and the front-end of helical conveyer to keep the cabin pressure from decreasing. Secondly, <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> of the second helical conveyer is turned on and the water is drained, then dregs outlet of the second helical conveyer is turned on to discharge the dregs.

40|$|PURPOSE: An {{essential}} nutrient for plant growth, phosphorus (P) is often implicated as {{a contributing factor}} to algal blooms. Lake Macatawa is a hypereutrophic lake located in west Michigan, and the watershed is dominated by row crop agriculture. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess agricultural tile drains as a source of P in the Macatawa Watershed. SUBJECTS: Nine tile drain outlets in the Macatawa Watershed from March 2015 – February 2016. METHODS: 1) Conduct a tile drain effluent survey by measuring soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) once per month; 2) investigate the change in tile drain P concentrations temporally over a one-year period; and 3) use seasonal algal bioassays to measure the bioavailability of P found within the tile drains. ANALYSIS: Kruskal-Wallis tests with a Holm’s adjustment compared P concentrations between sample sites and between sample dates. Linear regression was used to relate SRP concentration to algal growth after the bioassays. RESULTS: Tile <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> SRP and TP concentrations varied temporally and spatially. The SRP:TP ratio measured at the tile drain outlets had a significant, positive correlation with acreage drained by the tile system. Four of six bioassays resulted in a positive relationship between SRP and algal growth, but results from only one bioassay were statistically significant. The highest P loads, corresponding to high flow, occurred during winter sample dates. CONCLUSIONS: P loss to tile drains should be limited in the Macatawa Watershed with best management practices targeting locations and seasons with the highest P load...|$|E
40|$|The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{recently}} completed a study to evaluate the performance of edge drain systems placed along portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. To date, a variety of edge drain designs, backfill materials, and placement methods have been used and have resulted in {{varying degrees of success}} when measured against overall pavement performance. This study investigated several different types of edge drain systems that have been used by Caltrans. Their performance was evaluated, and it was observed that more than 70 percent of the surveyed edge drains were not performing efficiently or as designed. This poor overall result can be attributed to design flaws, improper construction practices, and lack of maintenance. Generally, the performance of originally constructed edge drains was better than retrofit projects, since originally constructed edge drains are generally equipped with larger diameter drain pipes, deeper trenches, and treated permeable bases. Edge drain trenches in retrofit projects are generally not deep enough to effectively collect all infiltrated water from the PCC and base layers. The geotextile filter fabric materials found in excavated projects are not soil-specific, which can cause clogging and eventually reduce the ability of these edge drains to allow free flow of water. Improper construction practices, such as high percentages of cement in cement-treated permeable base backfill material and improper placement of geo-fabric material were observed in a few of the surveyed edge drain projects. Among surveyed projects, more than 50 percent of the edge <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> pipes were either buried or clogged, which can be attributed to lack of maintenance...|$|E
40|$|Slope-Area {{relationships}} {{have been widely}} used to identify channel initiation points in the landscape. More recently, the importance of road-related rill and gully erosion has been highlighted. Previous studies indicate that channel initiation at road drain outlets can be predicted from the contributing road area and hillslope gradient at the <b>drain</b> <b>outlet.</b> In this study the validity and usefulness of channel initiation thresholds for road runoff management has been evaluated using field data from three catchments in south-east Australia. None of these catchments show a clear separation between channelised and non-channelised sites based on contributing road area and hillslope gradient. Many drains without channel have similar contributing road area and slope gradients as drain with a channel at the outlet. This demonstrates a relatively large variability within our dataset and limits the identification of a slope-area threshold for these catchments. Logistic regression using road area and slope gradient shows that both variables contribute significantly to channel initiation in the Albert and Tyers River catchments, while for the Sandy Creek catchment only slope gradient is significant at the 0. 05 level. Stepwise logistic regression on a wider range of variables shows the significance of cut-batter height in two of the catchments, indicating that flow interception at cut-and-fill roads may be important. Comparison of road-related channel initiation thresholds to previously published topographic thresholds, indicates that channels at road outlets tend to form at relatively small contributing areas and steep slopes. Current forest management guidelines do not consider the risk of channel initiation at road drain outlets in road design and drain spacing. The slope-area thresholds are still considered useful in minimising the risk of gully erosion, especially in forestry areas where it appears most likely that channel initiation occurs during a significant rainfall event immediately following hillslope disturbance or road construction...|$|E

Drain biofilms harbored 9. 8 to 11. 3 log 10 cells of viable enteric species and pseudomonads/g, while CDFF-grown biofilms harbored 10. 6 to 11. 4 log 10 cells/g. Since live-dead direct staining revealed various efficiencies of recovery by culture, samples were analyzed by DGGE, utilizing primers specific for the V 2 -V 3 region of eubacterial 16 S rDNA. These analyses showed that the major PCR amplicons from in situ material were represented in the microcosms and maintained there over extended periods. Sequencing of amplicons resolved by DGGE revealed that the biofilms were dominated by a small number of genera, which were also isolated by culture. One drain sample harbored the protozoan Colpoda maupasi, together with rhabtidid nematodes and bdelloid rotifers.

40|$|Since {{eutrophication}} {{may start}} at P concentrations {{as small as}} 20 mg l- 1 w ter, P losses from soil to water, while insignificant in direct economic terms, may have serious implications for the environment. Mechanisms of P movement include surface runoff and erosion. However it is widely considered that P leaching from the surface soil in drainage water is negligible in most soils as the P is so firmly fixed on the soil surface. We investigated P leaching losses in drainage waters from soils of the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted from autumn 1992 to late winter 1994.

40|$|Well-performing {{subsurface}} drainage systems form {{an important aspect}} of pavement design by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). The recently completed Iowa Highway Research Board (IHRB) project TR- 643 provided extensive insights into Iowa {{subsurface drainage}} practices and pavement subdrain outlet performance. However, the project TR- 643 (Phase I) forensic testing and evaluation were carried out in a drought year and during the fall season in 2012. Based on the findings of IHRB Project TR- 643, the Iowa DOT requested an expanded Phase II study to address several additional research needs: evaluate the seasonal variation effects (dry fall 2012 versus wet spring/summer 2013, etc.) on subdrain outlet condition and performance; investigate the characteristics of tufa formation in Iowa subdrain outlets; investigate the condition of composite pavement subdrain outlets; examine the effect of resurfacing/widening/rehabilitation on subdrain outlets (e. g., the effects of patching on subdrain outlet performance); and identify a suitable <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> protection mechanism (like a headwall) and design for Iowa subdrain outlets based on a review of practices adopted by nearby states. A detailed forensic test plan was developed and executed for inspecting the Iowa pavement subdrains in pursuit of fulfilling the Phase II study objectives. The observed outlets with blockage and the associated surface distresses in newly constructed jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCPs) were slightly higher during summer 2013 compared to fall 2012. However, these differences are not significant. Less tufa formation due to the recycled portland cement concrete (RPCC) base was observed with (a) the use of plastic outlet pipe without the gate screen–type rodent guard and (b) the use of blended RPCC and virgin aggregate materials. In hot-mix asphalt (HMA) over JPCP, moisture-related distress types (e. g., reflection cracking) were observed more near blocked drainage outlet locations than near “no blockage” outlet locations. This finding indicates that compromised drainage outlet performance could accelerate the development of moisture-related distresses in Iowa composite pavement systems. ****** Note: This report follows on work report in "Evaluating Roadway Subsurface Drainage Practices, 2013 " [URL] Note: This record contains links to the 210 page full report as well as the 3 page tech transfer summary.

40|$|Aluminum dialkyl phosphinates (ADPs) are {{emerging}} phosphorus flame retardants {{due to their}} superior characteristics, but their analytical method, and occurrence and fate in environments have never been reported. For the first time, we developed a method {{for the analysis of}} trace ADPs and their hydrolysates (dialkyl phosphinic acids, DPAs), and studied their occurrences and fates in soils and sediments. We found that ADPs are hardly dissolved in water and organic solvents, but are dissolved and hydrolyzed to DPAs in 30 mM NH 3 center dot H 2 O, thus both ADPs and DPAs can be determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) in the form of DPAs. ADPs and DPAs in soil and sediment samples were determined by (i) extracting both ADPs and DPAs with 75 mM NH 3 center dot H 2 O, and selectively extract DPAs only with formic acid-water-methanol (5 : 5 : 90, v/v/v); (ii) quantifying the total content of ADPs and DPAs, and DPAs by LC-MS/MS analysis of the DPA contents in the former and the latter extract, respectively; and (iii) calculating ADPs from the content difference between the former and the latter extracts. The limit of quantifications (LOQs) of the proposed method were 0. 9 - 1. 0 mu g/kg, and the mean recoveries ranged from 69. 0 % to 112. 4 % with relative standard deviations <= 21 % (n = 6). In soil and sediment samples around a manufacturing plant, ADPs and DPAs were detected in surface soils in the ranges of 3. 9 - 1279. 3 and 1. 0 - 448. 6 mu g/kg, respectively. While ADPs were found in all the samples of the soil and sediment cores from the <b>drain</b> <b>outlet</b> and the waste residue treatment site at levels ranging from 30. 8 to 4628. 0 mu g/kg, DPAs were found in more than 90 % of these samples with concentrations in the range of 1. 1 - 374. 6 mu g/kg. The occurrences of ADPs and DPAs are not in correlation with the total organic carbon, whereas the occurrences of DPAs are highly correlated with the sample pH. Our study also suggests that the DPAs in the samples sourced from the hydrolysis of ADPs. The high hydrolysis degrees of ADPs (up to 49. 6 %) suggest that once released into the environment, ADPs are likely to coexist with their hydrolysates. Thus, to evaluate the environmental safety of ADPs, the environmental behavior and toxicity of both ADPs and DPAs should be considered...|$|E

We therefore analyzed Cu concentrations and stable isotope ratios (δ 65 Cu values) in a drained Retisol to trace the response of Cu to a changing hydrological regime and enhanced clay eluviation. The study soil was artificially drained 16 years before sampling resulting in macroscopically visible pedogenetic changes and is thus a suitable site to investigate the influence of pedogenetic processes {{on the fate of}} Cu. Samples were collected from all horizons along a trench at four distances from the drain: 0. 6 m, 1. 1 m, 2. 1 m and 4. 0 m. In the E&Bt horizon, four different soil volumes (ochre, pale brown, white-grey and black) were sampled at all four distances from the drain. Furthermore, we analyzed soil solutions sampled with piezometer, porous cups, and at the <b>drain</b> <b>outlet.</b> The Cu concentrations were lowest in the surface (Ap) horizons (6. 5 – 8. 5 μg g− 1) and increased with depth to the clay-rich Bt horizons (10. 5 – 12 μg g− 1), because of clay eluviation and associated Cu transport. The δ 65 Cu values significantly decreased from the surface (Ap = − 0. 25 ± 0. 07 ‰) to the deeper horizons, but showed no significant variation among the deeper horizons (− 0. 41 ± 0. 28 ‰) and no correlation with the clay content, indicating that clay eluviation did not significantly affect δ 65 Cu values. The isotopically heavier δ 65 Cu values in the Ap horizons can probably be explained by agricultural management practices like sludge application and fertilization. Close to the drain (position 0. 6 m), Cu concentrations were depleted and the lighter Cu isotope was enriched (− 0. 91 ± 0. 15 ‰) in the uppermost part of the E&Bt horizon. We attribute this to the changing redox conditions, caused by the lowering of the water level close to the drain. Copper concentrations in black and ochre volumes were significantly higher than in pale-brown and white-grey volumes. The black volume had significantly higher δ 65 Cu values than the ochre volume indicating preferential sorption/occlusion of the heavy Cu isotope by Fe oxides. Enhanced clay eluviation in bulk soil close to the drain and in specific soil volumes did not affect δ 65 Cu values. Cu concentrations (2. 1 – 14 μg L− 1) and δ 65 Cu (0. 04 – 0. 42 ‰) values in water samples showed no clear relation with redox changes along the trench perpendicular to the drain. The enrichment of the heavy Cu isotope in the solution samples (Δ 65 Cu(soil-solution) = − 0. 61 ± 0. 41) indicates that reductive Cu mobilization is not the main driver of Cu leaching, because this would preferentially mobilize isotopically light Cu. We conclude that the eluviation of the < 2 μm fraction, strongly controlled Cu concentrations, but had no discernible effect on δ 65 Cu values. The changing redox conditions did not seem to control Cu concentrations and the stable isotope distribution in most of the bulk soil, soil volumes and soil water. Instead, weathering, complexation of leached Cu, Cu application with fertilizers and sorption processes within the soil controlled its δ 65 Cu values...|$|E

Drain biofilms harbored 9. 8 to 11. 3 log 10 cells of viable enteric species and pseudomonads/g, while CDFF-grown biofilms harbored 10. 6 to 11. 4 log 10 cells/g. Since live-dead direct staining revealed various efficiencies of recovery by culture, samples were analyzed by DGGE, utilizing primers specific for the V 2 -V 3 region of eubacterial 16 S rDNA. These analyses showed that the major PCR amplicons from in situ material were represented in the microcosms and maintained there over extended periods. Sequencing of amplicons resolved by DGGE revealed that the biofilms were dominated by a small number of genera, which were also isolated by culture. One drain sample harbored the protozoan Colpoda maupasi, together with rhabtidid nematodes and bdelloid rotifers. The microcosm enables the maintenance of stable drain-type bacterial communities and represents a useful tool for the modeling of this ecosystem. Peer reviewe...|$|R
