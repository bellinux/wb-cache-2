5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director blocking the first scene to be filmed—Ishaan returning <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> putting away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should {{not be aware of}} the camera, he chose a simple shooting style {{for the film}} that involved relatively little camera movement.|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E
25|$|Electronic Arts {{released}} The Sims 2 on September 14, 2004. The sequel, {{developed by}} Maxis, {{takes place in}} a full 3D environment as opposed to the dimetric projection of the original game. Sims also age through seven life stages from infancy to old age and subsequent death. Another major feature is the aspiration system. Each Sim exhibits wants and fears according to its aspiration and personality. Consequently, the level of the aspiration meter determines the effectiveness of a Sim at completing tasks. The fulfillment of wants provides aspiration points, which could then be used to purchase aspiration rewards. In addition, the game features clear days of the week, with weekends when children can stay <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> vacation days when adults can take time off work.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{schools across}} three states were {{destroyed}} in which 69 students were killed. More <b>schools</b> were destroyed <b>and</b> more students killed (as {{well as the}} single school record of 33 deaths in De Soto, Illinois) {{than in any other}} tornado in U.S. history. Deaths occurred at many rural schools. Counting those returning <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> those that died in schools, the toll was 72 students.|$|R

500|$|As the {{daughter}} of folksingers, Nilsen grew up around music. Her father is Lillebjørn Nilsen (born 1950 Oslo, Norway) who first came to prominence in Norway in the early 1970s {{after the release of}} his first albums, and her mother is Shari Nilsen, who is American. Siri Nilsen first wrote a song when she was six years old, [...] but grew up sheltered from the different aspects of the music industry. [...] Lillebjørn tells an anecdote illustrating this point: one day Siri and her sister came <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> sang a song to their father that they had learned that day, never realizing that it was he who had written it. [...] (Lillebjørn Nilsen wrote a popular song/guitar book that has been in print for decades).|$|E
500|$|She {{attended}} Southport State Primary School {{and experienced}} the personal struggles of a lonely childhood as {{she wanted a}} life similar to her school friends. [...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I'd get <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> {{there was nothing in}} the cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was common}} {{for the young}} Mayweather to come <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> find used heroin needles in his front yard. His mother was {{addicted}} to drugs, and he had an aunt who died from AIDS because of her drug use. [...] "People don't know the hell I've been through," [...] he says. The most time that his father spent with him was taking him to the gym to train and work on his boxing, according to Mayweather. [...] "I don't remember him ever taking me anywhere or doing anything that a father would do with a son, going to the park or to the movies or to get ice cream," [...] he says. [...] "I always thought that he liked his daughter (Floyd's older sister) better than he liked me because she never got whippings and I got whippings all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|State Representative John W. Butler, a Tennessee {{farmer and}} head of the [...] World Christian Fundamentals Association, lobbied state legislatures to pass anti-evolution laws. He succeeded when the Butler Act was passed in Tennessee, on March 25, 1925. Butler later stated, [...] "I didn't know {{anything}} about evolution... I'd read in the papers that boys and girls were coming <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense." [...] Tennessee governor Austin Peay signed the law to gain support among rural legislators, but believed the law would neither be enforced nor interfere with education in Tennessee schools. William Jennings Bryan thanked Peay enthusiastically for the bill: [...] "The Christian parents of the state owe you a debt of gratitude for saving their children from the poisonous influence of an unproven hypothesis." ...|$|E
50|$|This family special, {{based on}} a true story, uses {{animation}} {{to tell the story of}} a little black girl's encounter with mindless racism.

2500|$|... "She was {{the ideal}} mother", Billingsley {{said of her}} {{character}} in 1997 in TV Guide. [...] "Some people think she was weakish, but I don't. She was the love in that family. She {{set a good example}} for what a wife could be. I had two boys at home when I did the show. I think the character became kind of like me and vice versa. I've never known where one started and where one stopped." [...] As for the idealized TV family on Leave It to Beaver, which continues in reruns on cable {{more than half a century}} after its debut, Billingsley had her own explanation for the Cleavers' enduring appeal. [...] "Good grief," [...] she told TV Guide, [...] "I think everybody would like a family like that. Wouldn't it be nice if you came <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> there was Mom standing there with her little apron and cookies waiting?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E
