5|$|By 20 August 1831 Warsaw {{was almost}} entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had at his {{disposal}} a formidable force. His main force on the left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was tied <b>down</b> <b>around</b> Radom, fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki.|$|E

5|$|The afternoon's supply drop {{was little}} better than the {{previous}} day's. Although a message had reached Britain to arrange a new dropping zone near the Hotel Hartenstein, some aircraft flew to LZ 'Z' where all their supplies fell into German hands. At Oosterbeek, the Germans had used British marker panels and flares to attract the aircraft to their positions and the aircraft were unable to distinguish the exact dropping zones. Ten of the 164 aircraft involved were shot <b>down</b> <b>around</b> Arnhem for only 13% of supplies reaching British hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} stand above a {{warren of}} tunnels: previously, live animals {{were brought to}} market by hoof (from the mid-19th century onwards they arrived by rail) and were slaughtered on site. The former railway tunnels are now used for storage, parking and as basements. An impressive cobbled ramp spirals <b>down</b> <b>around</b> West Smithfield's public garden, {{on the south side}} of the Market, providing access to part of this area. Some of the buildings on Charterhouse Street on Smithfield north side maintain access to the tunnels via their basements.|$|E
5|$|The fourth tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 2:45a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, {{some of which}} were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the tornado struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the tornado dissipated. No injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} tornado and damages amounted to $30,000. The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of {{the outbreak}} touched <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado blew out the windows in the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.|$|E

5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|By 1958 the castle's {{condition}} {{had deteriorated}} and the Ministry of Works took legal {{custody of the}} site, although it continued to be owned by the Howard family. Conservation work {{took place during the}} 1960s, stabilising the stonework of the keep. Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on the keep in 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, and grass lawns laid <b>down</b> <b>around</b> the remaining stonework and foundations. Further excavations were carried out in 1987 during the construction of the ticket office beside the castle.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E

The association continued using the Greystone Cellars wine label. A year later, the Bisceglia brothers of San Jose purchased Greystone where they produced sacramental wine under the same label until 1930, and again beginning in October 1933. The Carpy family maintained part of the land, including a Victorian house nicknamed Albert's Villa south of the winery. The house burned <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 1929 and was replaced with a Spanish-style house that is now owned by the school.|$|E

5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were {{in the basement of a}} nine-story building relocating barrels when it came <b>down</b> <b>around</b> them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a broken arm. They sustained themselves on the food supplies—fruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham—that were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 12th century was a violent period in Gower, with {{extensive}} fighting occurring between the Anglo-Normans and the local Welsh. Loughor Castle was attacked and burnt <b>down</b> <b>around</b> the middle of the century, probably {{as a part of a}} Welsh rebellion that devastated the area in 1151. Henry II and the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd later agreed peace terms, and the castle was rebuilt. The inside of the ringwork was partially filled by debris during the 1151 attack, and at some point in the next few decades the bank of the ringwork was also deliberately widened inwards in places, allowing buildings to be constructed on it. These changes started the process of filling in the middle of the ringwork which led to the castle today having a mound, or motte-like, appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station burned <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight {{and killing}} station agent E. J. Snyder's dog.

By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E

5|$|CR492 intersects M-35 near Eagle Mills Location. M-35 {{approaches}} the county {{road from the}} north before it turns east to run concurrently with CR492. The two roadway designations cross a rail track before M-35 separates and turns south; traffic along the state highway must yield the right-of-way to traffic on the county road in the process. Eagle Mills is {{the location of the}} main LS rail yard and the former Pioneer Pellet Plant. CR492 curves away from this industrial area to the northeast. The roadway crosses Morgan Creek and enters the Morgan Heights area on the border of Negaunee Township and Marquette Township. This is the site of the first tuberculosis sanatorium in the Upper Peninsula built in 1911; the facility {{is said to have been}} haunted before the main buildings were torn <b>down</b> <b>around</b> 2002. The road continues east through forested lands in Marquette Township, rounding Dead Man's Curve and running downhill into the Morgan Meadows area. CR492 passes a convent of the Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres before entering a residential area. The road curves north past these subdivisions, meeting the western end of CR500 (Grove Street). Further north, CR492 intersects Brookton Road before the southern segment terminates at US41/M-28 in the middle of Marquette Township's commercial corridor.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 the Marquess {{began to}} {{renovate}} the property {{with the intention of}} turning it into a residence for his son, John. The grounds were radically altered under a programme of work that involved Capability Brown and his son-in-law, Henry Holland. The stone wall that separated the inner and outer baileys was destroyed using gunpowder, the Shire Hall and the knights' houses in the outer bailey were destroyed and the remaining ground partially flattened; the whole of the area was laid with turf. Considerable work was carried out on the main lodgings, demolishing the Herbert additions, building two new wings and removing many of the older features to produce a more contemporary, 18th century appearance. The keep and motte was stripped of the ivy and trees that had grown up them, and a spiral path was laid <b>down</b> <b>around</b> the motte. The motte's moat was filled in as part of the landscaping. A summer house was built in the south-east corner of the castle. Further work was planned on the property, including a reported proposal to roof the keep in copper, insert new windows and turn it into an assembly room for dances, but these projects were cut short by the Marquess's son's death in 1794.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} Generals Lucjan Żeligowski, Józef Haller, Jan Rządkowski and Franciszek Latinik met in Jabłonna {{and again in}} Struga to prepare a plan for retaking Radzymin once again. It was decided that, since the Soviet 27th Division was bogged <b>down</b> <b>around</b> Radzymin and had not resumed its march towards Jabłonna, the Polish 10th Infantry Division was no longer needed in that sector, and instead {{could be used to}} achieve a {{breakthrough}} at Radzymin. The division was relocated to Nieporęt, where General Rządkowski discovered the artillery units that were believed to have been destroyed by the Russians the previous day. A single battalion from the 28th Kaniów Rifles Regiment from the 10th Division, led by 1st Lieutenant Stefan Pogonowski, was ordered to entrench in a forest near Wólka Radzymińska and organise an ambush. The rest of the Polish forces were to start an all-out assault at 05:00 hours the following morning, with General Żeligowski in command over the ad-hoc corps. The forces amassed for the assault had a nominal strength of 17,000 infantry, 109 artillery pieces, and 220 machine guns.|$|E

50|$|The John Proctor House is a {{historic}} First Period house at 348 Lowell Street in Peabody, Massachusetts. According to local tradition, this wood frame house was occupied by John Proctor, who was convicted and hanged for witchcraft in the 1692 Salem witch trials. However, stylistic analysis of house's construction suggests it was more likely built c. 1700 by Proctor's son Thorndike, who bought the property from Charles <b>Downing</b> <b>around</b> that time. The house remained in the Proctor family into the mid 19th century.|$|R
