25|$|BP {{reported}} that the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> (tower) on its Mad Dog platform had been toppled into the sea, adding {{that it was too}} early to predict when the platform could resume production.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} on September 16, 2008 that Mad Dog was damaged due to Hurricane Ike. The <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> was toppled over {{and was on}} the sea bed. A new drilling package was built and replaced the damaged one on the spar in early 2012.|$|R
50|$|Drilling was {{performed}} using a conventional core wireline {{system with a}} <b>drill</b> <b>derrick,</b> protected by a cover against the rough climate. Sea ice was 2 m thick with a water depth of 150 - 300 m below. Four overlapping drill cores at three sites reflect in excellent quality the geological history and glaciation of the Antarctic during the last 34 million years.|$|R
5000|$|The Upper <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick</b> {{is located}} in a half timbered {{building}} and was restored by a local initiative from 2006 until 2009 and is a Museum since. The Lower <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick,</b> directly adjacent to the Brine Reservoir, is still operating and is pumping brine. A small timbered structure was erected over the first brinewell in 1668 which survived until the 1960 and was taken away than to make room for a wider road intersection at Solstraße and Severshuser Weg. It was called [...] "Solhaus" [...] and reconstructed a few meters from the original site in 1992.The old administrative building, Faktoreihaus, of the than state owned salt works was constructed in 1694. It is located on Solstraße and survives in only slightly altered form. On the right hand side of the building is the chapel used for church services until today (2014). The protruding part of the office building was made so that the officers had {{a good view of the}} works area. The building got it´s present form after a rebuild in 1910. There are a few other buildings around Salinenplatz which have been erected in conjunction with the salt works.|$|R
2500|$|With {{critical}} support structures burned away, {{and with}} nothing to support the heavier structures on top, the platform began to collapse. One of the cranes collapsed, followed by the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick.</b> The generation and utilities Module (D), which included the fireproofed accommodation block, slipped into the sea, taking the crewmen huddled inside with it. The largest part of the platform followed it. [...] "Rescue 138" [...] lands on Tharos [...] {{and picks up the}} 12 non-essential personnel, before leaving for Ocean Victory.|$|R
2500|$|World Saga {{was taken}} to Hitachi Zosen {{shipyard}} in Sakai, Japan, where all but the forward two-thirds of the tanker's hull were scrapped. The remaining section was reinforced with 7,000 tonnes of additional steel and strengthened against ice with 13,000 tonnes of concrete that formed a [...] thick inner hull. A new 4,000-ton topside with <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick,</b> cranes, helipad and accommodation block was installed {{on top of the}} ice-strengthened hull. The drilling unit was given the name SSDC, short for single steel drilling caisson.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the design}} feature and the {{operating}} of K-type derrick, an effective method used to stress real-time monitoring consider environmental loading is proposed. The {{challenge to the}} South China Sea offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> is a illustration. The derrick corrosion and wall thinning conditions is be considered, then using finite element software analyze derrick structure of static analysis, get the higher force about main member of derrick. Based on finite element analysis, select the key parts layout of measuring points, then monitor derrick stress under nine storms environmental loading and extreme work condition. The measured data results show that: the nine storms environmental load affect capacity of drilling significantly, the {{different parts of the}} main member stress have the different degrees of influence by environmental load, the maximum can reach 50. 8 %. This real-time monitoring method of stress, can protect the safety of marine operations, has a certain value of engineering application...|$|R

50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, {{coiled tubing}} refers to a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self-contained coiled tubing rig can be used.|$|R

50|$|Bissell had the {{innovative}} {{idea of using}} this oil to produce kerosene, then in high demand. After getting confirmation of {{the usefulness of the}} product from Yale chemist Benjamin Silliman Jr., he and his partner, Jonathan Eveleth, formed the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company for this purpose. In 1856, after seeing pictures of <b>derrick</b> <b>drilling</b> for salt, Bissell conceived of the idea of drilling for oil, rather than mining it. This was widely considered ludicrous at the time but on August 27, 1859, the company first succeeded in striking oil, on a farm in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Bissell invested heavily in the surrounding region and ended up becoming a wealthy business man.|$|R
5000|$|The Elgin-Franklin {{development}} {{is located in}} the Central Graben Area of the North Sea 240 km east of Aberdeen, Scotland at a water depth of 93 m. The installation consists of three separate platforms, two of which are connected by a 90 m bridge: two wellhead platforms which house the wells, one each for the Elgin and Franklin reservoirs, and the process, utilities and quarters (PUQ) platform, which is the central processing platform. The PUQ is a pile mounted jack up design which contains hydrocarbon processing facilities, control systems and accommodation for the crew of 97. The structure was built by BARMAC in Nigg, Scotland, and installed in July 2000. The facility has a processing capacity of [...] of gas and [...] of condensate. The Franklin wellhead platform (WHP) has nine well slots (seven wells on the Franklin Field and two extended reach wells on West Franklin) [...] It is not normally manned but has a helideck and shelter for up to 20 people. The Elgin wellhead platform has 12 well slots (11 wells on Elgin and one extended reach well on Glenelg). The platforms are linked to the PUQ by flowlines and were installed in 1999. The WHP has no installed <b>drilling</b> facilities (<b>derrick,</b> etc.). Well <b>drilling</b> and workover services are provided when needed by a jack up rig which operates in tender mode.|$|R
