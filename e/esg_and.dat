5|$|Days {{before the}} coup, fellow Lusophone country Angola {{announced}} its forces would be ending the two-year-old Angolan Military Mission in Guinea Bissau (MISSANG) that followed a similar failed {{effort by the}} European Union {{as part of the}} United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS). State-owned Angolan news agency ANGOP said that the Angolan troops were sent to Guinea-Bissau in March 2011 in accordance with a bilateral military agreement to reform the armed forces. On 16 April, Guinea-Bissau Defense Minister Jorge Tolentino Araújo was scheduled to arrive in Angola to meet his counterpart Cândido Pereira dos Santos Van-Dúnem and the Army Chief-of-Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda. He was also expected to visit the Higher Warfare School (<b>ESG)</b> <b>and</b> the Higher Technical Military Institute (ISTM). The same day as the coup, the two Lusophone countries of Angola and Cape Verde agreed to review their defense cooperation agreements. Presidential candidate and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Júnior was also unpopular with the army for his attempts to reform the institution.|$|E

25|$|Hereford United {{played their}} home matches at Edgar Street from their {{formation}} in 1924; {{the ground was}} previously used by the amateur club Hereford City {{as well as for}} athletics. In later years the ground was central to Hereford's financial troubles, with the previous owners of the club handing the leases over to a development company from which they had borrowed £1 million. During the club's early years in the Conference the future of the ground was in doubt, and relocation was considered to the point that plans for a new 7,500 seater stadium were drawn up. A joint venture agreement was made between the club and the developers to redevelop both ends of the ground to include leisure facilities that would enable the debt to be settled. The area around the ground is subject to a substantial redevelopment plan, known as the Edgar Street Grid (ESG). The club and the developers were originally looking to submit redevelopment plans to the council by the end of 2007. Although the ground redevelopment is independent of the ESG, plans for the building of a cinema at the Blackfriars End drawn up by the club and developers were not supported by <b>ESG</b> <b>and</b> Herefordshire Council. Several months later, plans for the ESG itself were published which included a cinema.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{experts have}} argued that, {{in the context}} of pension governance, {{trustees}} have started to reassert their fiduciary prerogatives more strongly after 2008 – notably following the heavy losses or reduced returns incurred by many retirement schemes {{in the wake of the}} Great Recession and the progression of <b>ESG</b> <b>and</b> Responsible Investment ideas: “Clearly, there is a mounting demand for CEOs (equity issuers) and governments (sovereign bond issuers) to be more ‘accountable’ [...] No longer ‘absentee landlords’, trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their governance prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups.” ...|$|E

The ESG information disclosure practices might differ across the country's location.

Using a content analysis method on the companies report in 2013 and comparative analysis (Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test), the study found that there is a significant different in <b>ESG</b> disclosure <b>and</b> its elements emphasis in both countries. Country regulatory background, norms and believe may effect and influence the level of <b>ESG</b> disclosures <b>and</b> its emphasis. The correlation analysis is employ to test the relationship between <b>ESG</b> disclosures <b>and</b> firms EVA. The result found that there is no relationship exists between <b>ESG</b> disclosure <b>and</b> firms EVA.
