5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun. This {{may be caused by}} the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface. <b>Energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is instead performed by the radiative process, which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion.|$|E
5|$|From {{the core}} {{out to about}} 0.7 solar radii, thermal {{radiation}} is the primary means of <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core. This temperature gradient {{is less than the}} value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection. Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions. The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) from 0.25 solar radii to the 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
40|$|In {{this letter}} we {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} magnetic energy growth in small-scale dynamo by studying <b>energy</b> <b>transfers,</b> mainly <b>energy</b> fluxes and shell-to-shell <b>energy</b> <b>transfers.</b> We perform dynamo simulations for magnetic Prandtl number Pm= 20 on 1024 ^ 3 grid using pseudospectral method. We demonstrate that the magnetic energy growth is caused by nonlocal <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> from the large-scale or forcing-scale velocity field to small-scale magnetic field. The peak of these <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> move towards lower wavenumbers as dynamo evolves, which {{is the reason why}} the integral scale of the magnetic field increases with time.

5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike has 15service plazas on {{the main}} highway {{throughout}} the state, as well as 2 on the northeastern extension. Each plaza has food franchises (such as Burger King, Subway, Sbarro, Roy Rogers, Famous Famiglia Pizzeria, Auntie Anne's, Hershey's Ice Cream, Popeyes, and Starbucks), a Sunoco gas station, and an A-Plus convenience store. Other amenities include ATMs, free cell phone charging, picnic areas, restrooms, tourist information, Travel Board information centers, and Wi-Fi. The King of Prussia plaza has a welcome center, and the New Stanton and Sideling Hill plazas feature seasonal farmers' markets. A few plazas offer E85 while New Stanton offers compressed natural gas; all of them offer conventional gasoline and diesel fuel. Select service plazas have electric vehicle charging stations.

5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium has {{a potential}} use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized {{in order to}} deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as fermium compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from the chelate matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and fermium.|$|E

40|$|Turbulent flows {{subject to}} solid-body {{rotation}} {{are known to}} generate steep energy spectra and two-dimensional columnar vortices. The localness of the dominant <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> responsible for the accumulation of the energy in the two-dimensional columnar vortices of large horizontal scale remains undetermined. Here, we investigate the scale-locality of the <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> directly contributing {{to the growth of}} the two-dimensional columnar structures observed in the intermediate Rossby number (Ro) regime. Our approach is to investigate the dynamics of the waves and vortices separately: we ensure that the two-dimensional columnar structures are not directly forced so that the vortices can result only from association with wave to vortical <b>energy</b> <b>transfers.</b> Detailed <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> between waves and vortices are computed as a function of scale, allowing the direct tracking of the role and scales of the wave–vortex nonlinear interactions in the accumulation of energy in the large two-dimensional columnar structures. It is shown that the dominant <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> responsible for the generation of a steep two-dimensional spectrum involve direct non-local <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> from small-frequency small-horizontal-scale three-dimensional waves to large-horizontal-scale two-dimensional columnar vortices. Sensitivity of the results to changes in resolution and forcing scales is investigated and the non-locality of the dominant <b>energy</b> <b>transfers</b> leading to the emergence of the columnar vortices is shown to be robust. The interpretation of the scaling law observed in rotating flows in the intermediate-Ro regime is revisited in the light of this new finding of dominant non-locality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: In this paper, {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} circular boreholes under internal hydraulic pressure {{are carried out}} to investigate the <b>energy</b> <b>transferred</b> to the surrounding rock and the breakdown pressure. The simulations are conducted by using a micromechanical continuum damage model proposed by Golshani et al. (2006). The simulation {{results suggest that the}} borehole breakdown pressure and the <b>energy</b> <b>transferred</b> to the surrounding rock are dependent on the mechanical properties of the rock and borehole size. Although the <b>energy</b> <b>transferred</b> to the surrounding rock increases with increasing borehole size, the borehole breakdown pressure decreases...|$|R

In this method, fluorophores are chemically linked or genetically fused to two proteins hypothesised to interact. If the proteins interact, this will bring the fluorophores into close spatial proximity. If the fluorophores are oriented in a manner that exposes the fluorophores to one another, usually ensured when designing and constructing the fluorophore-protein linkage/fusion, then the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from the excited donor fluorophore will result in a change in the fluorescent intensities or lifetimes of the fluorophores.|$|E

25|$|The {{injection}} system {{consists of a}} 250 MeV LINAC, a low <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> line. The LINAC was operated for over 30 years {{as part of the}} Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2586MHz. The 78m low <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1Hz, with an RF frequency of 500Hz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.|$|E
