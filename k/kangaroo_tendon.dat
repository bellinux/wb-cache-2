500|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, Hemingway spent his winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming, {{where he found}} [...] "the most {{beautiful}} country {{he had seen in}} the American West" [...] and hunted deer, elk, and grizzly bear. He was joined there by Dos Passos and in November 1930, after bringing Dos Passos to the train station in Billings, Montana, Hemingway broke his arm in a car accident. The surgeon tended the compound spiral fracture and bound the bone with <b>kangaroo</b> <b>tendon.</b> Hemingway was hospitalized for seven weeks, with Pauline tending to him; the nerves in his writing hand took as long as a year to heal, during which time he suffered intense pain.|$|E
5000|$|Assisted by Dr. Harold Cassidy, Loeser {{spent nearly}} 48-hours {{operating}} on Dillinger and Van Meter. Given the medical {{technology of the}} era and lack of hospital facilities, Loeser was limited in what he could do. He tightened Dillinger's cheeks using <b>kangaroo</b> <b>tendons,</b> however he nearly suffocated to death during the operation when he swallowed his tongue under general anesthetic. A caustic solution was used to burn away both men's fingerprints; it apparently failed to erase them completely, however, as Dillinger would be identified by his fingerprints following his death two months later.|$|R
25|$|The {{kangaroo}} {{has always}} been a very important animal for Australian Aborigines, for its meat, hide, bone, and <b>tendon.</b> <b>Kangaroo</b> hides were also sometimes used for recreation; in particular there are accounts of some tribes (Kurnai) using stuffed kangaroo scrotum as a ball for the traditional football game of marngrook. In addition, there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo. Aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the Northern Territory.|$|R
40|$|Organotypic co-cultures {{bridge the}} gap between {{standard}} two-dimensional culture and mouse models. Such assays increase the fidelity of pre-clinical studies, to better inform lead compound development and address the increasing attrition rates of lead compounds within the pharmaceutical industry, which are often a result of screening in less faithful two-dimensional models. Using large-scale acid-extraction techniques, we demonstrate a step-by-step process to isolate collagen I from commercially available animal byproducts. Using the well-established rat tail tendon collagen as a benchmark, we apply our novel <b>kangaroo</b> tail <b>tendon</b> collagen as an alternative collagen source for our screening-ready three-dimensional organotypic co-culture platform. Both collagen sources showed equal applicability for invasive, proliferative or survival assessment of well-established cancer models and clinically relevant patient-derived cancer cell lines. Additional readouts were also demonstrated when comparing these alternative collagen sources for stromal contributions to stiffness, organization and ultrastructure via atomic force microscopy, second harmonic generation imaging and scanning electron microscopy, among other vital biological readouts, where only minor {{differences were found between the}} preparations. Organotypic co-cultures represent an easy, affordable and scalable model to investigate drug responses within a physiologically relevant 3 D platform...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} fully {{the meaning of}} small-angle X-ray diffraction data from collagen fibers {{in terms of the}} distribution of molecular substance along fibrillar axes, it is necessary to have some means of determining the phase angles of the several components of the axial diffraction series for combination with measured amplitudes in the formulation of a Fourier series expressing the fibrillar electron density profile. This investigation has developed strip models for fibrillar axial structure based on reported electron micrographic descriptions of how stainable bands and molecular overlap zones (“backgrounds”) are located along the fibrils. These models permit the calculation of phases for use with the experimental amplitudes. Once band descriptions (identical widths and density heights plus relative locations) were fixed, three parameters dealing with background width, height, and location were varied to refine the models until they were reasonably capable of accounting theoretically for the observed diffraction amplitudes. Further minor adjustments, indicated by the initial results, finally produced models and profiles for dry and moist <b>kangaroo</b> tail <b>tendon</b> (KTT). The results show that the X-ray and electron optical conclusions regarding collagen fibrillar axial structure are in essential agreement down to a resolution of about 45 Å...|$|R
