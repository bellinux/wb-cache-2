5|$|Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut {{the season}} short and {{cancelled}} the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created {{a de facto}} mythical national championship (similar to college football) by naming managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of the Year. Two franchises, the New York Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers, <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> manager win the award.|$|E
5|$|In cricket, a batsman {{reaches a}} century when he scores 100 or more {{runs in a}} single innings. A century is {{regarded}} as a landmark score for a batsman, and his number of centuries is generally recorded in his career statistics. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 cricket in India, which has been held annually since its first edition in 2008. In the ten seasons played, 47 centuries have been scored by 30 different batsmen. Players from eight of the eleven franchises have scored centuries; the only franchises that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> player score a century for them are Pune Warriors India, Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Gujarat Lions.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{players have}} {{received}} either the Naismith or Wooden National Player of the Year awards {{in the same}} year that they received an ACC Player of the Year award. North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough is the most recent player to achieve this; the consensus national player of the year in 2008, he won every major national award in addition to the conference player of the year award. Duke and North Carolina are tied for the most winners with 15 apiece. Each of the original 1953ACC members has had at least one of its players win the award. Five ACC members <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> winner: Florida State, Louisville, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, and Syracuse. However, of these schools, only Florida State joined the ACC before 2013.|$|E

25|$|For {{those with}} {{osteoporosis}} but who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fracture evidence {{does not support}} a reduction in fracture risk with risedronate or etidronate. Alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but {{does not have any}} effect on other types of fractures. Half stop their medications within a year. When on treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density is not needed. Another review found tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis.|$|E

American Pit Bull Terriers with dilute coat colors <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> higher occurrence of skin allergies as other breeds. As a breed they {{are more susceptible to}} parvovirus than others if not vaccinated, especially as puppies, so vaccination is imperative beginning at 39 days old and continuing every 2 weeks until 4 months old.

25|$|The {{reduction}} of sea ice has boosted {{the productivity of}} phytoplankton by about twenty {{percent over the past}} thirty years. However, the effect on marine ecosystems is unclear, since the larger types of phytoplankton, which are the preferred food source of most zooplankton, do not appear to have increased as much as the smaller types. So far, Arctic phytoplankton <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant impact on the global carbon cycle. In summer, the melt ponds on young and thin ice have allowed sunlight to penetrate the ice, in turn allowing phytoplankton to bloom in unexpected concentrations, although it is unknown just how long this phenomenon has been occurring.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) {{recommend}} that all women 65years {{of age or}} older be screened by bone densitometry. Additionally they recommend screening women with increased risk factors that puts them at risk equivalent to a 65‑year‑old. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals for repeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in those who <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> previous bone fracture is unclear. The International Society for Clinical Densitometry, however, suggest BMD testing for men 70 or older, or those who are indicated for risk {{equal to that of}} a 70‑year‑old. A number of tools exist to help determine who is reasonable to test.|$|E
25|$|The only {{teams that}} <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> full-season third jersey since the {{beginning}} of the current program are the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, and New Jersey Devils. However, both the Red Wings and Canadiens have participated in multiple outdoor games and had special jerseys for each event. In addition, the Canadiens wore five different vintage jerseys over the course of their centennial celebration in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 seasons, in addition to their earlier participation in the Vintage jersey program. Finally, the New Jersey Devils have worn a red and green throwback jersey for one home game on or around St. Patrick's Day every season since 2009-10, with the exception of the lockout-shortened 2013 season, and have also worn them in their 2014 NHL Stadium Series outdoor game.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{capacity}} {{has more than}} doubled since Lambeau Field was opened, demand for tickets remains high. The Packers have sold out every game since 1960, and at least 115,000 names are on the waiting list (with a reported average wait time of 30 years). The sell-out streak has had the effect (intended or not) of ensuring that all Packers home games are televised in Green Bay and Milwaukee, a streak that started in 1973 (prior to that time, local telecasts of home games were disallowed regardless of how many tickets were sold); the Packers are one of four NFL teams (the others being the Washington Redskins, Denver Broncos, and Pittsburgh Steelers) that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> home game blacked out since the 1973 blackout rules were put into place.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} African Americans live in quiet, middle class {{suburban}} neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have large black populations whose family income {{is higher than}} average. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing, etc. (most of the outgoing population has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, Little Neck, and Douglaston <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods very desirable {{for people who want}} to reside near Manhattan in a less urban setting.|$|E
25|$|An article {{published}} by Vietnam News echoed {{some of the}} challenges and opportunities that Vietnam faces {{in preparation for the}} AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Import-Export Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises' lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to study the ASEAN market, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries. Another challenge for Vietnam, the article stated, is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.|$|E
