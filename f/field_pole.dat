In the salient-pole machine the pole's magnetic field is produced by a winding wound around the pole below the pole face. In the nonsalient-pole, or distributed field, or round-rotor, machine, the winding is distributed in pole face slots. A shaded-pole motor has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.|$|E
25|$|Born in Pinar del Río in Cuba, Silva {{began to}} {{participate}} in pole vault competitions {{from the age of}} twelve. Many women in her family took part in athletics and her mother was a javelin thrower. In spite of its strong traditions in track and <b>field,</b> <b>pole</b> vaulting was a discipline in which Cuba had not historically been successful. As a result, Silva quickly established herself nationally at the age of sixteen, coming second at the Cuban Athletics Championships and winning the Barrientos Memorial in 2003. In 2004, she cleared four metres for the first time, which was a Central American and Caribbean junior record. She improved this to 4.10m at the 2005 Barrientos meet, winning the competition again.|$|E
2500|$|On the field, Fisk {{threw out}} the {{ceremonial}} first pitch to his former batterymate Luis Tiant. From now on, like the Pesky Pole down the right-field line, the left-field pole will officially be called the Fisk Foul Pole. The idea was the inspiration of the countless fans who contacted the Red Sox about recognizing the historic moment. Fenway's right field foul pole, which is just 302 feet from the plate, is named Pesky's Pole, for former Red Sox shortstop Johnny Pesky. Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky in [...] when he won a game with a home run just inside the right <b>field</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Synchronous motors {{fall under}} the more general {{category}} of synchronous machines which also includes the synchronous generator. Generator action will be observed if the <b>field</b> <b>poles</b> are [...] "driven ahead of the resultant air-gap flux by the forward motion of the prime mover".

50|$|In the past, repulsion-start wound-rotor motors {{provided}} high starting torque, {{but with}} added complexity. Their rotors {{were similar to}} those of universal motors, but their brushes were connected only to each other. Transformer action induced current into the rotor. Brush position relative to <b>field</b> <b>poles</b> meant that starting torque was developed by rotor repulsion from the <b>field</b> <b>poles.</b> A centrifugal mechanism, when close to running speed, connected all commutator bars together to create the equivalent of a squirrel-cage rotor. As well, when close to operating speed, better motors lifted the brushes out of contact.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{small amount}} of {{asymmetry}} of the magnetic flux in the air-gap of an electrical machine can create {{a considerable amount of}} force called unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP). This unbalanced magnetic pull is generated due to the presence of the magnetic <b>fields</b> of <b>pole</b> pair p and p± 1 in the air gap of the motor. A torque producing magnetic <b>field</b> of <b>pole</b> pair p is already present due to the main supply of the stator winding. To create a controllable UMP an additional magnetic <b>field</b> of <b>pole</b> pair p± 1 can be generated using an additional stator winding. This controllable UMP can be used for active vibration control. The present paper uses a special type of winding scheme called bridge configured winding (BCW) where a single set of winding can be used to generate magnetic <b>field</b> of <b>pole</b> pair p+ 1 and p- 1. An experimental setup has been developed to demonstrate the vibration control using isolated bridge supply of a BCW based induction motor by controlling the additional magnetic <b>field</b> of <b>pole</b> pair p+ 1 and p- 1...|$|R
2500|$|Another park quickly {{took over}} the Polo Grounds' {{reputation}} for Chinese home runs. New York City's other National League team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, had also moved to the West Coast for the 1958 season, where they played their first home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Built for the 1932 Olympics, it had mainly been used for football since then. Its field was well-suited for that sport and the track and field events it had been designed for, but putting a baseball diamond in it was awkward. The left <b>field</b> <b>pole</b> was just [...] from the plate, even shorter than right {{had been at the}} Polo Grounds, and it was much more likely that balls would be hit there due to the majority of batters being right-handed. Before the regular season began, players from other teams were complaining about it.|$|E

50|$|The Royal {{field is}} a {{historical}} place on which according to the legend Přemysl, the Ploughman was called to become the ruler of the Czech state. Measurements of the Royal field served in the Middle Ages as a basis of the Czech <b>field</b> <b>pole</b> (česká polní míra).|$|E
50|$|These field {{effects are}} {{reversed}} when {{the direction of}} spin is reversed. It is therefore difficult to build an efficient reversible commutated dynamo, since for highest field strength {{it is necessary to}} move the brushes to {{the opposite side of the}} normal neutral plane. These effects can be mitigated by a Compensation winding in the face of the <b>field</b> <b>pole</b> that carries armature current.|$|E
5000|$|The first DC {{electrical}} motors, {{from the}} Gramme motor of the 1870s onwards, used bipolar fields. These early machines used crudely designed <b>field</b> <b>pole</b> pieces with long magnetic circuits, wide pole gaps and narrow pole pieces that gave {{only a limited}} flux through the armature. These fields were usually horseshoe-shaped, with either permanent horseshoe magnets or else either one or two field coils at {{some distance from the}} poles.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{dimensions of}} Bowman Field were quite large {{compared to the}} dimensions of modern baseball fields.

50|$|These are two {{principal}} methods {{by which the}} effect of armature reaction is overcome. The first method is to shift {{the position of the}} brushes so that they are in the neutral plane when the generator is producing its normal load current. in the other method, special <b>field</b> <b>poles,</b> called interpoles, are installed in the generator to counteract the effect of armature reaction.|$|R

5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding in the <b>field</b> <b>pole</b> face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its {{purpose is to}} reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the <b>field</b> <b>pole</b> plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E
