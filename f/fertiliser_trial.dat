No significant relationships were found between P fertiliser and respirable carbon, microbial carbon, microbial (C) quotient, microbial specific respiration, microbial nitrogen, microbial (N) quotient, mineralised N, or C:N ratio. The first hypothesis was rejected as the C:N ratio did not change with increased P fertiliser application. However, both C and N decreased with increased P fertiliser application.

The soils at the three sites differed markedly in their phosphorus retention characteristics (from 0 to 93 % phosphorus retention) but this appeared to have little effect on utilisation of applied phosphorus by the trees. At the site with the very low phosphorus retention, leaching of phosphorus seemed to occur. At the sites with the higher phosphorus retention, enhanced availability of phosphorus was restricted to the top 10 cm. Both the rock phosphate and the superphosphate treated trees contained similar additional amounts of phosphorus.

Conclusions on nutrient limitation have been founded mainly on soil extractions, fertiliser trials and tissue nutrient concentrations. In order to avoid some of the problems associated with these methods, we employed a special technique using intact sods which rooted both in the intact soil and in a nutrient solution, from which N, P and K were omitted stepwise. The method was applied to hay-field communities which differed in their history of fertiliser application. Four fields were compared which were not fertilised for 2, 6, 19 or 45 years, while hay making continued. This was done to restore former species-rich grassland communities. We tested the hypothesis that the increase in species diversity in these grasslands was attended by an increase in the number of limiting nutrients. We observed clear shifts in the type and extent of nutrient limitation. Fields which were recently fertilised were characterised by nitrogen and potassium limitation, while phosphorus limitation increased in importance towards the later stages of succession. In the last field (45 years unfertilised) N, P and K equally limited production at the community level. These conclusions differed from those drawn from a <b>fertiliser</b> <b>trial</b> in these same four fields, which failed to detect phosphorus limitation.

The grain-producing {{regions of}} {{northern}} New South Wales and southern and central Queensland are characterised by cropping {{systems that are}} strongly dependent on stored soil moisture rather than in-crop rainfall, and tillage systems that are increasingly reliant on zero or minimum tillage.

40|$|Sown pasture rundown {{and declining}} soil {{fertility}} for forage crops are too serious to ignore with losses in beef production {{of up to}} 50 % across Queensland. The feasibility of using strategic applications of nitrogen (N) fertiliser to address these losses was assessed by analysing a series of scenarios using data drawn from published studies, local <b>fertiliser</b> <b>trials</b> and expert opinion. While N fertilser can dramatically increase productivity (growth, feed quality and beef production gains of over 200 % in some scenarios), the estimated economic benefits, derived from paddock level enterprise budgets for a fattening operation, were much more modest. In the best-performing sown grass scenarios, average gross margins were doubled or tripled at the assumed fertiliser response rates, and internal rates of return of up to 11 % were achieved. Using fertiliser on forage sorghum or oats was a much less attractive option and, under the paddock level analysis and assumptions used, forages struggled to be profitable even on fertile sites with no fertiliser input. The economics of nitrogen fertilising on grass pasture were sensitive to the assumed response rates in both pasture growth and liveweight gain. Consequently, targeted research is proposed to re-assess the responses used in this analysis, which are largely based on research 25 - 40 years ago when soils were generally more fertile and pastures less rundown...|$|R
40|$|In Papua New Guinea, {{the biggest}} cash crop is oil palm, which is largely grown on soils formed in recent {{volcanic}} ash. Once N deficiency is overcome, cation deficiencies, especially Mg, become significant in these soils.

The soils have variable cation exchange capacity (CEC), negligible anion exchange capacity and pHCaCl 2 values of 5 - 6. Mean pH buffering capacity is about 2. 5 cmolc/kg per pH unit, and is largely due to organic matter. <b>Fertiliser</b> <b>trials</b> have shown that addition of NH 4 SO 4 at commercial rates acidified surface soil by about 0. 5 - 1 unit over 11 - 16 years, enough to reduce CEC considerably.

Preliminary examination of mineralogy showed a dominance of anorthite, an easily weathered Ca-rich aluminosilicate primary mineral. Excess exchangeable Ca appears to be out-competing applied Mg for exchange sites, rendering soluble sources of Mg ineffective in this high rainfall environment (2, 000 - 5, 000 mm p. a.).

Densitometric analyses showed that there was an immediate decrease in wood density after the 1969 fertiliser treatment and thereafter a recovery to pre-treatment levels over about 5 years. The maximum decrease in mean density was 20 % in the 1969 - 70 growth period at the butt level and 12 % at 12 m. Differences in whole-tree density, however, were only about 20 kg/m 3, i. e., well under 5 %. It was concluded that the effects of fertiliser treatment on wood density were of little technological significance. Analyses of tracheid length, shrinkage, spiral grain, and resin content showed that treatments had no significant influence on these characteristics. The one property which showed a marked response to accelerated growth was the incidence of mild compression wood, which closely followed the pattern for basal area increment response. However, the high levels of such reaction wood in the rings after treatment were not reflected in abnormal shrinkage values and would hence have little impact on utilisation.

40|$|In New Zealand, {{phosphate}} (P) fertilisers used {{in agriculture}} {{are the main}} sources of the potentially toxic elements cadmium (Cd) and uranium (U), which occur as unwanted contaminants. New Zealand is developing draft soil guideline values (SGV) for maximum concentrations of Cd. To assess when soils under pasture for sheep production might reach a particular SGV, we analysed archived soil samples from a 23 yr P <b>fertiliser</b> <b>trial.</b> The pasture sites were at Whatawhata, North Island, New Zealand, and had received P fertiliser at the rates of 0, 30, 50 and 100 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. From 1983 to 1989, P was applied as single superphosphate, from 1989 to 2006, P was applied as triple superphosphate. Soils from replicate paddocks were sampled annually {{to a depth of}} 75 mm on easy (10 – 20 °) and steep (30 – 40 °) slope classes. Total P, Cd and U were analysed by ICP-MS after acid digestion. Data were analysed by fitting trend lines using linear mixed models for two slope classes and for two sampling periods 1983 – 1989 and 1989 – 2006 when the soil sampling method and fertiliser type had been changed. The changes in total P, Cd and U were directly related to the type and amount of P fertiliser applied, the control treatment showed no significant change in P, Cd or U. At 50 and 100 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ there were generally linear increases in total P and total U, and the same trend line applied to both time periods, but the rate of increase in P was greater on the easy slope class. For Cd, a “broken stick” model was needed to explain the data. Pre- 1989, Cd increased in the 50 and 100 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ treatment (0. 036 – 0. 045 mg kg⁻¹ yr⁻¹, respectively) : post 1988 the rate of increase declined markedly on those two treatments (0. 005 – 0. 015 mg kg⁻¹ yr⁻¹, respectively), and declined absolutely in the 30 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ treatments. The maximum content of Cd was in the 100 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ treatment which reached 0. 931 mg Cd kg⁻¹ on the easy slope. For U there were steady linear increases for the 30, 50 and 100 kg P ha⁻¹ treatments, and {{no significant difference between the}} steep and easy slopes, nor the two sampling periods, the maximum concentration obtained was 2. 80 mg U kg⁻¹ on the 100 kg P ha⁻¹ treatment. The results suggest that at rates of P fertiliser likely to be applied to hill farms (< 50 kg P ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), and using P fertiliser with low Cd content, then the Cd concentration in this soil will never reach a SGV of 1 mg kg⁻¹...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand, {{nitrogen}} (N) {{inputs and}} losses have increased dramatically following establishment (and subsequent intensification) of European style pastoral agriculture from the 1800 s. An indicator that could identify soils which {{are most vulnerable}} to N loss {{would be useful to}} help target management practices aimed at reducing unwanted N losses. The natural abundance of ¹⁵N relative to ¹⁴N (δ¹⁵N) in soils is one potential indicator of N loss, because during most N transformations in soils, ¹⁴N is preferentially processed and lost (e. g. via ammonia volatilisation, denitrification or nitrate leaching). Therefore the overarching hypothesis for this thesis was that pastoral soils under intensive management regimes (with high N inputs, cycling and losses) would become progressively enriched with ¹⁵N relative to soils under less intensive management. This hypothesis was tested by measur ing δ¹⁵N in soils from four forest-to-pasture chronosequences, and in archived soils from six long-term (4 – 57 year) grazed field trials with different fertiliser or irrigation regimes. Three of the forest-to-pasture chronosequences were on pumice soils where pine forests had been converted to dairy pastures. The fourth chronosequence was on a podzol soil in Northland, where native scrub had been converted to sheep grazed pastures. Surface soil δ¹⁵N on the pumice soil increased significantly from pine forests (2 ‰) to long-term pastures (4. 1 ‰). In contrast, there was no clear relationship between pasture age and soil δ¹⁵N for the chronosequence on the podzol soil. The Northland soil displayed extreme podzolization and weathering, and had been previously disturbed by gum diggers, implying results could be relatively unique to this soil. The two longest field trials were at Winchmore on the Canterbury plains, where different rates of superphosphate and irrigation had been applied for ~ 50 years. Soil δ¹⁵N increased more in treatments receiving higher rates of superphosphate or more frequent irrigation, and there were significant positive correlations between the average rate of change in soil δ¹⁵N, and total pasture production, clover production (thus N fixation) and calculated N losses. Soil δ¹⁵N was also measured in archived soils from three long-term (¹⁵– 25 year) superphosphate trials on North Island hill country. In these trials there were no consistent differences in soil δ¹⁵N between treatments. The shorter duration of the hill country trials (compared to the Winchmore trials), combined with smaller differences in pasture production between treatments and higher variability due to complex topography, {{may have contributed to the}} lack of observed differences between treatments. Indeed, slope and aspect did have a significant influence on soil δ¹⁵N with higher values on sheltered east facing slopes, and on easy slopes than steep slopes. The final trial studied was a N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>trial,</b> in which N rates ranging from 0 to 750 kg ha–¹ y–¹ were applied to hill country pastures over a 4 year period. Soil δ¹⁵N increased significantly with time in treatments receiving > 100 kg N ha–¹ y–¹, and the increase was more rapid as N rate increased. There was also a positive correlation between the rate of change in soil δ¹⁵N and nitrate leaching (p 100 kg ha–¹ y–¹). More research will be required to further test the usefulness of this indicator. Key areas for future research include: gaining a better understanding of the effect of topography and soil type on soil δ¹⁵N, and making more direct measurements of the isotopic composition of different N inputs and outputs to more clearly identify mechanisms driving changes in soil δ¹⁵N in pastoral systems...|$|E
40|$|Many soil {{processes}} {{are related to}} cycles of water, carbon and nitrogen. Agricultural systems models are regularly employed to study such processes because {{of their ability to}} integrate and explore a range of environmental and crop management factors. However, no such model is currently available for oil palm production systems. We developed one within the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) framework and tested it using data from nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>trials</b> across a range of environments within Papua New Guinea. The model captured key trends in canopy development, biomass production and yield of fresh fruit bunches due to plantation age, climate and nitrogen management. The model was used to estimate the effects of plantation age and nitrogen fertiliser rates on carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in soil at one site. Soil carbon content increased during the immature phase and then stayed constant (with high fertiliser rate) or declined (zero fertiliser) during the mature phase. During the immature phase there were substantial leaching losses of NO 3, and gaseous emissions of N 2 O and N 2 from the soil, presumably driven by the inputs of nitrogen from the previous oil palm crop residues and from nitrogen fixation by the leguminous cover crop. During the mature phase, nitrogen losses increased with increasing fertiliser rate. The model is a useful tool for exploring possible effects of environmental and management factors on soil processes. Simulations suggested that the immature phase is an important and understudied period for nitrogen losses and soil organic matter accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{catchments}} in high N-deposition {{areas have}} low N retention. It has been hypothesised that {{under such conditions}} P addition may increase N retention in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. <b>Fertiliser</b> <b>trials</b> in N-saturated terrestrial ecosystems show that P addition can cause increased plant uptake of N. Few studies, however have focused on N leaching to surface waters. Theoretical considerations and limited empirical data suggest that P addition to acidic, oligotrophic lakes will stimulate NO 3 assimilation and thereby increase alkalinity and N retention within the lake. Near-shore coastal waters may benefit from reduced riverine N loading during summer in terms of reduced algal biomass and reduced probability of development of toxic dinoflagellate blooms. P treatment may be suitable to neutralise moderately acidified lakes and streams (pH> 5. 2). P addition will also increase biodiversity, stimulate aquatic production and improve the resource base for fish production. In more acidic lakes and streams, a combination of liming and moderate P addition may be an optimal management tool. We conclude that a large-scale experiment is necessary to test if P addition (both terrestrial and aquatic) might provide a mitigation technique for areas experiencing high NO 3 levels in surface waters. Possible technological solutions {{on how to use}} P to increase pH and stimulate biological production in acidified areas have been evaluated. Instead of adding P as PO 4 3 salts, P-containing wastewaters can be utilised at relatively low cost, after removing particulate matter, BOD, and N, but not P. HYDRO AS...|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} seven North and South Sumatra oil palm field <b>fertiliser</b> <b>trials,</b> which were {{recorded}} from 1994 - 2009, {{were used to}} study nutrient uptake and efficiencies. The different trial sites allowed effects of different soil properties and climate (rainfall) on dry matter production and yield to be investigated. Additional information was also assessed from two nursery trials to support the field trial results. The {{results showed that the}} nutrient recovery efficiency (RE), which is defined as palm nutrient uptake per unit of given nutrient is subject to variation in site properties. However, the field and nursery trial results demonstrated that the physiological efficiency (PE), or yield increment per unit of nutrient uptake of oil palm, at a particular age and planting material, remains relatively constant over a range of environments. The increased yield per unit of given fertiliser known as agronomic efficiency (AE) is therefore solely dependent upon the RE for a specific planting material. However, a nursery fertiliser showed variation for dry matter production for the same unit of nutrient uptake. Assuming the current daily field management practices have been developed to meet optimal RE and yield then agronomists are able to assess PE of different oil palm planting materials to screen the most suitable for different environments. From a practical point of view agronomists can predict potential yield based on dry matter production which can be helpful in determining the oil palm fertiliser requirement. PE results {{can also be used to}} identify and evaluate problem fields in oil palm plantations. ...|$|R
