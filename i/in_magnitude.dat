5|$|There {{are four}} Mira {{variable}} stars in Auriga: R Aurigae, UV Aurigae, U Aurigae, and X Aurigae, {{all of which}} are type M stars. More specifically, R Aurigae is of type M7III, UV Aurigae is of type C6 (a carbon star), U Aurigae is of type M9, and X Aurigae is of type K2. R Aurigae, with a period of 457.5 days, ranges <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> from a minimum of 13.9 to a maximum of 6.7.

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E

5|$|Ground {{temperature}} measurements, {{like most}} weather observations, are logged by location. Their siting predates the massive sprawl, roadbuilding programs, and high- and medium-rise expansions which {{contribute to the}} UHI. More importantly, station logs allow sites in question to be filtered easily from data sets.

50|$|This {{definition}} is convenient because the observed brightness {{of a light}} source is related to its distance by the inverse square law (a source twice as far away appears one quarter as bright) and because brightnesses are usually expressed not directly, but <b>in</b> <b>magnitudes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Stars {{can also}} vary in {{luminosity}} because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, {{as well as}} rotating stars that produce extreme starspots.

5|$|After World War II, Skopje greatly {{benefited from}} Socialist Yugoslav {{policies}} which encouraged {{industry and the}} development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a national philharmonic orchestra, a university and the Macedonian Academy. However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred 26 July. Although relatively weak <b>in</b> <b>magnitude,</b> it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|At {{least three}} red giants are Mira {{variables}} in Canis Minor. S Canis Minoris, of spectral type M7e, is the brightest, ranging from magnitude 6.6 to 13.2 {{over a period}} of 332.94 days. V Canis Minoris ranges from magnitude 7.4 to 15.1 {{over a period of}} 366.1 days. Similar <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> is R Canis Minoris, which has a maximum of 7.3, but a significantly brighter minimum of 11.6. An S-type star, it has a period of 337.8 days.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars {{visible to the naked}} eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the storm}} quickly downgraded, and by August 19 {{it was once}} again at minimal {{hurricane}} force. At roughly the same time, it turned more to the west, although it maintained a general northwesterly path. The abrupt weakening {{may have been the}} result of a seeding experiment carried out on the storm in an attempt to deteriorate it. By later in the day, Debbie had begun to restrengthen. It resumed Category 3 intensity on August 20, despite a minor oscillation <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> during the day. At this point, the cyclone acquired peak winds of 120mph (195km/h); shortly thereafter, its lowest recorded barometric pressure fell to 951 millibars.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Båth’s law {{states that}} the {{differences}} <b>in</b> <b>magnitudes</b> between mainshocks and their largest aftershocks are approximately constant, independent of the magni-tudes of mainshocks. In our modified form of Båth’s law we introduce {{the notion of the}} inferred “largest ” aftershock from an extrapolation of the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude statistics of the aftershock sequence of a given mainshock. To illustrate the application of this modified law we consider 10 large earthquakes that occurred in California between 1987 and 2003 with magnitudes equal to or greater than mms 5. 5. The mean difference <b>in</b> <b>magnitudes</b> between these mainshocks and their largest detected aftershocks is 1. 16 with a standard deviation rDm 0. 46 (Båth’s law). Our estimated mean difference <b>in</b> <b>magnitudes</b> between the mainshocks and the inferred “largest ” aftershocks is 1. 11 with rDm * 0. 29. The scaling asso-ciated with the modified Båth’s law implies that the stress transfer responsible for the occurrence of aftershocks is a self-similar process. We also estimate the parti-tioning of energy during a mainshock-aftershock sequence and find that about 96 % of the energy dissipated in a sequence is associated with the mainshock and the rest is due to aftershocks. We suggest that the observed partitioning of energy could {{play a crucial role in}} explaining the physical origin of Båth’s law...|$|R

5|$|In a study {{published}} in December 2000, the star's diameter was measured with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) at mid-infrared wavelengths producing a limb-darkened estimate of 55.2±0.5milliarcseconds (mas)—a figure entirely consistent with Michelson's findings eighty years earlier. At the time of its publication, the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63 ± 1.64mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6AU. However, an infrared interferometric {{study published}} in 2009 announced that the star had shrunk by 15% since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution <b>in</b> <b>magnitude.</b> Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star's extended atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{allometric}} exponent for sail {{height is}} similar <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> to the scaling of interspecific antler length to shoulder height in cervids. Furthermore, as Bakker (1970) {{observed in the}} context of Dimetrodon, many lizard species raise a dorsal ridge of skin during threat and courtship displays, and positively allometric, sexually dimorphic frills and dewlaps are present in extant lizards (Echelle et al. 1978; Christian et al. 1995). There is also evidence of sexual dimorphism both in the robustness of the skeleton and in the relative height of the spines of D. limbatus (Romer and Price 1940).|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider {{the case in}} which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel {{to the surface and}} an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases <b>in</b> <b>magnitude,</b> no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E

By 23 June 90 aftershocks had been reported at Ranau by the Malaysian Meteorological Department, ranging <b>in</b> <b>magnitudes</b> from 1.6 to 5.2.|$|R

5|$|The {{potential}} {{changes from}} extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> and type, {{based on the}} extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity. The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} {{of a star}} determines its spectral type via {{its effect on the}} physical properties of plasma in its photosphere. A star's energy emission as a function of wavelength is influenced by both its temperature and composition. A key indicator of this energy distribution is given by the color index, B−V, which measures the star's magnitude in blue (B) and green-yellow (V) light by means of filters. This difference <b>in</b> <b>magnitude</b> provides a measure of a star's temperature.|$|E
