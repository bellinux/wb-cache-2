25|$|The two Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana present Vaishnava {{philosophy}} and culture embedded in legends and dialogues. The epics {{are considered the}} fifth Veda, in Hindu culture. The Ramayana describes the story of Rama, an avatara of Vishnu, and is taken as {{a history of the}} 'ideal king', based on the principles of dharma, morality and ethics. Rama's wife Sita, his brother Lakshman, with his devotee and follower Hanuman all play key roles within the Vaishnava tradition as examples of Vaishnava etiquette and behaviour. Ravana, the evil king and villain of the epic, is presented as an epitome of adharma, playing the opposite role of <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to behave.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, {{he also said the}} film is [...] "an opera, not a documentary. That's what I say when people say it's historically inaccurate". He was also quoted in a BBC News story as saying that the film is, at its core [...] "a fantasy film". He also describes the film's narrator, Dilios, as [...] "a guy who knows <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to wreck a good story with truth".|$|E

500|$|Ball quotes the 2nd Edition's {{epigraph}} by the statistician Karl Pearson: [...] "I {{believe the}} day must {{come when the}} biologist will—without being a mathematician—not hesitate to use mathematical analysis when he requires it." [...] Ball argues that Thompson [...] "presents mathematical principles as a shaping agency that may supersede natural selection, showing how the structures of the living world often echo those in inorganic nature", and notes his [...] "frustration at the 'Just So' explanations of morphology offered by Darwinians." [...] Instead, Ball argues, Thompson elaborates on <b>how</b> <b>not</b> heredity but physical forces govern biological form. Ball suggests that [...] "The book's central motif is the logarithmic spiral", evidence in Thompson's eyes of the universality of form and the reduction of many phenomena to a few principles of mathematics.|$|E
500|$|The {{film is a}} shot-for-shot {{adaptation}} of the comic book, similar to the film {{adaptation of}} Sin City. Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book, from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. [...] "It was a fun process for me… to have a frame as a goal to get to," [...] he said. Like the comic book, the adaptation also used the character Dilios as a narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal [...] "Frank Miller world" [...] of 300 was told from a subjective perspective. By using Dilios' gift of storytelling, {{he was able to}} introduce fantasy elements into the film, explaining that [...] "Dilios is a guy who knows <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to wreck a good story with truth." [...] Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{learned from}} Ezra Pound {{how to achieve}} a stripped-down style and how to {{incorporate}} the concepts of imagism in his prose. He said Pound [...] "had taught him more 'about how to write and <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to write' than any {{son of a bitch}} alive"; and his friend James Joyce told him [...] "to pare down his work to the essentials". The prose is spare and lacks a clear symbolism. Instead of more conventional literary allusions, Hemingway relied on repetitive metaphors or metonymy to build images. The caesarian is repeatedly associated with words such as [...] "the blanket" [...] and [...] "the bunk" [...] in a series of objective correlatives, a technique Hemingway learned from T.S. Eliot. Tetlow believes in this early story Hemingway ignored character development; he simply places a character in a setting, and adds descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound, which give a sense of truth.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, he was {{surprised}} by Eamonn Andrews for an episode of This Is Your Life. Later in the year he published a novel, The Footballer. Author Melvyn Bragg wrote that The Footballer was [...] "predictable" [...] with [...] "thinly drawn" [...] characters, but praised the dialogue and the [...] "narrative flair". Dougan reprised his role in ITV's World Cup coverage for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, with Brian Clough and Jack Charlton replacing Crerand and McNab. In 1976, Dougan assisted historian Percy M. Young in producing On the Spot: Football as a Profession, a social history book that included anecdotes and insight from Dougan to compliment Young's research. He published a third autobiography in 1980, entitled Doog, which revealed his disdain for Bill McGarry. The following year he published <b>How</b> <b>Not</b> to Run Football, which condemned the footballing authorities for what Dougan termed a [...] "Victorian-Edwardian" [...] attitude. In 1983, he co-authored Matches of the Day with Pat Murphy.|$|E
500|$|The {{tranquil}} domestic routine {{ended when}} an Army faction rebelled and deposed PedroII on 15 November 1889, ordering the entire Imperial Family to leave Brazil. Upon hearing {{the order to}} depart, an officer told the Empress: [...] "Resignation, my lady." [...] She replied to him: [...] "I have it always, but <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to weep having to leave this land forever!" [...] According to historian Roderick J. Barman, the [...] "events of November 15, 1889, broke her emotionally and physically." [...] The Empress [...] "loved Brazil and its inhabitants. She desired {{nothing more than to}} end her days there. Aged 66 and plagued by both cardiac asthma and arthritis, she now faced the prospect of accompanying her husband in unceasing movement across the face of Europe, spending her last years virtually alone in alien and uncomfortable lodgings." [...] Having been ill during almost the entire voyage across the Atlantic, Teresa Cristina and her family arrived in Lisbon, Portugal, on 7 December.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway was {{inspired}} by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence {{can be seen in}} the stripped-down, minimalist style [...] characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound [...] "taught [...] more about how to write and <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to write than any son of a bitch alive". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to [...] "get the most from the least, [...] prune language, [...] multiply intensities, [...] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.|$|E

500|$|Blandine and Cosima were {{subjected}} to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima's biographer Oliver Hilmes likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: [...] "Above all, Patersi taught her how a 'noble lady' must behave, how to alight from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to betray herself when she was hurt". On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, {{his first visit to}} his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner. Carolyne's daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima's appearance as [...] "in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, sallow ... the image of her father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful". After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become Götterdämmerung. Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.|$|E
500|$|After Sony {{canceled}} {{their shared}} universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws {{of the first}} Amazing Spider-Man film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel [...] "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course." [...] Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [...] "was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, Amazing Spider-Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." [...] This would have saved Sony [...] "a boatload of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.|$|E
500|$|The typescript of {{the essay}} is headed by an epigraph, {{attributed}} to The Upbringing of Daughters by Catherine Durning Whethem. It reads: [...] "The chief justification of reading books of any sort is the enlargement of experience that should accrue therefrom". The text which follows is, in Motion's words, [...] "a homily on how and <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to write for children". It argues for the need for well-drawn heroines, and for unrepentant villainesses: [...] "To be tenacious in evil {{is the duty of}} every villain... Let her hate the heroine wholeheartedly, and refuse, yes, even on the last page, to take her hand in forgiveness". The story should not be about schoolgirls, but about a school with girls in it. The school must be English; foreign settings or trips abroad are disparaged. Larkin, in Coleman's voice, pleads for [...] "the Classic Unities": Unity of Place, which is the school and its inhabitants; Unity of Time, normally the term in which the action occurs; and Unity of Action, whereby every recorded incident contributes in some way to the telling of the story. The essay is laden with quotations from many writers of the genre, among them Joy Francis, Dorita Fairlie Bruce, Elsie J. Oxenham, Elinor Brent-Dyer and Nancy Breary.|$|E

500|$|The Marines, {{especially}} Latham, taught Reckless battlefield {{survival skills}} such as <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, [...] "incoming!" [...] The platoon called it her [...] "hoof training" [...] and [...] "hoof camp". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond {{of a wide variety}} of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day. [...] Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her horse blanket, and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.|$|E
500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{established}} {{as one of}} the show's primary settings, Monica's large Greenwich Village apartment has since {{become one of the most}} famous and iconic television sets in history. Steffani Cameron of BuildDirect wrote that Monica's [...] "apartment was unlike anything else on TV. It was full of color, clutter, and personality. It was a space cobbled together of kitsch and class, and it was just magic", citing its windows, color and openness among her favourite things about the apartment. Harper's Bazaar magazine ranked it among the [...] "12 Best Apartments on TV". Chloe Daley of Refinery29 joked that the apartment serves as both [...] "a lesson in how to decorate with purple" [...] and [...] "a lesson in <b>how</b> <b>not</b> to". Based on its total number of bedrooms, open kitchen concept, large living space and balcony, real estate agent Sydney Blumstein estimates that the apartment would be worth approximately 2.3million in 2015. In terms of its size and affordability, the apartment has frequently been the subject of scrutiny; critics constantly question how Monica, a chef, and Rachel, a waitress, were able to afford such a luxurious home based on their relatively low incomes, often dismissing the show's explanation that this is due to an illegal sublet courtesy of Monica's late grandmother. Hollywood.com's Abbey Stone ranked it television's 10th [...] "most ridiculous" [...] apartment, while The Village Voice placed it at number four in a similar article.|$|E
