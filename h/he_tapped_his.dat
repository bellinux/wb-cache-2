2500|$|Chiang Ching-kuo {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} in 1978, and in July 1987, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> old confidante Lee Huan to be the KMT’s new Secretary-General. [...] Chiang told Lee that he had three goals he would like Lee to fulfill: reform the KMT, move the ROC towards democracy, and move the ROC towards reunification. In {{a speech to the}} KMT’s Kaohsiung headquarters in September 1987, Lee declared that the KMT’s goal was no longer to replace the communist party ruling mainland China, but rather to [...] "push for democracy, freedom of the press, and an open economy in the mainland so as to rid China of Communism and to move it toward a democratic modern state." [...] Many in the KMT’s right-wing claimed the speech betrayed the party’s historic commitment to destroy the communists; Chiang countered by instructing Lee to publish the entire speech in the party’s official journal. The role Lee played in the lifting of martial law in Taiwan and subsequent reforms to the National Assembly led to assembly members characterizing Lee as one of the Red Guards.|$|E
60|$|The officer {{smiled and}} shook his head. Then <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} meaningly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> head triumphantly, and, with a bleared, shining old eye, {{winked at}} the cook.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, {{a fortune}} lies under every virtue we assume," [...] he recited. [...] "But {{she is not}} for you, Richard," [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> box.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so you {{are turned}} Jew?" [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> snuffbox. [...] "Before you go ahead so fast again, you will please to remember, d--n you, that Mr. Carvel is the kind that does not lose his friends with his fortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} the whole case here," [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> forehead--"the whole case, as neat and clean {{as if it was}} drawn in a brief. That master of yours doesn't stick at a trifle, William. It's my opinion that your {{mistress}} and you have not seen the last of him yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Old M. des Cadoux {{laughed in}} the dark, as with his sword {{hanging from his}} wrist <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> snuff-box.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> {{handsome}} nose with his pencil. [...] "They {{have made me}} happy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't see why {{he crossed}} the river in that fashion," [...] grumbled the freight agent, as <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> horse with the whip.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} was less at <b>his</b> ease. <b>He</b> stood <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> boot nervously with his long riding-whip.|$|R
60|$|PAUL. Alas, Simone, too true. (<b>He</b> <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> coat pocket.) There it lies. To-morrow I have {{a hundred}} and seventy {{thousand}} francs to pay, or be dishonoured. I cannot pay the sum. A Barbazange does not survive dishonour. My ancestors were Crusaders, preux chevaliers to a man. Their code is mine. Dishonour for me is worse than death.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> with <b>his</b> {{finger on}} the table, and Tuppence felt again the intense power that {{radiated}} from the man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only a {{few things}} of no importance," [...] {{answered}} Roger. <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> breast pocket. [...] "Those papers are here, and my money is here, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother's {{last letter}} to me," [...] said the boy, with a flush of {{pleasure}} as <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> breast. [...] "I have it safe here, and scarcely damaged at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're coming, master! You {{and your}} {{mistress}} must to earth unless {{you mean to}} face them in the open," [...] and the pale eyes glittered as <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> great black bow.|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN: (Laughs emptily) My {{centre of}} gravity is displaced. I have {{forgotten}} the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (<b>He</b> <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> brow) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> {{them with}} <b>his</b> forefinger, and the Prince nodded thoughtfully.|$|R
50|$|Under the EZ-Link system, when {{a person}} <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> card on the entry card reader, the system deducts the maximum fare payable from his bus stop {{to the end of}} the bus route. If <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> card on the exit reader when he disembarks, the system will return an amount based on the {{remaining}} bus stages {{to the end of the}} bus route. If <b>he</b> fails to <b>tap</b> the card on the exit reader when he disembarks, the entry card reader would have already deducted the maximum fare payable to the end of the bus route.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sally Glue is eighty-five," [...] {{explained}} the vicar, [...] "and Annie Glassbound is well--a young lady of extremely generous proportions. And not quite right, you know. Not quite right--here." [...] <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Relented!" [...] {{cried the}} young man, [...] "not a sou. C'est egal! I {{have the means}} here," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> pocket, [...] "I have the means here to set me on my feet again, Madame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sober, Baas, I am indeed. Last night I was drunk, to-day {{nothing is}} left but a pain here," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> great head. [...] "Why are you tying up that old cow Soa, Baas?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{he deems}} Mr Venus's wheels {{sufficiently}} lubricated, Mr Wegg approaches his object by asking, as <b>he</b> lightly <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> hands together, to express an undesigning frame of mind: ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the evening}} before the Geddington match, just before lock-up, Mike tapped at Burgess's study door. <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> with <b>his</b> right hand, for his left was in a sling.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad {{to share}} it with you. I have much of it here, and a little goes a great way, as you will soon discover," [...] <b>he</b> answered, <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> leg. She {{was past}} {{the stage of}} shudders now. Stiff all over, unable even to move her eyes, she felt an awful mental tension which was like blank forgetfulness. Ricardo tried to {{influence}} her in his own way.|$|E
60|$|Des Cadoux, who {{had also}} risen, seemed {{to take in the}} {{situation}} at a glance. Like a well-bred gamester who knows how to lose with a good grace the old gentleman laughed drily to himself as <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> snuff-box.|$|E
60|$|Otter {{looked at}} him for a while, then <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} significantly and started down the slope again. An hour later, Leonard, still dozing, was awakened by a sound of many voices, and by a hand that shook him not too gently.|$|E
60|$|Ennison looked {{steadily}} at {{the cigarette}} which <b>he</b> was <b>tapping</b> on <b>his</b> forefinger.|$|R
50|$|Carrie watches Brody's TV {{appearances}} and notices that <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> fingers in a repeated pattern, believing {{that he is}} giving a coded message. This observation convinces her CIA mentor, Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), to help her obtain a technically legal FISA warrant for Brody's home. Carrie continues surveilling Brody after her warrant expires and breaches CIA protocol by approaching him at {{a support group for}} veterans. They bond immediately over their shared experiences in the Middle East. The two eventually embark on a sexual relationship.|$|R
60|$|That was why, {{at twelve}} o'clock punctually on this Spring day, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> with <b>his</b> cane on R. Jones' ground glass, and showed such {{satisfaction}} and relief {{when the door}} was opened by the proprietor in person.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Mr. Caryll. [...] "That is {{more the}} man I know." [...] <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> snuff-box, {{and in that}} moment memory rather than {{inspiration}} showed him the thing he needed. [...] "Did ye ever see 'The Constant Couple,' Mr. Green?" [...] he inquired.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> folded leg {{below the}} knee, and was surprised, flattered, by the {{lighting}} up of her face, which stooped towards him eagerly and remained expectant, the lips girlishly parted, {{red in the}} pale face, and quivering in the quickened drawing of her breath.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} smartly, {{and turned}} to the first page of the manuscript before him, with an unconcealed triumph at the prospect of exhibiting his own cleverness, which was the first expression of a genuine feeling of any sort that had escaped him yet.|$|E
500|$|Mark Giordano {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario on October 3, 1983. His father, Paul, is {{a real estate agent}} and his mother, Anna, a hairdresser. [...] Giordano has an older sister, Michelle, and had another older sister, Mia, who was killed in a car {{accident}} when he was 14. [...] <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> helmet twice with his stick at the end of the national anthems before each game as a quiet tribute to his sister, whose death had a lasting impact on Giordano and his family and brought them closer together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell, by all means. Don't I {{always keep}} your secrets {{and give you}} the best advice, like a model guardian? You must have a confidant, and where find a better one than here?" [...] <b>he</b> asked, <b>tapping</b> <b>his</b> {{waistcoat}} with an inviting gesture.|$|R
5000|$|Being a San Diego native, Jones is {{a season}} ticket holder for the San Diego Gulls and has even {{worked as an}} off ice referee for the team. [...] Pre 2016, Jones {{typically}} pied teammates during post-game interviews after they drive in the winning run or make the most contributions to the team's victory at home. Jones has four tattoos. One {{of his mother and}} another of his grandmother, who he calls [...] "the two most important women in my life", on his left shoulder. Whenever crossing the plate after hitting a home run, <b>he</b> <b>taps</b> <b>his</b> left shoulder as a tribute.|$|R
