40|$|NK 1 receptors, which bind {{substance}} P, {{are present}} in the majority of brainstem regions that contain CO 2 /H +-sensitive neurons that play a role in central chemosensitivity. However, the effect of substance P on the chemosensitive response of neurons from these regions has not been studied. Hypoxia increases substance P release from peripheral afferents that terminate in the caudal nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Here we studied the effect of substance P on the chemosensitive responses of solitary complex (SC: NTS and dorsal motor nucleus) neurons from control and chronic hypoxia-adapted (CHx) adult rats. We simultaneously measured intracellular pH and electrical responses to hypercapnic acidosis in SC neurons from control and CHx adult rats using the blind whole cell patch clamp technique and fluorescence <b>imaging</b> microscopy. <b>Substance</b> P significantly increased the basal firing rate in SC neurons from control and CHx rats, although the increase was smaller in CHx rats. However, substance P did not affect the chemosensitive response of SC neurons from either group of rats. In conclusion, we found that substance P plays a role in modulating the basal firing rate of SC neurons but the magnitude of the effect is smaller for SC neurons from CHx adult rats, implying that NK 1 receptors may be down regulated in CHx adult rats.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) allows quantitative in-vivo sectional <b>imaging</b> of radiolabelled <b>substances.</b> 511 keV gamma quanta from the annihilation of positron and electron are detected in coincidence by a ring-shaped structure of bismuth germanate (BGO) scintillators and corresponding light detectors. Existing gamma detectors {{fail to meet}} all the requirements of high resolution, high efficiency PET {{for the evaluation of}} new tracer molecules in a future noninvasive autoradiography. Modern avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are low noise, blue-sensitive light detectors. Unlike bulky photomultipliers, APDs can read out individual scintillators in a one-to-one coupling permitting new detector designs. The use of APDs is favoured by the increasing availability of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) as new scintillation material of high light yield. While having an attenuation coefficient for 511 keV gamma rays comparable to BGO, LSO also shows a much shorter scintillation light decay time. In this study, LSO crystals, newly developed single element APDs and custom-made amplifying electronics have been characterized and optimized. (orig.)

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Novel imaging techniques using biomarkers have clarified {{the mechanisms of}} hitherto unanswered or misunder-stood phenomena of coronary artery disease and enabled eval-uation of myocardial blood and tissue fluid flows in vivo. Dye-staining coronary angioscopy using Evans blue (EB) as the biomarker can visualize fibrin and damaged endothelial cells, revealing that the so-called platelet thrombus is frequent-ly a fibrin-rich thrombus; occlusive transparent fibrin throm-bus, but not platelet thrombus, is not infrequently a cause of acute coronary syndrome; Bfluffy ^ coronary luminal surface is caused by fibrin threads arising from damaged endothelial cells and is a residue of an occlusive thrombus after autolysis in patients with acute coronary syndrome without angiograph-ically demonstrable coronary stenosis; and web or membrane-like fibrin thrombus is a cause of stent edge restenosis.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} algorithms for tomographic reconstructions {{described in}} Chapter 3 {{are based on}} projection data. These projections can represent, for example, the attenuation of x-rays through an object as in conventional x-ray tomography, the decay of radioactive nucleoids in the body as in emission tomography, or the refractive index variations as in ultrasonic tomography. This chapter will discuss the measurement of projection data with energy that travels in straight lines through objects. This is always the case when a human body is illuminated with x-rays and is a close approximation to what happens when ultrasonic tomography {{is used for the}} imaging of soft biological tissues (e. g., the female breast). Projection data, by their very nature, are a result of interaction between the radiation used for <b>imaging</b> and the <b>substance</b> of which the object is composed. To a first approximation, such interactions can be modeled as measuring integrals of some characteristic of the object. A simple example of this is the attenuation a beam of x-rays undergoes as it travels through an object. A lin...|$|R

Direct detection of magnetic nanoparticles {{can be achieved by}} magnetic nanoparticle relaxation measurements, i. e. determination of the relaxing magnetization of magnetic nanoparticles after a magnetizing field is switched off [4]. There are two relaxation mecha-nisms for magnetic nanoparticles (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 : Relaxation mechanisms of magnetic nanoparticles In fluids, magnetic nanoparticles can relax accord-ing to the Brownian relaxation mechanism, i. e. the entire particle rotates in the surrounding fluid with typical relaxation times within a range of microsec-onds. The second mechanism is Néel relaxation, i. e. the magnetization rotates within the magnetic core. In our experiments we use magnetic nanoparticles with Néel relaxation times predominately ranging from milliseconds to seconds. This difference in relaxation times enables discrimination between freely movable and bound magnetic nanoparticles [4]. The aim {{of the study was to}} use magnetic nanopar-ticle relaxation measurements to investigate the mobility of magnetic nanoparticles stabilized with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in the blood, liver and spleen of rats after intravenous injection.

40|$|Studies on the {{characteristics}} of individuals with hypersexual disorder have been accumulating due to increasing concerns about problematic hypersexual behavior (PHB). Currently, relatively {{little is known about the}} underlying behavioral and neural mechanisms of sexual desire. Our study aimed to investigate the neural correlates of sexual desire with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-three individuals with PHB and 22 age-matched healthy controls were scanned while they passively viewed sexual and nonsexual stimuli. The subjects’ levels of sexual desire were assessed in response to each sexual stimulus. Relative to controls, individuals with PHB experienced more frequent and enhanced sexual desire during exposure to sexual stimuli. Greater activation was observed in the caudate nucleus, inferior parietal lobe, dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the PHB group than in the control group. In addition, the hemodynamic patterns in the activated areas differed between the groups. Consistent with the findings of brain <b>imaging</b> studies of <b>substance</b> and behavior addiction, individuals with the behavioral characteristics of PHB and enhanced desire exhibited altered activation in the prefrontal cortex and subcortical regions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{pictorial}} essay is to demonstrate the imaging features (ultrasound, mammogram, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) of AlloDerm® (LifeCell Corp.; Branchburg, NJ), an acellular dermal matrix sometimes used in both primary and reconstructive breast surgeries. AlloDerm® is derived from cadaveric dermis and provides an immunologically inert scaffold in tissue reconstruction. Since there is little literature on the <b>imaging</b> of this <b>substance,</b> radiologists may be unfamiliar with its appearance in breast imaging. For this manuscript, ex vivo and in vivo images of AlloDerm® in postmastectomy patients were evaluated using different imaging modalities. The appearance of AlloDerm® can vary based on length of time postsurgery and incorporation into the host. AlloDerm® appears as an isodense to glandular tissue on a mammogram and isoechoic to glandular tissue on ultrasound imaging. On MRI, in comparison with normal breast parenchyma, AlloDerm® is hyperintense on T 2 -weighted imaging and isointense on T 1 -weighted imaging and demonstrates mild enhancement. To {{the best of the}} authors′ knowledge, this is the first multimodality imaging description of AlloDerm® used in postmastectomy patients. The conformation of AlloDerm® at surgical placement and the degree of host cell migration and neoangiogenesis are factors to take into consideration when performing diagnostic evaluations; and, familiarity with the various imaging appearances of AlloDerm® can be helpful to exclude residual or recurrent disease...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{induction}} tomography (MIT) is {{an exciting}} yet challenging research topic. It is sensitive to all passive electromagnetic properties, and as such it has great appeal to many industries. This thesis presents an experimental investigation of MIT within two broad ar- eas of application: non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and industrial process tomography. Within both areas, MIT {{is presented as a}} low cost and non-invasive inspection tool with considerable developmental potential with regard to commercial applicability. Experi- mental investigations into the use of MIT demonstrate its versatility in <b>imaging</b> conduc- tive <b>substances</b> ranging from metallic structures, such as pipelines (s ⇡ 106 108 S/m) to new composite material, such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (s ⇡ 104 105 S/m), as well as substances in a state of flow (s < 10 S/m). Research innovations presented in this thesis constitute (i) the first experimental evalu- ation of MIT for pipeline inspection, an application never before attempted in the area of NDE, (ii) the development of a novel limited region algorithm, which can improve the traditional resolution from 10 % to 2 %, (iii) the first experimental 3 D planar MIT study for subsurface imaging, which opens many opportunities for MIT as a limited access tomog- raphy technique, (iv) an in-depth experimental evaluation of the MIT system response towards various fluid measurements for the first time, while also reporting some of the first flow rig tests in this field. In addition, for each specific application, the capabilities of the prototype MIT systems are assessed with regard to (v) their flexibility in accommodating different sensor geometries, including circular, dual planar, planar and arc, (vi) situations in which the imaging subject has limited access, and (vii) their capacity to reconstruct a viable image of the subject given limited measurement data. Altogether, the results provide an evidential basis for future exploitation of this tech- nique. From the experimental investigations, it is concluded that the major limitations of this technique lie in both the hardware development {{in order to meet the}} standards of widespread commercial applications and the software capability for fully automated real time image reconstruction and structural analysis of the imaging subject. Nevertheless, with consistent development in both aforementioned areas, MIT could eventually be used as a rapid NDE technique for structural health monitoring and process tomography, as such contributing both to the social economy and public safety...|$|R
40|$|In beagle dogs, the {{alterations}} of intraosseous {{pressure and}} blood {{supply in the}} femoral head that result from the administration of vasoactive substances were examined, and the changes were documented by magnetic resonance <b>imaging</b> (MRI). Vasoactive <b>substance</b> were infused into the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries of 12 beagle dogs. All infusions were done under standardised conditions with simultaneous measurements of venous blood flow and intraosseous pressure distribution in the proximal femur. The drugs were infused in three cycles of 30 min each separated by 30 min recovery periods, followed by MRI examination {{at the end of}} each experiment. At an intraosseous pressure of 14. 3 (+/- 4. 2) mmHg in the femoral head epiphysis (I), 11. 6 (+/- 2. 7) mmHg in the greater trochanter (II) and 9. 3 (+/- 3. 2) mmHg in the femoral shaft (III), a baseline flow of 96. 2 (+/- 18. 8, n = 12) ml/min was measured in the femoral vein. After infusing bradykinin at a concentration of 10 (- 6) moles, which is commonly known to lead to cerebral and subcutaneous oedema formation by vessel dilatation, the intraosseous pressure increased to (I) : 49. 1 (+/- 6. 2) mmHg, (II) : 42. 5 (+/- 5. 8) mmHg and (III) : 38. 3 (+/- 7. 1) mmHg in the three measured femoral areas (n = 3). After the bradykinin injection, femoral vein flow increased to a peak value of 238. 4 (+/- 43. 4) ml/min and then dropped to 62. 3 (+/- 14. 2) ml/min after discontinuation of the bradykinin infusion. In a second and third series of tests, hyperosmolar (20 % NaCl) and hypo-osmolar (distilled water) solutions were applied, also resulting in increased but lower mean intraosseous pressure values (17. 3 +/- 4. 1 and 25. 7 +/- 5. 1 ml/min, respectively) in all regions. When administering bradykinin, MRI scans taken immediately after completion of the experiment showed substantial oedema in the femoral muscular system, but without any changes of osseous signals in T 1 - or short time inversion recovery (STIR) -weighted images, nor did any changes occur when solutions of 20 % NaCl or distilled H 2 O were injected. The results of our experiments demonstrate that acute increases of intraosseous pressure do not cause MRI signal alterations. We therefore conclude that in addition to the described pressure increase, other intraosseous alterations must occur to lead to the detectable signal changes found among patients with diagnosed femoral head necrosis. Finally, the short time period between the rise in intraosseous pressure and performing a conventional MRI may be one reason for missing the development of an intraosseous oedema. On the other hand, conventional MRI might have additional disadvantages for detecting intraosseous fluid compared with a dynamic imaging modalit...|$|R
