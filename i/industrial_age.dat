5|$|Richelieu {{was laid}} down at Toulon in 1869 and {{launched}} on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not suitable for the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Age.</b> The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876. She was placed in reserve on 3 December 1879.|$|E
5|$|Friedland {{was laid}} down at Lorient in January 1865 and {{launched}} on 15 October 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed with working practices more suitable for the <b>industrial</b> <b>age.</b> The ship began her sea trials on 1 May 1875, but was not completed until 20 June 1877. Friedland joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1878 and the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax from 6–16 July 1881 {{as part of the}} French occupation of Tunisia. She was reduced to reserve in 1887 and decommissioned in 1893. Friedland returned to active duty in 1893, but was paid off in 1898 and condemned in 1902.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the SS-SBR (Soil Slurry - Sequencing Batch Reactor) process for the remediation of soils contaminated by several organic pollutants has been evaluated. Experimental tests have been performed on two different soils, a spiked one and an <b>industrial</b> <b>aged</b> soil. The spiked soil, artificially contaminated, has been prepared trying to simulate the pollution of an <b>industrial</b> <b>aged</b> soil in terms of number and kind of contaminants. PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and phenols degradation has been particularly investigated because they are considered persistent and recalcitrant. Concerning the spiked soil, removal efficiencies higher than 95 % in 6 to 9 weeks have been found for all the pollutants, except for five-rings PAHs; however, these compounds were partly removed in I I to 13 weeks. Good results have been achieved also for the <b>industrial</b> <b>aged</b> soil with a maximum removal of about 80 % in 7 - 8 weeks. To enhance the pollutants degradation, trying to obtain a faster remediation, the biological treatment has been combined with a chemical oxidation with ozone. The best degradation {{effectiveness of}} the combined process has been obtained applying the ozonation after few days of the biological treatment...|$|R

The ship was placed in reserve upon her return until she recommissioned on 15 August 1878 in preparation for a commission as flagship of the Caribbean Squadron which began on 6 October under Rear Admiral Peyron. Two years later she sailed to Cherbourg and was reduced to reserve on 13 May 1880.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth and {{twentieth century}} avant-garde artistic {{movements}} {{took an interest}} in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. In the late nineteenth century, William Morris founded the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the value of traditional craft skills that seemed to be disappearing in the mass <b>industrial</b> <b>age.</b> His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works using traditional printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris also invented three distinctive typefaces - Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.|$|E

60|$|One {{wide and}} widest 'outline' ought really, in all ways, to be {{becoming}} clear to us; this namely: That a 'Splendour of God,' {{in one form}} or other, will have to unfold itself from the heart of these our <b>Industrial</b> <b>Ages</b> too; or they will never get themselves 'organised;' but continue chaotic, distressed, distracted evermore, and have to perish in frantic suicidal dissolution. A second 'outline' or prophecy, narrower, but also wide enough, seems not less certain: That there will again be a King in Israel; a system of Order and Government; and every man shall, in some measure, see himself constrained to do that which is right in the King's eyes. This too we may call a sure element of the Future; for this too is of the Eternal;--this too is of the Present, though hidden from most; and without it no fibre of the Past ever was. An actual new Sovereignty, Industrial Aristocracy, real not imaginary Aristocracy, is indispensable and indubitable for us.|$|R

25|$|Written {{reports of}} rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of {{branches}} {{were used to}} create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions.

In 1880, the first fish ladder was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam.

25|$|The feudalism {{of medieval}} rural England was {{yielding}} to changing times. Wealth, {{as defined by}} landholding, was once monopolised by the ancient gentry. But the developments {{of the age of}} iron were stoking the ambitions of the entrepreneurs of the first <b>industrial</b> <b>age.</b> Among the earliest beneficiaries of this change were some of England's oldest families: the Nevilles, the Sackvilles, the Sidneys, the Boleyns, the Dudleys and the Howards. Their enormous landholdings translated into wood for furnaces, and combined with their political clout, made them candidates for the ranks of the magnates of the coming age of iron. They and their servants became ironmasters.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{explosive}} increase in traffic {{at the height}} of the <b>industrial</b> <b>age,</b> the station was soon unable to cope with the growing demand. A separate marshalling yard was built in the 1880s, situated on the southern side of the passenger station. However, this did not provide real relief, and therefore the station area underwent major reconstruction starting in 1911 and finishing by 1929. The railway lines were laid on elevated embankments and the trackbed inside the station was raised, the old station building, originally built as an island platform, was torn down and replaced by the current building, the construction of which was finished by 1920.|$|E
