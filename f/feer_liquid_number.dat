40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a simple two-phase flow model for liquid-cut gas wells, which considers phase slippage {{and can be}} applied to various flow patterns. The model is developed from 312 measured pressure losses of gas wells in China, covering a wide range of flow patterns: annular flow, churn flow, and slug flow. Unlike most available methods, this new model introduces a derivation factor, ψ, to modify the void fraction, which not only considers the phase slippage but also unifies the slip model with the homogenous model. Parameter, ψ, is obtained from test data using the regression analyses method. It is a function of gas velocity <b>number,</b> <b>liquid</b> velocity <b>number</b> and <b>liquid</b> viscosity <b>number.</b> Frictional factor is estimated using the simple homogeneous modeling approach. The evaluation results using 145 published data indicate that the new model performed better than the other models...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} an original method to measure nitrification rates at different depths of a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) with variable contents {{of organic matter}} (sludge, colonized gravel). The method was adapted for organic matter sampled in constructed wetland (sludge, colonized gravel) operated under partially saturated conditions {{and is based on}} respirometric principles. Measurements were performed on a reactor, containing a mixture of organic matter (sludge, colonized gravel) mixed with a bulking agent (wood), on which an ammonium-containing liquid was applied. The oxygen demand was determined from analysing oxygen concentration of the gas passing through the reactor with an on-line analyzer equipped with a paramagnetic detector. Within this paper we present the overall methodology, the factors influencing the measurement (sample volume, nature and concentration of the applied <b>liquid,</b> <b>number</b> of successive applications), and the robustness of the method. The combination of this new method with a mass balance approach also allowed determining the concentration and maximum growth rate of the autotrophic biomass in different layers of a VFCW.

Tumor was implanted in 30 female mice distributed in three groups: treated with PTU, treated with thyroxine and control. Each group received an intraperitoneal injection of neoplastic cells, pre-incubated with sterile solutions of PTU, thyroxine and distilled water, respectively. On the fifth and seventh days after inoculation, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of the respective solutions. On the tenth day after inoculation, animals were sacrificed. Volume of ascitic <b>liquid,</b> <b>number</b> of neoplastic cells/ml and percentage of viable cells were determined. Ascitic liquid smears were carried out for tumor cytological evaluation.

In this group, there was a predominance of clear, round cells with abundant eosinophilic and very vacuolated cytoplasm with little defined edges.

40|$|The {{emissions}} of {{oxides of nitrogen}} (NOx) released from combustion chambers {{have been the subject}} of numerous experimental, theoretical and numerical studies in recent years. These emissions are directly related to the quality of fuel air mixing prior to combustion in gas turbines. Presently, Lean pre-mixed pre-vaporizing (LPP) concept is considered to reduce NOx emissions in gas turbines. Therefore, their reduction relies on a more accurate prediction of transport phenomena and interaction between the liquid fuel with the turbulent gas flow field. In LPP concept, liquid fuel is sprayed onto a hot wall thereby forming a thin film. A high velocity co-current hot compressed gas stream blows over this film. The thin film evaporates, and the vapor mixes in the gas stream to form a combustible mixture. The study of the various mechanisms governing transport phenomena in such flows is an important step towards understanding the pre-mixing and pre-vaporization process. The shear force imposed by the gas flow at the gas-liquid interface causes the formation of interfacial waves, and the velocity and amplitude of the traveling waves increase with the rise in interfacial shear force. Furthermore, increase in the interfacial shear force leads to enhancement in the heat and mass transfer rates. The shear-driven flows are turbulent and characterized by strong fluctuations in the velocities of the two phases (air and liquid fuel). In order to have detailed insight of unsteady two-phase flows and thermodynamic processes, new numerical techniques and specific experiments are essential. The present study focuses on development of numerical model for description of unsteady two-phase flows in an externally heated channel. Within the framework of this dissertation, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is utilized to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern transport processes in shear-driven liquid film flows on heated walls. The numerical studies are performed in OpenFOAM, an open source CFD code written in the C++ language. The open source code is further modified to perform detailed studies of heat transfer in two-phase flows. To predict the interfacial phenomena of two-phase flow, a Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach with an Eulerian-Eulerian method is adopted. The transport phenomenon in an unsteady two-phase flow behavior is studied in combination with Continuum Surface Force (CSF) model for the surface tension force at the gas-liquid interface. A Low-Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model combined with a near-wall grid adaptation technique is applied to both liquid and gas phases. The simulation results are verified with theoretical and experimental data from literature and also with in-house experimental data. Furthermore, the numerical simulations are performed by applying an artificial disturbance boundary condition at the inlet. The effect of gas and <b>liquid</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> on the hydrodynamics and heat transfer in a channel is investigated. Results of the simulation indicate that the inlet flow parameters such as gas and <b>liquid</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> on have a significant influence on heat transfer. Parametric analysis is employed to interpret the mechanism of wave dynamics under the influence of gas Reynolds number. The main parameters considered in this research are <b>liquid</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> (300 ≤ReL≤ 650), gas Reynolds numbers (10000 ≤ReG≤ 70000), and wall heat flux at 20 W/cm^ 2. The flow characteristics and film thickness in two-phase flow are significantly affected by increasing gas velocity. The heat transfer rate is enhanced due to influence of wavy flow with increasing gas and <b>liquid</b> Reynolds <b>numbers.</b> Ultimately, this numerical study helps to explain unsteady two-phase flow behavior under heat load...|$|R
