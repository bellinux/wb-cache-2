5|$|In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff {{including}} more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. There are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances. These fees and allowances were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about £30,000 per annum.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} accounted for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns because {{the federal government}} continues operations even during recessions.

50|$|The SCA {{held that}} the general rule was that a {{principal}} was not liable for the wrongs committed by an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> or its employees. The courts have, however, been extending the principal's liability for the acts of independent contractors: a tendency which, if unchecked, {{would result in the}} creation of vicarious responsibility for every act of negligence performed by an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> in the course of doing the work, thus effacing the distinction between principal and <b>independent</b> <b>contractor.</b>|$|R
5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> under certain circumstances.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies a firm's {{choice between}} {{employing}} a worker and using an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> {{to carry out}} a task. If the firm hires a worker, all residual rights reside with the firm. In contrast, when the firm deals with an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> it cannot interfere with the way the task is undertaken. The firm's future actions may impose non-pecuniary costs to the worker, and as a result the worker requires an ex-ante compensation. The firm can economize on the up-front cost by hiring an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor.</b> <b>Independent</b> contracting is a commitment device which ensures that the principal will not intervene in the future. However, when the firm has superior private information that is relevant to the execution of the task, the firm faces a trade-off between paying lower costs by hiring an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> and keeping the option of value-enhancing intervention in employment relationship. ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{statutory}} {{employee is}} an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> under IRS common law that {{is treated as}} an employee, by statute, for tax withholdings. For a standard <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> an employer cannot withhold taxes, as this would change the <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> relationship into an employer-employee relationship. Statutory employees are also permitted to deduct work-related expenses on Schedule C instead of Schedule A in the United States tax system. As a result, they are allowed a greater tax deduction for business expenses than standard employees, as Schedule C expenses {{are not subject to}} the 2% adjusted gross income threshold as seen with Schedule A.|$|R

Under the peculiar risk doctrine, a person who hires an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> to perform work that is inherently dangerous can be held liable for tort damages when the contractor’s negligent performance of the work causes injuries to others” (see Andreini case).

25|$|Brothel prostitutes, {{also known}} as Courtesans, work as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> and thus do not receive any unemployment, {{retirement}} or health benefits from the house they work for. They are responsible for paying Federal income tax and their earnings are reported to the IRS via form 1099-MISC. Nevada {{does not have a}} state income tax. The women typically work for a period of several weeks, during which time they live in the brothel and hardly ever leave it. They then take some time off.|$|E
25|$|But {{advocates of}} the guild model argue that the union is {{laying the groundwork for}} {{long-term}} growth. The union is not only gaining members which enable it to advocate for changes in federal labor law to permit the unionization of <b>independent</b> <b>contractors.</b> The union is also setting the stage for the affiliation of potentially hundreds of thousands of these workers. In the meantime, supporters say, OPEIU gains some additional dues income and is able to enhance its bargaining status with insurers and other vendors by pointing to a larger membership base.|$|E

500|$|Section 2(4)(b) {{establishes}} that [...] "where {{damage is}} caused to a visitor by a danger {{due to the}} faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repair by an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> employed by the occupier, the occupier {{is not to be}} treated without more as answerable for the danger if in all the circumstances he had acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor</b> and had taken such steps (if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properly done". This accords with the previous general rule that an occupier cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligence of an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor.</b> When a visitor does suffer harm from the work of an <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> the question is instead whether the occupier has taken reasonable steps to establish if the contractor is competent, and, if the job permits, whether the occupier has checked that the work has been properly done.|$|R

25|$|Prostitution {{is legal}} {{in parts of}} Nevada in {{licensed}} brothels, but only counties with populations under 400,000 {{have the option to}} legalize it. Although prostitution is not {{a major part of the}} Nevada economy, employing roughly 300 women as <b>independent</b> <b>contractors,</b> it is a very visible endeavor. Of the 14 counties permitted to legalize prostitution under state law, 8 have chosen to legalize brothels. State law prohibits prostitution in Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), and Washoe County (which contains Reno). However, prostitution is legal in Storey County, which is part of the Reno–Sparks metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, {{the union}} adopted its current name.

A similar organizing drive at Allstate ended after the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the 10,000 workers were <b>independent</b> <b>contractors.</b> OPEIU also began organizing {{in the health care}} industry, organizing office workers at a number of health insurers. But it also began organizing registered nurses and other health care workers in limited numbers around the United States. In 1998, the much-raided collective bargaining arm of the Pennsylvania Nurses Association affiliated with OPEIU, adding 2,500 nurses to the union's rolls. By 2005, OPEIU represented about 5,000 RNs, making it the sixth largest nurses' union in the AFL-CIO.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{facilities}} and services provided on the ride are contributed by around 400 volunteers each year. Volunteers include those {{with family and friends}} doing the ride but who do not want to ride themselves, former riders no longer able to participate, and many who simply enjoy the atmosphere of the ride. Some of the volunteers also participate in the ride itself. Volunteer positions include catering services, medical services, luggage handlers, route marshals, information and media services, sign production, sag wagon, Warby team, cleaning services, tent set-up, and campsite services. A total of thirty-five different volunteer teams operate on the ride. Often volunteers will be under the guidance of paid employees, or assisting paid <b>independent</b> <b>contractors</b> in providing a service. Without the level of support provided by volunteer labour the cost of ride would become prohibitively expensive for many riders.|$|E

The <b>independent</b> <b>contractor,</b> on the other hand, could be directed only as to what work must be done, not how it was to be done.|$|R
