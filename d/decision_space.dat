40|$|In {{order to}} explore a unified theory of {{three-way}} decisions proposed by Yao, Hu introduced three-way <b>decision</b> <b>spaces</b> through an axiomatic method, established the corresponding three-way decisions, and proposed two open problems on the changes of decision parameters in definition of three-way decisions. For answering these two questions, this paper firstly discusses the parameter changes in the assumptions from 0 <= beta < alpha <= 1 to 0 <= beta <= alpha <= 1 and inequality E(A) (x) <= beta in the rejection region is replaced by E(A) (x) < beta. Under the circumstance, this paper introduces new type of three-way decisions in three-way <b>decision</b> <b>spaces</b> and discusses properties of the three-way decisions, lower and upper approximations induced by three-way decisions, aggregation three-way decisions over multiple three-way <b>decision</b> <b>spaces</b> and dynamic three-way decisions on three-way <b>decision</b> <b>spaces.</b> Then this paper discusses another question on refusal decision region when the uncertain region is defined by using inequality beta < E(A) (x) < alpha and gives one example to illustrate the similarity and difference among these three-way decisions based on three-way <b>decision</b> <b>spaces.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Background The {{concept of}} <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> holds appeal as an {{approach}} to disaggregating the elements that may influence decision-making in decentralized systems. This narrative review aims to explore the functioning of <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> and {{the factors that influence}} <b>decision</b> <b>space.</b> Methods A narrative review of the literature was conducted with searches of online databases and academic journals including PubMed Central, Emerald, Wiley, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Sage. The articles were included in the review based on the criteria that they provided insight into the functioning of <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> either through the explicit application of or reference to <b>decision</b> <b>space,</b> or implicitly through discussion of decision-making related to organizational capacity or accountability mechanisms. Results The articles included in the review encompass literature related to decentralisation, management and <b>decision</b> <b>space.</b> The majority of the studies utilise qualitative methodologies to assess accountability mechanisms, organisational capacities such as finance, human resources and management, and the extent of <b>decision</b> <b>space.</b> Of the 138 articles retrieved, 76 articles were included in the final review. Conclusion The literature supports Bossert’s conceptualization of <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> as being related to organizational capacities and accountability mechanisms. These functions influence the <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> available within decentralized systems. The exact relationship between <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> and financial and human resource capacities needs to be explored in greater detail to determine the potential influence on system functioning...|$|E

40|$|Background Decentralisation aims {{to bring}} {{services}} {{closer to the}} community and has been advocated in the health sector to improve quality, access and equity, and to empower local agencies, increase innovation and efficiency and bring healthcare and decision-making {{as close as possible to}} where people live and work. Fiji has attempted two approaches to decentralisation. The current approach reflects a model of deconcentration of outpatient services from the tertiary level hospital to the peripheral health centres in the Suva subdivision. Methods Using a modified <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> approach developed by Bossert, this study measures <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> created in five broad categories (finance, service organisation, human resources, access rules, and governance rules) within the decentralised services. Results Fiji’s centrally managed historical-based allocation of financial resources and management of human resources resulted in no <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> for decentralised agents. Narrow <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> was created in the service organisation category where, with limited <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> created over access rules, Fiji has seen greater usage of its decentralised health centres. There remains limited <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> in governance. Conclusion The current wave of decentralisation reveals that, whilst the workload has shifted from the tertiary hospital to the peripheral health centres, it has been accompanied by limited transfer of administrative authority, suggesting that Fiji’s deconcentration reflects the transfer of workload only with decision-making in the five functional areas remaining largely centralised. As such, the benefits of decentralisation for users and providers are likely to be limited...|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in the previous subsection, the target of multi-objective optimization is to obtain a set of candidate solutions as trade-offs between the different objectives. Hence, an algorithm should maintain a good balance between the convergence and diversity of the population, such that, ideally, the candidate solutions can be uniformly distributed on the true PF. Despite that the target is to approximate the PF (in the objective space), most MEDAs still build models in the <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> and sample candidate solutions. However, as illustrated in Fig.  2, a uniformly distributed solution set in the <b>decision</b> <b>space</b> may {{not necessarily mean that}} their image set is also uniformly distributed on the PF.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} region-based {{representations of}} image and video that {{are useful for}} multimedia services such as those supported by the MPEG- 4 and MPEG- 7 standards. Classical tools related to the generation of the region-based representations are discussed.

Mainly tools useful in the context of the MPEG- 4 and MPEG- 7 standards are discussed. The review is structured around the strategies used by the algorithms (transition based or homogeneity based) and the <b>decision</b> <b>spaces</b> (spatial, spatio-temporal, and temporal). The second part of this paper proposes a partition tree representation of images and introduces a processing strategy that involves a similarity estimation step followed by a partition creation step. This strategy tries to find a compromise between what can be done in a systematic and universal way and what has to be application dependent. It is shown in particular how a single partition tree created with an extremely simple similarity feature can support a large number of segmentation applications: spatial segmentation, motion estimation, region-based coding, semantic object extraction, and region-based retrieval.
