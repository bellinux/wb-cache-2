As a corollary, the standard approach treats exchanges of services as a subspecies of exchanges of goods. We raise two objections against this standard approach. First, it is incomplete, as it fails to take into account, among other things, the offers and acceptances that lie {{at the core of}} even the simplest cases of exchanges. Second, it ultimately fails to generalize to exchanges of services, in which neither <b>inverse</b> <b>preferences</b> nor mutual transfers hold true. We propose an alternative definition of exchanges, which treats exchanges of goods as a special case of exchanges of services and which builds in offers and acceptances. According to this theory: (i) The valuations motivating exchanges are propositional and convergent rather than objectual and inverse; (ii) All exchanges of goods involve exchanges of services/actions, but not the reverse; (iii) Offers and acceptances, together with the contractual obligations and claims they bring about, {{lie at the heart of}} all cases of exchange...|$|E
40|$|We present {{here the}} {{complete}} 2. 4 -Mb genome of the cellulolytic actinobacterial thermophile Acidothermus cellulolyticus 11 B. New secreted glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases {{were identified in}} the genome, revealing a diverse biomass-degrading enzyme repertoire far greater than previously characterized and elevating the industrial value of this organism. A sizable fraction of these hydrolytic enzymes break down plant cell walls, and the remaining either degrade components in fungal cell walls or metabolize storage carbohydrates such as glycogen and trehalose, implicating {{the relative importance of}} these different carbon sources. Several of the A. cellulolyticus secreted cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes are fused to multiple tandemly arranged carbohydrate binding modules (CBM), from families 2 and 3. For the most part, thermophilic patterns in the genome and proteome of A. cellulolyticus were weak, which may be reflective of the recent evolutionary history of A. cellulolyticus since its divergence from its closest phylogenetic neighbor Frankia, a mesophilic plant endosymbiont and soil dweller. However, ribosomal proteins and noncoding RNAs (rRNA and tRNAs) in A. cellulolyticus showed thermophilic traits suggesting the importance of adaptation of cellular translational machinery to environmental temperature. Elevated occurrence of IVYWREL amino acids in A. cellulolyticus orthologs compared to mesophiles and <b>inverse</b> <b>preferences</b> for G and A at the first and third codon positions also point to its ongoing thermoadaptation. Additional interesting features in the genome of this cellulolytic, hot-springs-dwelling prokaryote include a low occurrence of pseudogenes or mobile genetic elements, an unexpected complement of flagellar genes, and the presence of three laterally acquired genomic islands of likely ecophysiological value...|$|E
40|$|Speakers {{sometimes}} repeat syntactic structures across sentences, {{a phenomenon}} called syntactic priming. We investigated {{the influence of}} verb-bound syntactic preferences on syntactic priming effects in response choices and response latencies for German ditransitive sentences. In the response choices we found <b>inverse</b> <b>preference</b> effects: There were stronger syntactic priming effects for primes in the less preferred structure, given the syntactic preference of the prime verb. In the response latencies we found positive preference effects: There were stronger syntactic priming effects for primes in the more preferred structure, given the syntactic preference of the prime verb. These findings provide further support for the idea that syntactic processing is lexically guided...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether structural priming {{of production}} latencies {{is sensitive to}} the same factors known to influence persistence of structural choices: structure preference, cumulativity and verb repetition. In two experiments, we found structural persistence only for passives (<b>inverse</b> <b>preference</b> effect) while priming effects on latencies were stronger for the actives (positive preference effect). We found structural persistence for passives {{to be influenced by}} immediate primes and long lasting cumulativity (all preceding primes) (Experiment 1), and to be boosted by verb repetition (Experiment 2). In latencies we found effects for actives were sensitive to long lasting cumulativity (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, in latencies we found priming for actives overall, while for passives the priming effects emerged as the cumulative exposure increased but only when also aided by verb repetition. These findings are consistent with the Two-stage Competition model, an integrated model of structural priming effects for sentence choice and latenc...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that genetic polymorphisms in female mating preferences may cause disruptive selection on male traits, facilitating phenotypic differentiation despite gene flow, as in reinforcement or other models of speciation with gene flow. Very little experimental data {{have been published}} to test the assumptions regarding the genetics of mate choice that such theory relies on. We generated a population segregating for female mating preferences and male colour dissociated from other species differences by breeding hybrids between species of the cichlid fish genus Pundamilia. We measured male mating success {{as a function of}} male colour. First, we demonstrate that non-hybrid females of both species use male nuptial coloration for choosing mates, but with <b>inversed</b> <b>preferences.</b> Second, we show that variation in female mating preferences in an F 2 hybrid population generates a quadratic fitness function for male coloration suggestive of disruptive selection: intermediate males obtained fewer matings than males at either extreme of the colour range. If the genetics of female mate choice in Pundamilia are representative for those in other species of Lake Victoria cichlid fish, it may help explain the origin and maintenance of phenotypic diversity despite some gene flow...|$|R
40|$|In {{document}} retrieval, {{besides the}} suitability of query with search results, {{there is also a}} subjective user assessment that {{is expected to be a}} deciding factor in document ranking. This preference aspect is referred at the fiqh document searching. People tend to prefer on certain fiqh methodology without rejecting other fiqh methodologies. It is necessary to investigate preference factor in addition to the relevance factor in the document ranking. Therefore, this research proposed a method of term weighting based on preference to rank documents according to user preference. The proposed method is also combined with term weighting based on documents index and books index so it sees relevance and preference aspect. The proposed method is <b>Inverse</b> <b>Preference</b> Frequency with Î± value (IPFÎ±). In this method, we calculate preference value by IPF term weighting. Then, the preference values of terms that is equal with the query are multiplied by Î±. IPFÎ± combined with the existing weighting methods become TF. IDF. IBF. IPFÎ±. Experiment of the proposed method uses dataset of several Arabic fiqh documents. Evaluation uses recall, precision, and f-measure calculations. Proposed term weighting method is obtained to rank the document in the right order according to user preference. It is shown from the result with recall value reach 75 %, precision 100 %, and f-measure 85. 7 % respectively...|$|R
40|$|The current {{endeavour}} {{focuses on}} the notion of positive versus negative polarity preference of verbs for their direct objects. This preference has to be distinguished from a verb's own prior polarity - for the same verb, these two properties might even be <b>inverse.</b> Polarity <b>preferences</b> of verbs are extracted {{on the basis of a}} large and dependency- parsed corpus by means of statistical measures. We observed verbs with a relatively clear positive or negative polarity preference, as well as cases of verbs where positive and negative polarity preference is balanced (we call these bipolar-preference verbs). Given clear-cut polarity preferences of a verb, nouns, whose polarity is yet unknown, can now be classified. We reached a lower bound of 81...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} results of a three-phase study on the learning of algebra. The first phase involved interviews with ten seventh graders (12 and 13 years of age) to uncover some of their pre-algebraic notions on equations and equation solving. Six of these novice subjects were kept on for the second phase: a two-month teaching experiment on equation solving which emphasized the symmetric procedure of performing the same operation on both sides. The pretest and two posttest interviews of the second phase included both equation-solving and equivalent-equations tasks. The third phase involved interviews with nine more-experienced algebra students from grades eight to eleven, to investigate their equation-solving procedures, errors, and methods of determining the equivalence of equation-pairs. Their approaches were compared with those of the novices on the same tasks. The study uncovered two distinct paths followed in the learning of equation solving: one by those already predisposed toward inversing; the other by those with a predisposition toward using surface operations. The latter group was more receptive to the procedure taught during the teaching experiment. A relationship was found to exist between subjects' view of the literal term in equations and their preferred equation-solving method. Novices with an <b>inversing</b> <b>preference</b> applied learned principles to equivalence tasks, but not to equation solving. More-expert subjects relied on inversing for both. Theoretical implications of these findings concern: the processes used {{in the early stages of}} learning a new domain, the modeling of the procedures used to determine equivalence, the relationship between errors and structural knowledge, and the representation of word problems by equations. Finally, the characterization of an arithmetic approach and an algebraic approach to the learning of equation solving is used to suggest a basis for a theory of algebra learning...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} vector space–based model for selectional {{preferences}} that predicts plausibility scores for argument headwords. It {{does not require}} any lexical resources (such as WordNet). It can be trained either on one corpus with syntactic annotation, or {{on a combination of}} a small semantically annotated primary corpus and a large, syntactically analyzed generalization corpus. Our model is able to predict <b>inverse</b> selectional <b>preferences,</b> that is, plausibility scores for predicates given argument heads. We evaluate our model on one NLP task (pseudo-disambiguation) and one cognitive task (prediction of human plausibility judgments), gauging the influence of different parameters and comparing our model against other model classes. We obtain consistent benefits from using the disambiguation and semantic role information provided by a semantically tagged primary corpus. As for parameters, we identify settings that yield good performance across a range of experimental conditions. However, frequency remains a major influence of prediction quality, and we also identify more robust parameter settings suitable for applications with many infrequent items...|$|R
40|$|A {{flexible}} methodology {{is developed}} to specify how a desired outcome {{can be reached}} in a given conflict by determining the preference structures required for the decision makers to find it stable. The objective of this methodology is to provide informed collective negotiation support. This new methodology is generated by reverse engineering some Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) procedures and is therefore called "Inverse GMCR". The essence of Inverse GMCR is to determine whether and how a strategic conflict can be ideally resolved, which may inform the mediators of strategies to achieve this resolution. Formal definitions and mathematical representations for the new Inverse GMCR methodology are formulated in this thesis. The four basic graph model stability definitions, Nash stability (R), general metarationality (GMR), symmetric metarationality (SMR), and sequential stability (SEQ) are redefined for Inverse GMCR as Nash IPS, GMR IPS, SMR IPS, and SEQ IPS, respectively where IPS stands for <b>Inverse</b> <b>Preference</b> Structure. Pattern recognition and inverse calculations are used to generate strategies that permit mediators to negotiate a desired resolution. Mediation, or third party intervention, is strengthened by utilizing the insightful {{information provided by the}} Inverse GMCR methodology and the negotiation support system. An in-depth strategic investigation and analysis of a complex water conflict in the Middle East is carried out to test and refine the algorithms developed here. This conflict occurred along the Euphrates River and had three key time points when the conflict escalated to the brink of a full scale war, in 1975, 1990, and 1998. A comprehensive analysis of the conflict is undertaken, including bilateral and trilateral negotiations both before and after mediation. Based on the new Inverse GMCR and existing algorithms, an advanced decision support system (DSS) is designed, built, and illustrated using real world conflicts. The new DSS, called GMCR+, is capable of handling a wide variety of decision problems involving two or more decision makers (DMs). Given the DMs, the options or courses of action available to each of them, and each DM's relative preferences over the scenarios or states that could occur, GMCR+ can calculate stability and equilibrium results according to a range of solution concepts that explain human behavior under conflict. Then the inverse component of the DSS, GMCR+, can determine the preference rankings of DMs that produce stable states and equilibria as specified by the user. Other features incorporated into GMCR+ include coalition analysis, graph and tree diagram visualization, narrative reporting of results, and a tracing feature that shows how the conflict could evolve from a status quo state to a desirable equilibrium or other specified outcome. The system GMCR+ has a modular design in order to facilitate the addition of further advances. The overarching purpose of this research is to provide a simple and intuitive methodology to better understand and resolve actual conflicts. The GMCR+ DSS was developed in order to implement the Inverse GMCR methodology {{in the context of the}} standard graph model functions and in a practical way. Analysis and investigation of real world examples demonstrate the applicability of the methodology in various domains...|$|R
40|$|Formalist {{positions}} towards {{money are}} considered from a perspective of formal methods in computing. The Formaleuro (FEUR) as a dimension for monetary quantities is proposed {{as well as}} the Formalbitcoin (FBTC) which represents an item ready for circulation in a model of informational money. An attempt is made to understand the concept of money from scratch. In order to provide a definition of money the need is felt to make use of a tailored theory of definition. To that end a theory of imaginative definitions is presented and its implications for definitions of money are sketched. It is argued that a theory of money may be dependent on the role of its holder. A survey of some roles is given, with the so-called subordinate administrative role (SAR) in a central position. The concepts of virtual memory and virtual machine are taken as the point of departure for a definition of the notion of virtual money. It is argued that {{from the perspective of a}} component (division) of a large organization (ORG) its local financial system (LFS) provides a virtual money vm(LFS, ORG) which may well fail to meet the most common general and acknowledged moneyness criteria. <b>Inverse</b> moneyness <b>preference</b> is coined as phrase to assert the tendency of top-management of ORG to make its virtual money deviate from these criteria.

40|$|This thesis work {{conducts a}} study on {{modelling}} car drivers’ start of brake when forward vehicle is stationary or when it is moving with constant velocity. The euroFOT data collected by Volvo Car Corporation in the Gothenburg area of Sweden has been the main data source for modelling purposes. The data segments used consist of braking events where the host vehicle is approaching the forward vehicle. The selection of data segments was further limited by addition of the constraint the forward vehicle has constant velocity or is stationary. A thorough literature investigation recommended several approaches to predict driver’s brake initiation in terms of distance {{as well as other}} perceptual or physical factors that are decisive on driver’s braking behaviour. With the help of previous knowhow, distance to target vehicle at drivers’ brake initiation and inverse time to collision (TTC) approaches have been selected for modelling. Vehicle dynamics related factors such as velocity, acceleration, yaw rate etc. and other factors presented in literature such as reaction time, visual angle, TTC, preferred time headway, preferred distance to vehicle ahead have been subjected to a correlation analysis to identify the significant parameters related to drivers’ braking distance and <b>inverse</b> TTC <b>preference.</b> Single and multiple linear regression analysis have been applied to the combination of selected parameters to establish an equation, which gives the minimum prediction error. Both normal and lognormal values of measured braking distance were used in regression analysis. The results suggested that, for brake events where target vehicle is stationary, the braking distance is best predicted with normal braking distance based modelling. On the contrary, modelling based on lognormal braking distance offered better estimation results for constant target vehicle velocity events. The best population fit and smallest prediction error is resulted with lognormal braking distance based modelling for constant target vehicle velocity condition. Interestingly, the inverse TTC approach provided promising results for the constant target vehicle velocity condition whereas the case for stationary target vehicle, inverse TTC did not lead to strong results. Finally, the study is concluded with various recommendations for possible future investigations...|$|R
