40|$|International audienceAIMS: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine trajectories of {{headache}} in relation to retirement and to clarify the role of work stress and stress-prone personality. METHODS: Headache prevalence during the 7 years before and after retirement was measured by annual questionnaires from GAZEL cohort comprising French national gas and <b>electricity</b> company <b>employees</b> (n[*]=[*] 12, 913). Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for headache during pre- peri- and post-retirement were calculated. The role of effect modifiers (work stress, type A or hostile personality) was tested by multiplicative interactions and synergy indices. RESULTS: An 11 - 13 % reduction in headache prevalence was found during pre- and post-retirement, whereas decline was much steeper (46 %) during the retirement transition. In absolute terms, the decline was greater among persons with high work stress or stress-prone personality than among other participants. CONCLUSIONS: Retirement is associated with a decrease in headache prevalence, particularly among persons with a high amount of work stress or proneness to over-react to stress...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} two techniques, for {{modeling}} electricity {{consumption of the}} Jordanian industrial sector, are presented: (i) multivariate linear regression and (ii) neuro-fuzzy models. Electricity consumption is modeled as function of different variables such as number of establishments, number of <b>employees,</b> <b>electricity</b> tariff, prevailing fuel prices, production outputs, capacity utilizations, and structural effects. It was found that industrial production and capacity utilization {{are the most important}} variables that have significant effect on electrical power demand. The results showed that both the multivariate linear regression and neuro-fuzzy models are generally comparable and can be used adequately to simulate industrial electricity consumption. However, comparison that is based on the square root average squared error of data suggests that the neuro-fuzzy model performs slightly better for prediction of electricity consumption than the multivariate linear regression model...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{multinational}} corporations (MNCs) {{have accounted for}} important shares of employment and production in Indonesian manufacturing since 1975, and these shares increased especially rapidly {{in the early to}} mid- 1990 s. These increases were concentrated in the machinery industries and in MNCs with large foreign ownership shares, and continued through the crisis of 1997 - 98 and beyond, despite apparently large withdrawals of inward foreign direct investment in 1998 and subsequent years. MNCs generally had much higher average labour productivity than local plants and, after controlling for plant-level variation in <b>electricity</b> consumption per <b>employee,</b> size and vintage, we found that these differentials persisted in about three-quarters of the cases examined. However, there was also large variation in MNC presence and in MNC-local productivity differentials across industries and time, with statistically insignificant differentials most common in apparel and footwear, as well as in MNCs with small foreign-ownership shares. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChronic {{occupational}} solvent {{exposure is}} associated with long-term cognitive deficits. Cognitive reserve may protect solvent-exposed workers from cognitive impairment. We tested whether the association between chronic solvent exposure and cognition varied by educational attainment, a proxy for cognitive reserve. Data were drawn from a prospective cohort of French national gas and <b>electricity</b> (GAZEL) <b>employees</b> (n = 4, 134). Lifetime exposure to 4 solvent types (chlorinated solvents, petroleum solvents, benzene, and nonbenzene aromatic solvents) was assessed using a validated job-exposure matrix. Education was dichotomized at less than secondary school or below. Cognitive impairment was defined as scoring below the 25 th percentile on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test at mean age 59 (SD 2. 8; 88 % of participants were retired at testing). Log-binomial regression was used to model risk ratios (RRs) for poor cognition as predicted by solvent exposure, stratified by education and adjusted for sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Solvent exposure rates were higher among less-educated patients. Within this group, there was a dose-response relationship between lifetime exposure to each solvent type and RR for poor cognition (e. g., for high exposure to benzene, RR = 1. 24, 95 % confidence interval 1. 09 - 1. 41), with significant linear trends (p < 0. 05) in 3 out of 4 solvent types. Recency of solvent exposure also predicted worse cognition among less-educated patients. Among those with secondary education or higher, {{there was no significant}} or near-significant relationship between any quantification of solvent exposure and cognition. Solvent exposure {{is associated with}} poor cognition only among less-educated individuals. Higher cognitive reserve in the more-educated group may explain this finding...|$|R

On 14 & 15 September, nearly 450 movie Theaters in Telangana were closed at the call given by Telangana film chamber. Starting 16 September, government teachers joined the strike. Private school managements declared one day holiday {{in support of the}} strike. On 19 September, state road transport corporation <b>employees</b> and state <b>electricity</b> board <b>employees</b> in Telangana joined the indefinite strike.On a call given by JAC, road blockades on national highways throughout Telangana, rail blockade and the strike of auto rikshaw union were organised on 24 and 25 September causing disruption in transport services.

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} case study, {{conducted in the}} Jordanian electricity sector, aimed at exploring the concept, philosophy and practice of training and development (T&D), by investigating and comparing T&D conceptualization and practice between the public, private and privatized electricity companies. To meet the objectives of this research, an exploratory research approach was employed. Data was gathered through 29 in-depth interviews, 34 days of observation and the analysis of companies' T&D documents. The research findings showed similarities {{in the way in}} which participants perceived T&D and the way they conceptualized the term among companies with different ownership styles. T&D was interpreted in terms of learning, being development focused and emphasizing a utilitarian outlook. Regarding T&D role, participants emphasized the 'instrumental' role of T&D, showing an inclination toward the Functionalist philosophical perspective of T&D. Concerning actual practice, it was found that T&D activities had a reactive role, designed specifically to meet particular or short term needs of the companies. The study findings support the general argument proposed in HRD literature regarding the role of T&D philosophy in guiding the related actions, but also indicate that the way of thinking about T&D is shaped through the prism of the 'situation needs' and T&D 'utility'. Furthermore, this study argues that the perceptions, understanding and application of T&D are influenced by a number of interrelated factors, most importantly, industry and organizational internal specification and needs. The findings of this research make a number of theoretical and managerial contributions. From a theoretical perspective, this study provides a step toward understanding how T&D is conceptualized and interpreted by <b>electricity</b> sector <b>employees.</b> Further, it provides explanation of how the situation is constructed, which in turn helps in filling the gap in Arab literature in this area. Finally, for the managerial contribution, this study proposed a model for T&D management that could be consistent with participants’ perceptions and within the acceptable philosophical perspective. Furthermore, the model takes account of the explored T&D problems and obstacles...|$|R
