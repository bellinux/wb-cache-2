On 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip.

Hutton then edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, England collapsed.

40|$|Parergon 2 is part {{a series}} of works researching the {{recurring}} relevance of illusion and materiality in painting practice {{as part of a}} touring exhibition project entitled ‘A Sort of Night to the Mind, a Kind of Night for our Thoughts; Illusion and Materiality in Contemporary Painting’. This research utilises a specifically developed method of applying graphite powder to produce illusive images with a very particular reflective quality; a changeable surface responsive to the viewer’s position. The paintings draw upon parallel research into modes of address in pictorial works, which produce a reflexive experience of viewing, i. e. positioning <b>the</b> viewer <b>in</b> an ambiguous way, rendering the act of viewing the work as a self-conscious one (with reference to theoretical studies of artists such as Manet). This work presents a complex frame of images with an empty centre (parergon meaning the aside, the incidental as opposed to the 'ergon' or main event. Ref: Derrida’s ‘The Truth <b>in</b> Painting’). <b>The</b> images are drawn from a variety of sources, appropriating from film, painting and the everyday to evoke different experiences of time. The use of black ground and graphite suspended in an oil medium, was developed in part <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> original reference point for the exhibition, whose title is based on two alternative translations of Honore de Balzac's description of illusion from the 1832 short story 'The Purse'. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> story, the paintings described reveal their materiality and illusion in a particular way <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light</b> and shifting perspective of the viewer. <br/...|$|R
25|$|During the crisis, {{the men in}} La Carrera's {{and part}} of Belveder's {{divisions}} were able to form into brigade squares. Kellermann organized a second attack against the unbroken squares but the Spanish soldiers held steady and repelled the French cavalry. Since his infantry were still far in the rear, Kellermann tried to fix the enemy squares in place by launching partial charges. For {{two and a half}} hours, this tactic succeeded in pinning down the Spanish soldiers on the west bank. Marchand's infantry and artillery finally appeared on the horizon. Realizing that his men would be annihilated by a combined arms attack, La Carrera ordered an immediate retreat. The French cavalry rushed forward and inflicted further losses, but most of the Spanish troops got away over the bridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light.</b> Marchand's leading brigade cleared some of Losada's rallied men out of the town of Alba and captured two more artillery pieces.|$|E

500|$|Early on {{the third}} day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England’s score at 64, before Compton and Hutton {{consolidated}} the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard cut shot that flew into Lindwall's left hand at second slip for a [...] "freak slip catch" [...] from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125. Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light,</b> and the umpires called off play due to poor visibility after an appeal by Yardley. The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match.

On the morning of 27 March, major elements of the Italian Fleet were spotted {{en route to the}} sea lanes between Egypt and Greece, and the carrier sailed later that afternoon to intercept them. Reinforced by three Fulmars from 806 Squadron, her air group only numbered 13 Fulmars, 10 Albacores and 4 Swordfish.

The attack was unsuccessful, and another strike force of three Albacores and two Swordfish was prepared. Shortly after launching them at 12:22, Formidable was unsuccessfully attacked by a pair of torpedo-carrying Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers. Around 14:50, one Albacore succeeded in torpedoing the Italian battleship, although the other aircraft missed. The hit briefly knocked out her engines and caused heavy flooding. Another air strike of six Albacores and two Swordfish was launched at 17:30 to finish off the crippled battleship, but they mistook the [...] for the battleship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fading</b> <b>light.</b> The cruiser was struck by a single torpedo from one of the aircraft, possibly from one of two Swordfish from 815 Squadron from Maleme, Crete, that linked up with Formidables aircraft before the attack.
