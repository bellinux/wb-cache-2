40|$|DE 2855676 A UPAB: 19930902 The time {{multiplex}} {{transmission system}} has a circuit for the continuous derivation and {{monitoring of the}} synchronisation criteria. It is obtd. from the bit current. The synchronisation criteria reoccur periodically and synchronisation is est. as quickly as poss. so as to eliminate the recurring interference. The bit patterns formed from the received data are compared with the specific bit pattern of the frame synchronisation symbol. A signal is prod. {{in the event of}} concurrence. This signal is used to trigger a <b>flywheel</b> <b>circuit</b> with the periodicity of the time frame when the signal appears within the given time interval. The instant of opening and closing the time window will be determined by considering at least two characteristic results with regard to stability...|$|E
50|$|The use of AM (rather than FM) {{for sound}} {{and the use of}} {{positive}} (rather than negative) video modulation made 405-line signals very prone to visible impulse interference, such as that generated by the ignition systems of vehicles. Such interference manifested itself as a loud popping on sound and large bright spots on the picture, which viewers found much more noticeable than the dark spots encountered when such interference is encountered on a signal using negative video modulation. With positive modulation, interference could easily be of similar amplitude to the sync pulses (which were represented by 0-30% of the transmitter output). The early time-base circuits were less able to discriminate between the signals and the picture would break up. By contrast, in negative modulation sync, pulses represent peak transmitter output (70-100% output). As a result, impulse interference would cause visual dark spots before it was large enough to affect the synchronisation of the picture. If the interference was large enough, the picture was probably unwatchable anyway. The later introduction of <b>flywheel</b> sync <b>circuits</b> rendered the picture much more stable, but these could have alleviated some of the problems with positive modulation. Almost all television systems that succeeded the 405-line system adopted negative modulation for this reason alone.|$|R
