Increasing {{demand of}} urban areas in Spain {{during the last}} decade has caused a series of {{environmental}} problems that are reflected in the quality of riverine waters. Many rivers in the Iberian Peninsula, that formerly received runoffs from agricultural areas, are at present taking rising inputs of urban effluents, frequently not subjected to previous wastewater treatment. These waters often transport anthropogenic molecules, which in several cases can be successfully distinguished from products derived from natural sources, such as fluvial organisms, in this case mainly benthonic. In this study series of organic compounds in waters from 16 summer sampling stations along the low basin of Guadarrama river (Madrid) are identified using gas chromatography in order to discriminate between natural or anthropogenic origins. This river basin, subjected to predominantly agricultural management until the 80 s, is presently occupied by ca. 1 million inhabitants. The organic fraction was extracted with methylene chloride, methylated with trimethylsilyldiazomethane and analysed in a Varian Saturn 2 gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric system equipped with a 10 m x 0. 22 mm i. d., cross-linked OV- 101 column; these chromatographic conditions being specifically fitted for a detailed identification of high-molecular weight signature compounds in water. The chromatographic analysis (Fig. 1) showed a complex composition made up mainly of C 15 - C 33 (mostly C 17 —C 29) n-alkenes with odd-C number preference, suggesting their origin in epicuticular waxes from vascular plants. Fatty acids (mainly C 14 —C 34) were in very low amounts, with a bimodal distribution and major peaks for palmitic and stearic acids; the odd-C numbered fatty acids typical in terrestrial plants were practically lacking. In addition, all samples showed a conspicuous series of wax esters composed almost exclusively of C 74 —C 32 palmitates, the triacontyl hexadecanoates dominating in most samples. In conclusion, the overall <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chromatogram</b> suggests that the information on the balance between inputs from terrestrial and aquatic organisms is displayed mainly by indices such as the relative amount of waxes and the chain length and carbon preference index of the alkyl series, mainly fatty acids. On the other hand, few possibilities to monitor the origin of the organic matter from different samples {{on the basis of the}} occurrence of diagnostic biomarker compounds derived from the autochthonous trophic system.

40|$|Fenoxycarb is an {{insecticide}} {{that can}} be used at very low concentrations in wood preservatives because of its hormon-like activity. As a consequence relatively low concentrations of fenoxycarb have to be determined in extracts of treated timber containing a background of wood extractives. It was demonstrated in parallel analyses in different laboratories that fenoxycarb can efficiently be extracted from treated wood by methanol and can be determined in the extracts by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detection. However, fenoxycarb concentrations at <b>the</b> lower level <b>of</b> required retentions can only be determined according to the tested procedure with further sample preparation. <b>The</b> deviation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results between the laboratories is relatively large caused by difficulties in <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chromatograms...</b>|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{requirements for}} <b>the</b> award <b>of</b> Doctor of Philosophy <b>of</b> Loughborough University. <b>The</b> thesis describes <b>the</b> characterisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymeric components <b>of</b> crosslinkedunsaturated polyesters; {{that is the}} saturated prepolymer synthesised from terephthalic acid and excess propylene glycol, the alkyd resulting from <b>the</b> condensation <b>of</b> this prepolymer with maleic anhydride and finally the styrene cured product. The poly (propylene terephthalate) prepolymer has been characterised qualitatively as well as quantitatively by high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A method has been developed which permits <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular weight, free propylene glycol content and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> glycol lost during polyesterification, from the integrated nmr spectrum. The prepolymer, has also been resolved into its chain components by low pressure gel permeation chromatography. The species eluting from the chromatographic column were detected by an infrared spectrophotometer and displayed as sets of curves on a time-response recorder. The lowest molecular weight diol, dihydroxypropyl terephthalate, {{assumed to be a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution, was synthesised and used for <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same compound present in the prepolymer. <b>The</b> isomeric forms <b>of</b> this component have been estimated statistically by nmr. Furthermore, a method, has been developed which enables <b>the</b> quantitative <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chromatograms</b> and <b>the</b> subsequent determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prepolymer chain distribution. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> starting materials on. the distribution has also been studied. In addition the molecular weights as deduced by this method were in very good agreement with those estimated by nmr. This project also includes attempts <b>of</b> splitting <b>the</b> double bonds <b>of</b> unsaturated terpo 1 yesters; tbe aim being <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saturated segments. However, ozonolysis, phase transfer catalysed oxidation as well as preferential hydrolysis of some ester bonds failed to give unambiguous results. Finally, <b>the</b> sequence distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> styrene crosslinks in the cured polyester has been studied by C nmr and infrared spectroscopy. The first method involves <b>the</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross 1 inked polyester into a styrene-fumaric acid copolymer and <b>the</b> assignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> styrene quaternary carbon atom absorptions to styrene sequences <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> which is determined from. <b>the</b> spectra <b>of</b> standard styrene-diethy 1 fumarate copolymers.

Adjusting <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> software allowed for <b>the</b> extraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum <b>of</b> an unusual steroidal hydrocarbon coeluting with <b>the</b> major compound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chromatogram.</b> Following a careful <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> "extracted" mass spectrum, <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unknown has been postulated {{to be the}} 4, 14 -dimethylcholestane (DMC).
