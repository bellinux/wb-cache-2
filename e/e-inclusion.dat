40|$|AbstractThis study {{addresses}} the <b>e-inclusion</b> problem {{that relates to}} the inclusion of as many individuals as possible to enjoy benefits of information and communication technology. Despite the fact that European Union accepted <b>e-inclusion</b> declaration in 2006 which aims to reduce disparities that exist among individuals and to improve the level of e-skills among people, nowadays <b>e-inclusion</b> problem still exists. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} find out new approach to promote <b>e-inclusion</b> in society. We propose a more nuanced design approach that takes into account student's satisfaction with e-learning environment and e-materials, student's ability to learn, instructor willingness to share knowledge and others factors. Moreover we believe that <b>e-inclusion</b> means not only high level of digital skills but also the usage of these digital skills to benefit from technologies. To obtain predictors for algorithms we did <b>e-inclusion</b> data domain study based on knowledge management theory. The aim of proposed work is to present <b>e-inclusion</b> theoretical model which is based on integration of several algorithms as multiply linear regression and cluster analysis. These algorithms were calculated based on statistical data obtained on evaluating a group of five hundred blended e-course learners. In this paper we propose architecture designed to predict <b>e-inclusion</b> degree of student based on machine learning and intelligent agent approach. We identified two main processes in the <b>e-inclusion</b> prediction system. The first process consists of agent learning activities. Intelligent agents learn the most appropriate algorithm to predict <b>e-inclusion</b> degree of student based on linear regression or cluster analysis. The second process includes activities to predict <b>e-inclusion</b> degree of student. This process covers analysis of <b>e-inclusion</b> risks and communication between student and instructor also. Proposed <b>e-inclusion</b> model consists of goal diagram, use cases diagrams and main algorithms of the system. As the result of the <b>e-inclusion</b> model is prediction of <b>e-inclusion</b> degree of person as well as <b>e-inclusion</b> risk factors for person, for instance inappropriate e-learning materials or no interest to learn, or dissatisfaction with e-learning environment, or others factors...|$|E
40|$|Research on <b>e-inclusion</b> and {{innovation}} policy {{on a national}} and supra-national (European Union) level not always shows to what extent successful <b>e-inclusion</b> {{and innovation}} policy have been pursued. Therewithal the aims of national <b>e-inclusion</b> and innovation strategies do not always coincide with {{the aims of the}} European Commission. Policies with regard to active aging and senior citizens’ participation in the information society {{on the one hand and}} local, regional or national initiatives and policy on the other hand might hence be different from the European level. We discuss how <b>e-inclusion</b> and digital access of and use by senior citizens became an important topic in Europe and European policy. We propose not only to focus on a top-down (policy) approach but also a bottom-up approach, where local, regional or national initiatives alongside policy are included in the assessment. We will discuss this on the basis of a literature research together with case studies of The Netherlands and Estonia...|$|E
40|$|Depending on the {{existing}} social patterns and trends, development of information society creates new opportunities and risks and restructures the established areas of public policy. For example, <b>e-inclusion</b> {{becomes more and more}} today's predominant form of social inclusion. Despite the diversity of approaches developed, its intrinsic multi-dimension nature and the challenges posed by the continuous evolution of global digital technologies and networks make <b>e-inclusion</b> a problematic scientific and political concept. This article proposes an extended approach to <b>e-inclusion,</b> seen as the cumulative result of three interlocking contributors - i) global evolution of digital technologies and networks, ii) the levels of ICT access, usage and skills and iii) {{the existing}} social structures - and examine its policy implications for Romania. An important conclusion arises from this exploration: Romania is poorly prepared to cope with <b>e-inclusion</b> challenges. The country's relatively incipient stage of information society development and its serious social problems and the emergence of new forms of digital divide demand a holistic policy response capable of coherently capturing and tackling all factors of <b>e-inclusion,</b> beyond the conventional fragmentation of public policy areas. Without it, social inclusion process will be hindered and Romania will not fully reap the social and economic benefits of information society...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contribution}} {{is to provide a}} survey of the economic impact of digitalization processes in the economy and society at large (<b>e-Inclusion).</b> The following three main bodies of literature have been selected and reviewed: The first one is the very rich literature on digital divide/inclusion (section 7. 1). Although the latter investigates the causes (rather than the economic effects) of the processes of digital inclusion (or exclusion) it nonetheless provides several hints and useful indications for a better understanding of both the <b>e-Inclusion</b> phenomenon and (indirectly) its potential economic impact. Section 7. 2 reviews the standard econometric literature assessing the economic impact of ICT picking up those contributions which have (explicitly or implicitly) taken into account phenomena and variables related to <b>e-Inclusion</b> processes and their final economic effects. This is particular the case of the micro-economic literature exploring the impact of ICT on employability and wages and the most recent empirical attempt assessing the economic impact of broadband and internet. Last but not least, section 7. 3 focuses on the few quantitative exercises which have tried to obtain proper quantitative/monetary figures on the impact of <b>e-Inclusion</b> in a selected number of economic areas...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: ICTD {{projects}} are usually driven along the three axes of technological innovation, development programs or new market creation. These drivers {{have to be}} complemented by {{a focus on the}} people served by ICT, and their needs. In this paper, we argue for the importance of human-driven design and research (HDDR) {{to take into account the}} four human dimensions of ICT: local practices; participatory design processes; sociocultural contexts, and political conditions. Building on our ethnographic and design research on the LINCOS project in Costa Rica and Hewlett-Packard's <b>e-Inclusion</b> program, we show how Lincos ' success was impeded by its inattention to human design features, the deployment of a neoliberal discourse of community appropriation, and the market-driven focus of <b>e-Inclusion.</b> We conclude b...|$|E
40|$|Background: Information {{communication}} technology (ICT) {{such as the}} Internet, mobile phones, computers and tablets, has become {{a central part of}} daily life. However a large number of older people do not use ICT, putting them at risk of exclusion from the digital society. Aims: To investigate level to which older people or are “e-included” (or engage with ICT) across various contexts, the factors which influence their <b>e-inclusion</b> and their access to ICT-based care, and the effects of ICT-use on their quality of life. Methods: Using a mixed method approach, I collected both secondary and primary data from numerous different sources including national datasets, the MonAMI project, the relevant literature, and interviews with older adults and technical experts. Analysis: Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed according to the dimensions of the 6 C framework for <b>e-inclusion.</b> The effects of ICT use was assessed against the domains of the ASCOT and WHOQOL models of quality of life. Results: Older people’s <b>e-inclusion</b> and access to ICT-based care were affected by a number of person-centred and environmental factors. There were marked variances in level of <b>e-inclusion</b> with the older population, which was partly attributed to a cohort effect. The evidence showed that access to ICT-based care was affected by local eligibility policies and care practitioner endorsement. Analyses revealed that ICT use positively affected older people’s quality of life in terms of maintaining independence and social networks, and improving psychological wellbeing. However, ICT-use had negative effects on older people’s sense of privacy. Moreover, ICT-based care services proved to be obtrusive and stigmatising for many older people. Conclusion: The findings highlighted a paucity in targeted policies which consider older people’s specific digital interests. There is also a need for {{a better understanding of the}} effects of ICT-based care on older people’s quality of life...|$|E

40|$|The {{changing}} demographic {{structure of}} the population, resulting in unparalleled growth of the elderly population, means that <b>e-inclusion</b> of this population group {{is considered to be}} a social and political priority in the context of the Information Society. Most research studies have only considered individual variables -such as age, gender, education, income and health- in the explanatory models of <b>e-inclusion</b> of senior citizens, while ignoring macro variables, such as the welfare systems and public policies in each country. Simultaneously, most studies focus on small-scale samples, lack international comparisons and do not consider the combined effect of several variables that influence Internet use. This study aims to analyse possible differences between two countries that have different welfare systems and public policies, after controlling for the effects of the individual variables that have been identified in the literature as relevant for Internet use. The study focuses on a sample of 8639 individuals, aged 50 years and over, residing in Portugal and Estonia, who participated in the SHARE project (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe). The results of the logistic regression analysis demonstrate that welfare systems and public policies have an impact on the likelihood of Internet use, thus reinforcing the importance of developing public policies to foster <b>e-inclusion</b> of senior citizens.

40|$|When {{young people}} {{drop out of}} school they are in great danger of being marginalized in society. Immigrants are another group of people who for several reasons often find it {{difficult}} to become integrated into their new home country. In both cases some less formal way of learning might help these groups avoid social exclusion. Well thoughtout development and application of new advanced technologies would be likely to level the way for continued education, communication and democratic participation in society. The term <b>e-inclusion</b> refers to these electronic means and how they could be applied to hindering social exclusion. This study compares the situation of school drop-outs and immigrants in Finland and Italy in the light of statistical data. It paves the way for a European research and development project whose aim is to study problems of <b>e-inclusion</b> in Finland and Italy empirically as well as develop technological and pedagogical solutions to them. mobile learning; e-inclusion; disadvantage groups; immigrants; drop outs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDigital divide {{is still}} a big topic in {{information}} systems and egovernment research. In the past, several tracks and workshops on this topic existed.

Although <b>e-Inclusion</b> programmes and initiatives changed over the years and, moreover, although the amount of <b>e-Inclusion</b> literature is constantly growing, there is still no thorough understanding of potential factors influencing private internet usage. Hence, in this study we identify important influencing factors based on the literature on technology acceptance and digital divide. We develop a model based on these factors and test it against comprehensive survey data (n= 192). Our theoretical model is able to explain more than 70 % of the variation in private internet usage.

The first {{led to the development of}} pilot programmes that worked directly with the rural poor to test bop products, services and business models and to create new sources of income for project participants. The second strategy saw <b>e-Inclusion</b> establish collaborations with public-sector organisations which until then had been peripheral to HP’s business, but were recognised as vital for e-Inclusion’s operations and HP’s emerging market success.
