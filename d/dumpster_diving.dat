5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving,</b> missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{usually find}} {{that most people}} that {{participate}} in practices associated with freeganism, <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> for food, do so for economic reasons. Freegans are usually distinguished as being a subset of this population which has an ideological or political motivation for recovering waste or avoiding consumption, although some freegans also {{say that they do}} so for amusement, to acquire free goods, or out of religious conviction.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the name may {{be traced to the}} fact that Brian Oblivion and Count Zero, two of the {{founding}} members of L0pht, shared a common loft space in Boston with their wives, who ran a hat business on the other side. There they experimented with their own personal computers, equipment purchased from the Flea at MIT, and items obtained from <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> local places of interest.|$|E
50|$|People {{may often}} <b>dumpster</b> <b>dive</b> for useful {{items such as}} clothing, furniture, food, and similar items in good working condition. Some people do this out of {{necessity}} due to poverty, while others do so professionally and systematically for large profits.|$|R

Anna went to a costume shop to pick up her Dolly Parton-esque ensemble. Carl wore a tux, but asked if'n he had to wear shoes with it. The duo lives right behind a train tracks because the price is right. The groom-to-be <b>dumpster</b> <b>dives</b> for his bride's gift because he doesn't believe in buying something when you can 'git it for free'." ...|$|R
50|$|Paradox is a cut up poetry collage {{forming a}} picture of Abraham Lincoln being Assassinated at Ford's Theater. The piece took roughly 3 years to complete. It is {{composed}} entirely of magazines which were obtained for free or <b>dumpster</b> <b>dived</b> from book stores. The name {{is derived from the}} literary device, the paradox is an anomalous juxtaposition of incongruous ideas for the sake of striking exposition or unexpected insight. It functions as a method of literary composition - and analysis - which involves examining apparently contradictory statements and drawing conclusions either to reconcile them or to explain their presence.|$|R
25|$|Public waste {{containers}} or street bins {{are provided}} by local authorities {{to be used as}} a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils pick the waste up and take it to reuse or recycling. However, there are issues with this approach. If the bins are not regularly emptied, then overfilling of bins occurs and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{legality}} of freegan practices of reclaiming wasted food, space, or buildings {{varies depending on}} local laws around property, trespassing, and waste removal. In some places, like New York City, freegans dumpster dive publicly; in other locations, urban foraging is a secretive activity. In recent years, there have been arrests of people <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> for political reasons in the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, although in most locations charges have eventually been dropped. These actions {{could be seen as}} part of a broader criminalization of acts of survival—like sleeping in public places, sharing food without a permit, or recovering aluminum cans to re-sell—that has affected freegans as well as affiliated groups like Food Not Bombs and the homeless. Freegans report that stores have responded to waste recovery as well, including deliberately destroying products prior to disposing of them, locking dumpsters, or pouring bleach on food to make it inedible. In France, a new national law bans the practice of destroying food in this way.|$|E
2500|$|Contact with [...] "waste" [...] {{is seen as}} a taboo and {{socially}} unacceptable in most developed countries, and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging [...] "pest" [...] animals like raccoons. Some public health officials, like those in New York City, have explicitly discouraged <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> for sanitation reasons and media coverage occasionally fixates on the [...] "ick" [...] factor of <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> while (explicitly or implicitly) ignoring its political content. This discourse has been deployed more broadly to discredit anarchist movements by claiming they are unhygienic and thus dangerous. While some freegans argue that dumpster dived food is safe—noting it is usually thrown out because it cannot be profitably sold, not because it is no longer edible—others embrace the [...] "dirtiness" [...] of recovered food as a symbolic rejection of capitalist norms. The group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging, arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food, rather than those who recover it.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{organized}} {{group of}} self-described [...] "freegans" [...] formed in 2003 as {{an offshoot of}} the Wetlands Preserve nightclub and associated Activism Center in New York City. According to the group freegan.info, [...] "After years of trying to boycott products from unethical corporations responsible for human rights violations, environmental destruction, and animal abuse, many of us found that no matter what we bought we ended up supporting something deplorable. We came to realize that the problem isn’t just a few bad corporations but the entire system itself." [...] From 2005, freegan.info organized regular events including sewing and bicycle workshops, wild food foraging expeditions, and [...] "trash tours"—public <b>dumpster</b> <b>dives</b> open to the public and to media.|$|R
5000|$|Bagboy is {{a fictional}} {{television}} pilot for a sitcom created by Dr. Steve Brule for Channel 5. Shelved for its [...] "substandard quality and low entertainment value", {{it begins with}} an introduction by Pablo Myers, owner of Myer's Super Foods, along with his family. After the opening with Steve injuring himself after mopping the floor inside of Myer's Super Foods, Steve is shown stocking some produce when he is asked by Micky Dolenz (of The Monkees fame) where the bananas are. After pointing to them, Brule is asked by cashier Daisy to bag customer Doug Prishpreed's cans. Prishpreed offers her a VIP ticket to the <b>Dumpster</b> <b>Dive</b> show featuring himself before rudely taking away his bags from Steve. Afterwards, Steve attempts to reveal his true affections for her when he is interrupted by his coworker Chip, who {{says that he has}} two tickets for a Twisted Chains concert.|$|R
5000|$|... 17-year old Clare Shannon {{is haunted}} {{by the memory of}} her mother's suicide by hanging. Her father Jonathan, who <b>dumpster</b> <b>dives</b> as a hobby, gives her a Chinese music box as a gift. Clare is able to {{decipher}} one of the numerous inscriptions on the box as [...] "Seven Wishes." [...] She absent-mindedly wishes for Darcie, her tormentor and school bully, to [...] "rot," [...] at which point Darcie develops necrotizing fasciitis and is admitted into the ICU. That same day, Clare's dog Max dies in her house's crawlspace after seemingly being eaten alive by rats. Realizing that the box has the ability to grant wishes, Clare wishes for Paul, a classmate whom she has a crush on, to fall madly in love with her. Paul proceeds to dump his current girlfriend Lola and begins making obvious advances towards Clare. Meanwhile, Clare's wealthy uncle August dies after slipping in a bathtub and hitting his head. News reaches Jonathan, and Clare makes her third wish of all her uncle's wealth being transferred to her. Surely enough, Jonathan receives a phone call indicating that Clare has received everything, including her uncle's mansion. Clare's neighbor and maternal figure Mrs. De Luca subsequently dies when her hair is caught in a sink garbage disposal unit, snapping her neck.|$|R
2500|$|Freeganism is also critiqued both {{by other}} radical {{movements}} and by mainstream commentators {{for the fact}} that its signature practice—dumpster diving—depends on the capitalist food system that freegans claim to be rejecting. A typical response is that freegan practices are not limited to <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving,</b> but include also actions like guerilla gardening, wild food foraging, or sewing or bike repair [...] "skill shares" [...] that are more fully autonomous from the conventional economy.|$|E
2500|$|Some freegans {{associate}} {{themselves with}} [...] "back-to-the-landers" [...] or [...] "anarcho-primitivism," [...] {{the latter of}} which asserts that human beings should reject not only capitalism but civilization itself. With some exceptions, though, freeganism is a largely urban or suburban phenomenon. Some research suggests that freegans overcome this apparent contradiction by attempting to re-naturalize the city, treating urban waste as a [...] "natural" [...] resource and approach <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> as a practice analogous to hunting or gathering.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{of buying}} {{conventionally}} grown foods, wild foragers find and harvest food and medicinal plants growing {{in their own}} communities. Some freegans participate in [...] "guerrilla" [...] or [...] "community" [...] gardens, with the stated aim of rebuilding community and reclaiming the capacity to grow one's own food. In order to fertilize those guerrilla gardens, food obtained from <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> is sometimes also reused, and some use vermiculture instead of ordinary composting techniques {{in order to keep}} the required infrastructure small and adapted to urban areas. Some rural freegans are also [...] "homesteaders" [...] who also raise their own livestock, grow their own food, and employ alternative energy sources to provide energy for their homesteads, occasionally living [...] "off the grid" [...] entirely.|$|E
50|$|After Maita and Chloe's {{fight in}} the {{dressing}} room, Maita went back to Santi's shop {{and asked him to}} help Chloe be herself again. Santi rebuffed her pleas and instead handed her an age-reversing cream, implying that what Maita really wanted was to be beautiful again. She signed a contract which says: 1. She must not tell anyone about the store, 2. She must take good care of the cream and never destroy it and 3. She must not overuse it. It was revealed that Maita was the beautiful lady in the portrait Odie saw earlier. Her fame stopped when she was raped resulting into Chloe coming into her life. The now young and beautiful Maita (Janine Gutierrez), ventured into a bar to attempt to reconcile with Chloe. She was helped in by the hunk whom Pippa was seen with earlier. She completely forgets about Chloe and started to party hard. Suddenly, bugs began bothering her skin. In fright, she ran out of the bar but was stopped by the hunk and started to sexually assault her. At the parking area, Odie came to his senses and started to look for Chloe. He saw her unconscious body on the floor and shouted at the car driver to help him get Chloe to the hospital. The driver was revealed to be Ato who is determined to make Chloe his next course in the restaurant. Ato points a gun at Odie and before he could kill him, a weakly Chloe bludgeons Ato unconscious. Odie then accompanies Chloe to the hospital to treat her injuries. Pippa was still being chased by the zombified men but comes across a <b>dumpster.</b> He <b>dives</b> in the <b>dumpster</b> to hide his smell from the perfume. As the zombies began to retreat, Pippa spots Maita being molested. He saves Maita from the hunk and the two recognized each other (as they met at the restaurant). Pippa and Maita then go to the hospital and came across Odie and Chloe. Realizing they were all cursed by Santi, they decided to finish it once and for all. Odie concluded that if they exchange their respective products from Santi's shop, {{they will be able to}} destroy it without harm. Odie gave Chloe his camera and she gave him her cellphone. Maita gave Pippa her cream and Pippa gave her his perfume. The four confronted Santi when Ato also arrived still with his violent approach. Santi then put them all into a trance as he revealed himself to be the Demon and revealed that their lives are payment for the products they bought. Ato, not being a part of Odie's plan, was killed by Santi. Chloe was threatened by Santi but before he could kill her, Chloe destroyed the camera. Her ears soon bleed. Pippa was almost killed by Santi when he impersonated his sister Larra but Pippa destroyed Maita's cream and escaped. Maita was then surrounded by thousands and thousands of bugs but was able to destroy Pippa's perfume allowing her to escape as well. Odie was confronted by Santi. He was able to smash Chloe's phone before being stabbed in the eye. In the real world, Chloe couldn't hear anything, Odie was blind and Pippa became sensitive to smell. They destroyed the remaining things of Santi and Maita sacrificed herself to burn the contracts and the store. Maita and Santi were killed in the fire.Sometime later, Chloe, now deaf, was in a press conference, with Pippa being her translator. After the conference, they met with a blind Odie. As the three boarded Chloe's van, Santi, who was revealed to be alive, was seen in front of his closed store selling a new batch of items to a new batch of people.|$|R
2500|$|Freegans {{are best}} known for {{recovering}} discarded food from commercial establishments, a practice known as [...] "dumpster diving" [...] or [...] "urban foraging" [...] in North America, [...] "skipping", [...] "bin raiding", or [...] "skipitarianism" [...] in the UK, [...] "skip dipping" [...] in Australia, [...] "containern" [...] in Germany, or [...] "doing the duck" [...] in New Zealand. Freegan diets are thus {{made possible by the}} range of practices that produce commercial food waste that is nonetheless still edible, such as conservative sell-by dates, the deliberate overstocking of certain perishable products (liked baked goods), or aesthetic criteria for fruits and vegetables. However, <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> is not limited to rummaging for food; freegans report recovering clothing, books, appliances, bicycles, and furniture from commercial dumpsters as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pamphlet}} [...] "Why Freegan?"—written {{by former}} Against Me! drummer Warren Oakes in Gainesville, Florida in 1999—defines freeganism as [...] "an anti-consumeristic ethic about eating" [...] {{and goes on}} to describe practices including <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving,</b> plate scraping, wild foraging, gardening, theft, employee scams, and barter as alternatives to paying for food. The pamphlet also expanded the activities associated with [...] "freeganism" [...] with a long section on non-alimentary practices, including conserving water, pre-cycling, reusing goods, and using solar energy. More than just a set of behaviors, though, the pamphlet presents freeganism as having an overarching political goal: an [...] "ultimate boycott" [...] of [...] "all the corporations, all the stores, all the pesticides, all the land and resources wasted, the capitalist system, the all-oppressive dollar, the wage slavery, the whole burrito" [...] in favor of [...] "liv a full satisfying life...while treading lightly on the earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{activities}} like <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> or gleaning are traditionally seen as subsistence {{strategies for the}} poor, most research on freegans finds that individuals come from middle-class and upper-class backgrounds and {{have high levels of}} education (even if their present lifestyles make them low-income). Freeganism has also been described as racially exclusive, because freegan's voluntary association of waste would seem to confirm a [...] "globally ubiquitous racial construction" [...] that people of color are dirty and polluted. As one freegan of color wrote, [...] "I am extremely embarrassed for people to see me diving, because I can tell that I’m not just me, I’m also a representation of black people in general...I got harassed by security several times while diving on my own campus, until my white friends pop their heads out of the dumpsters." [...] In contrast, the portrait of the gender balance of freeganism is more mixed, with some accounts saying groups are majority men and others majority women.|$|E
50|$|Since dumpsters {{are usually}} located on private premises, divers may {{occasionally}} {{get in trouble}} for trespassing while <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving,</b> though the law is enforced {{with varying degrees of}} rigor. Some businesses may lock dumpsters to prevent pickers from congregating on their property, vandalism to their property, and to limit potential liability if a dumpster diver is injured while on their property. <b>Dumpster</b> <b>diving</b> is often not prohibited by law. Abandonment of property is another principle of law that applies to recovering materials via <b>dumpster</b> <b>diving.</b>|$|E
