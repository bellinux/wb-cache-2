5|$|The {{northern}} <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> {{also contains}} the greatest diversity of animal {{life in the}} notch. Mammals include chipmunks, raccoons, white-tailed deer, black bears, and moose. There are also {{a large number of}} birds in this forest; frequently seen are red-eyed vireos, hermit thrushes, and ovenbirds. Amphibians are also found in the northern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> Red efts, the terrestrial stage of development for the red-spotted newt, congregate in large numbers after heavy rains; also present are American toads, spring peepers, and wood frogs.|$|E
5|$|The lowest {{elevations}} of Pinkham Notch are {{occupied by}} a northern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> This forest type is primarily deciduous and consists mostly of sugar maple, American beech, and yellow birch. There is also a proliferation of understory and forest floor plants; common examples include wild sarsaparilla, painted trillium, hobblebush, and Indian cucumber-root.|$|E
5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation. As {{elevations}} increase {{on the walls of}} the notch, climate and ecosystems change to those of increasingly northern occurrence. Biomes range from a low-elevation northern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> at the base of Mount Washington to alpine-Arctic vegetation near the summit comparable to vegetation found at the latitude of Labrador.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} the {{following}} forest communities: inland maritime (live-oak hammock), subtropical magnolia, and {{three types of}} <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests.</b> These <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests</b> include lowland mixed hardwood, pine-mixed hardwood, and mixed-oak hardwood.|$|R

5|$|In 1791, {{working with}} Dr. Theodore Wadsworth, Todd gained {{permission}} {{to start a}} hospital near the present-day Farmington/Plainville border for smallpox inoculation. The facility, commonly called Hospital Rock, is found deep in the second-growth <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> of Rattlesnake Mountain in Connecticut and was used from 1792-1794. Though the building is no longer present, the nearby rock ledge upon which patients would socialize remains. It was this rock that lent the facility its name. At this location, they could also receive mail and various packages.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

25|$|Red Spruce Trail {{is about}} one mile (1.6km) long and goes from the camping area to the Forty Maples Picnic Area. It passes through a spruce {{plantation}} and a mixed <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> Hikers should be cautious of the venomous snakes {{that live in the}} area.|$|E
25|$|The two regions {{also differ}} physically. The upland south is {{dominated}} by deciduous <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest,</b> {{in contrast to the}} Deep South's predominantly evergreen pine forests. The upland south is often much hillier than the deep south, due to the Deep South being part of the coastal plain.|$|E
25|$|Silver Creek Trail is a 1-1/2 mile easy {{trail that}} is marked with red blazes. It begins behind a dairy barn and follows Silver Creek through {{a forest of}} hemlocks with a fern understory. The trail ends with a steep climb through a <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> near Meadow Trail.|$|E
50|$|The river {{valleys and}} lower layers form the sub-montane zone. The {{aboriginal}} <b>hardwood</b> and mixed <b>forests</b> are largely replaced with spruce monocultures. Only the river valleys offer remnants of <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R

25|$|Glaciers {{shaped the}} area, {{creating}} a unique regional ecosystem. A {{large portion of}} the area is the so-called Grayling outwash plain, which consists of broad outwash plain including sandy ice-disintegration ridges; jack pine barrens, some white pine-red pine forest, and northern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> Large lakes were created by glacial action.|$|E
25|$|The second region {{comprises}} the northern lowlands, {{along with the}} southern coastal plain. Eighteen major rivers and many perennial streams drain these low-lying areas. The coastline is flat and swampy, with many lagoons, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. Westward from the northern coastal areas, the terrain changes from mangrove swamp to tropical pine savanna and <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nearly 60 {{percent of}} the park is covered with {{northern}} <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> Above 2600 feet (790 m) conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and these trees become mixed with or replaced by balsam fir and red spruce. Above 3500 feet (1000 m) black spruce replace red. Higher still only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.|$|E
2500|$|Cove <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests,</b> {{which are}} native to Southern Appalachia, {{are among the}} most diverse forest types in North America. [...] The cove <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests</b> of the Smokies are mostly second-growth, {{although}} some [...] are still old-growth.

500|$|Due to {{prolonged}} {{periods of}} natural fire suppression, {{much of the}} Pine Bush has evolved into northern or southern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests.</b> These forests, often dominated by invasive species, occupy roughly [...] of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve. The southern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests</b> are dominated by black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), which is exotic, and black cherry (Prunus serotina); [...] with lesser numbers of native oaks (Quercus) and maples (Acer), and the exotic, invasive tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima). The shrub layer is dominated by black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) and other brambles (Rubus sp.). In contrast the northern <b>hardwood</b> <b>forests</b> are dominated by aspen (Populus), black cherry, red maple (Acer rubrum), white pine (Pinus strobus), gray birch (Betula populifolia), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and oaks.|$|R
25|$|Missouri {{is home to}} a {{diversity}} of both flora and fauna. There is a large amount of fresh water present due to the Mississippi River, Missouri River, and Lake of the Ozarks, with numerous smaller tributary rivers, streams, and lakes. North of the Missouri River, the state is primarily rolling hills of the Great Plains, whereas south of the Missouri River, the state is dominated by the Oak-Hickory Central U.S. <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
25|$|The heron rookery {{is located}} along the East Arm Little Calumet River in the {{northeast}} corner of Porter County. The rookery is physically separated from {{the main part of the}} park. It is accessible from County Road 600 East, south of County Road 1400 North. The rookery is a <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> The great blue heron nests for which the site is named are no longer a feature of the area. Spring brings out a variety of wildflowers.|$|E
25|$|Both {{sections}} of Shikellamy State Park have a hiking trail. At the overlook {{there is a}} one-mile (1.6km) nature trail. Careful hikers will {{get the chance to}} observe some wildlife. They might see white-tail deer, many different songbirds and a wide variety of wildflowers. Hikers can also observe the development of forests at the overlook. The forest changes from scrub forest to mature <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest.</b> The marina is encircled by paved walking paths for those interested in taking a walk along the river and marina.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{the ongoing}} Trinity River Project, the Great Trinity Forest, at , is the largest urban <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> in the United States and is {{part of the}} largest urban park in the United States. The Trinity River Audubon Center is a new {{addition}} to the park. Opened in 2008, it serves as a gateway to many trails and other nature viewing activities in the area. The Trinity River Audubon Center is the first LEED-certified building constructed by the City of Dallas Parks and Recreation Department.|$|E
25|$|The hickories as a {{group are}} classed as {{intermediate}} in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant hardwoods (including the hickories) are climax, and the trend of succession toward this climax is very strong. Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest,</b> the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26).|$|E
25|$|The dock {{allowed the}} mainland’s <b>hardwood</b> <b>forest</b> to be harvested. Kelderhouse bought land and began {{processing}} cordwood {{to sell to}} passing ships for firewood. He built a sawmill near the John Burfiend farm. Port Oneida grew considerably over the next 30 years to include many commercial enterprises. Among these were a general store, a post office, a blacksmith shop and a boarding house. There were also two large barns built by other farmers. Kelderhouse owned most of the commercial buildings at Port Oneida and {{about half of the}} land on Pyramid Point. He built his home at Port Oneida. Kelderhouse also bought a gristmill on the Crystal River from John Fisher in 1866 to process grains.|$|E
