Buehler’s research focuses on bottom-up simulation of structural and mechanical properties of biological, bioinspired and synthetic materials across multiple scales, with a specific focus on materials failure from a nanoscale and molecular perspective, and on developing a fundamental understanding of how <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> properties are created in natural, biological and synthetic materials.

50|$|In {{the early}} stage of his study, Yoon contributed {{to the field of}} charge {{transfer}} complexes formation and charge transfer phenomenon in the nanopores of zeolite. Since 2000, he has showed that a new <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> can be produced through 2D and 3D arrays of silica nanobeads and zeolite microcrystals by using them as nano and micrometer building blocks. This finding not only shows that nano- and micro-sized particles can be included as a new class of building blocks but also means that organization of zeolite microcrystals has been settled down as a field of study in the future of material chemistry(Acc. Chem. Res. 2007, 40, 29-40).|$|E

5000|$|The term operando first {{appeared}} in catalytic literature in 2002. It was coined by Miguel A. Bañares, who sought to name the methodology {{in a way that}} captured the idea of observing a <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> — in this case a catalyst — under actual working, i.e. device operation, conditions. The first international congress on operando spectroscopy took place in Lunteren, Netherlands, in March 2003, followed by further conferences in 2006 (Toledo, Spain), 2009 (Rostock, Germany), 2012 (Brookhaven, USA), and 2015 (Deauville, France). [...] The name change from in situ to operando for the research field of spectroscopy of catalysts under working conditions was proposed at the Lunteren congress.Frequently the term [...] "operando" [...] is mistakenly written as [...] "in operando", which is incorrect use of the Latin language.|$|E
5000|$|Imprint {{lithography}} {{is inherently}} a three-dimensional patterning process. Imprint molds can be fabricated with {{multiple layers of}} topography stacked vertically. Resulting imprints replicate both layers with a single imprint step, which allows chip manufactures to reduce chip fabrication costs and improve product throughput.As mentioned above, the imprint material {{does not need to}} be finely tuned for high resolution and sensitivity. A broader range of materials with varying properties are available for use with imprint lithography. The increased material variability gives chemists the freedom to design new functional materials rather than sacrificial etch resistant polymers. [...] A <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> may be imprinted directly to form a layer in a chip with no need for pattern transfer into underlying materials. The successful implementation of a functional imprint material would result in significant cost reductions and increased throughput by eliminating many difficult chip fabrication processing steps.|$|E
50|$|Blending powders {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} unit-operations in the solids {{handling}} industries. For many decades powder blending has been used just to homogenize bulk materials. Many different machines have been designed to handle materials with various bulk solids properties. On the basis of the practical experience gained with these different machines, engineering knowledge has been developed to construct reliable equipment and to predict scale-up and mixing behavior. Nowadays the same mixing technologies are used for many more applications: to improve product quality, to coat particles, to fuse materials, to wet, to disperse in liquid, to agglomerate, to alter <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> properties, etc.This wide range of applications of mixing equipment requires a high level of knowledge, long time experience and extended test facilities to come to the optimal selection of equipment and processes.One example of a solid-solid mixing process is mulling foundry molding sand, where sand, bentonite clay, fine coal dust and water are mixed to a plastic, moldable and reusable mass, applied for molding and pouring molten metal to obtain sand castings that are metallic parts for automobile, machine building, construction or other industries.|$|E

5000|$|Early works {{considered}} {{the integration of}} luminescent materials as erosion sensors in TBCs. The notion of a [...] "thermal barrier sensor coating" [...] (sensor TBC) for temperature detection was introduced in 1998. Instead of applying a phosphor layer on the surface where the temperature needs to be measured, it was proposed to locally modify {{the composition of the}} TBC so that it acts as a thermographic phosphor as well as a protective thermal barrier. This dual <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> enables surface temperature measurement but also could provide a means to measure temperature within the TBC and at the metal/topcoat interface, hence enabling the manufacturing of an integrated heat flux gauge. First results on yttria-stabilized zirconia co-doped with europia (YSZ:Eu) powders were published in 2000. They also demonstrated sub-surface measurements looking through a 50 μm undoped YSZ layer and detecting the phosphorescence of a thin (10 µm) YSZ:Eu layer (bi-layer system) underneath using the ESAVD technique to produce the coating. The first results on electron beam physical vapour deposition of TBCs were published in 2001. The coating tested was a monolayer coating of standard YSZ co-doped with dysprosia (YSZ:Dy). First work on industrial atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) sensor coating systems commenced around 2002 and was published in 2005. They demonstrated the capabilities of APS sensor coatings for in-situ two-dimensional temperature measurements in burner rigs using a high speed camera system. Further, temperature measurement capabilities of APS sensor coatings were demonstrated beyond 1400 °C. Results on multilayer sensing TBCs, enabling simultaneous temperature measurements below and {{on the surface of the}} coating, were reported. Such a multilayer coating could also be used as a heat flux gauge in order to monitor the thermal gradient and also to determine the heat flux through the thickness of the TBC under realistic service conditions.|$|E

40|$|The main {{problematic}} of {{the research}} is to connect the stimuli-responsive behaviour of <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> to the end-user experience.

40|$|Children, {{it is well}} known, {{go through}} a {{developmental}} stage in which they omit <b>functional</b> <b>material,</b> a fact which is often attributed to a missing of deficient functional structure in the early grammar. We argue that the systematic omission of <b>functional</b> <b>material,</b> on the contrary, argues {{for the presence of}} functional structure, as in the absence of such structure, what is expected is not a systematic omission of <b>functional</b> <b>material,</b> but rather, its random (over) use. Random use of <b>functional</b> <b>material</b> is attested in agrammatic speech, where, we suggest, it may indeed stem from absent or deficient functional structure. On the other hand, the early grammar is characterized by a full, albeit phonologically unrealized, functional structures. Such phonologically unrealized functional structures, we suggest, are interpreted in the early grammar through D(iscourse) -linking, using UG-available principles that are otherwise attested in natural language. 1 The {{authors would like to thank}} audiences at the 21 st Annual Boston University Conference on Language Development and at Northwestern University as well as Kirrie Ballard and Cynthia Thompson for helpful comments.
