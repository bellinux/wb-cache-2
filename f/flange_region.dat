40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental investigation of thermally induced residual stresses in fabricated 3 CR 12 (DIN 1. 4003) T-sections. 3 CR 12 is a weldable utility stainless steel developed {{to provide a}} superior alternative to coated carbon steels and other alloys which have a poor corrosion/abrasion resistance. Because of the difficulty and costs involved in hot-rolling stainless steel structural sections, they are usually fabricated by welding. In this investigation, full-penetration laser- and manual metal arc (MMA) joints were considered along with partial-penetrated MMA- and metal inert gas (MIG) welded joints. The residual stresses induced during welding were measured by neutron diffraction. All the sections displayed a largely tensile residual stress field around the weld that subsequently implied a compressive residual stress field in the <b>flange</b> <b>regions.</b> This was most pronounced for the MMA and MIG welds. The laser- welded sections displayed a more localized tensile residual stress field in the heat-affected zone that translated to lower average stresses in the flanges. In {{the latter part of}} this article, the effect of the weld-induced residual stress fields on the structural performance of appropriate T-section-based columns are assessed and compared. A significant difference in structural performance between the different weld techniques is predicted with the laser- welded sections displaying the highest predicted strength...|$|R
5000|$|Deep {{drawing is}} a {{sheet metal forming}} process in which a sheet metal blank is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch. It is thus a shape transformation process with material retention. The process is considered [...] "deep" [...] drawing when {{the depth of the}} drawn part exceeds its diameter. This is achieved by redrawing the part through a series of dies. The <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> (sheet metal in the die shoulder area) experiences a radial drawing stress and a tangential compressive stress due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses (hoop stresses) result in flange wrinkles (wrinkles of the first order). Wrinkles can be prevented by using a blank holder, the function of which is to facilitate controlled material flow into the die radius.|$|E

In the drawn part wall, which is {{in contact with the}} punch, the hoop strain is zero whereby the plane strain condition is reached. In reality, mostly the strain condition is only approximately plane. Due to tensile forces acting in the part wall, wall thinning is prominent and results in an uneven part wall thickness, such that the part wall thickness is lowest {{at the point where the}} part wall loses contact with the punch, i.e., at the punch radius.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new approach, radial-axial force {{controlled}} (RAFC) electromagnetic {{sheet forming}} (EMF), {{has been developed}} for hard-form metal sheet deep drawing. Different to the traditional EMF, an additional radial Lorentz force was introduced at the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> of workpiece to improve the material flow and reduce the maximum strain of workpiece. For this purpose, an EMF system with two coils has been designed. The two coils were used to generate the axial Lorentz force (Fz) on the workpiece region (D 1) above the cavity and the radial force (Fr) on the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> (D 2), respectively. The Fz was used to accelerate the D 1 region's material in axial direction to shape the workpiece into the die, while the Fr was used to accelerate the D 2 region's material in negative radial direction to improve the material flow of the flange. In this paper the electromagnetic analysis of the system has been carried out. As a proof of concept, the variation characteristics of Fr and Fz under different discharging energies and schedules of the coils were simulated and analyzed.

Conversely, the mandible tends to make lower dentures less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the <b>flange</b> into these <b>regions</b> tends to produce a more retentive lower denture.

40|$|M. Ing. 3 CR 12 is a {{corrosion}} resistant steel that {{was developed in the}} 1980 ’s as an alternative to coated mild steel in the construction industry. The low chromium content together with an absence of nickel result in a competitative production cost. It has good welding characteristics when compared to the other ferritic grades. Because of the cost and difficulties involved, structural hot-rolled sections in 3 CR 12 (or any other stainless steel for that matter) are not commercially available. Sections are either cold formed or built-up through various welding techniques. Design in cold formed stainless steel sections are done in accordance to the SABS 0162 - 4 : 1997 code of practice. In general welded built-up sections should comply with the SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 code of practice. Little is known about the structural behaviour of built-up stainless steel and particularly 3 CR 12 fabricated sections. Currently sections are fabricated using both manual metal arc and laser welding. The effect of using different welding techniques (which has become common practice) is totally unexplored. The aim of this research is therefore to investigate the structural behaviour of built-up 3 CR 12 sections when fabricated by using either manual metal arc or laser welding techniques. The investigation was initiated by conducting a comprehensive literature review with specific reference to built-up 3 CR 12 structural sections. This is followed by an experimental investigation utilizing the neutron diffraction technique to determine the typical residual stress profile associated with manual metal arc and laser-welded built-up 3 CR 12 sections. This data is then used as input to a non-linear finite element investigation where the effect of the residual stress profile on the structural integrity of selected axial structural members (columns) is evaluated. An experimental program where a selected number of full scale fabricated sections were tested as axial members was then conducted to act as comparison and validation of the numerical model. The research found that both the welding techniques investigated may be successfully used to fabricate the structural sections. There is however a distinct difference in the residual stress profile within the sections between the two welding techniques. Laser welding induces smaller compressive residual stresses in the <b>flange</b> end <b>regions</b> when compared to manual metal arc welding. This has a beneficial effect on the axial buckling strength of the axial members. The difference could be up to about 8 % depending on the slenderness ratio and the column in question.

40|$|AbstractDeep {{drawing is}} a forming {{process in which}} a blank of sheet metal is {{radially}} drawn into a forming die by the mechanical action of a punch and converted to required shape. Deep drawing involves complex material flow conditions and force distributions. Radial drawing stresses and tangential compressive stresses are induced in <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> due to the material retention property. These compressive stresses result in wrinkling phenomenon in <b>flange</b> <b>region.</b> Normally blank holder is applied for restricting wrinkles. Tensile stresses in radial direction initiate thinning in the wall region of cup. The thinning results into cracking or fracture. The finite element method is widely applied worldwide to simulate the deep drawing process.

30|$|It {{can also}} be seen that the {{tangential}} tensile strain on Region C decreases to zero, while the thickness compressive strain increases significantly, which causes material accumulation on the round corner of the <b>flange</b> (<b>Region</b> C) and an the increase in wall thickness. In addition, because of bending, in Region C the radial compressive strain changes to very large radial tensile strain. In Region D, the large radial tensile strain changes to small compressive strain, and the large thickness compressive strain changes to small tensile strain. As a result, the wall thickness on the inner edge of the flange is continues to increase, but the increment is small. No deformation occurs in Region E, so all strains are zero.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of light}} metals and high strength steel in the automobile industry, demands for new sheet metal forming processes {{that can be applied}} successfully. In this thesis the subject of warm sheet metal forming is studied. In warm sheet metal forming the temperature of the blank is elevated either globally to one temperature evenly over the blank or locally where the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> of the blank is given a higher temperature. A survey of existing knowledge on the subject shows that the formability can be improved remarkably. This is especially true for the deep drawing of aluminium alloys and magnesium alloys. Other benefits can also be found like the elimination of stretcher-strain marks, which can be found on certain aluminium alloys, and reduction of springback. The temperature of the blank is usually elevated by using heated tools that warm the blank through conduction. The tools are usually heated by utilizing electrical resistance heaters inserted at different locations into the tool. If the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> is to be given a higher temperature the use of a heated blank holder and die can be used in conjunction with a cooled punch. In the thesis a new heating process is described called Localized In-Tool Induction Heating. The process integrates induction heating into the forming tool {{in such a way that}} a locally heated blank can be obtained. A short pre-heating time can then be followed by continual heating during the stroke. Since the blank is warmed, without heating the different parts of the tool, a fast and efficient process can be expected. A case study has been conducted where the manufacturing performance of Warm Sheet Metal Forming with Localized In-Tool Induction Heating has been compared with traditional sheet metal forming of a car trunk lid in aluminium. In the thesis it is concluded that warm sheet metal forming has a great potential, but the processes used must be further developed to meet production demands. A new process has been introduced and future research will further develop the process...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tailoring}} of hot stamped components is investigated, specifically {{the introduction of}} a tailored (locally softened) flange within an otherwise martensitic hot formed side impact beam. The effect of tailoring on the resulting micro-hardness distribution and crash response during three-point bending is examined. The “in-die heating” tailoring method is considered, using a cooled die with local heating in the <b>flange</b> <b>region.</b> The heated regions cool the flange at a lower cooling rate to produce a softer region with higher ductility. In the current work, three different die temperatures are chosen for the forming conditions in the tailored <b>flange</b> <b>region.</b> A fully hardened beam is hot formed and quenched with the dies set at room temperature as a benchmark case. Die temperatures in the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> of 400 and 600 °C are considered to produce the tailored side impact beams with reduced hardness in the flange. The material considered is Usibor® 1500 -AS boron steel in thicknesses of 1. 2 and 1. 8 mm. Two quenching periods of 4 and 10 s are also studied. After forming, the 1. 2 mm thick beams exhibit very little difference in hardness distribution between the two quenching periods. The 1. 8 mm thick beams have a larger difference in hardness distribution in the sidewall region caused by the difference in quenching (hold) time, with the shorter quench resulting in a softer sidewall condition. The measured micro hardness in the flange area of the 1. 2 mm thick beams was 480, 360, and 225 HV (compared to 480 HV in the fully quenched region away from the flange) when the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> of the dies are set to room temperature, 400 °C, and 600 °C respectively. For the 1. 8 mm thick beams, the measured hardness was 475, 270, and 205 HV for the corresponding die temperatures and a 10 s quench period. The tailored hot formed side impact beams are tested under three-point bend loading using two back plate configurations, referred to as the full back plate and split back plate configurations. The split back plate configuration was intended to focus deformation {{at the center of the}} beam thereby inducing fracture in the <b>flange</b> <b>region.</b> The beams exhibited two deformation modes, referred to as a “wrapping mode” versus a “collapse mode”. In the wrapping mode, the friction between the punch and beam surface sufficient to cause the deforming beam to wrap around the indentor resulting in a higher overall load level and energy absorption. In the collapse mode, the cross-section collapses or folds under the indentor leading to a lower bending resistance. The mode selection was spurious with nominally identical beams exhibiting both responses. In general, the fully hardened beams have the highest peak load while the tailored beams formed with a 600 °C dies have the lowest peak load in the 3 -point bend experiments. None of the beams tested exhibited global fractures for all conditions considered. Numerical models of the tailored hot forming process and subsequent three-point bend experiments were developed. The material model developed by Akerstrom (2006, PhD Thesis, Lulea University of Technology), as implemented in LS-DYNA with modifications proposed by Schill et al. (2013, 4 th Int. CHS 2 Conf., pp. 31 - 38) for tailoring simulations with a temperature hold period, is used to predict the hardness after tailored hot forming, while the TCM II constitutive model developed by Bardelcik et al. (2014, Mat. and Des., pp. 509 - 525) is used to predict the crash performance of the tailored hot formed beams. The forming simulations were able to accurately predict the hardness of the non-tailored, fully hardened beams with a predicted hardness of greater than 480 HV for both thicknesses and quenching periods. The hardness of the tailored (softened) flanges was predicted within 27 HV (12 %) for the 600 °C die temperature and 63 HV (18 %) for the 400 °C die temperature. A parametric study using the three-point bending model, demonstrated that the deformation mode (wrapping versus collapsing) was controlled by the friction between the punch and beam surface. High friction levels promoted a wrapping deformation mode that produces higher load levels. For high friction cases, the simulations were able to predict the force versus displacement response of the wrapping mode beams with a full back plate configuration very closely up to an impactor displacement of 30 mm. At this point, the beams in the experiments begin to soften due to fracture in fold regions which was not accounted for in the models. The predicted loads for the beams with a split back plate configuration at peak load displacement of the experiment were lower than measured by 4. 8 kN (or 22 %), possibly due to an additional gap that formed between the flange and the back plate caused by a thermal distortion. Tailoring the flange of the side impact beams lowered the peak force value when compared to the peak force of a fully hardened beam. Most of the fractures seen during the three-point bend experiments were located at the fully hardened region of a tailored beam. There was no spot weld failure in any of the three-point bend experiments regardless of the forming temperature or the spot weld configuration. Future work should include a bend experiment for which the specimens are more prone to fracture in the reduced hardness area, to further examine the role of tailoring in controlling the onset of fracture...|$|E

Recognition of seriousness of the situation has led regulatory organisations to impose strict targets on allowable carbon dioxide emissions from automotive vehicles. As a possible solution, it has been proposed that Fibre Metal Laminate (FML) system is used to reduce the weight of future vehicles. To facilitate this investigation, FML based on steel and self-reinforced polypropylene was stamp formed into dome shapes under different blank holder forces (BHFs) at room temperature and its forming behaviour analysed. An open-die configuration was used in a hydraulic press so that a 3 D photogrammetric measurement system (ARAMIS) could capture real-time surface strains.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{deep drawing}} process {{is one of the}} {{important}} sheet metal forming process. In this paper, different methods of analysis such as analytical, numerical and experimental techniques are employed to determine sheet blank size, formability and thickness distribution. The traditional sheet plate forming techniques used in industry is experimental, expansive and time consuming methods. Prediction of the formability, thickness distribution in {{deep drawing process}} will decrease the production cost and time of material to be formed. With this regard, the numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element method for cup shaped components with flange. Thickness distribution is obtained for entire cup along with flange. The results obtained from this numerical analysis are compared with experimental findings and results of other researchers. Experimentally thickness distribution is obtained by measurement at various locations in half cut cup along with <b>flange</b> <b>region.</b> Also analytical relationship is suggested to obtain correct initial blank size for cup shaped components with flange on the basis of principal of constancy of volume. As a result of this, 90 - 95 % consistency is obtained between the finite element result and experimental, analytical findings for initial blank size, formability and thickness distribution. Analytical models are extensive and experimentation is time consuming and expensive. Thus one can rely on FEA and simulations can be carried out to control IBS, formability, thickness distribution for component of same family by taking initial guess of IBS from analytical formula to avoid time and cost in field trials by controlling parameters of tooling and press machine...|$|E

As a consequence, sheet thinning limits the amount of bearable deformation, and thus the range of possible applications. Much attention has been given to the maximum strains that can be attained in AISF. Several authors have found that the forming limits are considerably higher than those obtained using a Nakazima test and that the forming limit curve is approximately a straight line (mostly having a slope of- 1) in the stretching region of the FLD. Based on these findings they conclude that the “conventional” forming limit curves cannot be used for AISF and propose dedicated tests to record forming limit diagrams for AISF. Up to now, there is no standardised test and no evaluation procedure for the determination of FLCs for AISF. In the present paper, we start with an analysis of the range of strain states and strain paths that are covered by the various tests that {{can be found in the}} literature. This is accomplished by means of on-line deformation measurements using a stereovision system. From these measurements, necking and fracture limits are derived. It is found that the fracture limits can be described consistently by a straight line with negative slope. The necking limits seem to be highly dependent on the test shapes and forming parameters. It is concluded that standardisation in both testing conditions and the evaluation procedures is necessary, and that a forming limit curve does not seem to be an appropriate tool to predict the feasibility of a given part design...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} isothermal and non-isothermal warm formability of an AA 3003 aluminum alloy brazing sheet is presented. Forming limit diagrams were determined using warm limiting dome height (LDH) experiments with in situ strain measurement based on digital image correlation (DIC) techniques. Forming limit curves (FLCs) were developed at several temperature levels (room temperature, 100 ºC, 200 ºC, 250 ºC, and 300 ºC) and strain-rates (0. 003, 0. 018, and 0. 1 s- 1). The formability experiments demonstrated that temperature has {{a significant effect on}} formability, whereas forming speed has a mild effect within the studied range. Elevating the temperature to 250 C improved the formability more than 200 % compared to room temperature forming, while forming at lower speeds increased the limiting strains by 10 % and 17 % at room temperature and 250 ºC, respectively. Non-isothermal deep draw experiments were developed considering an automotive heat exchanger plate. A parametric study of the effects of die temperature, punch speed, and blank holder force on the formability of the part was conducted. The introduction of non-isothermal conditions in which the punch is cooled and the <b>flange</b> <b>region</b> is heated to 250 C resulted in a 61 % increase in draw depth relative to room temperature forming. In order to develop effective numerical models of warm forming processes, a constitutive model is proposed for aluminum alloy sheet to account for temperature and strain rate dependency, as well as plastic anisotropy. The model combines the Barlat YLD 2000 yield criterion (Barlat et al., 2003) to capture sheet anisotropy and the Bergstrom (1982) hardening rule to account for temperature and strain rate dependency. Stress-strain curves for AA 3003 aluminum alloy brazing sheet tested at elevated temperatures and a range of strain rates were used to fit the Bergstrom parameters, while measured R-values were used to fit the yield function parameters. The combined constitutive model was implemented within a user defined material subroutine that was linked to the LS-DYNA finite element code. Finite element models were developed based on the proposed material model and the results were compared with experimental data. Isothermal uniaxial tensile tests were simulated and the predicted responses were compared with measured data. The tensile test simulations accurately predicted material behaviour. The user material subroutine and forming limit criteria were then applied to simulate the isothermal warm LDH tests, as well as isothermal and non-isothermal warm deep drawing experiments. Two deep draw geometries were considered, the heat exchanger plate experiments developed as part of this research and the 100 mm cylindrical cup draw experiments performed by McKinley et al. (2010). The strain distributions, punch forces and failure location predicted for all three forming operations were in good agreement with the experimental results. Using the warm forming limit curves, the models were able to accurately predict the punch depths to failure as well as the location of failure initiation for both the isothermal and non-isothermal deep draw operations...|$|E
