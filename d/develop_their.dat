5|$|The band's early {{sound was}} rooted in post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. In 2010, they began experimenting with acoustic music, (obvious in 2014 release Unbroken, Untied) a theme that would expand and <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> sound and audience.|$|E
5|$|Utica's neighborhoods have {{historically}} been defined by their residents, allowing them to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own individuality. Racial and ethnic groups, social and economic separation {{and the development of}} infrastructure and new means of transportation have shaped neighborhoods, with groups shifting between them as a result.|$|E
5|$|After {{five to six}} instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male's forceps {{will become}} curved, while the females' forceps remain straight. They will also <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> natural color, which can be {{anything}} from a light brown (as in the Tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the Ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.|$|E

5|$|Appearing as the player's tutors in {{the game}} are the sentient twin witch doctor masks Aku Aku and Uka Uka, both of whom give hints that help the player <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> racing skills. They double as {{obtainable}} power-ups during the races, temporarily protecting the player from all attacks and obstacles while increasing the kart's speed. However, their power does not protect the player from chasms or deep water.|$|E
5|$|Based on Béla Bánáthy's {{original}} work, {{the program}} is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and more advanced levels of instruction. Each level is tailored {{to the needs of}} youth at specific ages and maturity levels.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E

5|$|From the Order of Canada grew a Canadian honours system, thereby {{reducing}} the use of British honours (i.e. those administered by the Queen in her British privy council). Among the civilian awards of the Canadian honours system, the Order of Canada comes third, after the Cross of Valour and membership in the Order of Merit, which is within the personal gift of Canada's monarch. By the 1980s, Canada's provinces began to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own distinct honours and decorations.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{returned}} to Salt Lake City in 1870 {{and became a}} professor of German. However, he resigned from this position {{to return to the}} Twentieth Ward Seminary. In 1870, he also taught at the University of Deseret, helping to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> teacher training program. Maeser wrote articles in the Beehive Series of the Juvenile Instructor during 1870. In 1871, he was elected the president of the Salt Lake Teacher's Association. For {{a short period of time}} he was also an assistant organist for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.|$|E

5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E

Many of these hurricanes are either Cape Verde-type storms, which <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> strength by having a great deal of open water; or so-called Bahama busters, which intensify over the warm Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Such {{approval}} {{was increasingly}} granted starting in 1982. In May, Venezuela, {{who had long}} examined the FX project, agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs, replacing a fleet of Mirage III interceptors and Mirage 5 ground-attack aircraft. Sweden decided to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own design, the JAS 39 Gripen. In September 1983, Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G/S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A/B. Greece, stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16, purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984, giving a firm pledge of secrecy.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles' five residencies in Hamburg during 1960 to 1962 {{allowed the}} Liverpool band to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> {{performance}} skills and widen their reputation. Drummer Pete Best {{was added to}} the band in August 1960 to secure their first Hamburg booking, where they played for 48 nights at the Indra Club and then 58 nights at the Kaiserkeller. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961 to play at the Top Ten Club for three months.|$|E
5|$|The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML), {{published}} by the World Health Organization (WHO), contains the medications considered {{to be most effective}} and safe to meet the most important needs in a health system. The list is frequently used by countries to help <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own local lists of essential medicine. As of 2016, more than 155 countries have created national lists of essential medicines based on the World Health Organization's model list. This includes countries in both the developed and developing world.|$|E

5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found the opportunity to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of the AFM blends {{at the national level}} the elements of a presbyterian polity with an episcopal polity. Decentralization is a major feature of its constitution, which allows local churches to <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own policies. The Apostolic Faith Mission displays a variety of identities and ministry philosophies, including seeker-sensitive, Word of Faith, Presbyterian, and classical Pentecostal.|$|E
5|$|The {{data from}} the XB-70 test flights and {{aerospace}} materials development {{were used in the}} later B-1 bomber program, the American supersonic transport (SST) program, and via espionage, the Soviet Union's Tupolev Tu-144 SST program. The development of the Lockheed U-2 and the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft, as well as the XB-70, prompted Soviet aerospace engineers to design and <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> high-altitude and high-speed MiG-25 interceptor.|$|E
