Sunagawa soon began accompanying Raël during his travels to Lima, Miami, Brazil, and Martinique. In a television documentary, They're Coming! (1990) by Radio Canada, Raël was seen with four women, while Lisa, in slow-motion, wore a pink tutu and <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> with him.|$|E
5|$|Chariot racing {{seems to}} have {{declined}} {{in the course of}} the seventh century, with the losses the Empire suffered at the hands of the Arabs and the decline of the population and economy. The Blues and Greens, deprived of any political power, were relegated to a purely ceremonial role. After the Nika riots, the factions grew less violent as their importance in imperial ceremony increased. In particular, the iconoclast emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) courted the factions for their support in his campaigns against the monks. They aided the emperor in executing his prisoners and by putting on shows in which monks and nuns <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> while the crowd hissed at them. Constantine V {{seems to have}} given the factions a political role in addition to their traditionally ceremonial role. The two factions continued their activity until the imperial court was moved to Blachernae during the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E

For three of the prisoners the first shot caused death, but for the German-speaking Englishwoman a second shot had to be fired as she still showed signs of life after the first shot.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Paisley {{gathered}} {{a throng of}} Orangemen and tried to push through the police lines, but was arrested. Loyalists threw missiles at the police and tried {{to break through the}} blockade; police responded with plastic bullets. In support of the Orangeman, loyalists blocked roads across Northern Ireland, and there were attacks on Catholics and the police. The march was eventually allowed to continue through the Catholic area. As the march ended, Paisley and David Trimble <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> in the air {{in what appeared to be}} a gesture of triumph, causing considerable ill-feeling among the Catholic residents.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; {{they want to}} move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality. College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported. Most teens said they had kissed their partners, <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.|$|E

500|$|Following the pie {{attack on}} the archbishop, two of Allan Spear's colleagues invited Anita Bryant to come to St. Paul to {{overturn}} their three-year-old gay rights ordinance, and announced Save Our Children would be opening a branch there. Local activists did not think much of their chances; a local gay political group invited gays and lesbians in Miami to live in Minneapolis—St. Paul. In an act representing Bryant's diminished national public profile, in October 1977 Bryant {{and her husband were}} in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing an upcoming concert at a press conference when Thom Higgins, an activist affiliated with organizers in Minneapolis, walked up to her in front of cameras and mashed a strawberry rhubarb pie in her face. Bryant was stunned and bowed her head as she and Green <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> and prayed for Higgins. She quickly quipped [...] "At least it's a fruit pie." [...] An image of her covered with the pastry appeared {{on the front page of}} The New York Times the next day.|$|E
500|$|Whedon's {{rejection}} of the [...] "very special episode" [...] format impelled him to address the physicality of Willow and Tara's relationship within [...] "The Body". Before this episode, they had <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> and danced on screen, but they had not kissed. A genre of television specials dealing with female homosexuality developed as the [...] "lesbian kiss episode" [...] in the 1990s, where a female character kissed another female but no relationship is further explored. Whedon set out to acknowledge Willow's and Tara's affection without making it {{the primary focus of}} the show. For attempting this, he received resistance from the airing network, the WB. Whedon informed them that the kiss between Willow and Tara was [...] "not negotiable". According to Whedon, the conversation about the kiss was approached by the network executives, who were concerned with the number of gay relationships on the network. Whedon countered that the kiss was [...] "true to character" [...] and said he would quit the show if the network forbade it. It was the only time during the series he threatened to do so.|$|E
500|$|The {{feeling of}} urgency spread {{throughout}} Greenwich Village, even {{to people who}} had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing {{an opportunity to take}} action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, called the Annual Reminder. Organizers Craig Rodwell, Frank Kameny, Randy Wicker, Barbara Gittings, and Kay Lahusen, who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines. This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously <b>held</b> <b>hands,</b> Kameny broke them apart, saying, [...] "None of that! None of that!" [...] Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches. Participant Lilli Vincenz remembered, [...] "It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered." [...] Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.|$|E

2500|$|In ancient Greece {{the sport}} was called helkustinda (Greek: ἑλκυστίνδα), efelkustinda (ἐφελκυστίνδα) and dielkustinda (διελκυστίνδα), which derives from dielkō (διέλκω), meaning amongst others [...] "I pull through", all {{deriving}} from the verb helkō (ἕλκω), [...] "I draw, I pull". [...] Helkustinda and efelkustinda {{seem to have}} been ordinary versions of tug of war, while dielkustinda had no rope, according to Julius Pollux. It is possible that the teams <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> when pulling, which would have increased difficulty, since handgrips are more difficult to sustain than a grip of a rope. Tug of war games in ancient Greece were among the most popular games used for strength and would help build strength needed for battle in full armor.|$|E

Ratledge and Hunt were married on April 15, 1967. The Soft Machine were heavily booked {{and there was no}} time for a honeymoon, but Ratledge and Hunt were able to spend two months together before the band headed for France later that year. Hunt said in 1991 that she and Ratledge never <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> and never kissed, but that [...] "...he comes for Easter. But that's what we called married." [...] While the two have remained good friends, Hunt says the secret to a happy marriage is to [...] "separate immediately."

Morin described the situation as [...] "violent". He recalled putting his overcoat over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two <b>held</b> <b>hands.</b> Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in [...] "a rather bad spot", so he crouched and made himself [...] "as small as possible."

She was not averse to making {{physical}} contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way. Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> with an AIDS patient {{in one of her}} early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition. Diana noted: [...] "HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it. What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys." [...] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in [...] "something more pleasant". In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C. She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust. In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK. As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992. She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{name was}} called {{from a list}} of {{inactive}} reserves to serve on active duty in the Korean War on January 9, 1952. Williams, who was livid at his recalling, had a physical scheduled for April 2. Williams passed his physical and in May, after only playing in six major league games, began refresher flight training and qualification prior to service in Korea. Right before he left for Korea, the Red Sox had a [...] "Ted Williams Day" [...] in Fenway Park. Friends of Williams gave him a Cadillac, and the Red Sox gave Williams a memory book that was signed by 400,000 fans. The governor of Massachusetts and mayor of Boston were there, along with Korean War veteran named Frederick Wolf who used a wheelchair for mobility. At the end of the ceremony, everyone in the park <b>held</b> <b>hands</b> and sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne" [...] to Williams, a moment which he later said [...] "moved me quite a bit." [...] Private Wolf, (an injured Korean veteran from Brooklyn), presented gifts from wounded veterans to Ted Williams. Ted choked and was only able to say,"...ok kid..." [...] The Red Sox {{went on to win the}} game 5-3, thanks to a two-run home run by Williams in the seventh inning. After he returned from the Korean War in August , Williams practiced with the Red Sox for ten days before playing in his first game, garnering a large ovation from the crowd and hitting a home run in the eighth inning. In the season, Williams ended up hitting [...]407 with 13 home runs and 34 RBIs in 37 games and 110 at bats (not nearly enough plate appearances to qualify for that season's batting title). On September 6, Williams hit his 332nd career home run, passing Hank Greenberg for seventh all-time.|$|E
