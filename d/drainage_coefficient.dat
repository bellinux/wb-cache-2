Due to the growing urbanization, <b>drainage</b> <b>coefficients</b> have increased and the possibility of rain water retention on the surface has decreased. Among other things, large interventions in nature are also caused by the construction of motorways. We often deal with a great amount of rainwater coming very quickly from the road surface during heavy rain, which is often quite contaminated and as such unsuitable for release into the natural environment. Therefore, the rainwater from the road surface must first be properly cleaned before discharge, as determined by the applicable law. The type and degree of purification are determined according to the vulnerability of the area where the traffic route runs. Due to the lack of sufficient drainage, it is often necessary to hold rainwater in reservoirs, where water is partially cleaned and slowly released into the environment. If necessary, additional cleaning of storm water is provided. Recent studies demonstrate the effectiveness of cleaning, represented by the reservoir with additional functions of an oil separator, settlement tank, and a reservoir with ground infiltration.

For each time step, the new water table position was calculated based on flux across the water table, a Brooks-Corey equation mass balance for the unsaturated region, and an equation that calculates water table position for the saturated region. An equation was developed to calculate a <b>drainage</b> transfer <b>coefficient,</b> alpha, based on percentage of perforated area in the drain tube wall. The <b>drainage</b> transfer <b>coefficient</b> was incorporated into the finite element model as a Fourier boundary condition. To validate the finite element model, its results were compared with the Kirkham equation results for steady state recharge of three subsurface drainage systems. The finite element model was used to calibrate a semi-analytical frozen stream tube model for subsurface drainage of heterogeneous soils. The first step in the calibration procedure is to run the finite element model for steady state recharge and calculate the water table height divided by recharge rate (the stream tube resistance to flow) as a function of distance between drains. Least squares regression is used to fit a polynomial logarithmic equation, called the resistance function, to the stream tube resistance to flow vs. distance from the drain curve. A differential equation based on the principle of conservation of mass and application of Darcy's law to the frozen stream tube was solved to obtain an equation that calculates stream tube flow rate and final water table elevation {{as a function of the}} resistance function and initial water table elevation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} effects of using non-linear, high {{resolution}} rainfall, compared to time averaged rainfall on the triggering of hydrologic thresholds and therefore model predictions of infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff at the point scale. The bounded random cascade model, parameterized to three locations in Western Australia, was used to scale rainfall intensities at various time resolutions ranging from 1. 875 min to 2 h. A one dimensional, conceptual rainfall partitioning model was used that instantaneously partitioned water into infiltration excess, infiltration, storage, deep drainage, saturation excess and surface runoff, where the fluxes {{into and out of}} the soil store were controlled by thresholds. The results of the numerical modelling were scaled by relating soil infiltration properties to soil draining properties, and in turn, relating these to average storm intensities. For all soil types, we related maximum infiltration capacities to average storm intensities (k *) and were able to show where model predictions of infiltration excess were most sensitive to rainfall resolution (ln k * = 0. 4) and where using time averaged rainfall data can lead to an under prediction of infiltration excess and an over prediction of the amount of water entering the soil (ln k * > 2) for all three rainfall locations tested. For soils susceptible to both infiltration excess and saturation excess, total runoff sensitivity was scaled by relating <b>drainage</b> <b>coefficients</b> to average storm intensities (g *) and parameter ranges where predicted runoff was dominated by infiltration excess or saturation excess depending on the resolution of rainfall data were determined (ln g * < 2). Infiltration excess predicted from high resolution rainfall was short and intense, whereas saturation excess produced from low resolution rainfall was more constant and less intense. This has important implications for the accuracy of current hydrological models that use time averaged rainfall under these soil and rainfall conditions and predictions of larger scale phenomena such as hillslope runoff and runon. It offers insight into how rainfall resolution can affect predicted amounts of water entering the soil and thus soil water storage and drainage, possibly changing our understanding of the ecological functioning of the system or predictions of agri-chemical leaching. The application of this sensitivity analysis to different rainfall regions in Western Australia showed that locations in the tropics with higher intensity rainfalls are more likely to have differences in infiltration excess predictions with different rainfall resolutions and that a general understanding of the prevailing rainfall conditions and the soil's infiltration capacity can help in deciding whether high rainfall resolutions (below 1 h) are required for accurate surface runoff predictions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The NYCDEP Stream Management Program (SMP) is {{responsible}} for developing stream management plans for NYC water supply watersheds in the Catskill Mountains, New York State. This mostly forested region of Pleistocene glacial deposits over sedimentary rocks ranges in elevation from approximately 600 to 4, 120 feet above sea level; average annual precipitation ranges from 36 to> 60 inches/year. The SMP uses fluvial geomorphology {{as a framework for}} stream assessment, restoration and monitoring. Bankfull discharge, a common surrogate for channel forming discharge, forms a basis for assessing and classifying stream morphology (Rosgen, 1994). The SMP documented bankfull discharge and associated stream geometry for 41 cross sections at 18 USGS stream gage stations, which produce statistically significant regression models as a function of <b>drainage</b> area. <b>Coefficients</b> of determination (R 2) for bankfull discharge, cross-sectional area, width, and depth are 0. 81, 0. 90, 0. 88, and 0. 85, respectively.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} flow {{have been shown}} to be {{important}} determinants of biological community structure and function in streams, yet direct application of this approach to large rivers has been limited. Using a multivariate approach, we grouped flow gauges into hydrologically similar units in the Missouri and lower Yellowstone Rivers and developed a model based on flow variability parameters that could be used to test hypotheses about the role of flow in determining aquatic community structure. This model could also be used for future comparisons as the hydrological regime changes. A suite of hydrological parameters for the recent, post-impoundment period (1 October 1966 – 30 September 1996) for each of 15 gauges along the Missouri and lower Yellowstone Rivers were initially used. Preliminary graphical exploration identified five variables for use in further multivariate analyses. Six hydrologically distinct units composed of gauges exhibiting similar flow characteristics were then identified using cluster analysis. Discriminant analyses identified the three most influential variables as flow per unit <b>drainage</b> area, <b>coefficient</b> of variation of mean annual flow, and flow constancy. One surprising result was the relative similarity of flow regimes between the two uppermost and three lowermost gauges, despite large differences in magnitude of flow and separation by roughly 3000 km.

40|$|BACKGROUND Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein {{analysis}} {{is an important}} element in the diagnostic chain for various central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Among multiple existing approaches to interpreting measured protein levels, the Reiber diagram is particularly robust with respect to physiologic inter-individual variability, as it uses multiple subject-specific anchoring values. Beyond reliable identification of abnormal protein levels, the Reiber diagram has the potential to elucidate their pathophysiologic origin. In particular, both reduction of CSF drainage from the cranio-spinal space as well as blood-CNS barrier dysfunction have been suggested ρas possible causes of increased concentration of blood-derived proteins. However, there is disagreement on which of the two is the true cause. METHODS We designed two computational models to investigate the mechanisms governing protein distribution in the spinal CSF. With a one-dimensional model, we evaluated the distribution of albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), accounting for protein transport rates across blood-CNS barriers, CSF dynamics (including both dispersion induced by CSF pulsations and advection by mean CSF flow) and CSF <b>drainage.</b> Dispersion <b>coefficients</b> were determined a priori by computing the axisymmetric three-dimensional CSF dynamics and solute transport in a representative segment of the spinal canal. RESULTS Our models reproduce the empirically determined hyperbolic relation between albumin and IgG quotients. They indicate that variation in CSF drainage would yield a linear rather than the expected hyperbolic profile. In contrast, modelled barrier dysfunction reproduces the experimentally observed relation. CONCLUSIONS High levels of albumin identified in the Reiber diagram are more likely to originate from a barrier dysfunction than from a reduction in CSF drainage. Our in silico experiments further support the hypothesis of decreasing spinal CSF drainage in rostro-caudal direction and emphasize the physiological importance of pulsation-driven dispersion for the transport of large molecules in the CSF...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} a new method {{to deal with}} design dependent pressure loads in Topology Optimisation (TO) using the SIMP material model. A pronounced focus is on optimising pressure actuated compliant mechanisms. The difficulty herein is {{the interpretation of the}} pressure boundary in a TO design. In TO the boundaries are blurry, because of the filtering of the design variables, which is necessary to prevent checkerboarding. Another reason why the boundary is poorly defined is that the optimisation starts from an equally distributed grey, where black and white respectively are solid and void, so the boundary is either the domain boundary or not defined in early iterations of the optimisation. The methods proposed in literature often try to find the void-solid interface exposed to the pressure source to apply the loading from a pressure line directly. The method proposed in this work, appropriately called the Darcy method, first calculates the pressure field by using Darcy's law governing the flow through porous media and the associated pressure drop. A flow coefficient is introduced that decreases if the virtual element density increases. This results in a design dependent pressure field that can be solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM), which can then be translated to consistent nodal forces that are applied to the TO problem. A <b>drainage</b> <b>coefficient</b> has also been introduced {{to make sure that the}} pressure is drained entirely to the environment pressure over the first encountered void-solid interface exposed to the pressure source. The Darcy method has proven to function well in several test cases. The method has been thoroughly tested using several parameter sweeps on a clamping problem objective. The parameters whose influence is examined are: the initial condition, the density threshold value, flow coefficient gradient at the threshold, output spring stiffness and the volume fraction. Subsequently, some alternative TO problems are solved showing the diversity of the method. In perspective of future research, the Darcy method can function as a great tool to research load sensitivities by tuning the pressure field control parameters. The extension of the Darcy method to 3 D or to several load cases comes naturally but has not been tested in this work, this is also recommended for future research.

40|$|Soils play a {{key role}} in {{providing}} a range of ecosystem services. Quality-assessed soil information, with quantified uncertainty levels, is needed to address a range of global issues. Traditional mapping methods, which recognize that soil classes are “important carriers of soil information”, were used to prepare an updated harmonized dataset of derived soil properties for the world at a nominal resolution of 30 by 30 arc sec (WISE 30 sec). The map unit composition was determined using an overlay of the Harmonized World Soil Database, with minor corrections, and the Köppen–Geiger climate zones map as categorical co-variate. Property estimates for the respective component soil units were derived using taxonomy-based transfer rules that draw on a statistical analysis of some 21, 000 soil profiles. Best estimates (mean ± standard deviation) for twenty soil properties were calculated for seven depth intervals (up to 2 m depth or less when thinner) : organic carbon content, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH(H 2 O), CECsoil, CECclay, effective CEC, total exchangeable bases (TEB), base saturation, aluminium saturation, calcium carbonate content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, particle size distribution (content of sand, silt and clay), proportion of coarse fragments (> 2 mm), bulk density, and available water capacity (− 33 to − 1500 kPa); also the dominant soil <b>drainage</b> class. <b>Coefficients</b> of variation tend to be large.

As an example, the database was used to calculate the global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock to 2 m depth. Some 30 % (607 ± 87 Pg C) of this stock (2060 ± 215 Pg C) is held in the Northern Circumpolar Region, which is considered most sensitive to climate change...|$|R

Experiments were conducted on a hydraulic tilting flume under simulated unit flow (120 and 45 cm 2 s- 1), rainfall (120 mm/hr) and slope (0, 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 6, 1. 8, 2. 0, 2. 2, 2. 4, 2. 6, 2. 8 and 3. 0 %) conditions. The depth of soil was maintained at 0. 20 m. over a perforated bed to facilitate deep drainage. A comparative study of bare soil, stone cover (50 %) and vegetative cover (50 %) is made to evaluate soil loss, deep <b>drainage,</b> Manning’s roughness <b>coefficient.</b> The study has revealed that stone cover is more effective than vegetative cover at lower discharge in reducing the flow velocity and thereby soil erosion. Deep drainage has been reduced from lower discharge to higher discharge for all the slopes with cover measures, including bare soil. It is also found that cover measures are necessary beyond 2. 6 % bed slope in order to prevent rill erosion in salty soils...|$|R

Regional flood frequency analysis is based on physical, climatological and hydrological characteristics of basins. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine different models for the estimation of quantiles for some catchments in western Iran (namely: Gharehsoo, Gamasiab, Kashkan, Seimareh, Sezar and Abshineh) for which only maximum daily mean discharge data exist. In this research, peak and maximum daily mean discharges for 11 stream gauging stations were collected for a 21 -year period. The ratio of these two discharges (R) and mean and standard deviations of peak discharges and maximum daily mean discharges were computed. Catchment characteristics including catchment area, catchment perimeter, main channel length, mean elevation, mean slope equivalent rectangle length, circular ratio, Gravelius <b>coefficient,</b> <b>drainage</b> density, time of concentration, relief ratio and diameter of the circle having equal area with the catchment were computed. Linear regression analysis was performed between independent variables of the catchments and mean standard deviation of the parameter “R” to develop a relation.

40|$|Simulation models {{such as the}} Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) {{have become}} widely used in {{determining}} the water quality impacts of various management practices. Ensuring that the algorithms accurately represent the processes simulated has become an important goal. Tile drainage is a standard practice in the Midwest, US {{in order to reduce}} risk of yield loss due to excess water. Multiple tile drainage and water table algorithms have been available in the SWAT model between the initial SWAT release and revision 638 used in this study. Testing of those algorithms is often limited. Furthermore, algorithms in the current version have not been tested using small scale measured tile discharge. ^ To better represent the hydrologic processes related to subsurface drainage, four modifications were made to the SWAT model subsurface hydrology routines in order to increase the physical basis of these algorithms. First, percolation through the soil profile was altered to be based on Darcy’s Law and the Buckingham-Darcy Law. Second, the restrictive layer of the soil profile was redefined to be the bottom of the soil profile and an additional variable was added to control the seepage through the restrictive layer. Third, the water table height algorithm, which was based on an algorithm applicable at only one site, was redefined to be within the lowest unsaturated layer. Lastly, the lag through the tile drains, which caused an unrealistic delay under default conditions was removed and flow is delayed by only the <b>drainage</b> <b>coefficient.</b> ^ These changes were evaluated at the experimental tile drained field at the Southeast Purdue Agricultural Center (SEPAC). The model was developed with a single hydrologic response unit (HRU) and calibrated for both tile flow and nitrate. The modifications improved the performance of SWAT for water table and tile flow predictions, although the nitrate was more severely under-predicted. ^ The modifications were tested on a small watershed located in Central Ohio monitored by the USDA-ARS. Each tile output in this watershed was monitored allowing for each tile to be individually modeled and analyzed with SWAT. This watershed was also calibrated for tile flow and nitrate. Here again, the modifications showed an improvement for tile flow but a reduction in performance for nitrate. Phosphorus was also looked at but not calibrated for, and an extreme under-prediction issue was observed. ^ These modifications improved the physical basis or simplified the process representation in the SWAT model, and showed improvement to the tile flow model predictions. The model should be further tested and further developments, specifically for nitrogen and phosphorus, should continue. ...|$|E

Posteriorly, the analysis of the parameters was made possible by the creation of a database that have been manipulated through the software ArcGis 10. 1 and BaseCamp Garmin that generated a digital elevation model of the terrain from data project topodata-INPE derived of imagery SRTM-NASA, outside, hypsometric map, map of location, the boundaries of the river basin and river network. The results indicate that the watershed of the river capybara has an elongated shape, steeper slopes, is sparse and has a deep dissection river, with a drainage system little branched and dendritic, showing that geoprocessing is a tool very useful for studies of watersheds.

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{losses from}} {{agricultural}} fields have been recognised {{as one of}} the most important sources of P causing eutrophication in water bodies. Water transport in soil plays an important role in P leaching from drained fields. In this study, the ICECREAM model was employed to simulate 15 -year drainage and P leaching from a sandy loam soil at the Mellby experimental site in south-western Sweden. The results were compared with measured data in order to test the applicability of the model at the Mellby site, identify important processes controlling drainage and P leaching at Mellby, and suggest potential future improvements to the model to better suit the Mellby soil. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters related to soil physical properties (soil texture, soil porosity, field capacity, wilting point and saturated conductivity), infiltration capacity (CN 2) in connection with field management practices and macropore flow moderately or significantly affected the total amount of drainage. These parameters also indirectly affected P leaching, which was closely correlated to drainage. Soluble P leaching was also greatly sensitive to base saturation, while particle P leaching was greatly affected by parameters related to particle generation for macropore transport (detachability and particle extraction depth). The model accurately simulated total drainage and drainage dynamics for the 15 -year study period when the <b>drainage</b> partition <b>coefficients</b> for deep percolation (K 1 and K 2) and the parameters related to macropore flow (tresh_watin and frac) were calibrated. The simulation showed that considerable amounts of drainage water (17 %) bypassed tile drains and that water was able to move very fast along preferential flow paths in this sandy soil. The model accurately simulated the transport dynamics of soluble PO 4 3 [...] P and total P, but failed to simulate total amounts and concentrations. Leaching of both soluble P and total P was overestimated. One clear conclusion from this work was that new parameters are greatly needed in the model to better describe sorption-desorption processes for P to Fe-oxides or (and) Al-oxides in the soil. This would allow P leaching from a soil like this to be simulated with higher precision. It was also concluded that parameters related to particle generation need careful calibration in future simulations. The simulations for the Mellby site showed that when the soil P pools were large, it was difficult to distinguish the effects of reduced P fertilisation on leaching. They also showed that management practices such as crop type, tillage practices, etc. can influence P losses. The model should be further tested on field data to determine the accuracy of such estimations...|$|R
40|$|As local {{authorities}} {{are becoming more}} interested in the assessment of pollutant loads, this study offers a Geographic Information System (GIS) model for assessing nonpoint source of pollution for two scenarios: the current and ultimate stage of urbanization. The Puhinui Catchment, Manukau City, {{has been used as a}} case study in developing and testing this model. This catchment has all the attributes of a "typical" urban area and gives a good representation of the effects of land use on the receiving waters of Puhinui Stream and its estuary. Annual mass contaminant loadings were calculated by firstly assessing the physical characteristics of the Puhinui catchment (case study catchment) and secondly describing the nature of storm water quality and calculating the annual mass contaminant loadings. GIS is used to multiply the annual runoff volume by a mean pollutant concentration to acquire an average annual pollutant load. The annual runoff volume is calculated from the <b>drainage</b> area, runoff <b>coefficient</b> and annual rainfall. To calculate the total mean pollutant load, the pollutant loads for all land use types within the catchment are summed and the process is applied for each pollutant. This GIS model determines the connection of typical pollutant concentrations with land uses in the catchment and offers a characterisation of nonpoint source pollution in that catchment. This model can be used for, identifying catchment areas that contribute considerably to the pollution of waterways, determining the appropriate treatment of the storm water runoff for particular sub catchment, storm water quality improvement prioritization and cost-benefit analysis, selecting locations for water-quality monitoring stations, improvement in maintenance practices, assessment of proposed development environmental effects...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] The article {{was published in the}} journal, Water Resources Research and is available at: [URL] drainage systems of polythermal glaciers {{play an important role in}} high latitude hydrology, and are determinants of ice flow rate. Flow-recession analysis and linear-reservoir simulation of runoff time series are here used to evaluate seasonal and inter-annual variability in the drainage system of the polythermal Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard, in 1999 and 2000. Linear flow recessions are pervasive, with mean coefficients of a fast reservoir varying from 16 h (1999) to 41 h (2000), and mean coefficients of an intermittent, slow reservoir varying from 54 h (1999) to 114 h (2000). Drainage-system efficiency is greater overall in the first of the two seasons, the simplest explanation of which is more rapid depletion of the snow cover. Reservoir coefficients generally decline during each season (at 0. 22 h d– 1 in 1999 and 0. 52 h d– 1 in 2000), denoting an increase in <b>drainage</b> efficiency. However, <b>coefficients</b> do not exhibit a consistent relationship with discharge. Finsterwalderbreen therefore appears to behave as an intermediate case between temperate glaciers and other polythermal glaciers with smaller proportions of temperate ice. Linear-reservoir runoff simulations exhibit limited sensitivity to a relatively wide range of reservoir coefficients, although the use of fixed coefficients in a spatially-lumped model can generate significant sub-seasonal error. At Finsterwalderbreen, an ice-marginal channel with the characteristics of a fast reservoir, and a subglacial upwelling with the characteristics of a slow reservoir, both route meltwater to the terminus. This suggests that drainage-system components of significantly contrasting efficiencies can co-exist spatially and temporally at polythermal glaciers...|$|R
40|$|Evapotranspiration is a {{critical}} factor for local and regional planning, {{in terms of both}} water quality and quantity, to inform decisions around water catchment management, irrigation, water storage, and resource sustainability. Despite its importance, understanding of evapotranspiration from irrigated dairy pasture in Canterbury has to date been relatively limited. The focus of this research was, therefore, to improve understanding of evapotranspiration from ryegrass-based irrigated pastures under grazing. This was achieved through quantifying relationships between actual evapotranspiration and canopy development and evaluation and validation of methods commonly applied in the estimation of potential canopy evapotranspiration (PETc) for grazed perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pasture. A network of nine lysimeters located at three sites across the mid to north Canterbury Plains was used. Pasture canopy measurements were taken throughout the study at one of the sites, and the biophysical model ‘DairyMod’ used to simulate pasture growth at all three sites. The ‘DairyMod’ and ‘HYDRUS- 1 D’ models were used to simulate soil water flow, and used to support lysimeter-based estimates of actual evapotranspiration. Methods examined for modelling PETc included the use of a crop coefficient time series and a number of commonly applied single-layer models including Penman-Monteith (PM), FAO-modified Penman-Monteith (PMFAO) and Priestley-Taylor (PT), and the dual-layer dual crop coefficient (DCC) and Shuttleworth-Wallace (SWW) models. ‘DairyMod’ and ‘HYDRUS’ and selected PETc models were validated with data collected under a controlled, perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) pasture experiment at Lincoln University, with two levels each of irrigation and nitrogen fertiliser. At all three lysimeter sites, the pasture production was nitrogen-limited, with herbage yields of 10. 8 - 14. 9 t DM/ha/y, below optimum yields achievable for Canterbury. The results suggested under-fertilisation of pasture to be prevalent across the region. ‘DairyMod’ was successful in accurately simulating pasture growth under a commercial dairy operation when compared with the measured lysimeter data. However, limitations within the model were identified. Specifically, the calibrated model failed to account for the mechanistic relationship between nitrogen and leaf extension at the temperature stress parameter values required to achieve a reasonable fit with the observed data. Accordingly, within the model, temperature became more limiting than nitrogen. However, this was able to be overcome through the reliance on the empirical relationship between temperature stress and photosynthesis whereby temperature stress functions in the model could be manipulated to achieve the ‘correct’ yields. ‘HYDRUS- 1 D’ was found to be superior to ‘DairyMod’ in the simulation of soil water flow. This was due to the closer predictions of drainage and soil moisture content with that observed compared with DairyMod. The simulated drainage highlighted issues in the lysimeter design. Where lysimeters were installed without rubber rims around the top of lysimeter casings, there was the potential for surface redistribution of water to occur. This ultimately led to discrepancies in the lysimeter data through unaccounted for water losses and therefore a reduction in <b>drainage.</b> A crop <b>coefficient</b> time series was developed from the lysimeter water use data. The time step over which water use measurements were made was the dominant contributing factor to variation in monthly crop coefficient values between lysimeter sites. When daily estimates of water use are used rather than weekly or greater, which were calculated with the SWW model, the spatial variability was largely eliminated. Temporal variations were found to be seasonally driven. When a mean crop coefficient time series from the three lysimeter sites was used to predict PETc, estimates were within 1 - 11 % of the actual evapotranspiration (AET), determined using the observed lysimeter data. When used to predict PETc in the Lincoln experiment, estimates were within 3 - 13 % of AET when water was not limiting. The results highlighted that, due to temporal variations, use of a single crop coefficient value could not be supported, which led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. However, the site averaged time series could be used for water allocation management purposes over the irrigation season months. The single layer PM, PMFAO and PT models over predicted water use. There was a strong systematic error to the daily PM estimates. When the canopy was small PM under-estimated AET but at a leaf area index greater than approximately 1. 3, PM over-estimated AET. This led to total over-estimations of 8 - 29 %. However, this was an improvement on the climate-based PMFAO predictions, which over-estimated AET by 31 - 58 %, and the PT model, which over-estimated AET by 17 - 30 %. The failure of these methods to accurately predict water use was due to their inherent assumptions of the canopy that are not representative of a typical grazed ryegrass pasture in Canterbury. The dual crop coefficient model provided estimates of water use within 1 - 24 % of the observed AET. However, the SWW model predicted water use within 9 % of AET. This was largely owing to the separation of soil evaporation from canopy transpiration, enabling the influence of the canopy on the potential soil evaporation to be adequately accounted for. These results highlighted the benefit of using the SWW model for irrigation management purposes over other PETc models and the need to actively account for the canopy, being the primary factor controlling water use. The method of estimation was also found to be significant, whereby under a grazed system the process of canopy transpiration needs to be separated from the soil evaporation. Finally, irrigation schedule scenario testing across the three lysimeter sites indicated ~ 35 % of drainage losses could be avoided through optimising irrigation scheduling. Doing so involved applying 10 - 20 mm per irrigation event, with a minimum return interval of 2 - 4 days, and delaying irrigation by 10 - 14 days following grazing of the paddock. Through optimising irrigation, the total irrigation applied was reduced by up to 64 % without compromising herbage accumulation. However, while less irrigation was required, more nitrogen was necessary for optimum yields to be achieved. It is likely that this finding is applicable to many commercial dairy farms region wide...|$|R
