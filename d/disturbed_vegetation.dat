40|$|Resilience of tundra {{vegetation}} to disturbance by herbivores can be low {{and lead}} to ecosystem state shifts. Pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus are the most numerous herbivore on Svalbard and <b>disturb</b> <b>vegetation</b> when foraging for below-ground plant biomass (grubbing). We assessed grubbing extent (occurrence of vegetation disturbance) and intensity (proportion of <b>vegetation</b> <b>disturbed)</b> in 2006 / 07 / 08 when goose numbers were approximately 56, 000 and in 2013 when they increased to approximately 81, 000. Despite a 36 % increase in population size, in 2013 the grubbing extent at pre-breeding sites {{was similar to that}} in 2007 / 08 but grubbing intensity was lower. Extensive snow cover in 2013 probably dispersed geese over larger areas in search of snow-free patches for feeding, thereby reducing grubbing intensity. At the largest known breeding site, both grubbing extent and intensity increased with more geese. Birds preferentially fed close to nests in previously grubbed wet habitat, probably aiding nest defence and permitting feeding on plants that were easier to remove from the soil. A greater impact on tundra vegetation may occur at nesting areas if the breeding population continues to grow. However, timing of snowmelt appears key in moderating the impact of disturbance on tundra vegetation since it controls spatial distributions of feeding geese.

In recent years, considerable {{effort has been}} directed towards identifying geological parameters that pre-dispose natural terrains to landsliding and the assessments of landslide risk. There has, however, been little investigation of other possible causative factors, specifically, the role of vegetation type and disturbance, particularly hill fires, in promoting shallow landsliding. Fire-denuded hill slopes {{may be subject to}} more frequent landsliding events. Today, much of Hong Kong’s hill slopes are covered in fire-prone grasslands, and hill fires associated with cultural festivals are common place. This paper presents an approach to using remote sensing techniques to model areas of <b>disturbed</b> <b>vegetation</b> and detect associated shallow landslides in natural terrain. The research uses data from two satellites, LANDSAT TM and IKONOS. LANDSAT TM is used to detect <b>disturbed</b> <b>vegetation</b> using visible, near and mid-infrared bands and to obtain vegetation indices NDVI and NDMIDIR that indicate plant vigor. IKONOS high resolution multispectral data are used to prepare a color composite image to locate shallow landslides, that are correlated to LANDSAT depicted vegetation indices.

Over the past years the German TanDEM-X mission acquired data for a new, truly global Digital Elevation Model with unpreceded geometric resolution, precision and accuracy. First processed data sets (i. e. IDEM) with a geometric resolution of 0. 4 to 3 arcsec have been made available for scientific purposes. This includes four 1 ° x 1 ° tiles covering the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Here we document the results of a local scale IDEM validation exercise utilizing RTK-GNSS-based ground survey points from a dried out reservoir basin and its vicinity characterized by pristine open Savanna vegetation. Selected precursor data sets (SRTM 1, SRTM 90, ASTER-GDEM 2) were included in the analysis and highlight the immense progress in satellite-based Earth surface surveying over the past two decades. Surprisingly, the high precision and accuracy of the IDEM data sets have only little impact on the delineation of watersheds and the calculation of catchment size.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the impact of termite mounds on the {{vegetation}} of mopane (Colophospermum mopane) savanna in Northwestern Namibia. This area is a part of a mopane zone with a high distribution of termite mounds. Much previous research on termite mounds has been conducted in humid tropical areas. Such studies have found termite mounds to have high fertility and thus to be a key factor in vegetation dynamics. Few studies, however, have focused on the relationship between termite mounds and vegetation in arid or semi-arid areas, and the impact of the mounds on savanna vegetation remains unclear. In the area where I conducted research, almost all termite mounds were found together with trees. The composition of tree species on the mounds reflected the composition in the surrounding vegetation, but Combretum spp. dominated slightly more than other species. The rate of withered trees, especially Terminalia prunioides, was higher on the mounds than on the ground. Moreover, termite mounds were extracted as one of the parameters of tree withering from a statistical model analysis using a generalized linear model (GLM). As a result of this study, termite mounds appeared to act as negative factors in vegetation growth on or near the mounds. The mounds should, therefore, be taken into account as one of the factors that <b>disturb</b> <b>vegetation</b> dynamics in mopane savanna...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a preliminary {{investigation of the}} extent to which the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), derived from satellite optical imagery, can indicate the extent of damage to upland tundra (fruticose lichen and dwarf shrub) vegetation. We combine the results of a previously reported classification of Landsat multispectral scanner imagery from Kol'skiy Poluostrov, Russia, with field measurements of the biomass and spectral reflectance of tundra vegetation. The results show that the NDVI is not strongly influenced by biomass, but that differences in species composition and ground cover are significant. Other workers have concluded that vegetation indices are not useful for boreal forests. It is therefore suggested that the use of the NDVI by itself as an indicator of the state of <b>disturbed</b> <b>vegetation</b> in Arctic regions is not recommended...|$|E

40|$|We used 116 {{years of}} floral and faunal records from Mandarte Island, British Columbia, Canada, to {{estimate}} the indirect effects of humans on plant communities via their effects on the population size of a surface-nesting, colonial seabird, the Glaucous-winged gull (Larus glaucescens). Comparing current to historical records revealed 18 extirpations of native plant species (32 % of species historically present), 31 exotic species introductions, and one case of exotic introduction followed by extirpation. Contemporary surveys indicated that native species cover declined dramatically from 1986 to 2006, coincident with the extirpation of ‘old-growth’ conifers. Because vegetation change co-occurred with an increasing gull population locally and regionally, we tested several predictions from {{the hypothesis that the}} presence and activities of seabirds help to explain those changes. Specifically, we predicted that on Mandarte and nearby islands with gull colonies, we should observe higher nutrient loading and exotic plant species richness and cover than on nearby islands without gull colonies, as a consequence of competitive dominance in species adapted to high soil nitrogen and trampling. As predicted, we found that native plant species cover and richness were lower, and exotic species cover and richness higher, on islands with versus without gull colonies. In addition, we found that soil carbon and nitrogen on islands with nesting gulls were positively related to soil depth and exotic species richness and cover across plots and islands. Our results support earlier suggestions that nesting seabirds can drive rapid change in insular plant communities by increasing nutrients and <b>disturbing</b> <b>vegetation,</b> and that human activities that affect seabird abundance may therefore indirectly affect plant community composition on islands with seabird colonies...|$|R

40|$|A {{vegetation}} {{survey of}} the Witbank Nature Reserve, comprising 847 hectares, was conducted. Phytosociological data were used to identify plant communities, {{as well as to}} determine alpha and beta diversities. Eleven plant communities were recognised, two of these are subdivided into sub- communities, resulting in 14 vegetation units. These communities represent four main vegetation types, namely grassland, woodland, wetland and <b>disturbed</b> <b>vegetation.</b> Grassland communities have the highest plant diversity and wetland vegetation the lowest. Floristic composition indicates that the vegetation of the Rocky Highveld Grassland has affinities to the grassland and savanna biomes and also to the Afromontane vegetation of the Great Escarpment. An ordination scatter diagram shows the distribution of the 14 plant communities or sub-communities along a soil moisture gradient, as well as along a soil depth/surface rock gradient. The sequence of communities along the soil moisture gradient is used for calculating beta-diversity indices. It is concluded that the relatively small size of the Witbank Nature Reserve is unlikely to have significant negative effects on the phytodiversity of the various plant communities. This nature reserve is therefore of considerable importance in conserving a representative sample of the Rocky Highveld Grassland...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT While the {{dependence}} of Mbuti hunter-gatherers on the forest is relatively well documented, {{it has not been}} made clear how their activities and habitation influence the forest environment in which they live. The analysis of distribution of food plants and human induced secondary forests in the Ituri Forest of Congo suggests that the forest as a hunter-gatherer habitat may have been improved by the interaction of Mbuti hunters, Bantu and other farmers, plants and animals. Most of the major food plants of the Mbuti are light-demanding trees which grow well in secondary and <b>disturbed</b> <b>vegetation</b> regenerated from abandoned campsites and fields. The food plants also germinate from the discarded food thrown around the campsite. Moreover, large quantities of minerals and organic matters are concentrated to the camp as food and fuels, which, after the consumption, are accumulated also around the campsite in the forms of ashes and human body wastes, thus enriching the soil nutrients {{in the vicinity of the}} camp. The Mbuti activities and habitation thus comprise a part of a large recycling system of the forest ecosystem. The implications of such positive human impacts on the forest environment for conservation and development issues are discussed...|$|E
