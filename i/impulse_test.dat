SETTING: Tertiary academic center. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred neuro-otologically healthy individuals (age range, 19 - 80 years) and 15 patients with bilateral (n = 5) or unilateral (n = 10) peripheral vestibular loss (age range, 27 - 72 years). INTERVENTIONS: Testing of static visual acuity (SVA), DVA during active and passive horizontal head rotations (optotype presentation at head velocities > 100 degrees/s and > 150 degrees/s), and quantitative horizontal head <b>impulse</b> <b>testing</b> with scleral search coils. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference between SVA and DVA, that is, visual acuity loss (VA loss), gain of the high-acceleration vestibulo-ocular reflex. RESULTS: Passive head impulses and higher velocities were more effective than active impulses and lower velocities. Using passive head impulses and velocities higher than 150 degrees/s, the DVA test discriminated significantly (P <. 001) among patients with bilateral vestibulopathy, those with unilateral vestibulopathy, and normal individuals. The DVA test sensitivity was 100 %, specificity was 94 %, and accuracy was 95 %, with search-coil head <b>impulse</b> <b>testing</b> used as a reference. In healthy individuals, VA loss increased significantly with age (P <. 001; R(2) = 0. 04).

40|$|In 1988, we {{introduced}} impulsive testing of semicircular canal (SCC) function measured with scleral search coils {{and showed that}} it could accurately and reliably detect impaired function even of a single lateral canal. Later we showed that it was also possible to test individual vertical canal function in peripheral and also in central vestibular disorders and proposed a physiological mechanism for why this might be so. For the next 20 [*]years, between 1988 and 2008, impulsive testing of individual SCC function could only be accurately done by a few aficionados with {{the time and money}} to support scleral search-coil systems-an expensive, complicated and cumbersome, semi-invasive technique that never made the transition from the research lab to the dizzy clinic. Then, in 2009 and 2013, {{we introduced}} a video method of testing function of each of the six canals individually. Since 2009, the method has been taken up by most dizzy clinics around the world, with now close to 100 refereed articles in PubMed. In many dizzy clinics around the world, video Head <b>Impulse</b> <b>Testing</b> has supplanted caloric testing as the initial and in some cases the final test of choice in patients with suspected vestibular disorders. Here, we consider seven current, interesting, and controversial aspects of video Head Impulse Testing: (1) introduction to the test; (2) the progress from the head impulse protocol (HIMPs) to the new variant-suppression head impulse protocol (SHIMPs); (3) the physiological basis for head impulse testing; (4) practical aspects and potential pitfalls of video head impulse testing; (5) problems of vestibulo-ocular reflex gain calculations; (6) head <b>impulse</b> <b>testing</b> in central vestibular disorders; and (7) to stay right up-to-date-new clinical disease patterns emerging from video head <b>impulse</b> <b>testing.</b> With thanks and appreciation we dedicate this article to our friend, colleague, and mentor, Dr Bernard Cohen of Mount Sinai Medical School, New York, who since his first article 55 [*]years ago on compensatory eye movements induced by vertical SCC stimulation {{has become one of the}} giants of the vestibular world...|$|R

Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Patients: Seventy patients affected by unilateral definite MD (16 in Group 1 and 54 in Group 2) observed between March 2014 and May 2015 in a tertiary referral center were retrospectively studied and then divided into two groups: Group 1 was previously treated with intratympanic gentamicin, whereas Group 2 underwent only a conservative therapy. Instrumental tests included audiometry, caloric test, and Video Head <b>Impulse</b> <b>Test.</b> All the findings were statistically analyzed; significance was set at p= 0. 005. Intervention: Diagnostic. Main Outcomes Measures: If MD is treated conservatively the high-frequency vestibulo-oculomotor reflex gain determined with Video Head <b>Impulse</b> <b>Test</b> is normal; it is pathological if MD is treated with gentamicin. Results: High-frequency vestibulo-oculomotor reflex gain showed a statistically significant reduction in Group 1; at the same time, it showed no correlation in both groups with hearing loss, duration of disease or canal paresis. Conclusion: High-frequency vestibulo-oculomotor reflex is naturally preserved even in late stage MD if the patient has been treated conservatively; the dissociation between Caloric Test and Video Head <b>Impulse</b> <b>Test</b> findings could be considered an instrumental hallmark of MD. Gentamicin significantly reduces high-frequency vestibulo-oculomotor reflex gain: This reduction can {{be taken into account}} when determining the effectiveness of an ablative treatment...|$|E
