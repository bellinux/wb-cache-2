25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{the local}} {{governors}} had been replaced by Ottoman officials who discontinued the local relationships their predecessors had cultivated. Under the new governors, the exploitation of the local population by Janissaries, timariots (fief holders) and subashis continued unabated. The governors could not bring order to the Jerusalem Sanjak, with the main roads from Jerusalem to Jaffa and from Nablus to Hebron facing frequent assaults by Bedouin tribesmen and instability remaining rampant in the countryside and major towns such as Hebron. Many peasants left their villages to avoid heavy taxation by the governors or exploitation by junior officials. The dignitaries of Jerusalem often served as mediators of disputes in the district in place of government officials. The dignitaries' loss of privileges previously enjoyed under the local governors brought them closer with the lower, dispossessed classes due to their shared frustrations with the changing order. Moreover, acts by the Janissaries, namely the desecration of mosques and religious sites, including the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> (<b>Temple</b> <b>Mount)</b> in Jerusalem, further incensed the population.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> {{referred}} to in Arabic as al-Haram al-Sharif, had become emblematic of the Palestinian struggle against Zionist forces before {{the creation of the}} State of Israel in 1948. In the following two decades the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> as the last vestige of Arab sovereignty in historic Palestine, was heralded as a national symbol of Palestinians. Though venerated as a sacred space for centuries, the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> was elevated in significance during the twentieth century, becoming central to Palestinian nationalist thought. This evolution was catalyzed by two Muslim councils responsible for administering the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> as a religious sacred space: the Palestinian Supreme Muslim Council from 1921 - 1948, and the Jordanian Supreme Awqaf Council from 1951 - 1967...|$|R

5000|$|According {{to several}} Muslim scholars, {{including}} Mujir ad-Din, al-Suyuti, and al-Muqaddasi, the mosque was reconstructed and expanded by the caliph Abd al-Malik in 690 {{along with the}} Dome of the Rock.

In planning his magnificent project on the TempleMount, which in effect would turn the entire complex into the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> ("the Noble Sanctuary"), Abd al-Malik wanted to replace the slipshod structure described by Arculf with a more sheltered structure enclosing the qibla ("direction"), a necessary element in his grand scheme.

50|$|In his 1999 book The Temples that Jerusalem Forgot, Martin {{argued that}} the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> is not the {{location}} of the last Temple.

25|$|As {{an example}} of this process, an archaeological tunnel running the length of the western side of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> as it is known to Jews, or the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif,</b> as it is known to Muslims, became a serious point of contestation in 1996. The tunnel had been in place for about a dozen years, but open {{conflict}} broke out after the government of Benjamin Netanyahu decided to open a new entrance to the tunnel from the Via Dolorosa in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Palestinians and the Islamic Waqf authorities were outraged that the decision was taken without prior consultation. They claimed that the work threatened the foundations of the compound and those of houses in the Muslim quarter and that it was actually aimed at tunnelling under the holy compound complex to find remains of Solomon's Temple, similar to previous accusations in the 1980s. As a result of the rumor, Arabs rioted in Jerusalem and then spread to the West Bank, leading to the deaths of 86 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers.|$|R
50|$|The Palestinian National Authority views East Jerusalem as {{occupied}} territory {{according to}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.

2500|$|Israel {{proposed}} that the Palestinians be granted [...] "custodianship," [...] though not sovereignty, on the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> (<b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif),</b> with Israel retaining control over the Western Wall, a remnant of the ancient wall that surrounded the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount,</b> the most sacred site in Judaism outside of the <b>Temple</b> <b>Mount</b> itself. Israeli negotiators also {{proposed that}} the Palestinians be granted administration of, but not sovereignty over, the Muslim and Christian Quarters of the Old City, with the Jewish and Armenian Quarters remaining in Israeli hands. Palestinians would be granted administrative control over all Islamic and Christian holy sites, and {{would be allowed to}} raise the Palestinian flag over them. A passage linking northern Jerusalem to Islamic and Christian holy sites would be annexed by the Palestinian state. The Israeli team proposed annexing to Israeli Jerusalem settlements within the West Bank beyond the Green Line, such as Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Ze'ev, and Gush Etzion. Israel {{proposed that the}} Palestinians merge certain outer Arab villages and small cities that had been annexed to Jerusalem just after 1967 (such as Abu Dis, al-Eizariya, 'Anata, A-Ram, and eastern Sawahre) to create the city of Al-Quds, which would serve as the capital of Palestine. The historically important Arab neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and at-Tur would remain under Israeli sovereignty, while Palestinians would only have civilian autonomy. The Palestinians would exercise civil and administrative autonomy in the outer Arab neighborhoods. Israeli neighborhoods within East Jerusalem would remain under Israeli sovereignty. The holy places in the Old City would enjoy independent religious administration. In total, Israel demanded that Palestine's territory in East Jerusalem be reduced to eight sections including six small enclaves according to Palestine's delegation to the summit.|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} {{source of}} conflict is the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif.</b> While East Jerusalem is under Israeli control, {{the site is}} administered by the Islamic Waqf, a Jordanian religious trust with ties to the PA.

Waqf officials claim the exclusive right to approve visitation by non-Muslims, while per policy the Israeli Government opposes worship by non-Muslims.|$|R
500|$|It {{is evident}} from the copy of the record of the {{deliberations}} of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the <b>Haram</b> <b>al-Sharif</b> and also the spot where al-Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of Abu Madyan, may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ...
