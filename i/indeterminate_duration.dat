This study aimed to determine the impact of occlusion duration on the success and outcomes of contemporary PCI on chronic total occlusion (CTO). MethodsThe authors analyzed a retrospective cohort of consecutive patients submitted to PCI in CTO, who were compared according to the confirmed occlusion duration (COD) < 12 months, ≥ 12 months, or <b>indeterminate</b> occlusion <b>duration</b> (IOD). ResultsA total of 168 patients were treated, 122 (72. 6 %) with COD (80 < 12 months, 42 ≥ 12 months) and 46 (24. 7 %) with an IOD. Lesion extension was 17. 0 ± 13. 6 mm, in 2. 90 ± 0. 58 mm vessels, and the anterograde approach was used in 98. 8 % of cases. Angiographic success was attained in 79. 2 % of patients (80. 0 % vs. 73. 8 % vs. 82. 6 %; p = 0. 73). The main cause of failure was the inability to cross the lesion with the guidewire (68. 6 %). Occlusion duration had no impact on in-hospital events (4. 8 % vs. 7. 1 % vs. 6. 0 %; p = 0. 73), which were almost entirely explained by periprocedural myocardial infarction, or on late outcomes (18. 8 % vs. 7. 1 % vs. 15. 3 %; p = 0. 23). At the multivariate analysis, lesion length ≥ 20 mm (odds ratio - OR = 7. 27; 95 % confidence interval - 95 % IC 1. 94 - 29. 1; p = 0. 003), calcification (OR = 4. 72; 95 % CI 1. 19 - 19. 1; p = 0. 02), and tortuosity of the occluded segment (OR = 15. 98; 95 % CI 2. 18 - 144. 7; p = 0. 007) were predictors of failure.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are limited}} data on factors {{predicting}} response to azathioprine and uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The notes of patients attending the Oxford IBD clinic from 1968 to 1999 were reviewed. Remission {{was defined as}} no need for oral steroids {{for at least three}} months and relapse was defined as active disease requiring steroids. RESULTS: A total of 622 of 2205 patients were treated with azathioprine (272 Crohn's disease, 346 ulcerative colitis, and four <b>indeterminate</b> colitis). Mean <b>duration</b> of the initial course of treatment was 634 days. The overall remission rates were 45 % for Crohn's disease and 58 % for ulcerative colitis. For the 424 patients who received more than six months of treatment, remission rates were 64 % and 87 %, respectively. Factors favouring remission were ulcerative colitis (p= 0. 0001), lower white blood cell (WBC) or neutrophil count (p= 0. 0001), higher mean cell volume (p= 0. 0001), and older age (p= 0. 05). For Crohn's disease, colonic disease favoured remission (p= 0. 03). Factors that were not significant were age, sex, lymphocyte count, and dose (mg/kg). The proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0. 95, 0. 69, and 0. 55, respectively. The chance of remaining in remission was higher if WBC was less than 5 x 10 (9) (p= 0. 03) and in male patients (p= 0. 01; Crohn's disease only). There was no difference in relapse rates between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. After stopping azathioprine, the proportion of patients remaining in remission at one, three, and five years was 0. 63, 0. 44, and 0. 35 (222 patients). Duration of azathioprine treatment did not affect the relapse rate after stopping treatment (p= 0. 68). CONCLUSIONS: Azathioprine is effective treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The efficacy of azathioprine is reasonably well sustained over five years...|$|R
40|$|Background. During {{the past}} decade. the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) {{has emerged as}} the primary {{therapeutic}} option for survivors of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Investigation of the clinical efficacy of these devices has primarily assessed outcome in adults with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this cooperative, international study was to evaluate the impact of ICDs on the pediatric population of SCD survivors, based on an analysis of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of young patients who underwent ICD implantation following an episode of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or resuscitation from SCD. Methods and Results. An initial data base, established by contacting the manufacturers of the various commercially and investigationally available devices, identified 177 patients who were less than 20 years of age at the time of initial implantation of an ICD. With this data base as a reference, detailed responses were subsequently obtained from physicians involved in the care of 125 (71 %) of these patients. The patients ranged in age from 1. 9 to 19. 9 years (mean, 14. 5 +/- 4 years) and weighed 9. 7 - 117 kg (mean, 44. 6 +/- 14 kg). Of the 125 patients, 76 % were survivors of SCD, 10 % had drug refractory ventricular tachycardia, and 10 % had syncope with heart disease and inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The most common types of associated cardiovascular disease were hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies (54 %), primary electrical diseases (26 %), and congenital heart defects (18 %). Ventricular function was abnormal in 46 % of the patients. During a mean follow-up of 31 +/- 23 months, at least one ICD discharge occurred in 85 of the 125 (68 %) patients. Seventy-three patients (59 %) received at least one appropriate ICD discharge, and 25 patients (20 %) had one or more spurious or <b>indeterminate</b> discharges. <b>Duration</b> of follow-up > 24 months (p= 0. 001) and inducibility of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia (p= 0. 05) were correlated with appropriate ICD discharges. There were nine deaths during the study period: five sudden, two due to recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, and two related to congestive heart failure. Abnormal ventricular function (p= 0. 002) and prior ICD discharge (p= 0. 01) were univariate correlates of patient mortality; by multivariate logistic regression, abnormal ventricular function was the only significant correlate of death (p= 0. 005). By actuarial analysis, the estimated overall post-ICD implant survival rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 95 %, 93 %, and 85 %, respectively. The corresponding sudden death-free survival rates were 97 %, 95 %, and 90 %. Conclusions. Pediatric patients resuscitated from SCD appear to remain at risk for recurrence of life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. During a mean follow-up of 31 months, the ICD provided an effective therapy for such arrhythmias in the majority of patients in this study. Following ICD implant, impaired ventricular function was the primary factor correlated with mortality. The patterns or ICD discharge observed in young patients and. thus, inferred risk of recurrent life threatening arrhythmias {{are similar to those of}} adult survivors of SCD. Thus, the use of ICDs in pediatric patients, with implant selection criteria similar to adults. appear valid...|$|R

Enzyme immunoassays [(EIA) Murex and Gold ELISA] were employed for human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 screening; Western blotting (WB), INNO-LIA (LIA), real-time PCR pol (qPCR), and nested-PCR-RFLP (tax) were used to confirm infection. Samples were considered human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 positive when there was reactivity using {{at least one of the}} four confirmatory assays. By serological screening, 127 / 2991 samples were positive or borderline, and human T lymphotropic virus infection was confirmed in 108 samples (three EIA-borderline) : 56 human T lymphotropic virus type 1 [G 1 (27)  + G 2 (29) ]; 45 human T lymphotropic virus type 2 [G 1 (21)  + G 2 (24) ]; one human T lymphotropic virus type 1  + human T lymphotropic virus type 2 (G 2); six human T lymphotropic virus [G 1 (2)  + G 2 (4) ]. Although there were differences in group characteristics, human T lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 prevalence was similar [3. 1 % (G 1) and 4. 2 % (G 2), p =  0. 113]. The overall sensitivities of LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP were 97. 2 %, 82. 4 %, 68. 9 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively, with some differences among groups, likely due to the stage of human T lymphotropic virus infection and/or HAART <b>duration.</b> <b>Indeterminate</b> immunoblotting results were detected in G 2, possibly due to the seroconversion period. Negative results in molecular assays could be explained by the use of HAART, the occurrence of defective provirus and/or the low circulating proviral load.

40|$|Purpose - To {{undertake}} {{an analysis}} of the implications of potential Scottish independence for inward foreign direct investment (FDI), multinational enterprise strategies, and the local economy. Design/methodology/approach - Takes a multidisciplinary approach drawing upon literature and evidence in the international business and management, political economy, and economic geography fields to analyze the role and impact of inward FDI in Scotland following possible Scottish independence. Findings - Scotland continues as an attractive location for FDI, with greater diversity than hitherto. While the country’s comparative advantages in immobile natural resources provide some protection from uncertainty, weak embeddedness is a risk factor irrespective of independence. A range of transition costs of independence are identified, which could be high and of <b>indeterminate</b> <b>duration,</b> and some will be sector-specific.

40|$|En abordant les {{relations}} industrielles d'un point de vue international, l'auteur traite d'abord de problèmes ayant trait aux relations professionnelles {{dans le cadre de}} l'entreprise et s'appuie ensuite sur l'expérience des pays industrialisés et plus spécifiquement des pays européens telle qu'elle ressort notamment de la deuxième session de la Conférence régionale européenne de VOIT. In view of {{the wide}} differences between industrial relations of the various countries of the world as well as between the political, economical and sociocultural factors which influence them, it might be thought {{that it is impossible to}} discern general trends from a comparative examination of industrial relations' phenomena and institutions. This negative reaction, while perfectly correct in many respects, would not however correspond to the whole truth. Almost no country today lives in isolation. Ideas have no frontiers, in so far, of course, that there is freedom of expression. The tripartite meetings convened by the ILO offer a unique opportunity of discovering common problems and trends and their conclusions, especially when they take the form of Conventions and Recommendations, represent an international consensus on important problems of social policy. Trends analysed in this article refer only to labour - management relations at the level of the undertaking and are mainly based on the experience of industrialised countries. THE EVOLUTION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF LABOUR-MANAGEMENTRELATIONS AT THE LEVEL OF THE UNDERTAKINGSince the Second World War, three main trends have characterised this evolution. A first trend, under employers' influence, has placed the emphasis on the improvement of the social climate by stressing the common objectives which should be shared by all the members of an undertaking, and by seeking ways and means of enlisting the maximum contribution from each towards the common end. This search has been facilitated by advances in social sciences (studies on the motivations of the man at work) and in techniques of management (delegation of authority, management by objectives, etc [...] ) A second trend, essentially of a political nature, encompasses the developments which have changed the basic structure of the undertaking (nationalisations and various forms of workers' participation in the managerial bodies of public or private undertakings). The third trend consists of all the measures which, mainly under trade union influence, are concerned with regulating the behaviour of managements (by law, collective agreements or as result of day-to-day trade union action) in such a way as to curtail their freedom of action by means of a whole series of procedures and institutions. These regulations have resulted in nothing less than a Bill of Rights for workers, which has gradually been evolved to safeguard them in their dealings with their employers. THE CONTEMPORARY TRENDSTowards greater security. In a world which is rapidly changing it is not surprising that the aspiration for security should have become prominent in the industrial relations field. Thus an aspiration towards greater employment and income security is to be noted in most countries. The principle that a worker should not be arbitrarily deprived of his employment has been firmly recognised at the international level, when, in 1963, the International Labour Conference adopted the Recommendation (No. 119) on Termination of Employment, which states that « termination of employment should not take place unless there is a valid reason for such termination ». This is a very important change in comparison with the old philosophy according to which, when a worker has been recruited by an employer under a contract of <b>indeterminate</b> <b>duration,</b> this contract may be rescinded at the will of either party provided a certain period of notice is given. While the recognition of the principle of the justification of termination of employment is essential to ensure the dignity of the worker in the employment relationship, there is nothing demagogic in it. The « valid reason » which may justify termination of employment, may be « based on the operational requirements of the undertaking, establishment or service ». Management therefore remains free to manage according to the best interest of the undertaking. As it is increasingly recognised that technical progress and economic growth need a greater mobility of workers than in the past, security is not therefore synonymous of stability. Certain jobs become reduntant or obsolete. A particular job cannot therefore be protected at all costs. In such situations the trend towards greater security will focus on the protection of the workers' income and on the measures to be taken to facilities his reemployment. While reduction of workforce may be justified as a factor of economic progress, the workers affected by such reductions cannot be left on their own. If society is to benefit from economic progress, it has also to support the social cost of such progress. This is the new principle of social justice which is now gaining acceptance. Towards greater participation. In 1966 the International Labour Conference adopted a Resolution noting that in various countries with different economic and social structures, efforts and experiments are being made to enable workers to participate in the decisions taken in their undertakings and requesting studies by the ILO on this subject. These studies, as well as various meetings organised by the ILO, have shown that while there cannot be an internationally agreed definition of the concept of « participation », workers are anxious to obtain a greater influence on the marking of the decisions which concern them, through methods as different as collective bargaining, joint consultation and communications, or workers' representation in the managerial boards. The concept of participation is likely to dominate the evolution of industrial relations in the next thirty years because the worker of today has new aspirations which are not satisfied by the present industrial organisation. He refuses to be manipulated like a tool or buffeted by forces or decisions over which he has no influence. Towards greater accountability.

The partners to collective bargaining will have more and more to be in a position to justify their behaviour in the light of the public interest. The need for training and education. The complexity and interdependance of problems raised by technological developments and the evolution of economic and social relations call for a tremendous increase in training and education, not only from a technical point of view but also with regard to economic and social knowledge. The International Labour Conference will consider next June the drafts of a convention and a recommendation on educational leave for workers and the Governing Body of the ILO has emphasised the social responsibility of managers as one of the key elements of the future activities of the ILO Management Development Programme.
