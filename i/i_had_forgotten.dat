It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|Spacey {{summed up}} Underwood's {{relationship}} with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall - as being {{like that of a}} [...] "best friend" [...] and [...] "the person [...] more than anyone." [...] Because of this, his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises. In the season 2 premiere, after having gone the whole episode without doing so, Underwood addresses the viewer directly, saying, [...] "Did you think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> you? Perhaps you hoped I had." [...] In addition, in season 3, after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him, a seething Frank vents his anger by lashing out at the viewer; looking directly into the camera, he snaps [...] "What're you lookin' at?!" ...|$|E

500|$|Three {{million copies}} of And the Mountains Echoed were sold within five months of its publication. In general, the novel was {{received}} well, with Los Angeles Times critic Wendy Smith finding it [...] "painfully sad but also radiant with love". Fran Hawthorne of The National described the book as [...] "masterful storytelling" [...] and a [...] "haunting portrayal of war-ravaged Afghanistan and insight {{into the life of}} Afghan expatriates". Susan Balee from Philly.com wrote that it [...] " [...] at the personal level the history of his war-torn homeland: Fierce loyalties alternate with bloody betrayals". The Guardian's Philip Hensher gave a more mediocre review and said, [...] "I enjoyed this novel in a very undemanding sort of way. The shifts of viewpoint would be ambitious if the novel had any interest in varieties of psychology. But it serves its purpose in providing amusement {{for two and a half}} hours; a day after finishing it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> everything about it." ...|$|E

We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right {{in the middle of my}} story Carpenter looked at me and said, [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{a family}} meeting took place {{to talk about}} the boy's future: None of his sisters-in-law was ready to finance his studies. As for his brothers, they {{considered}} him unsuccessful and considered to find him a job as a farmer or grocer's apprentice. Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: [...] "As for [...] "si" [...] Mahmoud, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> {{to tell you that the}} year I passed my certificat d'études primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de seconde. I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and my fear was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the cleaning woman rushed to the window and cried for help. I was severely traumatized and I still wonder today how such a scandalous treatment has not finally overcame my intelligence and thirst for knowledge [...] He had indeed redeemed himself".|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>forgotten</b> my high school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
