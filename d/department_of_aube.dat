40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to study}} prescription-drug use in {{pregnant}} women in the <b>department</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Aube.</b> Method: We used the data-base of the general scheme of French health insurance (régime général de l’assurance maladie) {{in order to obtain}} all reimbursed drug prescriptions for March 2000. Results: The incidence of prescription-drug use in this cohort of women was 81. 78 per 100 persons month. Among the 1, 313 pregnant women who were reimbursed for at least one medication, 1. 7 % took a prescription drug which was absolutely contra-indicated during pregnancy and 3. 9 % received one which was relatively contra-indicated during pregnancy. More than half of these cases involved topical prescription drugs. The most frequently prescribed contra-indicated drugs were non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (absolutely contra-indicated) and aminosides (relatively contra-indicated). Conclusion: The authors insist on the potential danger of topical drug use in pregnant women, a fact which is undoubtedly ignored by patients and possibly by druggists and prescribing physicians as well...|$|R

40|$|Where was the Shroud located {{during the}} first quarter of the fifteenth century? In 1415 all France was in turmoil {{following}} English king Henry V's victory at Agincourt. Directly as a result of that battle Marguerite de Charny, who had inherited the Shroud from her father Geoffroi II de Charny on his death in 1398, lost her young husband, Jean de Bauffremont, and his father Burgundian chamberlain Philibert de Bauffremont, both of them killed in the fray. As young widows often did at that time, Marguerite quickly remarried, in her case to nobleman Humbert de Villersexel, whose territories were to the east, bordering Savoy. And because Marguerite's seigneurie of Lirey was in great danger from roving bands of English marauders, she and her husband decided that the Shroud should be removed to a safer location. From a document preserved in the Archives <b>of</b> France's <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Aube,</b> we seem to know where Marguerite and Humbert chose for that safer location. The document in question, dated 6 July 1418, is a receipt for the Shroud that Humbert drew up for Lirey's community of canons, and it is worded: Hombart, comte de la Roche, seigneur de Velar-Cessey et de Lirey, scavoir faisons a tous que, pour la guerre qui a present est, et pour la doubte des gens de ma...|$|R

50|$|Perier {{entered the}} Chamber of Deputies for Paris in 1817, taking {{his seat in}} the Left Centre with the {{moderate}} opposition, and making his first speech {{in defense of the}} freedom of the press. Re-elected for Paris in 1822 and 1824, and in 1827 for Paris and for Troyes, he elected to represent Troyes (<b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aube),</b> and sat for that constituency until his death. Perier's violence in debate was not associated with any disloyalty to the Bourbon Restoration, and he held resolutely aloof from the Republican conspiracies and intrigues which prepared the way for the revolution of 1830. Under the Martignac ministry, there was some prospect of a reconciliation with the court, and, in January 1829, he was nominated a candidate for the presidency of the chamber; but in August with the elevation to power of Jules, Prince de Polignac, the truce ceased, and on 15 March 1830, Perier was one of the 221 deputies who repudiated the Ordinances put forward by Charles X.|$|E

In 1894 he founded the Comité Dupleix, a pro-colonialist organization. In 1898 Bonvalot launched an expedition to cross Ethiopia and join the Marchand expedition at Fashoda. But Bonvalot failed to obtain the cooperation of the Ethiopian emperor, Menilek II, and quit the expedition before they reached Sudan.In 1898 Bonvalot founded the journal La France de demain and remained the editor until 1904. He served as a deputy from Paris in the Parliament of France from 1902 to 1906.

5000|$|Casimir Perier’s {{policy as}} a banker was to spread his capital {{investment}} {{over a wide}} range of characteristic early nineteenth century business enterprise. He engaged as well in almost continuous investment in land and real estate, calculated most recently at about 15% of his total investments during 1815-30. Most notable were his purchases of highly valued properties on the rue Neuve du Luxembourg, the rue Sainte-Honoré and the Champs-Elysées; a summer residence in the Bois de Boulogne; the Château Saint-Pierre (‘le Taillis’) in Normandy, near Rouen; and the parkland and ruins of the Château Pont-sur-Seine (<b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aube),</b> a property owned previously by Napoleon that was destroyed by invading armies in 1814. Casimir’s largest investment in Paris real estate during the Restoration was made in 1829-30 when he agreed to pay 744,600 francs for properties on the rue Saint-Honoré owned by Francis Egerton, Duke of Bridgewater. By the time of the Revolution of 1830, Casimir Perier was one of the richest men in Paris. At the age of 55 in 1832, when he died of cholera, his estate was estimated at close to 14 million francs.|$|E
