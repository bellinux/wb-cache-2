5|$|Back at the office, {{the staff}} have drunk {{multiple}} cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush {{along with a}} powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly irritable and argumentative, frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath, and try to relocate the copy machine. At <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are bewildered by the sight they encounter.|$|E
5|$|Their debut album, It's <b>Five</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Somewhere, was {{released}} in 1995. For the supporting tour, Slash enlisted James LoMenzo and Brian Tichy, of Pride and Glory, in place of Inez and Sorum who had other commitments. They played shows in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia before Geffen Records pulled their financial support for the tour, with Slash returning to Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit disbanding.|$|E
5|$|Becoming a Peking opera {{performer}} {{requires a}} long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked {{at a young age}} by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.|$|E
60|$|We {{set to work}} {{to pack up and}} {{get ready}} for moving, but the {{afternoon}} passed away without bringing old John. Between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> along came his oldest boy, with a bucket of water.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, she {{was offered}} a {{position}} at Sky News and co-anchored {{some of the main}} news programmes including the morning show, Sunrise, as well as Live at <b>Five,</b> the nine <b>o’clock</b> news, Sky News at Ten.|$|R
60|$|The sleigh {{driver said}} that if they made good time during the {{afternoon}} they would reach the village of Bojowak by <b>five</b> or six <b>o'clock.</b> Here he was certain they would hear further of the exploring party.|$|R
25|$|The accuser {{also changed}} her {{description}} of Evans. She previously claimed {{that she was}} attacked by a man that looked like Evans except with a mustache, but later stated that the assailant just had a <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> shadow.|$|E
25|$|An express {{message was}} sent from Oxford to Sir William Ogle, instructing him to co-operate with Gage, by {{entering}} Basing Park {{at the rear}} of the Parliamentarian quarters between four and <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> on the morning of Wednesday, 11 September.|$|E
25|$|It {{was noted}} {{as a very}} {{controversial}} incident due to the carer, Emma Bulbrooke, telling Marion's daughter {{to go to her}} mother's house and ‘do the best she could’ because the Southern Health office was closing at <b>five</b> <b>o’clock.</b>|$|E
60|$|During the {{afternoon}} the rum-laden schooner Mathilde was taken, after a lively chase, by the torpedo-boat Porter. Between <b>five</b> and six <b>o’clock</b> {{in the evening}} the torpedo-boat Foote, Lieut. W. L. Rodgers commanding, received the first Spanish fire.|$|R
60|$|With {{all these}} stoppages, it was between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> {{and we were}} yet a few miles short of Saint Albans {{when he came out}} of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea.|$|R
60|$|Sir Percy owned {{considerable}} {{property in}} the North, certainly, and he had often before gone there alone and stayed away {{a week at a}} time; but it seemed so very strange that circumstances should have arisen between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> in the morning that compelled him to start in this extreme hurry.|$|R
25|$|Shade: shade is an {{art form}} that {{developed}} from Reading. Rather than the aim to insult, someone works with the medium of backhanded compliments. An example is to suggest that someone's beautiful dress makes people almost forget {{that she has a}} <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> shadow.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{occurred in}} October 2002, and involved a {{cast and crew}} of about 30 individuals. The shoot occurred without any major incidents. None of the main cast, {{all of whom were}} heterosexual, had any problems with portraying gay characters, or engaging in same-sex kissing or sex-play. Actor Dylan Fergus ("Eddie") found it difficult to kiss co-star Bryan Kirkwood ("Joey") {{at the end of the}} day due to Kirkwood's <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> shadow, and actor Matt Phillips ("Tobey") fell several times while wearing high-heeled footwear.|$|E
25|$|Zero hour {{arrived at}} <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> {{on the morning}} of 19 June 1938, presumably timed to {{surprise}} the strikers and to minimize the number of onlookers. Colonel Foster enlisted the services of Harold Winch of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, who had acted as a liaison between the unemployed and the police during the 1935 relief camp strike. His task this time was to ensure that the treasures of the gallery went unscathed during the eviction. Along with police tear gas canisters, Winch successfully negotiated the withdrawal of the unemployed.|$|E
60|$|After dinner, nature avenged {{herself in}} the young men for their vigils of the night before, when they had stayed up so late, parting with friends, that they had found {{themselves}} early risers without having been abed. They both slept so long that Dunham, leaving Staniford to a still unfinished nap, came on deck between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{last of the}} ebb on a big tide {{would be}} between <b>five</b> and seven <b>o'clock,</b> {{and it would be}} dark then, night and morning," [...] Whitney remarked. [...] "This means that, supposing there was a {{wireless}} installation, it could be used only at fixed intervals; roughly speaking, it wouldn't be available one week out of two." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{generally}} on Sundays a house dinner, so called, at eight <b>o'clock.</b> <b>Five</b> or six men would sit down, and would always gamble afterwards. On this occasion Dolly Longestaffe sauntered in at about seven in quest of sherry and bitters, and Felix found the opportunity {{a good one}} to speak of his money. 'You couldn't cash your I.O.U.'s for me to-morrow;--could you?' ...|$|R
25|$|After 1926, Grossmith stopped producing, but he {{continued}} to perform, playing King Christian in Albert Szirmai's Princess Charming (1926) for producer Robert Courtneidge in New York, and Britain in The <b>Five</b> <b>o'Clock</b> Girl and Lady Mary (1928). In New York in 1930, and later in London (where it flopped), he starred in Ralph Benatzky's My Sister and I (aka Meet My Sister). He also appeared in at least ten films for London Film Productions Ltd. in the 1930s. In 1930, he appeared in a 20th Century Fox film, Are You There?.|$|E
25|$|Only 20 {{minutes after}} escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in Crowthorne and {{approached}} Mrs. Doris Spencer, {{who was in}} her garden. He asked her for a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor {{and the likelihood of}} escapes. After 10 minutes, he left. An hour and a half later, he reached Farley Hill, and at about <b>five</b> <b>o'clock,</b> Straffen came to the point where 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Within half an hour, Bowyer was dead.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two long}} morning classes {{with a short}} break in between them for {{students}} {{to get to their}} next class. After lunch, classes resume at 1pm, and there is a break around afternoon teatime before another class period. The classes are about one hour in length, with occasional double periods lasting two hours. Classes end around <b>five</b> <b>o'clock.</b> First-year students get Friday afternoons off, while sixth- and seventh-year students have several free periods during the week. In the evening, students eat their dinner in the Great Hall, after which they are expected to be in their common rooms. Astronomy classes take place late at night in the Astronomy Tower.|$|E
60|$|It {{is somewhere}} about <b>five</b> or six <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon, and a balmy {{fragrance}} of warm tea hovers in Cook's Court. It hovers about Snagsby's door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one and supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby {{was about to}} descend into the subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door just now and saw the crow who was out late.|$|R
50|$|The {{engagement}} began between about <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> {{when the}} left wing of the British Government army advanced against Lord George Murray's position {{on the south side}} of the river. The position was first shelled by the mortar batteries and then attacked by four platoons of Clayton's regiment and Munro's. After some initial stubborn resistance, Lord George Murray's unsupported men were driven from their position and forced to retreat.|$|R
60|$|The room {{in which}} he had shut himself up, was on the ground floor, {{at the back of the}} house. It was lighted by a dirty skylight, and had a door in the wall, opening into a narrow covered passage or blind-alley, very little frequented after <b>five</b> or six <b>o'clock</b> in the evening, and not in much use as a {{thoroughfare}} at any hour. But it had an outlet in a neighbouring street.|$|R
25|$|Eliot {{arranged}} for a formal separation in February 1933, and thereafter shunned her entirely, hiding from her and instructing his friends– including members of the Bloomsbury Group and the publisher Faber & Faber, {{where he was a}} director– not to tell her where he was. Her brother had her committed to an asylum in 1938, after she was found wandering the streets of London at <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, apparently asking whether Eliot had been beheaded. Apart from one escape attempt, she remained there until she died nine years later at the age of 58; she was said to have suffered a heart attack, although there is a suspicion that she took an overdose. Eliot won the Nobel Prize for Literature the following year.|$|E
25|$|England made six {{changes and}} one of the newcomers, Harold Rhodes, took wickets with his fourth and twelfth balls in Test cricket to reduce India to 23 for four, with new wicketkeeper Roy Swetman taking three catches. Later Indian batsmen did better, but no one reached 30 on a bland wicket. England's new opening pair of Gilbert Parkhouse and Geoff Pullar put on 146 for the first wicket, and then Cowdrey and Barrington put on 193 for the fourth wicket, Cowdrey going on to make 160. After early wickets for Moss and Trueman, India rallied with a {{partnership}} of 69 between Borde and Umrigar before the off-spin pairing of Brian Close and John Mortimore finished things off by <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> on the third day.|$|E
25|$|An {{employee}} at Kautokeino {{claimed that he}} had observed allied aircraft in the no-fly zone {{on the day of}} the accident, but investigations showed that he was not working in Finnmark in March. Investigations of the logs at Kautokeino and Sørreisa showed no entries regarding any NATO air traffic. Captain Stein Aarbogh, working at Setermoen gunnery range, stated that {{on the day of the}} accident two Harriers were expected, but showed up several hours late, at around <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon. Aarbogh was certain of whom was range officer at the gunnery range on the day of the incident, but the commission could document that the person in question was working at Rygge Air Station on 11 March. Therefore, this incident could not have taken place on the day of the accident.|$|E
5|$|Once there, Achebe was double-promoted in {{his first}} year, {{completing}} the first two years' studies in one, and spending only four years in secondary school, instead of the standard five. Achebe was unsuited to the school's sports regimen and belonged instead {{to a group of}} six exceedingly studious pupils. So intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from <b>five</b> to six <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon (though other activities and other books were allowed).|$|R
60|$|I {{went back}} to the doctor to tell him, by Lady Glyde's desire, that she insisted on {{speaking}} to him immediately. He withdrew at once to quiet her ladyship's agitation, and to assure her of the physician's arrival {{in the course of a}} few hours. Those hours passed very slowly. Sir Percival and the Count were together downstairs, and sent up from time to time to make their inquiries. At last, between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock,</b> to our great relief, the physician came.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{from the}} door, which, {{in the first}} {{transport}} of his rage, he had meditated battering upon until Gride's very fears should impel him to open it, he turned his face towards the city, and working his way steadily through the crowd which was pouring from it (it was by this time between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon) {{went straight to the}} house of business of the brothers Cheeryble, and putting his head into the glass case, found Tim Linkinwater alone.|$|R
25|$|In 1994, Slash formed Slash's Snakepit, a {{side project}} that {{featured}} his Guns N' Roses bandmates Matt Sorum and Gilby Clarke on drums and rhythm guitar respectively, {{as well as}} Alice in Chains' Mike Inez on bass and Jellyfish's Eric Dover on vocals. The band recorded Slash's material originally intended for Guns N' Roses, resulting in the release of It's <b>Five</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Somewhere in February 1995. The album was critically praised for ignoring the then-popular conventions of alternative music, and fared well on the charts, eventually selling over one million copies in the US alone despite little promotion from Geffen Records. Slash's Snakepit toured {{in support of the}} album with bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Brian Tichy of Pride and Glory, before disbanding in 1996. Slash then toured for two years with the blues rock cover band Slash's Blues Ball.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that {{it looks as if}} a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since {{returning}} from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by <b>five</b> <b>o'clock.</b> As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E
25|$|Years later, Jamal, now a Chaiwala in an Indian call centre, {{searches}} the centre's database for Salim and Latika. He fails in finding Latika, while succeeding in finding Salim, now a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's crime organisation. Jamal reproaches Salim, who then pleads for forgiveness, and offers {{him to stay}} in his luxurious apartment. Jamal later bluffs his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika but as he professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal nevertheless promises to wait for her every day at <b>five</b> <b>o'clock</b> at the VT station. Latika attempts to meet him there, but is recaptured by Javed's men, led by Salim, and once Javed moves to another house, outside Mumbai, the two again lose contact. Jamal becomes a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, knowing that she watches the show regularly. Much to the consternation of Prem Kumar, the show's host, Jamal becomes a wonder across India. He uses the 50/50 lifeline on the penultimate question and during the following break, whilst in the men's room, Kumar tries to fool Jamal, feeding him with a wrong answer, yet Jamal chooses the other one, which {{turns out to be the}} correct answer.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{hindered}} the smoothness of his journey, {{which seemed}} not half its former length. Though dark, {{it was only}} between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> when the bulky chimneys of Mrs. Hall's residence appeared in view behind the sycamore-tree. On second thoughts he retreated and put up at the ale- house as in former time; {{and when he had}} plumed himself before the inn mirror, called for something to drink, and smoothed out the incipient wrinkles of care, he walked on to the Knap with a quick step.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank Heavens, no!" [...] she answered. [...] "My dear David, {{what are}} you {{thinking}} of? He is not here and he dare not come here. You are to go to your rooms," [...] she added, glancing at the clock, [...] "and between <b>five</b> and six <b>o'clock</b> this evening you will be rung up on the telephone. A rendezvous will be given you for later on to-night. You must take the money there and receive the packet. Von Behrling will be disguised and prepared for flight." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{weather has}} very much changed since we left Ad Abaga. We {{have a strong}} and really cold north-wind blowing all day, and between <b>five</b> and eight <b>o’clock</b> of an evening it is most cutting. At night it drops; and the {{temperature}} is then not so cold as it was either at Senafe or Attegrat. The natives generally are affected with coughs and colds; {{and the amount of}} coughing which goes on at night in the vicinity of our tent is both astonishing and disagreeable.|$|R
