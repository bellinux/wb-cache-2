Philby, in turn, recognising that competition by foreign interests would get a better deal for the Saudi King, made contact with George Martin Lees, Chief Geologist of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in order to alert him to SoCal's interest in gaining oil exploration rights in Saudi Arabia. Anglo Persian was one of five international partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), through which it pursued its interest in the Saudi concession. In March 1933, IPC sent a representative, Stephen Longrigg, to join negotiations with the Saudi government in Jeddah. However, Philby's primary loyalty was to the Saudi King and, although he was being paid by SoCal, he kept the arrangement a secret from Longrigg. In May 1933, IPC instructed Longrigg to withdraw from Jeddah, leaving SoCal free to conclude negotiations with the Saudi Arabia for a 60-year contract to obtain the <b>exclusive</b> <b>concession</b> for exploration and extraction {{of oil in the}} al-Hasa region along the Persian Gulf.|$|E

40|$|In Italy long {{distance}} coach services have long {{played a significant role}} in connecting the most dispersed part of the country to major destinations, giving an important contribution to social and geographical inclusion, but remaining limited in absolute numbers and receiving marginal attention by the general public and even policy makers. After years of stability, the industry is going to face radical changes in the next years since its liberalisation process, gradually started in 2007, was completed at the end of 2013, changing from <b>exclusive</b> <b>concessions</b> to non-exclusive authorisations. In this paper we perform some spatial and scenario analyses, with particular reference to competing transport modes and new potential markets. The industry supplied more than 88 million bus-km in 2012, serving about 2. 6 billion passenger-km. The existing network, providing a particularly extensive service in the South and in the Centre of the country, directly serves 2 / 3 of Italian population. New opportunities are arising as a consequence of liberalisation, changes in competing modes (in particular {{long distance}} railway services) and changes in characteristics of part of the country also as a consequence of more recent internal migration phenomena. Coach services in 2013 are serving only 27, 000 origin-destination, including indirect connection, out of about 115, 000 formally allowed. Many relations, including some very important in terms of total mobility, are still unexplored and left to competing transport modes (rail and air). Our analyses suggest that the most promising relations for possible new services appear to be those among the Centre and the North-East of the country, with a polarisation on urban areas having limited rail services. ...|$|R

40|$|Long {{distance}} coach {{services in}} Italy represent an almost unknown {{mode of transport}} to the general public, often ignored even by policy markers. The industry has been liberalised since 2007, and service regulation is gradually changing from <b>exclusive</b> <b>concessions</b> to non-exclusive authorisations. This paper aims at shedding a light on this sector, underlining its importance, evidencing its specific strengths and weaknesses starting {{from the results of}} the first numerical research specifically focused on long distance coach transport in Italy, carried out by the authors (Beria et al., 2012). We provide policy indications for this evolving and promising industry, looking at what happened in other countries and at what can be learnt from the European air industry after the liberalisation of the 90 ’s. We developed a geographical database of the long distance coaches supply and a database of the operating firms. Moreover, we interviewed managers and directors of some operating firms. According to our estimations, that are not present in the Italian transport statistics, the industry supplied more than 90 m bus*kilometres in 2010. Our database shows the geographical areas where coach services are more present and some considerations about bus companies. To compare the industry with the long distance rail sector, which is partially subsidised in Italy, we referred to and analysed the official Ferrovie dello Stato (the national railway company) economic figures, to make comparisons on supply and estimated passengers. Today coach and rail are mainly complementary, often filling the qualitative and quantitative gaps of the rail. However, this is expected to evolve as a consequence of liberalization. Policy scenarios appear to be three: the consolidation of the existing market, inside the new liberalised context; an expansion of the market towards new users; a different attitude of the national planner towards a broader use of coach for the subsidised long distance “universal service”, now supplied only by rail. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} in full {{the history}} of the Kuwait oil concession, which has proved {{to be one of the}} most valuable in the world. Interest in Kuwait's oil deposits first arose more than twenty years before the oil concession was finally secured by an Anglo-American combine. Many parties were actively involved in the quest for oil in Kuwait during the long negotiations which spanned the years 1912 - 1934. Companies backed by the British and United States Governments were all bargaining tor the concession while the Shaikh was determined to secure the best financial terms possible. Moreover, events in Kuwait were inter-related with and parallel to negotiations in Bahrein and Saudi Arabia, where American interests succeeded in securing <b>exclusive</b> oil <b>concessions.</b> This commercial success, which eventually drew the United States Government deeper into the Persian Gulf, was achieved despite a relatively early British recognition of the political and strategic importance of the region's oil concessions. This thesis discusses the formulation and application ot the policies of the various participants. It also provides an account of the way in which the American oil companies competing against British companies established themselves firmly in a region which was under British influence...|$|R

However, in negotiations with the Portuguese government, Barotseland was claimed to fall within the British sphere of influence and the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 allocated the Barotse Kingdom's territory to the British sphere, although the boundary with Angola was not fixed until 1905. Lewanika protested that the terms of the treaty had been misrepresented to him. No BSAC Administrator was sent to Barotseland until 1895, and the first Administrator, Forbes who remained until 1897, did little to establish an administration. As the Foreign Office was not convinced that the Lochner Concession had established a British protectorate over Barotseland or given BSAC any rights to administer the territory, it considered that a new concession was necessary. It agreed in 1896 that a BSAC official would be appointed as Resident Commissioner to secure this concession. The first appointee died before taking up his post, but in October 1897, Robert Coryndon reached Barotseland as Resident Commissioner. Coryndon, a former secretary of Cecil Rhodes and member of the Pioneer Column, had been proposed by the BSAC, and his appointment was approved by the High Commissioner for South Africa as representing the British government. In his capacity as Resident, Coryndon declared Barotseland to be a British protectorate, resolving its previously anomalous position. Coryndon also confirmed that the 1890 mineral concession gave the BSAC no right to make land grants. In 1897 Lewanika signed a new concession (the Coryndon Concession) that gave the BSAC the rights to make land grants and to establish jurisdiction in parallel to the king's courts. Next, in 1900, Lewanika signed a further agreement, (the Barotse Concession), which resolved some details that were in dispute following the earlier concessions and was drafted in terms compatible with the Barotseland-North Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899[...]|$|R
