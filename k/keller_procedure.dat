40|$|Resection arthroplasty—known as the Keller procedure—is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of severe hallux rigidus. As a modification of this procedure, resection arthroplasty is combined with cheilectomy and interposition of the dorsal capsule and extensor hallucis brevis tendon, which are then sutured to the flexor hallucis brevis tendon on the plantar side of the joint (capsular interposition arthroplasty). In this study the clinical and radiological outcome of 22 feet treated by interposition arthroplasty were investigated and compared with those of 30 feet on which the <b>Keller</b> <b>procedure</b> was performed. The mean follow-up period was 15  months. No statistically significant difference was found between either group concerning patient satisfaction, clinical outcome and increase in range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. At follow-up, patients who had undergone interposition arthroplasty did not show statistically significantly better American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) forefoot scores than those of the <b>Keller</b> <b>procedure</b> group. A high rate of osteonecrosis of the first metatarsal head was found in both groups. These radiological findings did not correlate with the clinical outcome at follow-up. In conclusion, no significant benefit in clinical or radiological outcome was found for capsular interposition arthroplasty compared with the <b>Keller</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{interphalangeal}} wounds or ulcerations ofthe {{great toe}} are a frequent complication in neuropathic diabetic feet. Ulcerations of the hallux {{may result in}} eventual amputation if infectionbecomes uncontrolled. While total contact casting is usually ef-fective as a first-line treatment, some wounds persist presenting substantial management challenges. Sal-vage of the hallux quite often requires surgical inter-vention if and when conservative management has failed. Keller arthroplasty has been used successfully to accelerate ulcer resolution in patients with neuropathic ulcers under the great toe joint that had been resistant to casting alone. 1, 2 The Keller resection arthroplasty has traditionally been indicated for painful hallux valgus in older pa-tients with degenerative disease of the first meta-tarsophalangeal joint or with hallux limitus or hallux rigidus. The results of the <b>Keller</b> <b>procedure</b> {{have been reported in}} several series, with patient satisfaction rates ranging from 79 % to 89 %. There have been more than 100 procedures with a myriad of approaches, osteotomies, fixation techniques, implants, and post-operative course. The primary objective of surgical cor-rection of hallux valgus and hallux limitus/rigidus should be that of reducing pain and providing the pa-tient with the most functional long-term result possi-ble. Two of the mainstays for hallux valgus, limitus, and rigidus surgery are the Keller arthroplasty and the first metatarsophalangeal arthrodesis. The <b>Keller</b> <b>procedure</b> for symptomatic hallux valgus and hallux rigidus has been effective in improving pa-tient satisfaction (AmericanOrthopedic Foot andAnkl...|$|E
40|$|The Mayo operatiomi for {{hallux valgus}} and buniomi 16 {{has been out}} of favom ’ for over thirty years. Fear that removal of the first {{metatarsal}} head will cause excessive strain out the other metatarsals and thereby produce met. at. arsalgia l.,l 7, 23 has prompted mamiy surgeons to prefer the Keller art. hropla. sty 13, which preserves the metatarsal head.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} survey {{was carried out}} to assess the results in the middle aged and elderly of an operation for hallux valgus which combined a basal osteotomy of the first metatarsal with a <b>Keller's</b> <b>procedure.</b> Mean follow up in 34 patients (54 feet) was 3. 2 years.

40|$|Iatrogenic {{hallux varus}} is a {{possible}} complication of hallux valgus surgery following Mc Bride or Scarf osteotomy, with or without Akin osteotomy of the first phalanx. It may also occur following chevron osteotomy or <b>Keller’s</b> <b>procedure.</b> One possibility for surgical revision of iatrogenic hallux varus is recon-struction of the lateral stabilising soft-tissue compo-nents of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Until now, only dynamic tendon transfers, possibly com-bined with interphalangeal fusion, have been described. The aim of our study {{was to develop a}} static, anatomic reconstruction procedure. A new surgical technique of ligamentoplasty using the abductor hallucis tendon is described. The new method was applied in 7 feet (5 patients) with a mean follow-up over two years. Hallux varus deformities were operated by transplantation of the abductor hallucis tendon. Subsequent radiographs showed correction of most of the factors considered to be responsible for the iatrogenic deformity. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux metatarsophalangeal-interpha-langeal (MTP-IP) score improved from 61 to 88. This new technique is a reliable, anatomic recon-struction with use of the tendon involved in the pathogenesis of the hallux varus deformity. No other functional tendon is used...|$|R
30|$|The {{statistical}} {{analyses were conducted}} using the PASW Statistics for Windows version 20.0 software (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). To describe sociodemographic variables and socialization goals, standard deviations with percentages and means were calculated. Maternal socialization goals were grouped accord Socialization Goals Questionnaire, and self-models discriminated by Keller et al. (2006) and <b>Keller</b> (2007). Next <b>procedures</b> considered inclination of mothers for autonomy and interdependence. Yet, spontaneous prosocial behavior was also described. Frequencies and percentages calculations indicated degree of child’s hesitancy in performing a proposed task. Finally, acquired data were crossed, so maternal socialization goals and children’s prosocial behavior could be statically correlated (Pearson correlation).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{a review}} of 401 {{operations}} for symptomatic bunion, {{it was found that}} 101 Mitchell procedures gave satisfactory results in 90 per cent of feet in which it was used. About the same percentage of satisfactory results ensued after use of the <b>Keller</b> or Silver <b>procedure,</b> but the Mitchell procedure was limited in its indications to younger patients without rheumatoid arthritis but with moderate deformity. The other operations were used when other indications were present, such as in elderly patients and in those with mild or more severe deformity. Late complications (re-sidual deformity, metatarsalgia, and others) were largely responsible for unsatisfac-tory results. More than eighty different types of surgical operations have been described for the correction of symptomatic bunion. Each surgeon must rely upon his own somewhat lim-ited repertory of bunion procedures to fit the patient at hand. To improve the skill of the surgeon in selecting the appropriate reconstructive foot surgery, I have reviewed my ex-perience with bunion surgery at The Mason Clinic over the period from 1957 to 1970. A minimum of three years of follow-up was required for the detection of late complications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part, {{a review of the}} authors' recent work is given. This concerns a study of the mechanics of thin membranes, under internal pressure, which are composed of elastically dissimilar straight cylindrical tubes joined end-to-end longitudinally. Both static pressure fields and pressure fields arising from fluid flow through the tube are considered, and stresses at the joints can be calculated. In the case of fluid flow, a coupled fluid/elastic problem arises. It is hoped that the work will ultimately aid the design of arterial grafts. The case of pulsatile flow is considered using the fluid solution for harmonic waves following that of Womersley. The membrane solutions are derived either from the equations formulated in Green and Adkins for finite deformations or from a linearized version of these equations. In the second part, a short study is made of wave propagation in initially deformed thin elastic tubes containing inviscid flow. Applying the long wavelength approximation, we predict analytically that for any frequency if the tube is predeformed, there are values of the principal stretches for which the wave will not propagate, in addition to wave cut-off frequencies shown by Rubinow and <b>Keller.</b> This analytic <b>procedure</b> is much simpler than the corresponding numerical calculation for viscous fluid, and the results, at least for the cut-off frequencies, are very similar...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recurrent {{hallux valgus}} is a {{relatively}} common, yet challenging, condition for both {{the patient and the}} surgeon. The literature on the treatment of recurrent hallux valgus is sparse. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evalu-ate prospectively the functional outcome and patient satisfaction following the Lapidus procedure for the treatment of recurrent hallux valgus deformity. Methods: Twenty-four patients with a total of twenty-six symptomatic recurrences of hallux valgus after previous pro-cedures for treatment of the deformity were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included prior fusion procedures on the foot or ankle, a previous <b>Keller</b> or Mayo <b>procedure,</b> insulin-dependent diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or peripheral neuropathy. A visual analog pain scale and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Meta-tarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale were administered preoperatively, at six months postoperatively, and yearly thereafter. Weight-bearing radiographs were also made preoperatively; at six weeks, three months, six months, and one year postoperatively; and yearly thereafter. Patient satisfaction was assessed at the latest follow-up evaluation. Results: At twenty-four months, the mean score according to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale had increased from 47. 6 to 87. 9 points, the mean score according to the visual analog pain scale had improved from 6. 2 to 1. 4, the mean hallux valgus angle had improved from 37. 1 ° to 17. 1 °, and the mean intermetatarsal angle had improved from 18 ° to 8. 6 °. The patients were very sat...|$|R
