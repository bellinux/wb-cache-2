30|$|Legal {{scholars}} concur that evacuation has {{a protective}} element which is absent from {{all forms of}} illegal displacement. The research of these scholars underlines that if evacuations/forced displacements do not fulfil adequate standards of civilian protection, then they {{must be seen as}} illegal (Jacques 2012; Zayas 1975). Further, based on an analysis of IHL treaty provisions and CIHL and in relation to the objective of this paper, an evacuation/forced displacement must therefore be considered illegal if ‘(…) satisfactory conditions (…)’ are not provided for the security of civilians by the armed party responsible. In addition, transfer, evacuation, or forced displacement can be considered illegal, if the protecting power (<b>if</b> <b>designated)</b> is not informed that an evacuation is taking place. Suggesting the existence of an obligation, on those responsible for ordering, to have an organized plan of evacuation/forced displacement and to provide that plan to a third party (e.g. the protecting power) concerned with the protection of civilians. Obviously, the need for secrecy during military operations may decide when such a plan may be shared; nevertheless, this does not diminish the obligations of, e.g. GCIV Art 49, AP II (1977) 17, and AP I (1977) 58.|$|E

50|$|In {{modal logic}} and the {{philosophy}} of language, a term {{is said to be}} a rigid designator when it designates (picks out, denotes, refers to) the same thing in all possible worlds in which that thing exists and does not designate anything else in those possible worlds in which that thing does not exist. A designator is persistently rigid <b>if</b> it <b>designates</b> the same thing in every possible world in which that thing exists and designates nothing in all other possible worlds. A designator is obstinately rigid <b>if</b> it <b>designates</b> the same thing in every possible world, period, whether or not that thing exists in that world. Rigid designators are contrasted with non-rigid or flaccid designators, which may designate different things in different possible worlds.|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{provides guidance}} for {{the planning and}} conduct of land operations by joint forces under the command and control of a joint force land component commander (JFLCC) {{in an area of}} operation. It presents options and considerations for use by a joint force commander (JFC) in designating a JFLCC and forming a functional land component, to include advantages and disadvantages of each option. It also addresses the timing and decision of the JFC to form the component and designate the JFLCC, assignment of subordinate commands, and the authority and responsibilities of the commander. It addresses formation, functions, and organization of the component, and provides joint doctrine and selected tactics, techniques, and procedures for operations in support of major operations or campaigns by a JFC across the range of military operations. It includes topics that should be considered when developing a joint land operation plan or order. These operations are primarily those involving large forces to include Army corps and Marine expeditionary forces, and those operations outside of an amphibious objective area, <b>if</b> <b>designated.</b> 2.

40|$|Emergency medical {{services}} (EMS) {{have been of}} interest for operations research {{since the middle of}} the 1960 &# 145;s. Since then there have been published numerous articles on the location of ambulances stations, allocation of ambulances, dispatching of vehicles, re-deployment of ambulances and evaluation methods. This thesis presents a new problem for the location of ambulance stations and allocation of ambulances in heterogeneous regions, referred to as the Maximum Expected Performance Location Problem for Heterogeneous Regions (MEPLP-HR). The problem applies multiple performance measures as well as station specific probabilities for the availability of ambulances at a station. Compared with earlier problems, the MEPLP-HR is more realistic for heterogeneous regions as the service rate of ambulances in the problem depends on the area a station covers. A mixed integer linear model is proposed to solve the problem. The probability for available ambulances is found by utilizing queuing theory together with the service rate and arrival rate of calls for each station. In contrast to recent models, the probability for available ambulances is calculated within the model. Hence, {{it is not necessary to}} use iterative solution approaches. The formulation is strengthened using valid inequalities and a reformulation of a restriction. With the strengthening constraints, both the solutions and the best bounds are improved. The computational studies are performed on the heterogeneous region of S&# 248;r-Tr&# 248;ndelag in Norway. For this region, the model is able to find a realistic solution that has a higher expected performance than the current solution on each of the given performance measures. The model is also tested with different weights for the performance measures, with the conclusion that the weights significantly affect the locations and allocation of stations and ambulances. By using the model as a decision support tool, three real managerial cases are analyzed together with potential solutions. The first case concerns the importance of taking multiple time periods into account when planning. The results from the computational study indicate that it is sufficient to plan for the busiest period. The second case analyzes the consequences and potential mitigating actions for closing down a local emergency room (ER). By closing the local ER, the travel time to ER will increase significantly for the zones close to the local ER. However, adding an extra ambulance and ambulance station can to some degree mitigate this effect. The third case concerns the benefit of transferring all non-urgent transport calls to designated non-urgent transport vehicles. The analysis in this case shows that there is a potential to reduce the number of ambulances by one fifth <b>if</b> <b>designated</b> non-urgent vehicles are introduced. This thesis consists of a report and two articles. The report is the main part of the thesis and contains all of our results and analyses. The articles are found as separate works after the report. The first one, "Strategic ambulance location for heterogeneous regions", presents the problem, the proposed model and technical characteristics. The second article, "Strategic Emergency Medical Service Planning - Three Case Studies", presents how the model can be applied as a decision support tool. The articles are based on the report, hence the report and articles are to some degrees overlapping. </p...|$|E
