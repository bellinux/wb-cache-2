MethodA new test activity was developed and evaluated for its ability to elicit bimanual actions in adolescents with (n= 20) and without (n= 10) unilateral CP. The AHA scores of 126 adolescents (mean age 14 y 3 mo, SD 2 y 6 mo; 71 males, 55 females) and 157 children with unilateral CP (mean age 6 y 1 mo, SD 2 y 10 mo; 102 males, 55 females) were analysed using the Rasch measurement model. ResultsThe test activity elicited bimanual actions in 100 % of typically developing adolescents and in 96. 8 % and 57. 9 % of adolescents with unilateral CP (moderately and severely limited hand function respectively). The scale demonstrated good construct validity; thus the same scoring criteria can be used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>range</b> studied.

40|$|This study {{presents}} comparative otolith-based age {{readings of}} pelagic redfish (Sebastes mentella) from the Irminger Sea within an otolith exchange program between institutes in Germany, Iceland and Norway. 213 otoliths were thin-sectioned and read independently in the participating labs. Age reading results were compared between readers {{in terms of}} bias and precision, using a set of statistical tests and graphical methods. Significant bias was observed between readers, mainly caused by deviations between age scores in the higher ages (> 20 years). Precision estimates, considering the high longevity of S. mentella, were relatively good compared to age readings of other long-lived species. In contrast, the age dependent percent agreement was poor (< 20 %) for a tolerance level of ± 0 years, particularly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>range</b> 21 - 40 years, which represents the major fraction of the fished stock. A tolerance level of ± 5 years, however, lead to around 90 % agreement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>ranges</b> up to 20 years. The fit of age reading scores with the von-Bertalanffy growth curve was relatively good, showing good correspondence between readers. A comparison of growth parameters with age-length relationships reported for demersal S. mentella in shelf areas in the Northeast Arctic, around Greenland and on the Fle mish Cap showed that pelagic S. mentella generally exhibits slower growth.

40|$|A {{study was}} made on the stress {{relaxation}} behavior at 25 C of poly(methyl methacrylate) in uniaxial tension {{as a function of}} physical aging at both room temperature and 60 C. Test specimens were compression molded at 165 C, then quenched to room temperature and allowed to age for up to 30 days prior to testing. Stress relaxation curves measured after different aging times could be superposed to a single master curve for each aging temperature. Superposition was achieved by applying vertical and horizontal shifts. Hence, the shape of the response curves was not changed by aging. This is in accordance with observations made by Struik for tensile creep curves. Volume changes as a function of physical aging were also determined. Simple exponential relationships were observed between volume and both horizontal and vertical shifts. The horizontal shift implies a shift in the effective time scale caused by a change in free volume. The vertical shifts could be correlated with changes in Young's modulus caused by a change in density. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of <b>aging</b> studied, <b>the</b> response time scale varied over nearly two decades of log-time. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> same conditions modulus varied by 30 percent...|$|R
