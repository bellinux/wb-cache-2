40|$|Abstract:The creep {{character}} of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock is remarkable. The big undisturbed mudstone samples in Nanning Basin {{as a typical}} argillaceous soft rock is chosen to the research object in this paper. The laboratory simulated destructive tests and the creep tests of full <b>grouted</b> <b>anchor</b> rod have been down. Through the destructive tests of mudstone sample, the instantaneous adhesive strength between the anchor body and mudstone in Nanning Basin is 70 kPa. By analyzing the creep curves of anchor rod, a conclusion {{is that there is}} a long-term adhesive strength of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock. When the design adhesive strength of anchor rod is less than the long-term adhesive strength, eventually the anchor rod is stable during the process of long-term pull-out. When the design adhesive strength of anchor rod is greater than the value, the creep of anchor rod with the time will do not stop until the anchor rod failure. The greater difference value between the instantaneous and long-term adhesive strength, the faster the rate of creep, the faster the anchor rod failure. Finally, for the permanent support engineering design of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock, the paper gives two principles, as follows: (1) the design of anchor rod in argillaceous soft rock must be determined according to the long-term adhesive strength. (2) by using variety of technical measures, the impact of various factors on the creep of anchor rod will be decreased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of supporting technology, more and more pressure-dispersive anchor systems are applied in civil and mining engineering recently. In this anchor system, unbonded steel strands are used to disperse the external load to load-bearing bodies at different locations, and the load is transferred through the compressing action between the load-bearing body and cement mortar. It has obvious technique advantage as a permanent anchor system. However, the stretching mode for pressure-dispersive <b>grout</b> <b>anchor</b> is still not clear in actual engineering practice. In this paper, there are 3 common types of stretching mode for pressure-dispersive <b>grout</b> <b>anchor</b> with u-shaped load-bearing bodies in soil ground are analyzed by FEM (finite element method) and the reasonable one is suggested. Ulteriorly, the loading formulas are deduced respectively for the pressure-dispersive <b>grout</b> <b>anchor</b> with 2 or 3 load-bearing bodies, which will be used conveniently in practice...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Shallow anchor {{systems have}} been widely used for decades due to their time and cost efficiency. Yet when it comes to cold regions like Alaska, new {{challenges}} caused by the harsh environment need to be resolved before they are used extensively in cold regions. One challenge associated with anchor installation could be the potential thawing of warm permafrost due to the grout mortar hydration, which might undermine the capacity of the anchor. Another challenge is that due to low temperature the grout may cure slower or not cure at all, which will also result in a significant decrease in the ultimate strength of the anchor. Field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of shallow anchors including duckbill <b>anchors</b> and <b>grouted</b> <b>anchors</b> with three types of different grouting materials, including Microsil <b>Anchor</b> <b>Grout,</b> Bentonite Clay and a newly-developed Antifreeze Grout Mortar. Constant-load creep test and pullout test were conducted to evaluate the performance of the anchors. Test results indicated that the <b>anchors</b> <b>grouted</b> with Antifreeze Grout Mortar caused the least permafrost disturbance and degradation, gained the largest tensile strength, exhibited the least creep displacement, and showed relatively large pullout capacity, and thus achieved the best performance among all types of shallow anchors...|$|R

40|$|Sheet pile {{walls are}} one of the oldest earth {{retention}} systems utilized in civil engineering projects. They are used for various purposes; such as excavation support system, cofferdams, cut-off walls under dams, slope stabilization, waterfront structures, and flood walls. Sheet pile walls {{are one of}} the most common types of quay walls used in port construction. The worldwide increases in utilization of large ships for transportation have created an urgent need of deepening the seabed within port areas and consequently the rehabilitation of its wharfs. Several methods can be used to increase the load-carrying capacity of sheet-piling walls. The use of additional <b>anchored</b> tie rods <b>grouted</b> into the backfill soil and arranged along the exposed wall height is one of the most practical and appropriate solutions adopted for stabilization and rehabilitation of the existing quay wall. The Ravenna Port Authority initiated a project to deepen the harbor bottom at selected wharves. An extensive parametric study through the finite element program, PLAXIS 2 D, version 2012 was carried out to investigate the enhancement of using submerged <b>grouted</b> <b>anchors</b> technique on the load response of sheet-piling quay wall. The influence of grout-ties area, length of <b>grouted</b> body, <b>anchor</b> inclination and anchor location were considered and evaluated due to the effect of different system parameters. Also a comparative study was conducted by Plaxis 2 D and 3 D program to investigate the behavior of these sheet pile quay walls in terms of horizontal displacements induced along the sheet pile wall and ground surface settlements as well as the anchor force and calculated factor of safety. Finally, a comprehensive study was carried out by using different constitutive models to simulate the mechanical behavior of the soil to investigate the effect of these two models (Mohr-Coulomb and Hardening Soil) on the behavior of these sheet pile quay walls...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{grouting}} during {{installation of}} <b>grouted</b> ground <b>anchors</b> {{is known to}} increase anchor capacity in non-cohesive soils, but little information is available on correlations between applied grouting pressures, duration of grouting, ground conditions and increase of anchor pull-out capacity. The presented PhD study is concerned with processes taking place during installation of <b>grouted</b> ground <b>anchors</b> in non-cohesive soils, where filtration of the cement grout is assumed. It was aimed to {{determine the influence of}} pressure grouting on the stresses on the anchor body and the properties of the adjacent soil. The knowledge of those is considered prerequisite {{in order to determine the}} anchors pull-out capacity. In the first part of the PhD thesis, a series of laboratory experiments is presented, which was carried out to understand the filtration process of cement grouts and to determine the properties of the filter cake material. Using a filtration press the rate of filter cake build-up was investigated, taking into account the influence of grouting pressure and initial water/cement ratio of the grout. The test results were used to evaluate different analytical approaches to simulate the filtration process: a two-phase filtration model and classical consolidation theory. Both models were found appropriate, and calculation parameters were determined. In addition to the filtration tests, the mechanical properties of the fresh, uncured, filter-cake material were investigated. Applying soil mechanical investigation methods, strength and stiffness properties could be determined. In the second part of the PhD thesis in-situ tests during anchor installation in sands are presented. On three test sites the grout pressure was measured inside the borehole during and after anchor installation. Measurements confirmed a grout filtration inside the borehole and indicated the increase of radial stresses on the anchor body. Additional flat-dilatometer soundings (DMT) and cone penetration tests (CPT) showed the influence of the grouting process on the radial stresses in the adjacent soil. In the third part of the thesis a numerical model is proposed to simulate the filtration process of cement grout in a fully coupled flow-displacement finite element analysis. Based on the two-phase filtration model a filter criterion was implemented, which defines the phase change from liquid to solid grout based on the discharge of water. The phase change was realised by changing the material properties of the grout elements. With the presented model the <b>grouting</b> during <b>anchor</b> installation was simulated and the influence of different parameters could be determined. The transfer of grouting pressures from the liquid grout to the soil through seepage forces in the filtercake is simulated and the residual stresses after grouting determined. The findings can now be used as starting point to simulate the load transfer mechanisms of <b>grouted</b> ground <b>anchors</b> in numerical analysis, taking into account installation effects...|$|R

40|$|The seismic {{behaviour}} {{of existing}} masonry buildings strongly {{depends on the}} type of connections between orthogonal walls and between walls and floors. Recent earthquakes have clearly shown that the most common failure modes of existing masonry buildings involve out-of-plane mechanisms. In these structures, the structural connections are crucial to achieve a favourable distribution of horizontal loads and to avoid out-of-plane mechanisms. In order to investigate on the effectiveness of typical existing structural connections between bearing walls in masonry buildings, an experimental program has been carried out on a full scale T-shape tuff masonry specimen. A weak connection has been designed between the two orthogonal walls of the specimen in order to reproduce common execution practices. Three tests have been performed under the simultaneous application of axial load and monotonic or cyclic horizontal displacements on the specimen in three different configurations: as-built, repaired, and repaired and strengthened with an innovative solution based on the use of composite systems. The strengthening solution consisted of <b>grouted</b> <b>anchors</b> made by hollow CFRP pultruded carbon tubes wrapped with longitudinal and spiral stainless steel fabrics to increase the bond between mortar and tubes.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rods {{have been}} {{increasingly}} used in <b>grouted</b> ground <b>anchors</b> {{due to their}} high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent corrosion resistance, and convenience in incorporating the fiber sensing technology. To establish their pull-out capacity, FRP rods are usually embedded within a grouted steel tube and then subjected to pull-out in the laboratory. The aim {{of this paper is}} to develop a numerical method for predicting the nonlinear pull-out response of FRP rods embedded in steel tubes filled with cement grout. In the method, the cement grout is assumed to be subject to simple shear, the local interfacial bond stress-slip model of the bar-to-grout interface is represented by a piece-wise curve comprising elastic, softening, and frictional stages, and the unloading effect is also taken into account. A set of two second-order ordinary differential equations are derived in terms of the displacements of the FRP rod and steel tube and solved analytically to formulate the element transfer matrix. When the thickness of the steel tube approaches infinity, this method can be applied to the problem of FRP rods embedded in rock. Based on the developed numerical method, the interfacial bond properties and snapback phenomenon are analyzed. After the method is validated by comparisons with four sets of experimental data, the effects of the radius and length of FRP rods, the local peak bond stress and the residual frictional strength on the maximum pull-out load are evaluated in a quantitative manner.

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{conceded that the}} costs associated with current practices for the mooring, anchoring, or foundation systems of Marine HydroKinetic (MHK) and Deepwater Floating Wind systems are a disproportionate portion of the total cost of an installed system. Reducing the cost of the mooring and anchoring components for MHK systems can contribute substantially to reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). Micropile anchors can reduce the LCOE both directly, because the anchors, associated mooring hardware and installation costs are less than conventional anchor and mooring systems, but also because micropile anchors require less extensive geotechnical surveys for confident design and proper implementation of an anchor or foundation system. This report presents the results of the development of critical elements of <b>grouted</b> marine micropile <b>anchor</b> (MMA) technology for application to MHK energy conversion systems and other ocean engineering applications that require fixing equipment to the seafloor. Specifically, this project identified grout formulations and developed designs for grout dispensing systems suitable for use in a seawater environment as a critical development need for successful implementation of practical MMA systems. The project conducted a thorough review of available information on the use of cement-based grouts in seawater. Based on this review and data available from commercial sources, the project selected a range of grout formulations for testing as part of a micropile system. The project also reviewed instrumentation for measuring grout density, pressure and flow rate, and integrated an instrumentation system suitable for use with micropile installation. The grout formulations and instrumentation system were tested successfully and demonstrated the suitability of MMA technology for implementation into anchor systems for MHK and other marine renewable energy systems.

40|$|Cable bolt {{supports}} {{are widely}} used as ground support in underground hard rock and coal mines. During the last two decades, the cable bolt technology has improved significantly and new types of cable bolts, new grouts and new installation methods and pumps have been introduced and successfully developed. The design of cable bolts is currently attempted by empirical methods based on rockmass characterization. However, until such methods do {{not take into account}} all the important parameters affecting the mechanical behaviour of cable bolts namely, the type of cable geometry, grout quality, stiffness of the host medium, the amount of confining pressure and the presence of end anchorage and pretension. This thesis deals with the numerical modelling of cable bolts considering all of the above mentioned factors. To evaluate the shear bond stiffness of cable bolts, which simulate the interface between the cable bolt and the rockmass, a new empirical model is developed. A database with data of pull-out tests is constructed. Empirical relations were derived between the shear bond stiffness and the variation of confining pressure, the modulus of elasticity of host medium and the water:cement ratio. The relations were derived for three types of cables (standard cable, nutcase cable and garford bulb cable). A new numerical model using the finite element method is developed for the numerical simulation of cable bolts. Together with the empirical model for shear bond stiffness, the numerical model computes the load distribution along the cable bolt and thus can simulate fully grouted, partially <b>grouted,</b> end <b>anchored</b> and tensioned cable bolts. The model is implemented in an existing finite element code (e-z tools). Parametric analyses are performed on the new model, and proved useful in the demonstration of the role of each design parameter. A new design methodology is proposed to evaluate the load distribution along the cable bolt. Two case studies are presented: a stope hanging-wall support by cable bolt in a hardrock mine and a tailgate secondary supports in a coal mine.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the behaviour of the perimeter {{wall of a}} very large excavation in saturated sands. The excavation was extended to a depth of 20 m (17 m below the water table) and the walls reached an impervious silty clay formation which appears 55 m below the surface. The reinforced concrete walls were stabilized by a single row of <b>anchors</b> <b>grouted</b> in sand, below the water table. Stabilizing berms were also left unexcavated against the walls to allow reaching the maximum excavation depth in the large central area of the site. Later, basement slabs were built and propped against the walls, before the excavation was completed. A disturbing finding was the large horizontal displacements measured in the walls during the early excavation stages. These large displacements extended to large depths, well beyond the excavation depth. However, anchor loads remained essentially constant throughout the excavation and water lowering operations. Computer results were found in reasonable agreement with available wall displacements and anchor loads. A most interesting part of the analysis was the distribution of movements in the active zone of the walls. It was found that significant displacements extended well beyond the expected distance from the wall. In fact, wall displacements and anchor fixed length displacements were similar in magnitude. This result could be interpreted as an indication of impending failure but further finite element analysis carried out to establish the safety factor against failure showed that the entire system was far from limiting conditions. This effect is related to some features of the project, which include the anchor length, the stiffness of the wall {{and the size of the}} excavated area. Postprint (published version...|$|R

Soil mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering come into stage at this phase and analyses the soil -structure relationship. Generally, loads transferred from super structures form compression forces on soil or rock interface, some may form tension forces. It is not possible for a soil layer or rock layer to resist applies forces directly. Although, change in geometry of foundation underneath a building overcome the tension forces; for long electricity transmission towers, wind turbines, high-rise buildings or dams tension forces which will react on soil is inevitable. Anchor whose origin dates back to screw piles in 1800 's, is a soil technology that has an important place in civil engineering world by transferring tension forces of structures to the soil. It was officially first used in Algeria to strengthen the Dam Cheurfas and has become widely used parallel to the developments in civil engineering era. Especially after Second World War, countries which had been affected from the war were rebuilding themselves and started to open excavation pits under ground level to meet the needs. In order to prevent damages of these pits to the near facilities such as buildings or highways and to construct safely, these excavation pits had to be supported. Generally steel-prefabricated systems which have been still used today were being utilized as a support system. This application which can also be named as internal support brought some difficulties and limitations regarding the progress of excavation. Moreover, it affacted the construction stages of super-structure and made the process more complicated. Anchors which have high tensional capacity and are capable of transferring subjected tensional forces to soil or rock layers have been evaluated as an alternative method for the solution of support system in excavations. Particularly, when difficulties of internal supports and their unfavorable costs are considered anchors have become more attractive. In 1958, anchors used for a successful excavation in Munchen/Germany proved the performance and easy use of anchors compared with the internal support system and contributed {{a lot to the}} spreading to world. Germany, France, Austria-Switzerland and England are the main countries in Europe which have used and developed ground anchor technology parallel with developed machine-materials technology. In addition to developments on anchor production, same countries have also contributed to advances on ground anchor design, such as increasing anchor capacity and preparing of standards-regulations. Ground anchor technology which was an origin of West Europe, have been used by countries in different region of worlds; USA, Japan, Australia etc. Ground anchors are load bearing elements which are made of steel tendons as a base material and can be installed in unsuitable soil conditions with any directions. In addition to this description, lots of definitions, terms are given in literatures by different researchers. In the third part of this thesis, ground anchors are examined with their definitions and parts which are anchor head, free length and fixed length. Moreover, terms of active and passive anchor are defined comparatively including also their advantages/disadvantages of each. Ground anchors are divided into two main groups according to their service life; temporary and permanent anchors. In addition to this, degree of risk after anchor will fail also affect definition of anchor as a permanent or temporary. In this part, definition of temporary and permanent anchors in accordance with different standards, regulations (PTI, SIA 191, TA' 95, BS 8081, EN 1537) are also considered. In the scope of this thesis, bearing capacity of anchors which can be divided into passive and active with respect to their working principle are considered. By including a wide range of literature review, the content consists of historical development, structural system and researches to study anchor types changing with respect to material-production-working principle respectively. Calculation methods and approaches of anchor bearing capacity which constitutes the main scope of this thesis for different types of anchors and soil conditions are investigated. Furthermore, researches done for examination the effects of construction methods and techniques on bearing capacity and design assumptions derived from the results are also examined within the scope of this thesis. In the first years which soil or rock anchors were began to be used, lack of specialized firms and experiences made it unavoidable to fail in this technology. This enforced countries such as America to prepare standards and specifications. At the beginning, these documents which had been made up in the lights of experiences of specialized firms were providing guidance. In the beginning of 1970 's researches were mainly based on theoretical studies such as bearing capacity and load transfer mechanism of anchors. Results of these studies took their places on these standards and specifications and further provided a guidance on application methods and design of anchors. BS 8081 : 1989, PTI 2004, DIN 4125 are the main ones which are examined under the scope of this thesis. The studies in this thesis mainly focus on the determination of anchor capacities in different type of soils and effects of production methods on bearing capacities. The main indicative factor for bearing capacity of ground <b>anchors</b> is the <b>grouting</b> methods which are categorized in four types. Moreover, grouting methods are also determined in according to soil type where anchor is installed. Three main groups are examined for bearing capacity of ground anchors with regards of soil type; cohesionless soil, cohesive soil, and rocks. In these examinations, calculation or determination of bearing capacity of ground anchors with respect to different approaches including theoretical, statistical researches are considered. There are four different failure system which can be available for ground anchors; failure of soil mass, failure of interface between soil and grout, failure of interface between grout and steel (bar or strand or wire), failure of steel or anchor head. Design of each issues will be performed with respect to safety factors defined in standards/regulations or by researchers. Moreover, service life of anchors (temporary or permanent) or degree of risk by failure of anchor are criteria which can affect safety factors. In the fifth section of thesis, detail information about post <b>grouting</b> type <b>anchors</b> and special anchors (SBMA, single borehole multiple anchor) are given. Post <b>grouting</b> <b>anchors</b> can be preferred on soil types which are high plastic clay, marn, loose silt or highly fractured rocks. By application of post grouting, bearing capacity of ground anchors which are low for such soils, will be increased. In addition to this, post grouting can be preferred for anchors installed already and failed during stressing process especially when they do not pass the criteria as creep. Moreover, effect of post grouting to bearing capacity of ground anchors is also examined in this section by considering time of post grouting process. Advantage of post grouting process on bearing capacity of ground anchors by showing an example of site application in France is also shown in this section. SBMA type anchors were invented based on non-uniform bond stress occurred during tensioning of anchors. Non-uniform shear stress between interface of grout and ground, mobilizes due to fact that soil-grout-steel do not show same elasticity behaviour under loading. Since 1970, a lot of investigations and researches about this issue have been performed and it has been concluded that shear stresses are not uniform such as assumption taken for conventional anchor design. While conventional anchors have single unit (bond), SBMA type anchors have multiple unit that is generally shorter than conventional's. At the stage of initial loadings, stresses are concentrated on top part of anchor bond which are near to discrimination of free and fixed part of anchors. By increasing of loading, stressed part of anchor bond is shifting to the end of bond and anchor bond will be failed at the end which is also described as progressive debonding. In according to investigations more than 60, conventional anchor design was developed by using efficiency factor which is depends on length of bond. Nowadays, it is possible to achieve higher loads; 1000 - 1500 kN by installation of SBMA type anchors in weak soils. In the sixth section of thesis, the case study includes the experiments to determine anchor bearing capacities performed on trial anchors executed for the support of the excavation of a project located in İstanbul. In trial anchors performed in soft-medium clay, medium-hard and stiff clay layers, conventional method, post grouted (Tube a Manchette) and SBMA (Single Bore Multiple Anchors) methods were utilized. Mechanical properties of weak soils were determined as a result of site investigations (i. e. shear strength, deformation modulus etc.) and effect of Tube a Manchette and SBMA techniques on anchor bearing capacity is examined. As a result of analysis done with case study given in this thesis, SBMA and post <b>grouting</b> type <b>anchors</b> provide significant advantage instead of conventional anchors in soft-medium clayey soil. It is also concluded that performing of trial tests are useful to determine design of ground anchor with theoretical calculations. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|During {{pressure}} <b>grouting</b> {{of ground}} <b>anchors</b> in non-cohesive soils {{the water in}} the grout is filtrated out, producing a stiff filter cake material. Often the grouting is done in more than one stage so that the filter cake will be unloaded as the pressurizing is paused, and then reloaded again during the following grouting phase. Little is known of how this filtered material behaves, neither for the first time loading nor for the unloading and reloading. Aiming at {{a better understanding of the}} properties of this material, filtration tests on fresh grout with water contents ranging between 0, 4 - 0, 6 and filtration pressures between 1 - 15 bar have been executed. Additionally, oedometer tests were run on the filter cake material produced during the filtration tests. A split-ring oedometer allowing measurements of the horizontal pressures were used. Thus, the lateral response can also be evaluated from the oedometer results in addition to conventional oedometer properties like the one-dimensional stiffness. Also the water contents before and after filtration and after oedometer testing were measured, and a simple permeability test was done on some of the filter cakes. It was found that the initial water content and the filtration pressure had only a minor effect on the water content after filtration, in general ranging between 0, 24 - 0, 30. The time needed for the filtration process to finish was found to be unaffected by the initial water content, but decreasing with increasing filtration pressure. The permeability of the filter cake was found to lie in the order of 1 E- 8 to 2 E- 7, mainly affected by the initial water content. The oedometer results show an increase in initial stiffness with filtration pressure, while the stiffness seems less affected by this as the load increases. However, the increase in stiffness is small and the material does not have clear over and normally consolidated areas. When unloading and reloading in the oedometer, the material clearly remembers the prestressing to a much greater extent, giving much higher stiffnesses for the reloading sequences than for first time loading. The lateral stress coefficient was found to vary between 0, 25 - 0, 30 for first time loading. Based on the over-all results, a kinematic hardening model is proposed for modeling the filtered materials behavior. </p...|$|R
