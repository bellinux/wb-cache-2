Further, some regions of the combustion chamber may have a very weak flame, that is, they have either very <b>fuel-lean</b> or very fuel-rich conditions and consequently they have a low combustion temperature. These regions will cause intermediate species such as formaldehyde and alkenes to be emitted.

Fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> flame with different air factors were analyzed separately. Emission of fuel-rich flame is CO whereas emission of <b>fuel-lean</b> is NOx, and fuel rich-lean ratio {{is the most important}} factor for NOx and CO emission. If fuel-rich flame α 1 is changed with constant <b>fuel-lean</b> flame α 2, NOx emission decreases and CO emission increases evidently. If α 2 is changed with constant α 1, NOx decreases slightly and CO increases initially and then decreases.

The effects of temperature (1000 – 1300 °C) and the excess oxygen ratio λ(0. 6 – 1. 4) on the conversion of volatile-N and char-N to NOx were studied. Also, the reduction of recycle NOx by fuel-N was investigated under various conditions. The results show that fuel-N conversion to NO in O₂/CO₂is lower than that in O₂/N₂. In O₂/CO₂atmosphere, the volatile-N conversion ratios vary from 1 – 7 % to 15 – 24 % under fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions, respectively. The char-N conversion ratios are 11 – 28 % and 30 – 50 % under fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions, respectively. The influences of temperature on the conversion of volatile-N to NO under fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions are contrary. A significant difference for char-N conversion in fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions is observed. The experimental data of recycle NO reduction indicate that the reduction of recycle NO by gas-phase reaction can be enhanced by volatile-N addition in <b>fuel-lean</b> condition at high temperature, while in fuel-rich condition, the volatile-N influence cancelled out and the overall impact is small.

On {{the basis of}} these considerations the two most promising concepts were selected. Refined analysis and preliminary design work was conducted on these two concepts. The selected concepts were required to fit within the combustor chamber dimensions of the reference engine. This is achieved by using a dump diffuser discharging into a plenum chamber between the compressor discharge and the turbine inlet, with the combustors overlaying the prediffuser and the rear of the compressor.

40|$|The Jing Ltd. {{miniature}} combustion aerosol standard (Mini- CAST) soot generator is a portable, {{commercially available}} burner that {{is widely used}} for laboratory measurements of soot processes. While many studies have used the Mini-CAST to generate soot with known size, concentration, and organic carbon fraction under a single or few conditions, {{there has been no}} systematic study of the burner operation over a wide range of operating conditions. Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of the microphysical, chemical, morphological, and hygroscopic properties of Mini- CAST soot over the full range of oxidation air and mixing N 2 flow rates. Very fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> flame conditions are found to produce organic-dominated soot with mode diameters of 10 – 60 nm, and the highest particle number concentrations are produced under fuel-rich conditions. The lowest organic fraction and largest diameter soot (70 – 130 nm) occur under slightly <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions. Moving from fuel-rich to <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions also increases the O:C ratio of the soot coatings from ~ 0. 05 to ~ 0. 25, which causes {{a small fraction of the}} particles to act as cloud condensation nuclei near the Kelvin limit (κ ~ 0 – 10 − 3).

40|$|Three-dimensional direct {{numerical}} simulations {{with detailed}} chemistry {{were performed to}} investigate the effect of equivalence ratio on spatial variations of the heat release rate and flame markers of hydrogen/carbon monoxide syngas expanding spherical premixed flames under turbulent conditions at elevated pressures. The flame structures and the heat release rate were analysed and compared between <b>fuel-lean,</b> stoichiometric and fuel-rich centrally ignited spherical flames. The equivalence ratio changes the balance among thermo-diffusive effects, Darrieus-Landau instability and turbulence, leading to different flame dynamics and the heat release rate distribution, despite exhibiting similar cellular and wrinkling flames. The Darrieus-Landau instability is relatively insensitive to the equivalence ratio while the thermo-diffusive process is strongly affected by the equivalence ratio. As the thermo-diffusive effect increases as the equivalence ratio decreases, the <b>fuel-lean</b> flame is more unstable than the fuel-rich flame with the stoichiometric flame in between, under the joint effects of the thermo-diffusive instability and the Darrieus-Landau instability. The local heat release rate and curvature display a positive correlation for the lean flame, no correlation for the stoichiometric flame, and negative correlation for the rich flame. Furthermore, for the <b>fuel-lean</b> flame, the low and high heat release rate values {{are found in the}} negative and positive curvature zones, respectively, while for the fuel-rich flame, the opposite trends are found.

At specific regions, either inverted or partially inverted flames can exist, primarily in dependence on axial distance and radial direction of the ignition source.

The edge flame propagation behavior has been studied in terms of the statistics of the edge flame displacement speed S d, which refers to the speed at which the fuel mass fraction Y F isosurface moves normal to itself, relative to an initially coincident material surface at the intersection between the fuel-rich and <b>fuel-lean</b> premixed flames on the stoichiometric mixture fraction isosurface. The probability density function of the density-weighted edge flame displacement speed S 8 d shows nonzero probability of finding negative values of S*d at later stages of self-sustained flame propagation.

The Damko¨ hler number and chemical explosive mode (CEM) analysis also verify that auto-ignition occurs at the flame base.

In the second part of this thesis (Paper II), the development of rhodium catalysts for fuel-rich methane combustion is addressed. The effect of water addition on the methane conversion and the product gas composition was studied. A significant influence of the support material and Rh loading on the catalytic behavior was found. The addition of water influenced both the low-temperature activity and the product gas composition. QC 2010112...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to improve the}} understanding of combustion chemistry by modeling the chemical and physical characteristics of ethylene and allene reacting mixtures {{in a wide variety of}} combustion systems. This is of critical importance for environmental and economic reasons today: formation of air toxics whose emissions are regulated by the U. S. Clean Air Act Amendments, optimization of engines output, and reformulation of fuels, for example. ^ First, a reaction set containing 731 reactions of 85 species was assembled from the literature and theoretical calculations. The mechanism focuses on the C 2 and C 3 hydrocarbons reactions but it also includes heavier species up to C 6 hydrocarbons such as benzene and phenyl. New rate constants for the reactions of the key system C 2 H 3 +O 2 were calculated theoretically and rate constants for the C 3 H 3 recombination reaction were inferred from the recent literature. ^ This reaction set was then used in simulations of shock-tubes, flow reactors and especially flame experiments in various conditions. The predictions obtained throughout the study are generally in good agreement with the experimental data and establishes the overall high-quality of the reaction set. However, in the case of a <b>fuel-lean</b> (2 ̆ 6 phis; = 0. 70) ethylene flame, the predicted profiles of key radicals are not within the experimental uncertainty. The modeling of important reactions involving radicals such as H+O 2 in this environment may still be inaccurate. ^ A novel approach to flat-flame modeling is also introduced. External heat losses by radiation are included in the energy conservation equation for the first time. This improvement of the model allows the temperature profile to be computed in the case of real, non-adiabatic flames. The analysis of the predictions shows that temperature is greatly affected by the presence of soot in fuel-rich flames. In <b>fuel-lean</b> flames, insufficient heat is generated by the mechanism at low temperature. Finally, net heat flux analysis is used to demonstrate the very good agreement of the predictions with data of the fuel-rich flame and quantify the discrepancy in the case of the <b>fuel-lean</b> flame. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory {{program on}} {{alternative}} automotive fuels, the subcontractor has been conducting studies on the origin and fate of organic pollutants from the combustion of alternative fuels. Laboratory experiments were conducted simulating cold start of four alterative fuels (compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol-gasoline mix, and ethanol-gasoline mix) using a commercial three-way catalyst under <b>fuel-lean</b> conditions. This report summarizes {{the results of these}} experiments. It appears that temperature of the catalyst is a more important parameter for fuel conversion and pollutant formation than oxygen concentration or fuel composition...|$|E
