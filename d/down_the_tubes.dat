2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1989, Lynch had {{finished}} the pilot episode for the successful Twin Peaks television series and tried to rescue two of his projects – Ronnie Rocket and One Saliva Bubble – both involved in contractual complications {{as a result of}} Dino De Laurentiis' bankruptcy, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures. Lynch stated, [...] "I've had a bad time with obstacles... It wasn't Dino's fault, but when his company went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes,</b> I got swallowed up in that". Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch's and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on. Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write. He let Montgomery read it in pre-published galley form while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it. Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct. Lynch remembers telling him, [...] "That’s great Monty, but what if I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?" [...] Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his [...] "kind of thing." [...] Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it. Lynch remembers, [...] "It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] Lynch was drawn to what he saw as [...] "a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell," [...] and was also attracted to [...] "a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about. So it seems truthful in some way." ...|$|E

50|$|Fernez {{soon found}} that beyond {{a depth of}} one metre, or at most a metre and a half, inhaling air <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> and exhaling it {{thorough}} the exhaust valve becomes impossible because of the pressure of water compressing the chest. He quickly realised that the air needed to be supplied to the diver under sufficient pressure to balance {{the pressure of the}} water at whatever depth the diver was operating. He added a manual Michelin air pump, the type used to inflate car tyres, to pump air <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> and also a clamp for the diver's nose to prevent water entry, and goggles to protect the eyes and permit underwater vision. Air was pumped continuously <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> and flowed out of the exhaust valve of the mouthpiece, causing the pressure in the mouthpiece to be exactly the same as the external water pressure. The diver could breathe in and out from this stream of air without difficulty. This breathing apparatus was called the Fernez model 1.|$|R
50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|E

[...] He explains that the song depicts the apocalypse occurring in New York, [...] "the skyline tumbling down, this horrendous conflagration happening in New York City."

5000|$|Moreover {{due to the}} {{conditions}} the Health Care Financing Administration has threatened to cut Kaiser's 700,000 dollar Medicare disbursement.

The hospital is required to provide 24-hour care but this service especially the nurse advice line {{has been described as}} [...] "shoddy". Nurses report that although Kaiser acts to fix problems quickly, it chooses temporary fixes over long term solutions to bigger problems in a routine fashion. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that once investigators leave [...] "it all goes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> again" [...] and that management changes the charting system monthly causing distress for the employees. It has also been reported that staff have been banned from charting anything that could arouse the suspicions of inspectors such as medical record errors and that some workers had been written up for doing so.

5000|$|Discovery of the {{hydrothermal}} vents in {{the eastern}} Pacific Ocean was quickly followed by the discovery and description of new vestimentiferan tubeworm species. These tubeworms {{are one of the}} most dominant organisms associated with the hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. Tubeworms anchor themselves to the substratum of the hydrocarbon seep by roots located at the basal portion of their bodies. [...] Intact tubeworm roots have proven very difficult to obtain for study because they are extremely delicate, and often break off when a tubeworm is removed from hypothermal vent regions. It is unsure how long the roots of the tube worms can grow to, but root have been recovered longer than 30 m in length. A single aggregation of tubeworms can contain thousands of individuals, and the roots produced by each tubeworm can become tangled with the roots of neighbouring tubeworms. [...] These mats of roots are known as “ropes”, and travel <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> of dead tubeworms, and run through holes in rocks. The diameter and wall thickness of the tubeworm roots do not appear to change with distance from the trunk portion of the tubeworms body. Like the trunk portion of the body, the roots of the Vestimentiferan tubeworms are composed of chitin crystallites, which support and protect the tubeworm from predation and environmental stresses. The Vestimentiferan tubeworms build the external chitin structure themselves by secreting chitin from specialized glands located in their body walls.|$|E
