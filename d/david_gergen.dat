500|$|Reagan {{was known}} to joke {{frequently}} during his lifetime, displayed humor throughout his presidency, and was famous for his storytelling. His numerous jokes and one-liners have been labeled [...] "classic quips" [...] and [...] "legendary." [...] Among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the Cold War. As a microphone test in preparation for his weekly radio address in August 1984, Reagan made the following joke: [...] "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes." [...] Former aide <b>David</b> <b>Gergen</b> commented, [...] "It was that humor... that I think endeared people to Reagan." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1983, Reagan {{introduced}} the Strategic Defense Initiative, a defense {{project that would}} have used ground- and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible. There was much disbelief surrounding the program's scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub SDI [...] "Star Wars" [...] and argue that its technological objective was unattainable. The Soviets became concerned about the possible effects SDI would have; leader Yuri Andropov said it would put [...] "the entire world in jeopardy." [...] For those reasons, <b>David</b> <b>Gergen,</b> former aide to President Reagan, believes that in retrospect, SDI hastened {{the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Sanford {{was born}} in 1917 in Laurinburg, North Carolina, the son of Elizabeth Terry (Martin) and Cecil Leroy Sanford, both of English descent. He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's Troop 20 of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his Scouting {{experience}} to journalist <b>David</b> <b>Gergen</b> and said that it [...] "probably saved {{my life in the}} war. Boys who had been Scouts or had been in the CCC knew how to look after themselves in the woods.... What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped me make decisions about what was best." [...] The BSA recognized him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.|$|E
500|$|Kemp championed several Chicago {{school and}} supply-side {{economics}} issues: economic growth, free markets, free trade, tax simplification and lower tax rates on both employment and investment income. He was a long-time {{proponent of the}} flat tax. He also defended the use of anti-Communist contra forces in Central America, supported the gold standard, spoke for civil rights legislation, opposed abortion, {{and was the first}} lawmaker to popularize enterprise zones, which he supported to foster entrepreneurship and job creation and expand homeownership among public housing tenants. During his career, he sometimes sounded like a liberal Democrat: he supported affirmative action and rights for illegal immigrants. [...] The New York Times described Kemp as the most proactive combatant in the war on poverty since Robert Kennedy. He differed from Rockefeller Republicans and earlier combatants such as Lyndon Johnson by supporting incentive-based systems instead of traditional social programs. For his commitment to inner city concerns from within the Republican party, <b>David</b> <b>Gergen</b> heralded him as a [...] "courageous voice in the wilderness." [...] Although he was liberal on many social issues and supported civil liberties for homosexuals, he opposed certain gay rights such as the right to teach in schools. Kemp at times felt his role was that of [...] "freewheeling, entrepreneurial, wildcatting backbencher." ...|$|E

The founders included Harlene Anderson, <b>David</b> Cooperrider, Kenneth <b>Gergen,</b> Mary Gergen, Sheila McNamee, Suresh Srivastva, and Diana Whitney.

The institute currently functions as a virtual centered organization.|$|R

Complex thoughts could be retained, referenced and augmented. Greek society was the first to celebrate the thinker, the rationalist and this questioning attitude became a hallmark of Western Civilization.

5000|$|Modern seekers {{abandoned}} traditional {{sources of}} meaning such as nations or religion and found or invented new sources. In France the Marquis de Concorcet rejected religion {{and power in}} individuals. Instead, mass movements were expounded as a new wave. The result was the French Revolution yet he died in jail, victim of his own teachings. Auguste Comte developed Positivism, {{a system in which}} only sensory experiences were the true reality. Related to this was historical determinism in which progress occurs by outside forces unrelated to human actions. From these two arose Ideology, a belief that the ideas expressed were true because they could be [...] "proven". Individuals lost not only influence but also meaning. Boorstin strongly opposed ideology... the people who think they have found the final answer...are the menace to our humanity really, because I think there is no final answer. <b>Gergen,</b> <b>David</b> Online Newshour: The Seekers He first warned of the dangers of ideology in 1953 in The Genius of American Politics.

[...] A spokesman for Human Rights Watch stated that [...] "there were many things that were commendable ... but it is disappointing that when he talked about democracy in the Muslim world he wasn't more specific about some of the problems." [...] He also stated that Obama refrained from talking about what the spokesman saw as the suppression of dissidents in Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|Former National Security Adviser and Secretary of the Interior William P. Clark Jr. {{believes}} that the allegations were {{a product of a}} [...] "campaign of leaks" [...] by Baker, Deaver, <b>David</b> <b>Gergen,</b> and Dick Darman to discredit ideologues in the administration they did not like. William F. Buckley Jr. asserted the view that the investigation had been driven by [...] "two forces, one of them galactic, the other merely torrential [...] [...] [...] The first is the disposition of the State Department bureaucracy to make things hard for political appointees. The second is the disposition of all of Washington to make things hard for Mr. Reagan." [...] For her part Whittlesey attributes the allegations to disgruntled career State Department employees who disagreed with Reagan's policies and her personnel decisions as chief of mission, but in the end the constant friction, according to one source, led to her resignation.|$|E

2500|$|Accounts differ {{as to who}} popularized the term. President George W. Bush {{introduced}} the term officially during his presidency. According to Safire, author Christopher Hitchens was responsible for its diffusion, while Valerie Scatamburlo d'Annibale argues that its popularization {{is due to the}} work of Eliot Cohen, former counselor to Condoleezza Rice, reputed occasionally to be [...] "the most influential neocon in academe". It circulated in neoconservative circles for some years after 2001 and came into wider currency after President George W. Bush, still grappling to find a phrase that might identify the nature of the [...] "evil" [...] which would define the nature of his enemy in the War on Terror, stated in 2005 that Islamofascism was an ideology synonymous with Islamic radicalism and militant jihadism, which, he then clarified, was decidedly distinct from the religion of Islam. It moved into the mainstream in August 2006. [...] After the arrest of Islamic terrorists suspected of preparing to blow up airlines, Bush once more alluded to [...] "Islamic Fascists", apparently a [...] "toned-down" [...] variant of the word, The public use of the neologism and the analogous Islamic fascism during the run-up to the U.S. 2006 mid-term elections, perhaps with a specific focus group in mind, provoked an outcry, or storm of protest, and was quickly dropped from the president's rhetorical armory. Katha Pollitt, stating the principle that, [...] "if the control the language, you control the debate", remarked that while the term looked [...] "analytic", it was emotional and [...] "intended to get us to think less and fear". <b>David</b> <b>Gergen,</b> former speechwriter for Richard Nixon, commented that the phrase [...] "confuses more than it clarifies", for [...] "Islamic fascism has no meaning" [...] in the Arab world. Neoconservative writers, critics and scholars from Hitchens to Robert Wistrich however responded that the Muslim religion itself is fascistic, a view which, in identifying Islam with political fascism, was lambasted for being as offensive as the term Judeo-Nazi coined in the 1970s by Yeshayahu Leibowitz, editor of the Encyclopedia Hebraica, to characterize Messianic Jews settling in the occupied West Bank. Hitchens replied that the link is no more deleterious than that made by Leibowitz, or by left-wing analysts who wrote of clerical fascism.|$|E
