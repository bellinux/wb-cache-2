It also {{examined the relationship between}} the self-determination theory and achievement goal theory. A total of 632 (349 boys, 283 girls) adolescent athletes (aged 13 - 18 years) completed the Sports Motivation Scale and Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire. Results indicated significant differences between gender on intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, amotivation (t(630) = 4. 10, p < 0. 05) and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> (t(630) = 2. 48, p < 0. 05). Male students reported higher intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, amotivation and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> A significant difference was found between age groups on task orientation (t(630) = 1. 94, p < 0. 05) and locality on <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> (t(630) = 1. 94, p < 0. 05). Older athletes showed significantly higher task orientation. Rural athletes had higher <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> whereas urban athletes have higher intrinsic motivation. Task orientation was related to intrinsic motivation (r = 0. 55, p < 0. 01), extrinsic motivation (r = 0. 55, p < 0. 01), but weakly related to amotivation (r = 0. 10, p < 0. 01). <b>Ego</b> <b>orientation</b> was related to intrinsic motivation (r = 0. 30, p < 0. 01), extrinsic motivation (r = 0. 36, p < 0. 01) and amotivaion (r = 0. 36, p < 0. 01). Task orientation was related to <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> (r = 0. 29, p < 0. 01).

I studien deltog 103 bordtennisspelare (60 män och 43 kvinnor) tävlandes i {{division}} ett till tre. Metoden som användes i studien var en kvantitativ undersökning och bestod av enkäterna Collegiate Goal Setting in Sport Questionnaire (Weinberg, Burton, Yukelson, Weigand, 1993) och Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire (Duda & Nicholls, 1992; ref i Duda, 1998). Resultatet i studien visade flera signifikanta skillnader mellan bordtennisspelarna med högre resultatinriktning och bordtennisspelare med en lägre resultatinriktning när det gäller uppfattning om målsättning. Resultatet visade exempelvis att bordtennisspelarna med högre resultatinriktning oftare satte resultatmål och prestationsmål jämfört med bordtennisspelare med en lägre resultatinriktning. Vidare visade resultatet också att bordtennisspelarna med en lägre resultatinriktning anser att det är viktigare med gemenskap för att delta i än bordtennisspelare med en högre resultatinriktning. Resultatet diskuterats i relation till tidigare forskning.  Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the differences in goal preferences of table tennis players, depending on goal orientation. The participants were 103 (60 male and 43 female) table tennis players competing in division one to three. The method used in the study was a quantitative study consisted of questionnaires Collegiate Goal Setting in Sport Questionnaire CGSSQ (Weinberg, Burton, Yukelson, Weigand, 1993) and Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire TEOSQ (Duda & Nicholls, 1992; ref in Duda, 1998). The results showed several significant results between table tennis players with a high <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> and table tennis players with a lower <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> in goal setting. For example the result showed that table tennis players with a high <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> used more often outcome goals and performance goals than table tennis players with a lower <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> The result also showed that a table tennis player with a lower <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> means that it is more important with fellowship than tennis players with a high <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> The results have been analyzed and discussed in relation to previous research...|$|E

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 632 (349 male, 283 female) athletes from the under 15 and 18 years age groups (mean, 15. 2 ± 1. 28 years) who volunteered {{to participate in the}} annual state track and field meet. The participants completed the expectancy-related beliefs, subjective task values measures, and Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Question-naire. Results indicated a significant interaction effect between sex, age group and locality for expectancy-related beliefs, F(1, 624) = 8. 02 (p 0. 05) and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> F(1, 624) = 0. 04 (p> 0. 05).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine motivational orientations of youth (N= 1235) towards sport {{participation}} by using Achievement Goal Theory (AGT; Nicholls, 1989) and Reversal Theory (RT; Apter, 1989). Both theories are useful for determining how individuals varying in motivational orientations differ in their participation motives in the sport context. AGT postulates that individuals have task and <b>ego</b> <b>orientations</b> whereas RT assumes that individuals have eight orientations (telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic, alloic, mastery, and sympathy). Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated overall good fit of seven underlying sport motive structures derived from the 30 -item Participation Motivation Inventory (Gill, Gross, & Huddleston, 1983). Subsequent canonical correlation analyses generally indicated a close relationship between motivational orientations and sport participation motives congruent with theoretical predictions in both AGT and RT. It was also found that task and <b>ego</b> <b>orientations</b> in AGT were linked with specific motivational orientations in RT. The results suggest that the two theories have similar motivational orientation constructs, more articulated in RT, which may be useful in examining what motivates youth to participate in physical activities and sport. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Achievement Goal Theory (Nichols, 1989) {{outlines}} {{three factors}} that affect motivation: goals, perceived ability, and behaviors. The combination of these factors yields two goal orientations that are subsequently used to define success and ability: task orientation and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> Those with high task orientation are intrinsically motivated (Duda 2 ̆ 6 Ntoumanis, 2003). Those with high <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> are extrinsically motivated (Newton 2 ̆ 6 Duda, 1993). Although decades of {{research has focused on}} motivational orientations as they relate to perceptions of ability and performance outcomes, there is little research investigating how motivational orientation may affect variability of motor performance during and after competition. The present study explored the relationship between motivational orientation and dynamic measures of motor variability, for performance and learning. The Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ; Duda 2 ̆ 6 Nicholls, 1989) was used to assess individual 2 ̆ 7 s levels of task and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> Participants were placed into four categories: High Task, High Ego; High Task, Low Ego; Low Task, High Ego; and Low Task, Low Ego. Over three days, participants completed 51 trials of isometric force tracking. Day 1 involved 25 practice trials. On day 2, 21 trials were completed while competing with a confederate from the lab. Day 3 consisted of five trials to measure retention. Performance for all groups was not significantly different during competition versus practice; however, retention (learning) was poorer for the high ego, low task group. A non-linear measure (ApEn) quantifying regularity of performance also increased during competition for both groups that reported high <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> The regularity of behavior during competition did not directly predict learning outcomes. Having high task orientation along with high <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> allows for better learning despite greater irregularity of performance during competition. Furthermore, the least adaptable motivational profile for learning was high ego paired with low task...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to assess the {{hypothesis}} that achievement goal orientations will predict sportpersonship attitudes among young athletes, namely that task orientation will predict socially positive attitudes and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> will predict socially negative attitudes. For hundred and eighty two athletes, aged 13 to 16 years completed the Portuguese versions of the Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQp) and of the Sports Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQp). Bivariate correlations were used to examine the relationships between TEOSQp and SAQp. Afterwards, relationships between <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> and score agreement in cheating and gamesmanship as well as task orientation and score agreement in convention and commitment were examined through EQS (version 5. 7). For the estimation of the model, the maximum likelihood method was used. A matrix correlation between the variables (task orientation, <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> cheating, gamesmanship, convention and commitment) showed positive correlations between task orientation and convention (r = 0. 29, p < 0. 01) and commitment (r = 0. 40, p < 0. 01). <b>Ego</b> <b>orientation</b> appeared to be positively correlated with cheating (r = 0. 30, p < 0. 01) and gamesmanship (r = 0. 33, p < 0. 01), and negatively with convention (r = - 0. 16, p < 0. 01). The fit of the model was evaluated using the CFI (0. 97) and SRMR (0. 04). The hypothesized model was confirmed. Task and ego orientations produced a significant effect on prosocial attitudes and on antisocial attitudes, respectively. Task-oriented goals in youth sport programs can represent a relevant framework for promoting prosocial attitudes and consequentely increment the effectiveness of educational intervention...|$|E

40|$|Achievement goal theory (AGT) is a {{dominant}} theoretical framework. The {{purposes of this}} review were (1) to provide {{a summary of the}} task and <b>ego</b> goal <b>orientations</b> literature in competitive sport as measured by the Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientations</b> in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) or the Perceptions of Success in Sport Questionnaire (POSQ), (2) to test the interdependence of the two goal orientations, and (3) to provide the estimated means for both orientations across a number of historically examined moderator variables. 260 studies met inclusion criteria totaling 80, 959 unique participants across 39 countries and 32 sports. Youth samples were nearly 50 % of all included studies. The meta-analyzed intercorrelations (rw=. 18, z= 9. 96, p<. 000) supported the conceptualized interdependence of the two goal orientations. The estimated mean values were 4. 15 +. 30 (task) and 3. 04 +. 51 (ego). However, differences, POSQ compared to TEOSQ, existed in the estimated means (g=. 92 task; g= 1. 09 ego). Thus, the TEOSQ and POSQ samples for the moderator variables (i. e. sex, sport level, sport type, and collective/individualistic countries) were examined separately. Results both supported and refuted the hypotheses and also differed by measure. Because of TEOSQ and POSQ inconsistencies, an additional analysis was undertaken to examine whether the TEOSQ and POSQ differed to a common correlate motivation climate. This analysis revealed measurement differences in the ego to ego climate relationships. In conclusion, AGT has been extensively researched in competitive sport.

40|$|Training and {{competition}} are two important contexts within the sport domain. In this study, we examined: (a) consistency {{and differences in}} goal orientations across the training {{and competition}} contexts and whether these are moderated by sport type; and (b) whether goal orientations predict effort, enjoyment, and trait anxiety differently in the two contexts, and whether sport type moderates these relationships. Participants were individual- (n = 145) and team-sport (n = 203) athletes, who completed questionnaires measuring goal orientations, effort, enjoyment, and trait anxiety in training and competition. Both task and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> showed medium-to-large consistency across the two contexts for individual- and team-sport athletes. Athletes in both sport types reported higher <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> in competition than in training, but {{did not differ in}} task orientation. Task orientation predicted effort positively in training. However, in competition, this goal predicted effort positively only in individual-sport athletes who had low <b>ego</b> <b>orientation.</b> Task orientation also predicted enjoyment positively in both contexts; however, in competition this prediction was significantly stronger in individual than in team-sport athletes. <b>Ego</b> <b>orientation</b> also predicted enjoyment positively in competition in both individual- and team-sport athletes. Finally, task orientation predicted trait anxiety negatively in competition but only in individual-sport athletes.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the characteristics of goal orientation and perceived motivational climate change according to the playing positions of amateur footballers. Material and Methods: Four hundred and sixty amateur male football players participated in the study (age, 21. 72 ± 4. 63 years; football experience, 9. 24 ± 4. 18 years). Footballers were named as the defence (n= 199), midfield (n= 187) and forward (n= 74) according to their playing position. The scores of perceived motivational climate and goal orientation were determined by the Turkish versions of ‘The Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire’ and ‘The Perceived Motivation Climate Questionnaire’, which were adopted by Toros (2002). Results: Pearson correlation analyses showed that football experience had no effect on task orientation, <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> mastery climate, and performance climate. ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests showed that task orientation and mastery climate scores were higher in defence players than midfield players (p= 0. 003 vs. p< 0. 001). <b>Ego</b> <b>orientation</b> and performance climate scores of the midfield and defence players differed in favour of the midfield players (p< 0. 001 vs. p< 0. 001). Although there were no statistically significant differences in terms of the scores of task orientation and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> among forward, defence, and midfield players, performance climate scores were higher in forward players than midfield players (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: According to the results of this study, players who have higher task orientation and mastery climate scores can play as defence players, and other players who have higher <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> and performance climate scores can play as midfield players. With the need for more extensive studies to determine the goal orientation and motivational climate scores of forward players, scores that are obtained from questionnaires should be evaluated with physical and physiological tests...|$|E

(2004) and the Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) of Duda (1989). The sample consisted of 300 children (198 boys and 102 girls) with ages ranging from 8 to 17 (M= 11. 7 ± 2. 43), and an average of (M= 2, 9 ± 1. 13) years of practicing tennis. Exploratory factor analysis applied for PMQ identified five factors explaining the 48. 09 % of the total variance, that is, «social participation and energy release» (α=, 825), «status achievement» (α=, 798), «skill improvement» (a=, 666), «challenge» (α=, 639) and «personal motives» (α=, 616). As for TEOSQ, two factors emerged explaining the 52, 90 % of the total variance concerning task orientation (α= 81) and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> (α=. 83). Correlation analysis (Pearson's r) revealed a positive relation between task orientation and intrinsic motives such as skill development (r=. 570, p< 0. 01), while <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> was positively correlated with extrinsic motives such as "status achievement" (r=. 514, p< 0. 01).

Using cluster analysis techniques including hierarchical methods and the non-hierarchical method (k-means cluster) to examine goal profiles, a three cluster solution emerged viz. cluster 1 - high task and moderate ego (HT/ME), cluster 2 - moderate task and low ego (MT/LE) and, cluster 3 - moderate task and moderate ego (MT/ME). Analysis of the fundamental areas of mental toughness based on goal profiles revealed that athletes in cluster 1 {{scored significantly higher on}} negative energy control than athletes in cluster 2. Further, athletes in cluster 1 also scored significantly higher on positive energy control than athletes in cluster 3. Chi-square (χ 2) test revealed no significant differences among athletes with different goal profiles on performance outcomes in the competition.

In this study we examined a model of mental toughness development based on achievement goal theory, assessing the relations between motivational climates, goal orientations, and mental toughness. Five hundred ninety-nine varsity athletes, representing 13 different sports from six different high schools in a southwestern United States school district, participated in the study. Athletes completed self-report measures assessing parent, peer, and coach motivational climates, goal orientations, and their mental toughness. Initially, I examined the measurement model and found it fit the data well both in the exploratory (SRMR =. 06; CFI =. 94) and confirmatory (SRMR =. 06; CFI =. 95) samples. Second, the structural model was examined and found to fit the data well in both the exploratory (SRMR =. 08; CFI =. 93) and confirmatory samples (SRMR =. 07, CFI =. 95). Parent task-involving climate, (β =. 55; p <. 05) and coach task-involving climate (β =. 32; p <. 05), but not peer task-involving climate (β =. 05), were associated with task goal orientation (R 2 =. 57). <b>Ego</b> goal <b>orientation</b> (R 2 =. 32) was explained by peer ego-involving climate (β =. 15; p <. 05), parent ego-involving climate (β =. 39; p <. 05), and coach ego-involving climate (β =. 16; p <. 05).

This research examined the level of goal orientation towards the performance of the Junior Golfers in Malaysia and its relationship with their achievement. Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaires (TEOSQ) was administered to measure goal orientation aspects. A purposive sample of 80 junior golfers who participated in the 2002 national junior golf circuit was employed for this study. The findings showed that Junior Golfers were more Task orientated rather than Ego oriented. There was a significant correlation between <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> and Nett Score Achievement. However, there were no correlations between Task, <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> and Gross Score Achievement as well as between Task orientation and Nett Score Achievement. The findings of this study has implications to education policy, sports trainers and athletes. It is recommended that future studies examine a larger sample of Golfers from different levels or athletes from different types of sport. Qualitative research should be conducted in addition to quantitative research to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} athletes’ thoughts during competition. A comparative study between psychological profiles of Malaysian athletes and other successful international athletes is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold. Firstly to examine the {{relations}} between the different constructs that defines Nicholls’ Achievement Goal Theory and Deci and Ryan’s self-determination theory. Secondly to analyse the differences that exist between them with respect to the socio-demographic variables gender and age. A sample of 292 federated basketball players from the Region of Murcia (Spain) with ages between 14 and 18 years old was used. In addition, Castilian versions of The Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ) and the Sports Motivational Scale (SMS) were administered. Three statistical analyses were employed, a descriptive analysis, a correlation analysis and a regression analysis. The results showed a positive relation between <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> extrinsic motivation and amotivation. The motivational relations between both theories and the differences with respect to gender and age are discussed. We have found out that mainly gender and also age differences are strong predictors of <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> extrinsic motivation of external regulation and amotivation. We can also confirm that extrinsic motivation of external regulation positively predicts <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> and a decrease of task orientation. The results ratify the use of the Spanish version of the SMS to measure different types of motivation within the sports context...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the affect of task and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> on athletic identity and anti social behavior of students and athletes. A total of 156 students (86 males and 70 females {{with a mean age}} of 16, 5 years) and 150 athletes (90 males and 60 females {{with a mean age of}} 18, 5 years) participated at the study. The study was conducted from December 2012 to February 2013 during a basketball school tournament at the premises of Anatolia College for students and during local championships for athletes. TEOSQ (The Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> in Sport Questionnaire) by Nicholls (1989) was used for the assessment of goals, the A. I. M. S. (Athletic Identity Measurement Scale) by Brewer et al,(1993) for athletic identity and the questionnaire by M. Kavussanu (pro-social and antisocial behavior 2006) was used for antisocial behaviour. All questionnaires have been previously used for similar studies in Greece. Results showed that task and <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> as well as identity affect antisocial behavior. Differences among athletes and students were observed only on athletic identity, while regarding the two sexes boys showed higher scores on antisocial behavior and aggression in relation to girls...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} determinants of active lifestyles in Singaporean university students. Using confirmatory factor analysis, {{a measure of}} lay beliefs concerning athletic ability was confirmed. Other results confirmed hypotheses that beliefs reflecting that athletic ability can be developed over time (incremental beliefs) predict an achievement task (selfreferenced) orientation, while beliefs reflecting that athletic ability is relatively stable (entity beliefs) predict an <b>ego</b> (otherperson, comparative) <b>orientation.</b> Goal orientations directly affect perceived competence which, in turn, influence intrinsic motivation to be physically active. A task orientation had a direct link to intrinsic motivation. Results suggest that intrinsic motivation towards sport and physical activity might be enhanced through interventions that focus on self-referenced and selfimprovement notions of ability as well as perceived competence...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate grade 9 - 12 students’ motivation while engaged in two different engineering design projects: marble-sorter and bridge designs. The motivation components measured in this study were focused on students’ intrinsic (IGO) and extrinsic (<b>EGO)</b> goal <b>orientations,</b> task value (TV), self-efficacy for learning and performance (SELP), and control belief (CB). After finishing each project, students were asked to complete an Engineering Design Questionnaire (EDQ) survey instrument. The instrument consisted of 26 items modified from motivational scales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Besides the motivational scales, five demographic and two open-ended questions exploring students’ most and least motivating aspects about their designs were added to the instrument. From the statistical tests, the results showed a significant difference on students’ IGO during marble-sorter and bridge design activities. Students’ intrinsic goal orientation was significantly higher on bridge design than marble-sorter design. Students who planned to major in engineering or technology education were more significantly motivated working on the two design activities than those who whose majors were in other areas. Students’ EGO did not appear to be correlated to their IGO, TV, SELP, and CB. Common themes associated with student motivation in the activities are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince {{the concept}} of spatial {{cognitive}} map appeared, {{it has been shown}} that different parameters play a role in how spatial representations are encoded within ego- or allocentered frames of reference. The main influences seem to come on the one hand from the variations of the subject's activity and, on the other hand, from the nature of the configuration to be learned. Because we necessarily perceive space from our current position and <b>orientation</b> (<b>ego),</b> abstraction of this information into a more global bird's eye view (allo) involves cognitive processes. By this respect, moving and locating requires the subject to mentally connect different pieces of information built either within an ego or an allocentric spatial frame of reference. Some researchers have suggested that these two kinds of spatial frames of reference are used in parallel but nowadays, even if some studies have identified the specific influences of these different parameters, their coordination mechanisms still pose questions...|$|R
40|$|Although widely {{researched}} {{in education}} and sport, little research examines employee achievement goal orientations in a work context. This article provides validity and reliability evidence for the Task and <b>Ego</b> <b>Orientation</b> at Work Questionnaire (TEOWQ) from a study of 378 employees representing from eight different occupational categories. Confirmatory factor analyses indicate that are-specified model comprising two ego ("Being the best" and "being better than others") and two task sub-factors ("Learning" and "Effort") fit the data better than the original two-factor model. Temporal stationarity and stability of the constructs over time receive support. As hypothesized, task and task-effort orientations relate positively with persistence while <b>ego</b> <b>orientation</b> does not. The TEOWQ {{appears to be a}} valid and reliable instrument of achievement orientation in a work setting. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Educology is {{the fund}} of {{knowledge}} about the educational process, which obviously occurs within and outside of schools. Educology includes, at the least, the fund {{of knowledge about}} past education (historical educology), about current states of affairs in education (scientific educology), about effective practices within education (praxiological educology), about meanings of terms and sentences in education (analytic philosophical educology) and about good education (normative philosophical educology). This article is a work in scientific educology. It reports on an exploration of extant relationships among four dimensions of goal orientation in mathematics lessons (self-defeating <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> self-enhancing <b>ego</b> <b>orientation,</b> task orientation, and avoidance orientation) and mathematics achievement, self-concept, self-efficacy, anxiety, and intrinsic motivation.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the relationships}} between competitive anxiety (both cognitive and somatic) and perceived motivational climate (ego and mastery) in 54 young competitive soccer players (mean age: 9. 45 years), related to their four coaches’ perceptions of the soccer players’ skills and performance. We administered the Spanish versions of the SAS- 2 (Sport Anxiety Scale- 2, Smith, Smoll, Cumming and Grossbard, 2006) and the MCSYS (Motivational Climate Scale for Youth Sports, Smith, Cumming and Smoll, 2008), along with two ad hoc scales to evaluate perceived skills and performance. The results show that 1) young players perceived and discriminated clearly between motivational climates (which {{were more or less}} equally distributed between <b>ego</b> and mastery <b>orientations),</b> 2) some performance-related anxiety (mostly cognitive rather than somatic) appeared and 3) no significant relationships were found between their coaches’ perceptions of their skills and their performance. Lastly, the results are discussed and compared with similar results from preadolescent players...|$|R
40|$|Personality {{traits and}} goal {{orientation}} {{have been reported}} to have associations with test anxiety. However, the mediation role of goal orientation between the Big Five personality traits and cognitive test anxiety (CTA) needs further exploration. Based on data from 458 university students, regression and mediation analyses were conducted to test associations between five personality factors (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), two types of goal orientations (extrinsic and intrinsic), and CTA. Direct negative relationships were found between two personality factors (Openness and Conscientiousness) and CTA. Direct positive associations were found between Neuroticism and Extrinsic Goal <b>Orientation</b> (<b>EGO)</b> and CTA. Examination of model fit indices revealed a partially mediated model examining the relationships among personality variables, goal orientation, and cognitive test anxiety was the only model with acceptable fit indices. Overall, 18. 7 % of the variance in cognitive test anxiety could be attributed to personality when mediated by goal orientation. Results suggested that students who reported being more extrinsically motivated were identified with more conscientious traits had higher cognitive test anxiety levels.

40|$|This study {{particularly}} {{aimed at}} investigating {{the relationships of}} <b>ego</b> identity, goal <b>orientation</b> and age of the students among EFL university students. Ego identity is the core element through psychological issues and it sets social and cognitive structure of individuality. Goal orientation {{is a sign of}} personal issue and considered as a kind of motivation that guides the learners to their future actions. Four universities were randomly sampled. Participants were 217 students of whom 158 were females and 59 were males. The students responded to scale of the EOM-EIS and AGQ. SPSS was run, using Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlation coefficient were applied. The results revealed all four subscales of ego identity except for identity-foreclosure, had a significant relationship with total goal orientation and age of the students. The results also demonstrated that total goal orientation had a significant relationship with age of the learners. Consequently, ego identity, and goal orientation are influential in academic achievement of the students. The current study revealed that identity achievement {{plays an important role in}} the locus of identity formation and it could be more crucial in their academic courses than the other learners who were more concerned with the other subscales of ego identity. Students who were more inclined to mastery goals were more oriented to progres...|$|R
