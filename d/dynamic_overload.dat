30|$|The {{observation}} that wheel vibration modes are quite damped {{makes clear that}} the contribution to the total response, in terms of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> transmitted to the road pavement, is very small. On the other hand, {{the influence of the}} vehicle type is considerable, and in particular heavy traffic causes an appreciable <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload,</b> especially when the road surface irregularities are increased.|$|E
30|$|The {{consequences}} of this <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> should then {{be the subject of}} further studies to determine the transfer mode and the damage level produced on buildings situated near to the roads.|$|E
30|$|Heavy traffic, {{when the}} {{irregularities}} {{of the road}} surface evolve toward significant values of deterioration, generates a considerable <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload,</b> closely connected with the accelerations of the great masses of trucks.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, as the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> {{caused by}} the rail {{corrugation}} are unknown, a simplified numerical model that disregards the presence of such pathology is developed (model 1 a). Next, a first approximation to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> is obtained by experimental formulation and it is then applied to the numerical model. In this moment, a process of pre-calibration is carried out on the high rail (iteration n =  0), obtaining a first approximation of the equivalent stiffness of the track (K_eq_ 0).|$|R
30|$|We can {{see that}} a new {{sinusoidal}} behavior induces some differences in the amplitude of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads.</b> Nevertheless, in all the cases, only minor differences were obtained.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> {{obtained}} by the dynamic model, {{it has been observed}} that the amplitude in the low rail is much higher than the one obtained in the high rail. The {{reason for this is that}} the corrugation phenomenon has only been depicted on the inner rail, while the response of high rail is the result of the interaction between the two wheels on the same axle. Furthermore, rail corrugation wavelength has been perfectly reproduced in <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads,</b> obtaining relative maximums and minimums separated each rail corrugation wavelength.|$|R
30|$|The paper {{shows how}} this <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> may be {{predetermined}} {{as a function}} of the pavements surface degradation. This is a useful reference for the purposes of designing and maintaining road pavements.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{the paper}} {{provides}} a useful methodological contribution to the determination of dynamic effects caused by the interaction vehicle-road pavement, by evaluating the entity of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> induced by surface irregularities.|$|E
30|$|Because of this {{significant}} difference of frequency, {{the motions of}} vehicle body and of wheels are almost independent. In addition, since the vibration modes of the wheels are generally quite damped, they scarcely contribute to the total response, in terms of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> transmitted at the road pavement.|$|E
3000|$|The new {{stiffness}} {{value is}} used to recalculate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads,</b> obtaining a new <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> vector (F [...] n+ 1). This vector is applied on model 1 b and a new vibrational response of the track is obtained. Then it is compared with the one previously calculated. If there is a relevant difference, the calibration process should be repeated until K_eq_n - 1 ≈ K_eq_n. In that moment, the model will be calibrated and validated for a K_eq_n stiffness and a F [...] n [...] dynamic forces vector.|$|R
30|$|Then, {{these data}} are {{introduced}} into the numerical model 1 a and the pre-calibration process begins. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> applied to the complete model 1 b are developed in Sect. 3.2.|$|R
40|$|Multi-methods (collections of {{overloaded}} methods {{associated to}} the same message, whose selection takes place dynamically instead of statically as in standard overloading) are a useful mechanism since they unleash the power of dynamic binding in object-oriented languages, so enhancing re-usability and separation of responsibilities. However, many mainstream languages, such as, e. g., Java, do not provide it, resorting to only static overloading. In this paper we propose an extension, we call FMJ (Featherweight Multi Java), of Featherweight Java with encapsulated multimethods thus providing <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloading.</b> The extension is conservative and type safe: both “message-not-understood ” and “message-ambiguous ” are statically ruled out.

40|$|The paper tackles {{the theme}} of {{evaluating}} dynamic load increases that the vehicle transfers to the road pavement, due to the generation of vibration produced by surface irregularities. The study starts from the generation, according to the ISO 8608 Standard, of different road roughness profiles characterized by different damage levels. In particular, the first four classes provided by ISO 8608 were considered. Subsequently, the force exchanged between the pavement and three typologies of vehicles (car, bus and truck) has been assessed by implementing, in Matlab®, the QCM (Quarter Car Model) characterized by a quarter vehicle mass and variable speed from 20 to 100 km/h. The analysis allows determining the amount of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> that causes the vibrational stress.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase in the development of the railway system. Despite the huge benefits of railways, one of the main drawbacks of this mode of transport is vibrations caused by vehicles in service, especially in the case of trams circulating in urban areas. Moreover, this undesirable phenomenon may be exacerbated by the presence of irregularities in the rail-wheel contact. Thus, an analytical model able to reproduce the vibrational behavior of a real stretch of tram track was implemented. Besides, a simulation of different types of corrugation was carried out by calculating in an auxiliary model the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> generated by corrugation. These <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> fed the main model to obtain the vibrations generated and then transmitted to the track...|$|R
30|$|The closest {{approximation}} {{to reality}} {{that involves the}} calculation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> using multi-body models requires dismissing those forces obtained by experimental formulations [Eqs. (6) and (8)]. Hence, a new calibration and validation process is carried out {{in order to achieve}} an accurate value of equivalent track stiffness.|$|R
30|$|After {{analyzing}} the results, {{it can be}} concluded that the amplitude of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> obtained is mainly caused by rail corrugation, while the average value is mainly caused by geometric variations in the track. Therefore, {{in the absence of any}} other pathology, rail grinding can counteract the amplitude variation of the wheel–rail contact forces.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} three lumped parameters {{models for}} the study of the dynamic behavior of a boom crane.

Some application examples are presented, with the aim of showing the correlation between the magnitude of the stress and the type of the employed motion command...|$|E
30|$|Finally, from a {{vibrational}} {{point of}} view, {{it has been}} proved that the numerical model has adequately responded to variations in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> calculated. Once the loads corresponding to a grinded track are introduced, the vibrational response is reduced considerably. Consequently, {{it can be concluded}} that the grinding process of a corrugated rail surface can significantly reduce the vibrations generated by passage of a vehicle, especially in lateral dynamics. Nevertheless, the fact of introducing loads as discrete forces at different timesteps has induced a predominant frequency in the numerical model corresponding to the loadsteps application. For further investigations, the authors will work to overcome this handicap.|$|E

30|$|In addition, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> {{obtained}} for the four wheels of the same bogie have presented different behaviors {{as a result of}} the curved stretch. For this reason, the eight wheels of the wagon have been implemented in the numerical model instead of considering the superposition principle. This has considerably increased calculation times, but an improvement in the accuracy of the results has been obtained.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, a {{noticeable}} reduction of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overloads</b> after rail grinding has been achieved. Although {{it is observed}} that the sign and average value of the overload have remained virtually unchanged in 15 of the 16 cases after the grinding process, the amplitude of the forces of wheel–rail interaction has disappeared. Therefore, {{in the absence of any}} other pathology, rail grinding will allow counteracting the amplitude variation of the wheel–rail contact forces.|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{continue}} in this research field by analyzing the influence of rail grinding on the vibration generation phenomenon by a time domain feedback between a multi-body model of the vehicle and a FE model of the track. For this purpose, the dynamic forces resulting from the passage of the train through the track (defined as dynamic overloads) are calculated with a multi-body model and then incorporated to the FE model. For calculating of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload,</b> two cases are presented: the first one (case A) includes a track where the inner rail is corrugated, while the second one (case B) consists in a track without defects. Then, the influence of rail grinding will be evaluated by analyzing the different vibratory response of the FE model in both cases.|$|E
30|$|The {{paper is}} {{structured}} {{in a first}} theoretical part, in which the concepts underlying the classification of road profiles according to the ISO 8608 are synthetically included. The {{second part of the}} paper is dedicated to the modeling of vehicles with reference to the Quarter Car Model (QMC). In the third part of the paper, the operational phase of the study is developed, in which the road profiles taken into consideration interact in Matlab® environment with appropriate categories of vehicles (cars, buses and trucks). In this way, it is obtained the extent of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> in relation with various operating variables, such as types of vehicles, their speed of transit typology of the road profile, etc. These results are summarized in diagram form, and allow developing interesting considerations on the generation and extent of the vibrational phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Many {{overload}} control {{mechanisms for}} Web based applications aim to prevent overload by setting limits on {{factors such as}} admitted load, number of server threads, buffer size. For this they need online measurements of metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization. This requires instrumentation of the server by modifying server code, {{which may not be}} feasible or desirable. An alternate approach is to use a proxy between the clients and servers. We have developed a proxy-based overload control platform called MASTH Proxy–Multi-class Admissioncontrolled Self-Tuning Http Proxy. It records detailed measurements, supports multiple request classes, manages queues of HTTP requests, provides tunable parameters and enables easy implementation of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> control. This gives designers of overload control schemes a platform where they can concentrate on developing the core control logic, without the need to modify upstream server code...|$|E

40|$|Low {{contact ratio}} spur gears {{were tested in}} the NASA gear noise rig to study the noise {{radiated}} {{from the top of}} the gearbox. The measured sound power from the gearbox top was obtained from a near field acoustic intensity scan taken at 63 nodes just above the surface. The sound power was measured at a matrix of 45 operating speeds and torque levels. Results are presented in the form of a spectral speed map and as a plot of sound power versus torque (at constant speed) and as sound power versus speed (at constant torque). Because of the presence of vibration modes, operating speed was found to have more impact on noise generation than torque level. A NASA gear dynamics code was used to compute the gear tooth <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> at the same 45 operating conditions used for the experiment. Similar trends were found between the analytical results for dynamic tooth overload and experimental results for sound power.

40|$|Convenience, reliability, and {{effectiveness}} of automatic memory management have long been established in modern systems and programming languages such as Java. The timeliness requirements of real-time systems, however, impose specific demands on the operational parameters of the garbage collector.

Utility Accrual is a method of <b>dynamic</b> <b>overload</b> scheduling that is designed to respond to CPU overload conditions by producing a schedule that heuristically maximize a predefined metric of utility. There also exists in such systems the possibility of memory overload situations in which the cumulative memory demand exceeds the amount of memory available. This paper presents a utility accrual algorithm for uniprocessor CPU and garbage collection scheduling that addresses memory overload conditions. By tightly linking CPU and memory allocation, the scheduler can now appropriately respond to overload along both dimensions. This scheduler is {{the first of its kind}} to enable the use of automatic memory management in a utility accrual system.
