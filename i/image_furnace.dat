40|$|We have {{measured}} the specific heat of single crystals of the triple-layer Ruddlesden-Popper material, Sr 4 Ru 3 O 10, grown both in an <b>image</b> <b>furnace</b> and by flux-growth. The flux grown sample has a sharp mean-field-like anomaly {{at the onset}} of magnetic order, Tc = 102 K, but a much broader anomaly, indicative of residual heterogeneity, is observed for the <b>image</b> <b>furnace</b> sample. Even for the flux grown sample, however, the anomaly is at least an order of magnitude smaller than one would expect for complete ordering of the spins. Neither sample exhibits an anomaly at Tm ~ 50 K, where magnetic measurements suggest that basal plane antiferromagnetism sets in. Anomalous behavior (e. g. consistent with a term in the specific heat ~ T^ 3 / 2 as would be observed for a three-dimensional ferromagnet with weak exchange) is observed at low temperatures for both samples, indicative of the unusual magnetic order in this material.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} paper {{is to show that}} the <b>image</b> <b>furnace</b> is an {{efficient}} laboratory device for studying fundamental aspects of high temperature reactions involving a solid. The basic principle relies of solid heating by a concentrated radiation in very clean conditions. The available heat flux densities can be quantitatively controlled inside very large domains, which are quite similar as those encountered in usual pilot plant reactors. The <b>image</b> <b>furnace</b> qualities are experimentally studied in the particular case of biomass thermal conversion. Many results have been already published in the field of pyrolysis reactions. The present paper reports its ability to study also basic reactions of char steam gasification and of catalytic (olivine) cracking of vapours produced by biomass thermal degradation. These three types of reactions (decomposition of a solid; reaction of a gas with a solid; interaction of a vapour with a catalyst) can be studied independently from each other and in the same heat flux densities conditions. The results can be efficiently used for further worthwhile modelling of biomass gasifiers...|$|E

The aim {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate the feasibility of heat flux density modulation with a new improved vertical <b>image</b> <b>furnace</b> which is based on the former horizontal setup. This is achieved through the comparison of the experimental and theoretical surfaces temperatures evolutions. A numerical model is solved in order to estimate the theoretical surface temperature evolution of a char particle immersed in a fluidized bed at 1123 K. The goal of the experiments performed with char samples is to reproduce the same temperature evolutions. The surface temperatures profiles are measured by pyrometry in different conditions (constant heat flux density, variation of the heat flux density over time) and compared to the modeling results. The experiments at constant heat flux density show poor agreement with the model, in comparison with experiments made with variable heat flux density. The best agreement is obtained when the heat flux density is decreased from 560 kWm- 2 to 250 kWm- 2 in 1 second after a period of 500 ms...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, direct {{determination}} of mercury at the nanogram per liter {{level in the}} complex seawater matrix by imaging time-resolved electrothermal atomization laser-excited atomic fluorescence spectrometry (ITR-ETA-LEAFS) is described. In the case of mercury, {{the use of a}} nonresonant line for fluorescence detection with only one laser excitation is not possible. For measurements at the 253. 652 nm resonant line, scattering phenomena have been minimized by eliminating the simultaneous vaporization of salts and by using temporal resolution and the imaging mode of the camera. Electrothermal conditions (0. 1 M oxalic acid as matrix modifier, low atomization temperature) have been optimized in order to suppress chemical interferences and to obtain a good separation of specific signal and seawater background signal. For ETA-LEAFS, a specific response has been obtained for Hg with the use of time resolution.

The relative composition of the two determines the overall quality of the combustion and a proper balance is needed for optimum combustion in order to avoid wasting expensive fuel or producing hazardous emissions.
