5|$|The Nclass {{incorporated}} {{the principles of}} power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for <b>free</b> <b>running</b> up to , a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. These features are attributed to Holcroft, {{who worked on the}} GWR 4300class before joining the SECR. The boiler was intended to become a standard component for use on future SECR locomotive designs, thereby reducing building times and improving organisation at the works. The size was constrained by the heavier axle-loading of Maunsell’s proposed 2-6-4 tank locomotive variant of the Nclass, the Kclass, and was consequently smaller than was otherwise possible on the 2-6-0 chassis. The need to reduce overall weight also meant that the latter would feature lightly braced frames.|$|E

These demanding challenges for riders are held in New South Wales at Dalgety, Tamworth and Murrurundi plus The Man From Snowy River Challenge in Corryong, Victoria. Several New South Wales show societies, including Walcha, Bellingen and Dorrigo, hold special classes for registered Brumbies at their annual agricultural shows.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with <b>free</b> <b>running</b> and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E

25|$|Dachs is German for badger, a {{term used}} for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by {{crossbreeding}} long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke {{was used in}} German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (<b>free</b> <b>running</b> packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.|$|E

It is alluded that the old man may have connections to American intelligence circles and Tito hopes he can explain the mysterious death of his father. When the old man calls in a favour, his family dispatches Tito on a dangerous new assignment.|$|E
500|$|Maunsell and Holcroft {{completed}} {{plans for}} a new 3-cylinder locomotive in 1919. Designated N1, the new design was an attempt to increase the operational flexibility and power of the SECR 2-6-0 without substantially increasing axle loading. Holcroft's previous employment as an engineer involved with the GWR's 4300class meant that the N1 used the same Churchward features as the Nclass to aid standardisation and the manufacture of parts. These included the use of long-travel valves for <b>free</b> <b>running</b> at speed, right-hand drive in the cab and [...] driving wheels. The retention of the 2-6-0 wheel arrangement meant ample accommodation for the Nclass' tapered boiler with Belpaire firebox. As with the Nclass, detail design on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell's assistants, James Clayton, who brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design: the loading gauge-friendly shape of the cab, the tender and the large-diameter smokebox. The smokebox housed a large superheater, regulator valve and snifting (anti-vacuum) valves. [...] The N1 also retained Walschaerts valve gear on both outside cylinders.|$|E

500|$|The Kclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell's team in 1914 {{as part of his}} proposed standardisation programme following the Nclass, but the designs were not shown to the railway directors until early 1915 to enable all six designs to be shown at once. The design incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by George Churchward, using a Belpaire firebox that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the smokebox, long-travel valves for <b>free</b> <b>running</b> at high speeds, a sharply tapered and domeless boiler, and a right-hand driving position. The inclusion of these features is attributed to Holcroft, Maunsell's personal assistant, who had worked on the GWR 4300class and the Nclass. James Clayton, Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, brought simpler and more functional Midland Railway influences to the design, such as the shape of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. The latter was fitted with Ross pop safety valves and pressed to [...]|$|E
500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He {{is the one who}} hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and <b>free</b> <b>running</b> skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell for sure if he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the whole place collapses - which is either possible thanks to his <b>free</b> <b>running</b> abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E
