40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} {{prediction model}} of rock <b>drillability</b> {{is based on}} regression analysis using well logging data. Regression analysis directly uses initial data to establish model, so its precision is not satisfied. By accumulating initial data, gray theory model (GM (0,N)) is able to weaken the random of initial data. Therefore, a practical approach to calculate the rock <b>drillability,</b> which base on GM(0,N) using well logging data, is presented in this paper. Based on the inherent relation of well logging information and rock <b>drillability,</b> a lot of logging parameters are selected closely to rock <b>drillability,</b> and the prediction model of rock <b>drillability</b> are established by GM(0,N). This method is applied to logging data process of Du 4 well in SC oil field, {{the results show that}} it can improve predicting accuracy of rock <b>drillability,</b> and can easily frame rock <b>drillability</b> profile in some areas. ...|$|E

Unfortunately, there are many limits in the current definition as well as experimental methods. <b>Drillability</b> is redefined and a new concept of <b>drillability</b> index is brought out from analysis. Under the new concept, the <b>drillability</b> index is defined as penetration rate under specific energy. Based on the coupling relationship among effective thrust, rotation speed, penetration rate and <b>drillability</b> index, a calculation formula is established.

40|$|The {{formation}} <b>drillability</b> is {{an elusive}} parameter. For theoretical consideration it considered constant {{and given a}} value which is representative for the <b>drillability</b> for formations in the Mexican Gulf. The <b>drillability</b> has several applications: With proper <b>drillability</b> calculations, parameter like pore pressure can be estimated more correctly. The formation types can be determined while drilling into them so that drilling crews can better handle the drilling operation. These are important parts to consider when drilling a new well. To prevent loss of every calculation must be as close to reality as possible. In this thesis two methods have been chosen to be incorporated into an data agent that will calculate formation <b>drillability</b> in real time. The Bourgoyne-Young method with eight functions related to rate of penetration, and Eaton?s method utilizing the d-exponents to normalize penetration rate. Both methods uses a set of Real Time Drilling Data and other pressure gradients. The agent has successfully computed <b>drillability</b> for both methods, and {{the results have been}} analyzed and interpreted. The result of the analysis shows that both methods compute drillabilities that coincide with the information known about the formation. Since rate of penetration is responding both to <b>drillability</b> and pore pressure, it has been necessary in the present work to select areas in the field data where pore pressure has been constant. In this way only <b>drillability</b> has been the main unknown. In relatively shallow areas the pore pressure is normal, meaning it is constantly equal to the equivalent pore pressure density of 1. 03 kg/l. The agent has potential to become a fully functional tool. It needs some work on its data processing feature, including compatibility with direct real time drilling data. The next priority in the development should be incorporating the results into a formation type classification tool. </p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that {{the characteristics of}} hardness and <b>drillability</b> are influenced by microstructure of rock. In this study, rock properties were analyzed on grain size and grain content. Coarse-grain and fine-grain sandstones were tested under successive indentation condition. Eighteen groups of sandstone and shale were employed for the <b>drillability</b> test. Indentation tests results showed that grain size influenced the low point of residual hardness, the crushing depth and volume and grain content influenced the peak point of hardness. The <b>drillability</b> values of shale increased with increasing contents of clay and quartz. Meanwhile, <b>drillability</b> values of sandstone increased with increasing content of quartz, but decreased with increasing content of clay.

40|$|First online: 13 January 2016 Rock {{drilling}} Penetration Rate (PR) {{is influenced}} by many parameters including rock properties, machine parameters of the chosen rig and the working process. Five datasets were utilized to quantitatively assess the effect of various rock properties on PR. The datasets consisted of two sets of diamond and percussive drilling and one set of rotary drilling data. A new rating system called Rock <b>Drillability</b> Characterization index (RDCi) is proposed to predict PR for different drilling methods. This <b>drillability</b> model incorporates {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} of intact rock, the P-wave velocity and the density of rock. The RDCi system is further applied to predict PR in the diamond rotary drilling, non-coring rotary drilling and percussive drilling. Strong correlations between PR and RDCi values were observed indicating that the developed <b>drillability</b> rating model is relevant and can be utilized to effectively predict the rock <b>drillability</b> in any operating environment.

The results of rock strength, diamond and percussion <b>drillability</b> tests in eleven sandstones, marbles and igneous rocks are reported, and correlated with the developed texture coefficient. The texture coefficient returns highly statistically significant correlations with rock strength and <b>drillability</b> data.

The advancements in {{drilling}} {{have always}} {{depended on the}} cost of drilling of new wellbores, therefore mathematical models of the drilling process were elaborated to minimize the cost. The first simple models based on a few fundamental parameters, were then developed into complex, computer-based models employing many variables. Models made for cutter bits are used for PDC tools. They contain formulae accounting for drilling parameters and wearing of the bit. The paper addresses works which prove that in some particular situations the influence of the tools wear on the drop of rate of penetration can be neglected, thanks to which simple formulae are obtained, based on the fundamental parameters and which are easily applicable in the field conditions. The MSE is an amount of energy used for drilling a given volume of rock. This approach is useful and practicable because allows for detecting possible inefficiencies in a relatively short time (as compared to other parameters).

40|$|Drill bits having {{cutting edges}} formed of {{a matrix of}} {{sintered}} metal powder impregnated with diamond bort (the so called "impregnated" diamond bits) {{have the potential to}} greatly increase the economy of diamond drilling, due to low production costs and long bit life resulting from reconditioning of the cutting edges. However, little detailed research into the performance of impregnated bits has been conducted, and the capacity to predict their field behaviour is limited. As a contribution to the knowledge of impregnated bit performance, this project has studied basic relationships between thrust, rotational speed and the penetration of diamond bits into rock, with particular attention paid to the development of techniques suitable for laboratory testing using miniature impregnated bits. A conventional bench drill and a radial arm drill were modified and instrumented to enable operating conditions to be controlled and drilling parameters to be measured and monitored, for microscale and fullscale drilling using impregnated drill bits. Bit performance and drilling characteristics were studied for four rock types, and rock <b>drillability</b> studies were carried out on seven rock types. Statistical relationships between penetration rate, specific energy, torque and drilling distance that were determined enable projection of drilling data from a standard "sharp" condition. A wear measuring device was developed to assess matrix wear of the impregnated microbits. Reconditioning was done by drilling medium-strength, abrasive Stawell sandstone. Initial penetration rate increases linearly with increases in thrust and/or rotational speed, but only within a limited range, depending on rock type and the other operating parameters. Matrix contact with the rock surface, "clogging" of the diamonds, time-dependency, and strength of diamonds and the diamond-matrix bond play important roles in these phenomena.

We analyzed the amplitude-frequency characteristics of steady-state mechanical vibration excited by harmonic vibration in rocks and an apparatus was built to achieve high frequency vibration of rock. The influence of rock <b>drillability,</b> rotary speed, excitation frequency, and other parameters on the rate of penetration (ROP) in resonance drilling was analyzed. The {{results show that the}} rock <b>drillability</b> decreased with an increase in excitation frequency. When drilling with a large size drill bit, the ROP increased with excitation frequency. The ROP reached a maximum value at the resonant frequency of the rock. The ROP of the bit increased linearly with rotary speed when no vibration was applied on the rock and increased approximately exponentially when harmonic vibration was applied. In addition, the resonant frequency of the rock was changing during the process of rock fragmentation, so in order to achieve the desired resonance of the rock, it is necessary to determine an appropriate harmonic vibration excitation frequency.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of drilling a well {{is the potential}} economic profit. The total cost of a drilling operation result from a complex interplay of many factors (Graham and Muench, 1959). Work that can optimize some of these factors is desirable, {{and the need for}} information that can eliminate unfortunate incidents resulting in increased operational time and make the operation more efficient is constant. Well cemented layers and the composition of the cemented materials are the main causes of hard stringers. Hard stringers may lead to severe downhole problems like washouts, severe local doglegs and keyseats. Such downhole problems are often related to the unexpected appearance of hard stringers and may cause the drill string to stick and result in lost time. Hard and soft stringers may be detected through real-time drilling data. This is achieved by comparing different drilling parameters, like rotary speed (RPM), weight on bit (WOB) and block position (BPOS). A decrease in RPM followed by an increase in WOB indicates hard formations. However, manual analyses are time consuming and inefficient. A modified and improved version of the hardness detection program previously developed by Solberg (2011) is presented in present thesis. The model is based on a simplified version of the rate of penetration (ROP) equation proposed by Bourgoyne and Young (1986). <b>Drillability</b> is the desirable result from the equation, as <b>drillability</b> is the inverse of hardness. Not all the functional relations that initially are part of the ROP equation have been assumed relevant for the detection of soft and hard stringers. Some of them alter only gradually, either with depth or as the drilling operation progresses, and do not affect the sudden change in <b>drillability</b> as the well is being drilled. WOB, RPM and ROP (&# 916;BPOS/&# 916;t) are drilling parameters chosen as relevant for present work. They are obtained through real-time drilling data and utilized in the calculations of <b>drillability.</b> Exponents related to the WOB and the RPM functions will frequently vary with the hardness in the formation. However, frequent manipulation of the exponents is difficult to achieve and only one soft and one hard formation exponent related to each exponent type have been applied. The final result shows a plot of hardness variation with depth. The plot has been proved to correlate well with experienced hard stringers stated in the Final Well Report. The program has been proved to be able to detect lithology transitions. The boundaries of particularly the Utsira Fm are evident on the hardness curve. The detection of Utsira Fm is enhanced by both gamma ray and sonic log from the same formation in wells nearby. Correlations between the two logs and hardness have been established. However, due to absence of sonic and gamma ray data from Well 0, the trustworthiness of the establishment is hard to evaluate. </p...|$|E

40|$|The works {{published}} {{until today}} about lithological interpretation in drilling, use the ROP, rate of penetration, {{as the base}} for the diagnosis. These analyses are poorly detailed and often limited to distinction between hard and soft layers. This thesis establishes a direct relationship between lithology and <b>drillability,</b> using well data from Gullfaks 34 / 10 C- 47. This relationship provides the basis for standardization of the parameter. The model was made from the equation relating the ROP to WOB, weight on bit; RPM, revolutions per minute; and K, <b>drillability</b> at each point. The values for each drilling point were obtained from C- 47 data and after being treated, they generated the graph which enabled numerical association between K and lithology. The main difficulty which was presented was the standardization of K. The formula for the model {{does not account for}} the size and type of bit causing different values of the ratio K-lithology in each of the sections; additionally, in overpressured areas K values are unreliable. However, it is possible to establish a relationship between the K values from the different sections allowing the estimation of the theoretical value of K for a lithology which is not present in a section. The parameter K enables better lithological interpretation than simply using ROP. The use of this new parameter only requires a software implementation in existing equipment, so it does not require a large investment in time and money for its operationalization. The next step for widespread application is the refinement in obtaining the parameter by using other factors which influence it. </p...|$|E

Drilling {{of large}} {{diameter}} wells {{to be used}} for dewatering of lignite deposits is inefficient due to the presence of large packages of loose Quaternary and Tertiary strata. Moreover, considerable dewatering of the rock mass favors serious complications and drilling break-downs connected with the sliding of wellbore walls. Accordingly, new technical and technological solutions, which enable faster drilling, are searched for. In this way the time of operation of drilling mud on the near-wellbore zone can be shortened and the safety of drilling works increased. For the sake of obtaining higher rates of drilling in large diameter dewatering wellbores a new cutter bit 0. 96 m of diameter was designed. <b>Drillability</b> tests in industrial conditions followed. These tests were performed in separated, loose and low-compaction, macroscopically homogeneous rocks of similar <b>drillability.</b> The tests were performed on selected sections 0. 3 to 1. 0 m long, and each of the sections was drilled at constant rotational velocity and weight on bit. Prior to these tests there were established limitations regarding weight on bit and rotational velocity of the bit, in reference to the technical characteristic of the rig, strength of the string and the cutter bit. Two different regression models were considered to find a dependence of mechanical drilling rate on weight on bit and rotational velocity of the bit for selected macroscopically homogeneous strata. The most favorable results were obtained for a power model representing impact of axial stress and rotational velocity of the bit on the drilling rate. They have been confirmed by calculated regression coefficients and statistical parameters. Industrial tests were performed to assess the efficiency of drilling large diameter dewatering wells with a cutter bit of 0. 96 m diameter {{on the basis of the}} presented model of average drilling rate.

40|$|International audiencePDC {{drill bit}} {{performances}} in hard rock {{has been greatly}} improved during the last decades by innovations in PDC wear, impact resistance and better vibrations understanding. The bit design is generally done by balancing the bit, distributing uniform wear along the profile and achieving high <b>drillability</b> and steerability. To obtain required drilling performances, drill bit designer adjust features such as profile shape, gage and mainly cutter characteristics (shape, type and orientation). Cutter rock interaction model became a critical feature in the design process. But previously used models considered only three forces on a cutter based on the cutter-rock contact area : drag force, normal force and side force. Such models are no longer valid {{with the introduction of}} PDC cutters with chamfer and special shape. This paper presents a new cutter rock interaction model including some several improvements. It is based on the presence of a build-up edge of crushed materials on the cutting face often described in the literature. In addition, the chamfer, which significantly affects bit Rate Of Penetration (ROP), is taken into account (shape and size). Forces applied {{on the back of the}} cutter and due to the rock deformation and back flow of crushed materials are considered in the model. Finally, results of numerous single cutter tests (under atmospheric and confining pressure) are presented and compared to the new cutter rock interaction model predictions. An analysis of the influence of the PDC characteristics (shape, size, chamfer, back and side rake angles, [...] ) is presented. The model has been applied to optimize the cutting efficiency and bit steerability and some design rules are given to minimize the specific energy and maximize the rate of penetration.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} geological/technical challenges affecting engineering projects in chalk with flints either for hydrocarbon/water exploration or infrastructural development is encountering flints, which mostly result in excessive wear or damage to cutting tools or drilling/tunnelling equipment. Overcoming this requires a regional understanding of the engineering properties of flints which are linked to various factors including the genesis/diagenesis of flints. To date, the genesis of flints remains debatable and the controls on engineering properties of flints on a regional basis have not been systematically investigated. This study sets to investigate: the genesis of flints, the engineering properties of flints across various geographical locations, the variations in these properties with colour, structures, origin, and morphology of flints, and the tectonic history of the host chalk. To achieve these objectives a series of physicomechanical and petrophysical tests on flints and associated structures sampled from the Danish, English and French chalks have been carried out. A <b>drillability</b> test focusing on the grey and dark brownish grey flints using a standard tricone bit to reflect the rock mass characteristics of flint has been conducted. Petrographic studies comprising scanning electron microscopy, scanning electron microcopy-cathodoluminescence and X-ray diffraction have then been applied to analyse the genesis, diagenesis, microstructures, microtexture, and mineral phase/composition of flints. Results support the biogenic origin of flints through a calcite-silica replacement process and illustrate that engineering properties of flints correlate with colour, origin, and the diagenesis of flints, plus the properties and tectonic history of the host chalk. This study demonstrates that physicomechanical properties of flints are controlled by their micro-structures/texture/fractures, structures, calcite inclusions and mineral compositions. The dark brownish grey flints with finer microtexture are the strongest, stiffest, densest, hardest, most abrasive and least porous materials with extremely high potentials to cause drill wear. By comparison, the grey flints located in a highly tectonized zone behave differently and are the weakest, less dense, less abrasive and the most porous flints with relatively lower potentials to cause drill wear.

However, the technology is not always preferred as time is a key factor for offshore operations and a pile <b>drillability</b> analysis is generally more complex and less reliable than a drivability assessment. This paper extends the results of previous researches, which considered a theoretical drilling rate model based on the estimation of the specific excavation energy, applying a probabilistic approach. To consider the uncertainty of the geotechnical parameters of soil/rock used in drilling pile projects, a statistical method-that is, the Monte-Carlo method, has been applied to two cases of weak rock/cemented soil. It was possible to obtain the theoretical drilling rate values as a probabilistic distribution in order to assess the reliability of the estimation. It is important to understand that the drilling rates are based on a theoretical approach {{and they have to be}} considered as such. © 2017 ICE Publishing. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{object of}} this thesis is to analyse and {{optimise}} the drill bits performance {{that used to}} drill on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The three different types of bits that were utilized under drilling are described {{in the first part}} of the thesis. The different aspects of designs and features are discussed and their technological advantages are highlighted. In the second part of the thesis an experimental tests are conducted. The main purpose of this test is to evaluate the performance, efficiency and stability of 9 ½ inch Kymera (KM 623), against 9 ½ inch PDC (6 bladed), and 9 ½ inch (TCI) VMD - 20. The test will compare the <b>drillability</b> (ROP), durability (dullgrade, wear etc) and stability of Kymera vs PDC and TCI. All the bits will be tested in the same formation types and strenghts at the same range of RPM and ROP parameters. Bit response, stability and MSE will be evaluated in order to better understand bit behavior in the subject formation. The analyses and conclusions will be used for future field drilling optimization and advice in offshore operations...|$|E
40|$|The {{geologic}} {{condition in}} Yuanba Area is quite complex. The drilling problems of formation leakage, pressure differential sticking, narrow density windows {{and other issues}} {{are more and more}} prominent. Drilling efficiency is low with long drilling cycle because of abnormal complex engineering geological characteristics such as thick continental formation, interbeded sand shale, poor <b>drillability,</b> ultra-high pressure in J 1 z and T 3 x formation, narrow pressure window. 12 completed wells in Yuanba area are analyzed, the conclusion can be draw that improving drilling efficiency in Yuanba region is quite potential if complexity underlying can be decreased and ROP can be improved. In view of this, the matching drilling technologies and tools are introduced and applied, the result show that optimization technology of casing program, bit optimization, gas drilling technology, compound drilling technology and corresponding new tools has made great success in Yuanba area, the average ROP was increased by 20. 25 %, drilling period was shortened by 18. 33 %, and the average complex accident handling time was reduced by 25. 40 %, which provides a good reference for ultra-deep well drilling.

40|$|Several {{mathematical}} ROP {{models were}} developed {{in the last five}} decades in the petroleum industry, departing from rather simple but less reliable R-W-N (drilling rate, weight on bit, and rotary speed) formulations until the arrival to more comprehensive and complete approaches such as the Bourgoyne and Young ROP model (BYM) widely used in the petroleum industry. The paper emphasizes the BYM formulation, how it is applied in terms of ROP modeling, identifies the main drilling parameters driving each subfunction, and introduces how they were developed; the paper is also addressing the normalization factors and modeling coefficients which have significant influence on the model. The present work details three simulations aiming to understand the approach by applying the formulation in a presalt layer and how some modification of the main method may impact the modeling of the fitting process. The simulation runs show that the relative error measures {{can be seen as the}} most reliable fitting verification on top of R-squared. Applying normalization factors and by allowing a more wide range of applicable <b>drillability</b> coefficients, the regression could allow better fitting of the simulation to real data from 54 % to 73 %, which is an improvement of about 20 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: PDC bit {{drilling}} rate {{equation is}} one measuring criterion of PDC bit work efficiency. The reasonable PDC bit drilling rate equation could predict the penetration rate and provide guidance for field operation. This paper studied the in-fluences of the parameters on PDC bit drilling rate, such as rock <b>drillability,</b> cutting teeth diameter, specific weight on bit and rotate speed, and regressed the relation equations between the above parameters and drilling rate for cement rock, white sandstone, yellow sandstone, red sandstone and granite {{based on the}} laboratory rock breaking experiments. The re-sults showed that the regression equation between specific weight on bit and drilling rate is quadratic polynomial for the soft and intermediate hardness rock, such as cement rock, yellow sandstone and white sandstone. The regression equation is quartic polynomial, the regression equation between rotate speed and drilling rate is quadratic polynomial for the inter-mediate hardness rock, such as red sandstone. The field data verification results of Daqing Oilfield medium-deep well showed the fractional error in actual drilling speed and forecast drilling speed between 3. 03 % and 9. 23 % and the average error is 6. 397 %. This explained that the modified PDC bit drilling rate equation could describe the drilling law preferably...|$|E
40|$|Key Words: igneous rock; {{impregnated}} diamond bit; bit design; diamond parameters; compound drilling Abstract: Igneous {{rocks of}} Junggar Basin are hard, strong abrasive and poor <b>drillability.</b> ROP {{is low in}} drilling these rocks, and drilling cycle is long, which seriously affect the process of exploration and development in the Carboniferous reservoir. Considering the igneous rock formation characteristics and the drilling problems, using PDC impregnated diamond high strength, super abrasion as the main rock breaking device, {{a new type of}} cutting and grinding of diamond impregnated bit was developed. This bit has the following characteristics: Compound cutting structure with blades and cylindrical Impregnated cutters; big nozzle in the center + deep radiation water slot hydraulic structures; Natural diamond and TSP lengthened gauge design; Selection of 40 / 50 mesh diamond grit, mix two kinds of inserts with diamond concentration 70 %. The bit has the combination of impregnated bit and PDC drill bit technical advantages, which improve the bit adaptability to the formations. Hassan 3 Carboniferous igneous formations field test shows that: average ROP is 0. 71 m / h, single bit footage is 86. 5 m, which increased by about 20 % and 302 % respectively compared with high efficient three-roller bits. The success usage of this bit in Hassan 3 provide an effective means for high quality fast drilling in Junggar Basin igneous rock formation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} strength of rock {{is one of}} the most important factors of concern to engineers involved in mining operations. Information about rock strength is used in rock excavation planning and design operations in civil and mining engineering. Drilling is widely carried out in hard rocks for blasting the rock mass so that the blasted material can be easily loaded by the excavators. The <b>drillability</b> of rock depends on many factors including rock properties whereas properties such as compressive strength, porosity, density etc. are uncontrollable parameters during drilling process. A number of studies have been reported recently on the application of sound level which have been concentrated on using either CNC or jack hammer machine for drilling purpose. It is worth mentioning that neither CNC machine nor jack hammer drill set-up is the normal way of drilling in rock, nor in mining, civil or any other operations, not even in working with rock in installation of countertops. Therefore, it is difficult to exactly say whether the noise generated during drilling is only from the rock drilling or from the drilling unit itself. In view of the above, it is important to fabricate a new drilling set-up which is a silent unit in itself. Such unit when used for drilling purpose will clearly indicate the change in sound level produced with different rock properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two {{coarse-grained}} granitic rocks- charnockite and {{biotite granite}} – were studied {{with the aim}} of estimating their unconfined compressive strength from simpler non-destructive test values. The simpler tests were the ultrasonic pulse velocity, the Schmidt hammer rebound, and the specific gravity. Another test carried out was the moisture absorption. The rocks had compressive strength in the range 115 - 250 MPa, Schmidt hammer rebound number or index of 35 - 55, and pulse velocity of 3. 4 - 5. 5 km/s. The correlation coefficients between the uniaxial compressive strength and the rebound number were 0. 86 and 0. 81 for the biotite granite and the charnockite, respectively. Products of the rebound index and the pulse velocity and the specific gravity improved the correlation coefficients to 0. 94 and 0. 91 respectively. The high correlation factors implied that the compressive strength can be estimated using the simpler tests parameters. These simpler parameters also relate indirectly to geomechanical properties of the rocks such as <b>drillability,</b> boreability and machine tool wear. The moisture absorption alone and its combination with the rebound number correlated inversely and poorly with the compressive strength. The correlation coefficient ranged between – 0. 45 to – 0. 67. The moisture absorption therefore proved to be a poor predictor of the uniaxial compressive strength of the rocks...|$|E
