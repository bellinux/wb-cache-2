50|$|The town seal {{is a view}} of Middlefield as {{seen through}} a <b>gun</b> <b>sight.</b> The {{crosshairs}} represent the <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> manufacturing {{that has taken place}} in Middlefield for many years. The four quadrants of the <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> are broken into different aspects of the town of Middlefield. The upper left-hand quadrant is a picture of the 1700s saltbox homes that still stand in Middlefield. The upper right-hand quadrant represents the orchards and farmland that make up much of the open space of Middlefield. The lower left-hand quadrant represents many of the outdoor activities that go on in Middlefield such as fishing, hunting, boating, skiing, golfing, and many other activities. The lower right-hand quadrant is the old pistol shop that used to be a major part of Middlefield's makeup. The seal was designed by Donald Ginter.|$|R
40|$|Construction for a 19 th-century Confederate ironclad ram {{known as}} CSS Georgia began in March 1862 after the Ladies Gunboat Association of Savannah, Georgia raised the {{necessary}} funds. However, Georgia never saw action and {{spent most of}} its career moored on the Savannah River. The Confederates intentionally sunk Georgia as General William T. Sherman?s troops approached Savannah in 1864 to prevent its capture by Union forces. It spent the next 150 years {{at the bottom of the}} channel. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District, in partnership with Panamerican Consultants, Inc., the Conservation Research Laboratory (CRL) at Texas A&M University, and the U. S. Naval History and Heritage Command, organized the recovery of thousands of artifacts and sent many of them to the CRL for subsequent conservation. This vast collection of artifacts includes a set of brass naval instruments known as <b>gun</b> <b>sights.</b> Their use enhanced the accuracy of guns during engagements at sea. Additionally, Georgia yielded brass percussion locks that facilitated the instantaneous discharge of naval guns. They represent one of the largest archaeologically recovered collections of naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks from this era. A brief historical survey of the introduction of guns at sea places the naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks within a broader context. Between the 16 th-century and the Civil War, the world?s navies placed different kinds of <b>sighting</b> mechanisms on <b>guns</b> and these continued to improve until their culmination in the form of the complex naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks recovered from Georgia. The design and use of the Georgia <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> reflects an understanding of the physical properties of a projectile in flight. The evolution of naval gunnery, sighting mechanisms used on guns, and the scientific understanding of the physical properties of a projectile in flight all form a strong basis from which a detailed analysis of the naval <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> and percussion locks under study can be made. This research sheds more light on aspects of naval gunnery during the Civil War...|$|R
5|$|As the {{computor}} {{held the}} level line and was sending angle commands to the sight, it eliminated {{the need for}} a two-axis gyro in the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> itself. The gyro on the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its roll axis.|$|R

5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as <b>gun</b> <b>sights</b> on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft <b>gun</b> <b>sights,</b> anti tank <b>gun</b> <b>sights,</b> and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a dependable sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|R

500|$|The <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> {{was mounted}} {{on top of}} a square platform, with screw {{adjustments}} {{that could be used to}} level the platform. A spirit level on the sight allowed it to be checked. The normally periodic and minor changes required to level the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> could be performed by removing the cover over the [...] spirit level and then turning a small adjusting screw on the mount. Pressing the release lever unlocked the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> from the mounting shaft on the left of the platform, allowing the sight to be removed and then re-attached simply by sliding it back onto the shaft, maintaining the level setting between missions.|$|R

5000|$|Marble Arms & Manufacturing Company of Gladstone, Michigan {{began in}} 1892 with the {{invention}} and manufacture of the Marble Universal Rifle Sight by Webster L. Marble. Frank H. Van Cleve of Escanaba, Michigan shared patent rights {{on some of}} the early patents applied for by Webster L. Marble. [...] Products expanded to include outdoor goods like a novel safety axe, hunting knives, match safes, compasses and the Marble Game Getter combination gun. The company grew to be foremost manufacturer of <b>gun</b> <b>sights,</b> competing with rivals such as Lyman, Redfield, Pacific, King, and Williams <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> companies. Still in business in Gladstone, Michigan, Marble Arms remains an important member of the firearm and shooting sports industry.|$|R
5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> and the computor. The <b>sighting</b> <b>head</b> was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|R
5000|$|... "Participants use the {{joystick}} to {{keep the}} <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> on the airplane as it moves at a constant rate. The airplane randomly changes direction when it hits {{the side of the}} screen or if a participant successfully targets it for multiple seconds." ...|$|R
50|$|Trijicon {{was founded}} in 1981 by Glyn Bindon as Armson USA, the sole US {{importer}} and distributor of the Armson OEG. The Armson OEG was an occluded type <b>gun</b> <b>sight</b> that used tritium and fiber optics in its construction and was manufactured in South Africa.|$|R
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the <b>sight</b> <b>head</b> stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|R
50|$|Often a target, {{for example}} a {{vertical}} wooden sighting panel (or a sighting pole, {{not unlike a}} surveyor's target rod) was placed precisely over the DP marker so that the guns of the battery could sight on it and adjust the offsets of their <b>gun</b> <b>sights.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Suddenly {{the drone}} turned back towards Los Angeles. Einstein and Hurliman {{were forced to}} switch from the faulty {{automatic}} mode to manual fire. The D-model Scorpions had been delivered with <b>gun</b> <b>sights,</b> but when the E-6 fire-control system was later added, the sights were removed. Now, with the radar-guided system inoperative and no <b>gun</b> <b>sight,</b> the attackers were forced to manually aim the unguided rockets. The F-89D was capable of firing all 104 of it rockets at once, all leaving their tubes in only 0.4 s. The rockets could also be set to [...] "ripple fire" [...] in two different patterns: two ripples (64 and 42 rockets) or three ripples (42, 32, and 30 rockets). A single hit was sufficient to bring down an aircraft. Murray and Hale set their intervalometers to [...] "ripple fire" [...] in three salvos.|$|R
