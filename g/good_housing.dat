25|$|There {{was a lack}} of <b>good</b> <b>housing</b> and a {{proliferation}} of squatter settlements. Combined with the high unemployment rate, this led to social problems from crime, a low standard of living, and unrest. The other deleterious effect of squatter settlements was that many of these were built of highly flammable materials, were poorly constructed and thus posed a high fire risk. A prominent example in this case is the Bukit Ho Swee Squatter Fire that broke out in 1961. In addition, there was poor sanitation, which led to the spread of infectious diseases.|$|E
500|$|In the inter-war period, {{officers}} led a [...] "country club existence". They {{had a high}} social standing, {{equivalent to}} that of an upper-middle-class professional. They normally worked a 30-hour week, which gave them {{plenty of time to}} spend with their families, and for sports. They and their families had access to free medical and dental care. They had free life insurance, and an adequate salary, which could be stretched because Army commissaries and post exchanges sold many everyday goods tax-free. [...] They invariably lived on-base in <b>good</b> <b>housing,</b> and in tight-knit and supportive communities. When posted overseas, they took their families with them. A secure and steady job was highly prized during the Great Depression years from 1929 to 1939, and resignations were rare.|$|E

2500|$|In 1887, Lever bought [...] of {{land on the}} Wirral in Cheshire {{between the}} River Mersey and the railway line at Bebington. This site became Port Sunlight where he built his works and a model village to house its employees. From 1888, Port Sunlight village offered decent living {{conditions}} {{in the belief that}} <b>good</b> <b>housing</b> would ensure a healthy and happy workforce. The community was designed to house and support the workers. Life in Port Sunlight included intrusive rules and implied mandatory participation in activities. The tied cottages meant that a worker losing his or her job could be almost simultaneously evicted.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{sustainable}} {{development is a}} recent, controversial concept. Wheeler, in his 2004 book, defines sustainable urban development as [...] "development that improves the long-term social and ecological health of cities and towns." [...] He sketches a 'sustainable' city's features: compact, efficient land use; less automobile use, yet better access; efficient resource use; less pollution and waste; the restoration of natural systems; <b>good</b> <b>housing</b> and living environments; a healthy social ecology; a sustainable economy; community participation and involvement; and preservation of local culture and wisdom. Urban planners are now promoting a sustainable city model, which consists of cities that designed with consideration of environmental impacts, such as minimising the uses of energy, water, and the outputs of waste and pollution.|$|E
60|$|When we {{definitely}} turned our backs {{on the potential}} poultry-farm offered us at our hotel, we found ourselves in as <b>good</b> <b>housing</b> at another, overlooking the length and breadth of the stately Plaza San Fernando, with its parallelogram of tall palms, under a full moon swimming in a cloudless heaven by night and by day. By day, of course, we did not see it, but the sun was visibly there, rather blazing hot, even in mid-October, and showing more distinctly than the moon the beautiful tower of the Giralda from the waist up, and {{the shoulder of the}} great cathedral, besides features of other noble, though less noble, edifices. Our plaza was so full of romantic suggestion that I am rather glad now I had no association with it. I am sure I could not have borne at the time to know, as I have only now learned by recurring to my Baedeker, that in the old Franciscan cloister once there had stood the equestrian statue of the Comendador who dismounts and comes unbidden to the supper of Don Giovanni in the opera. That was a statue which, seen in my far youth, haunted my nightmares for many a year, and I am sure it would have kept me from sleep in the conditions, now so perfect, of our new housing if I had known, about it.|$|E
