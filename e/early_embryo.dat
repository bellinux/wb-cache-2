5|$|Such a {{cascading}} regulatory {{network has}} been studied in detail {{in the development of}} the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the <b>early</b> <b>embryo,</b> the bicoid and hunchback genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the caudal and nanos genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of caudals messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.|$|E
25|$|Wnt {{signaling}} and beta-catenin dependent {{gene expression}} plays {{a critical role}} during the formation of different body regions in the <b>early</b> <b>embryo.</b> Experimentally modified embryos that do not express this protein will fail to develop mesoderm and initiate gastrulation. During the blastula and gastrula stages, Wnt as well as BMP and FGF pathways will induce the antero-posterior axis formation, regulate the precise placement of the primitive streak (gastrulation and mesoderm formation) {{as well as the}} process of neurulation (central nervous system development).|$|E

30|$|The active DNA {{demethylation}} in <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> {{is essential}} for subsequent development. Although the zygotic genome is globally demethylated, the DNA methylation of imprinted regions, part of repeat sequences and some gamete-specific regions are maintained. Recent evidence has shown that multiple proteins and biological pathways participate in the regulation of active DNA demethylation, such as TET proteins, DNA repair pathways and DNA methyltransferases. Here we review the recent understanding regarding proteins associated with active DNA demethylation and the regulatory networks controlling the active DNA demethylation in <b>early</b> <b>embryos.</b>|$|R
25|$|The testes {{begin as}} an {{immigration}} of primordial germ cells into testicular cords along the gonadal ridge in the abdomen of the <b>early</b> <b>embryo.</b> The interaction of several male genes organizes this developing gonad into a testis {{rather than an}} ovary by the second month of gestation. During the 3rd to 5th months, the cells in the testes differentiate into testosterone-producing Leydig cells, and anti-Müllerian hormone-producing Sertoli cells. The germ cells in this environment become fetal spermatogonia. Male external genitalia develop during the 3rd and 4th months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{signaling}} {{has been}} most extensively studied {{in the context of}} human diseases and signaling between cells of a single organism. However, cell signaling may also occur between the cells of two different organisms. In many mammals, <b>early</b> <b>embryo</b> cells exchange signals with cells of the uterus. In the human gastrointestinal tract, bacteria exchange signals {{with each other and with}} human epithelial and immune system cells. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during mating, some cells send a peptide signal (mating factor pheromones) into their environment. The mating factor peptide may bind to a cell surface receptor on other yeast cells and induce them to prepare for mating.|$|E
25|$|After {{fertilization}} of the oocyte, the <b>early</b> <b>embryo</b> (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions {{until about}} 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By {{the end of}} the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, gastrulation starts.|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: MicroRNA- 29 b (miR 29 b) {{has been}} {{previously}} identified in <b>early</b> mouse <b>embryos</b> through miRNA microarray analysis. Recent {{research has indicated that}} miR 29 b participates in DNA methylation by regulating DNA methyltransferase 3 a/ 3 b (Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b) expression. However, the expression pattern and biological function of miR 29 b in mouse preimplantation embryonic development remain unknown. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression patterns of miR 29 b and Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b in mouse <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> at different developmental stages. Subsequently, expression and localization of DNMT 3 A/ 3 B protein was analyzed in mouse <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> by immunofluorescence staining. The biological function of miR 29 b in mouse <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> was analyzed by microinjection of commercially available miRNA-specific inhibitors and mimics. Results: Our data showed that Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b mRNA expression is negatively regulated by miR 29 b in mouse <b>early</b> <b>embryos.</b> Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that DNMT 3 A/ 3 B protein expression is predominantly localized within the nucleoplasm of embryos. Alterations to the activity of miR 29 b could change the DNA methylation levels in mouse preimplantation embryos and lead to a developmental blockade, from the morula to the blastocyst stage. Conclusion: These results indicated a role for the miR 29 b-Dnmt 3 a/ 3 b-DNA methylation axis in mouse early embryonic development, and we provide evidence that miR 29 b is indispensable for mouse early embryonic development. This study contributes to a preliminary understanding of the role of miR 29 b during mouse embryonic development...|$|R

The journey's scientific purpose was to secure emperor penguin eggs from the rookery near Cape Crozier at an <b>early</b> <b>embryo</b> stage, so that [...] "particular points {{in the development of the}} bird could be worked out". This required a trip in the depths of winter to obtain eggs in an appropriately early stage of incubation. A secondary purpose was to experiment with food rations and equipment in advance of the coming summer's polar journey. Scott approved, and a party consisting of Wilson, Bowers and Cherry-Garrard set out on [...] 1911.|$|E

2500|$|The heart tube {{continues}} {{stretching and}} by day 23, {{in a process}} called morphogenesis, cardiac looping begins. The cephalic portion curves in a frontal clockwise direction. The atrial portion starts moving in a cephalic ally and then moves to the left from its original position. This curved shape approaches the heart and finishes its growth on day 28. The conduit forms the atrial and ventricular junctions which connect the common atrium and the common ventricle in the <b>early</b> <b>embryo.</b> The arterial bulb forms the trabecular portion of the right ventricle. A cone will form the infundibula blood of both ventricles. The arterial trunk and the roots will form the proximal portion of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The junction between the ventricle and the arterial bulb will be called the primary intra-ventricular hole. The tube is divided into cardiac regions along its craniocaudal axis: [...] the primitive ventricle, called primitive left ventricle, and the trabecular proximal arterial bulb, called the primitive right ventricle.|$|E
60|$|I mean by this {{expression}} {{that the whole}} organisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. This {{is a very important}} subject, most imperfectly understood. The most obvious case is, that modifications accumulated solely {{for the good of the}} young or larva, will, it may safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the <b>early</b> <b>embryo,</b> seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult. The several parts of the body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.|$|E

Injection of X 5 TR 2 mRNA into <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> resulted in the formation of a duplicated body axis. Mesoderm induction as evaluated by the activation of the α-actin gene in presumptive ectoderm (animal cap) treated with exogenous activin was significantly enhanced by the injection of XSTK 2 mRNA.

40|$|TRIM 28 is {{critical}} for the silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we reveal that an essential impact {{of this process is}} the protection of cellular gene expression in <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> from perturbation by cis-acting activators contained within these retroelements. In TRIM 28 -depleted ES cells, repressive chromatin marks at ERVs are replaced by histone modifications typical of active enhancers, stimulating transcription of nearby cellular genes, notably those harboring bivalent promoters. Correspondingly, ERV-derived sequences can repress or enhance expression from an adjacent promoter in transgenic embryos depending on their TRIM 28 sensitivity in ES cells. TRIM 28 -mediated control of ERVs is therefore crucial not just to prevent retrotransposition, but more broadly to safeguard the transcriptional dynamics of <b>early</b> <b>embryos...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In diploid parthenogenesis, proembryos {{developed}} from binucleate egg-equivalents containing an egg nucleus and an apoptotic ventral canal nucleus. As the axial tier of <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> formed, the cell regulatory proteins in proembryonal cells were ubiquitinated {{and turned over}} as suspensors differentiated. Axial-tier formation was blocked at high levels of chlorsulfuron, an inhibitor of acetolactate synthase. This enzyme {{is required for the}} biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, which are especially abundant in ubiquitin. The block of acetolactate synthase led to the accumulation of free "-amino-n-butyrate. The overall behavior of branched-chain amino acids revealed rigid and linear relations over all chlorsulfuron levels. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), required for DNA synthesis, was detected in rapidly cycling proembryonal cells. PCNA appeared to serve as a factor maintaining the cell replication typical of rapidly growing <b>early</b> <b>embryos.</b> Less than 0. 01 % of nuclei reacted with epitopes to anti-p 53 and anti-p 21 that are commonly associated with cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. The cleavage sites of <b>early</b> <b>embryos</b> involved apoptosis and contributed to their multiplication. Chlorsulfuron contributed to aborted axial-tier development due to disrupted patterns for the ubiquitination of cell regulatory proteins and changes in the soluble amino acid pool...|$|R
40|$|The germline-specific role of telomeres {{consists}} of chromosome end elongation and proper chro-mosome segregation during early developmental stages. Despite {{the crucial role}} of telomeres in germ cells, {{little is known about}} telomere biology in the germline. We analyzed telomere homeostasis in the Drosophila female germline and <b>early</b> <b>embryos.</b> A novel germline-specific function of deadenylase complex Ccr 4 -Not in the telomeric transcript surveil-lance mechanism is reported. Depletion of Ccr 4 -Not complex components causes strong derepression of the telomeric retroelement HeT-A in the germ cells, accompanied by elongation of the HeT-A poly(A) tail. Dysfunction of transcription factors Woc and Trf 2, as well as RNA-binding protein Ars 2, also results in the accumulation of excessively polyadenylated HeT-A transcripts in ovaries. Germline knockdowns of Ccr 4 -Not components, Woc, Trf 2 and Ars 2, lead to abnormal mitosis in <b>early</b> <b>embryos,</b> characterized by chromosome missegregation, centrosome dys-function and spindle multipolarity. Moreover, the ob-served phenotype is accompanied by the accumula-tion of HeT-A transcripts around the centrosomes in <b>early</b> <b>embryos,</b> suggesting the putative relationship between overexpression of telomeric transcripts and mitotic defects. Our data demonstrate that Ccr 4 -Not, Woc, Trf 2 and Ars 2, components of different regula-tory pathways, are required for telomere protection in the germline in order to guarantee normal devel-opment...|$|R
