50|$|There {{are several}} classes of {{anthelmintic}} drugs {{used to control}} gastrointestinal nematodes in livestock. The most common in the cattle industry are macrocyclic lactones, which include ivermectin and <b>eprinomectin,</b> benzimidazole, and imidazothiazoles are also used to a lesser extent. Due to routine, blanket herd treatment, there is widespread resistance to anthelmintic drugs in warm climates in sheep, and increasing evidence of resistance in cattle in temperate climates. As a consequence, livestock industries will have to adapt husbandry practices to manage internal parasites. This may include a variety of combinations of pasture rotations, flexible stocking rates, and genetic selection. Several new control methods are also being researched including vaccines, nematode-trapping fungi, and tannins in feed.|$|E
5000|$|Option for {{treating}} ear mites in rabbits are the related antiparasitics ivermectin and selamectin. Both of these antiparasitics {{have also been}} used with good effect in cats and dogs. A topical preparation of 0.01% ivermectin (Acarexx) can be used directly as an oil in cat ears, and the related new generation drug selamectin (brand name [...] "Revolution") is available as a once-per-month skin treatment for both dogs and cats, which will prevent new mite infestation {{as well as a}} number of other parasitic diseases. As with ivermectin, selamectin must be used with caution in collies and herder breeds with the possibility for homozygous MDR1 mutations. A single treatment with a topical formulation containing fipronil, (S)-methoprene, <b>eprinomectin</b> and praziquantel was shown to be efficient for the prevention of Otodectes cynotis infestation in cats.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFour {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics and in vitro metabolism of <b>eprinomectin,</b> a semi-synthetic avermectin, in cats. Pharmacokinetic parameters including bioavailability of <b>eprinomectin</b> were determined in a parallel study design comprised of one group of eight cats which were treated once topically at 0. 12 mL/kg bodyweight with BROADLINE®, a novel combination product (fipronil 8. 3 % (w/v), (S) -methoprene 10 % (w/v), <b>eprinomectin</b> 0. 4 % (w/v) and praziquantel 8. 3 % (w/v)), delivering a dose of 0. 5 mg <b>eprinomectin</b> per kg body weight, {{and a group of}} six cats which received 0. 4 % (w/v) <b>eprinomectin</b> at 0. 4 mg/kg bodyweight once by intravenous injection. For cats treated by topical application, the average <b>eprinomectin</b> (B 1 a component) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 20 ng/mL. The maximum concentrations were reached 24 h after dosing in the majority of the animals (six of eight cats). The average terminal half-life was 114 h due to slow absorption (‘flip-flop’ kinetics). Following intravenous administration the average Cmax was 503 ng/mL at 5 min post-dose, and the mean elimination half-life was 23 h. <b>Eprinomectin</b> was widely distributed with a mean volume of distribution of 2390 mL/kg, and the clearance rate was 81 mL/h/kg. Mean areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves extrapolated to infinity were 2100 ngh/mL and 5160 ngh/mL for the topical and intravenous doses, respectively. Topical <b>eprinomectin</b> was absorbed with an average absolute bioavailability of 31 %. In a second parallel design study, the dose proportionality of <b>eprinomectin</b> after single topical administration of BROADLINE® was studied. Four groups of eight cats each were treated once topically with 0. 5, 1, 2 or 5 times the minimum recommended dose of the combination, 0. 12 mL/kg bodyweight. Based on comparison of areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves from the time of dosing to the last time point at which <b>eprinomectin</b> B 1 a was quantified, and Cmax, dose proportionality was established. In addition, the metabolic pathway of <b>eprinomectin</b> using cat liver microsomes, and plasma protein binding using cat, rat, and dog plasma were studied in vitro. Results of the analyses of <b>eprinomectin</b> B 1 a described here showed that it is metabolically stable and highly protein bound (> 99 %), and thus likely to be, as with other species, excreted mainly as unchanged parent drug in the feces of cats...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>eprinomectin</b> in goat milk and cheeses (cacioricotta, caciotta, caprilisco) with different ripening times following a pour-on administration {{at a single}} dose rate (500 microg/kg of body weight) and a double dose rate (1, 000 microg/kg of body weight) to goats with naturally occurring infections of gastrointestinal nematodes was studied. Milk residues of <b>eprinomectin</b> reached a maximum of 0. 55 +/- 0. 18 microg/kg and 1. 70 +/- 0. 31 microg/kg at the single and double doses, respectively. The drug concentrations decreased progressively until the fifth day after treatment, when they were less than the detection limit at both dose rates. The <b>eprinomectin</b> levels measured in all cheese types (both treatments) were higher than those recovered in milk at all the sampling times. In caciotta cheeses, the <b>eprinomectin</b> residues levels were constantly higher than other cheeses. With the exception of cheeses made with milk the first day after treatment, <b>eprinomectin</b> concentrations were nearly constant up to the fourth day then decreased by the fifth and sixth days after treatment.

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} 10 dose {{confirmation}} studies {{was conducted to}} evaluate the persistent activity of an extended-release injectable (ERI) formulation of <b>eprinomectin</b> against single point challenge infections of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes of cattle. The formulation, selected based on the optimal combination of high nematode efficacy, appropriate plasma profile, and satisfactory tissue residue levels, includes 5 % poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and is designed to deliver <b>eprinomectin</b> at a dose of 1. 0 mg/kg bodyweight. Individual studies, included 16 – 30 cattle blocked based on pre-treatment bodyweight and randomly allocated to treatment with either ERI vehicle or saline (control), or the selected <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI formulation. Treatments were administered once at a dose volume of 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight by subcutaneous injection {{in front of the}} shoulder. In each study, cattle were challenged with a combination of infective stages of gastrointestinal and/or pulmonary nematodes 100, 120 or 150 days after treatment and were processed for parasite recovery according to standard techniques 25 – 30 days after challenge. Based on parasite counts, <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI (1 mg eprinomectin/kg bodyweight) provided > 90 % efficacy (p< 0. 05) against challenge with Cooperia oncophora and Cooperia surnabada at 100 days after treatment; against challenge with Ostertagia ostertagi, Ostertagia lyrata, Ostertagia leptospicularis, Ostertagia circumcincta, Ostertagia trifurcata, Trichostrongylus axei, and Cooperia punctata at 120 days after treatment; and against challenge with Haemonchus contortus, Bunostomum phlebotomum, Oesophagostomum radiatum and Dictyocaulus viviparus at 150 days after treatment. Results of a study to evaluate <b>eprinomectin</b> plasma levels in cattle treated with the <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI formulation reveal a characteristic second plasma concentration peak and a profile commensurate with the duration of efficacy. These results confirm that the <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI formulation can provide high levels of parasite control against a range of nematodes of cattle for up to 5 months following a single treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objective-To {{investigate}} plasma disposition, {{concentration in}} the hair, and anthelmintic efficacy of <b>eprinomectin</b> after topical administration in donkeys. Animals- 12 donkeys naturally infected with strongyle nematodes. Procedures-The pour-on formulation of <b>eprinomectin</b> approved for use in cattle was administered topically to donkeys at a dosage of 0. 5 mg/kg. Heparinized blood samples and hair samples were collected at various times between 1 hour and 40 days after administration. Samples were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Fecal strongyle egg counts were performed by use of a modified McMaster technique before and at weekly intervals for 8 weeks after treatment. Results-Plasma concentration and systemic availability of <b>eprinomectin</b> were relatively higher in donkeys, compared with values reported for other animal species. Concerning the anthelmintic efficacy against strongyle nematodes, <b>eprinomectin</b> was completely effective (100 %) on days 7 and 14 and highly effective (> 99 %) {{until the end of}} the study at 56 days after treatment. No abnormal clinical signs or adverse reactions were observed for any donkeys after treatment. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Eprinomectin had excellent safety. The relatively high plasma concentration after topical administration could result in use of <b>eprinomectin</b> for the control and treatment of parasitic diseases in donkeys...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeven {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in commercial grazing operations to confirm anthelmintic efficacy, assess acceptability, and measure the productivity response of cattle to treatment with <b>eprinomectin</b> in an extended-release injectable formulation (ERI) when exposed to nematode infected pastures for 120 days. The studies were conducted under one protocol in the USA in seven locations (Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Wisconsin). Each study had 67 – 68 naturally infected animals {{for a total of}} 475 (226 female, 249 male castrate) Angus or beef-cross cattle. The animals weighed 133 – 335 kg prior to treatment and were approximately 3 – 12 months of age. The studies were conducted under a randomized block design based on pre-treatment body weights to sequentially form 17 replicates of four animals each within sex in each study. Animals within a replicate were randomly assigned to treatments, one to <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI vehicle (control) and three to <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI (5 %, w/v <b>eprinomectin).</b> Treatments were administered at 1 mL/ 50 kg body weight once subcutaneously anterior to the shoulder. All animals in each study grazed one pasture throughout the observation period of 120 days. Cattle were weighed and fecal samples collected pre-treatment and on 28, 56, 84, and 120 days after treatment for fecal egg and lungworm larval counts. Positive fecal samples generally were cultured en masse to determine the nematode genera attributable to the gastrointestinal helminth infection. Bunostomum, Cooperia, Haemonchus, Nematodirus, Oesophagostomum, Ostertagia, and Trichostrongylus, when present, were referred to as strongylids. At all post-treatment sampling intervals, <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI-treated cattle had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower strongylid egg counts than vehicle-treated controls, with ≥ 95 % reduction after 120 days of grazing. Over this same period, <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI-treated cattle gained more weight (43. 9 lb/head) than vehicle-treated controls in all studies. This weight gain advantage was significant (P< 0. 05) in six of the studies with the <b>Eprinomectin</b> ERI-treated cattle gaining an average of 42. 8 % and the control cattle gaining 33. 1 % of their initial weight.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of <b>eprinomectin</b> in an extended-release injection (ERI) formulation was determined in cattle harboring naturally acquired infestations of first- or second- and third-stage larvae of Hypoderma spp. in three studies conducted {{according to the}} same protocol in the USA (two studies) and Germany (one study). Thirty cattle sourced from herds {{with a history of}} Hypoderma infestation were included in each study. Cattle were formed into replicates of three animals each on the basis of pre-treatment anti-Hypoderma antibody titers. Within replicates each animal was randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: ERI vehicle (control) at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight, administered once on Day 0; <b>Eprinomectin</b> 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg), administered once on Day 0 (when larvae were expected to be first instars); or <b>Eprinomectin</b> 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg), administered once when larvae were second or third instars (study dependent, Day 73, 119, or 140). Treatments were administered by subcutaneous injection in front of the shoulder. In all studies, emerging and/or expressed Hypoderma larvae were recovered, speciated, and counted and viability was determined. <b>Eprinomectin</b> LAI treatment was 100 % (p< 0. 05) efficacious against first- and second- or third-stage larvae of Hypoderma bovis (two studies) and Hypoderma lineatum (one study).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{treatment}} with <b>eprinomectin</b> on milk yield, milk composition and somatic cell counts (SCCs) was studied in 105 dairy cows located on seven farms in South Tyrol, Italy. On each farm, {{half of the}} animals were treated with <b>eprinomectin</b> {{and the other half}} were used as an untreated control group. Three test day records per animal were obtained before treatment (days - 117, - 75 and - 33) and another three test day records were obtained after treatment (days 22, 62 and 131). Test day records comprised milk yield, milk composition, SCC and days in milk. On the day of treatment, blood samples and faecal samples were taken for parasitological analysis. Cows with positive faecal egg counts yielded less milk. A significant effect of <b>eprinomectin</b> on milk yield was observed after treatment and was most pronounced on the second and the third test days after treatment (+ 1. 90 kg [P= 0. 002] and + 2. 63 kg [P< 0. 001], respectively).

40|$|Parasitic {{infections in}} cattle {{are known to}} {{negatively}} impact cattle performance. It has been demonstrated that anthelmintic treatment that reduces or eliminates worm load can positively influence cattle productivity by increasing a plethora of parameters including weight gain, reproductive efficiency, and carcass characteristics. While parasitic infections pose threats to all cattle, bulls {{have been found to}} be more susceptible than their female counterparts and tend to acquire higher worm loads more quickly. While an increased susceptibility in bulls is recognized, little research has been done to determine the effect of anthelmintic treatment on bull reproductive performance and semen quality. This study evaluated the effects of <b>eprinomectin</b> on performance parameters and reproductive function in bulls during the summer grazing and breeding season. We observed no differences in BW and BCS between treatment with either injectable <b>eprinomectin</b> or injectable doramectin. Likewise, semen and reproductive parameters including motility, morphology, scrotal circumference, and scrotal tone were not affected by treatment. Overall, both treatments effectively reduced internal parasite loads during the breeding season.

Each study initially included 16 nematode-free cattle. The cattle were of various breeds or crosses, weighed 109 – 186. 5 kg prior to treatment, and were approximately 4 – 7 months old. The animals were blocked based on pre-treatment bodyweight and then randomly allocated to treatment: <b>eprinomectin</b> ERI vehicle (control) at 1 mL/ 50 kg body weight or <b>eprinomectin</b> 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg) for a total of eight and eight animals in each group. Treatments were administered once on Day 0 by subcutaneous injection in front of the shoulder. In each study, cattle were infected with a combination of infective third-stage larvae or eggs of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes. Inoculation was scheduled so that the nematodes were expected to be fourth-stage larvae or adults at the time of treatment. For parasite recovery, all study animals were humanely euthanized and necropsied 14 – 15 (adult infections) or 21 – 22 days after treatment (developing fourth-stage larval infections).

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of <b>eprinomectin</b> in an extended-release injection (ERI) formulation {{in the treatment}} of cattle harboring naturally acquired nematode populations (including inhibited nematodes) was evaluated. Five studies were conducted under a similar protocol in the USA, the UK, and in Germany. All study animals were infected by grazing naturally contaminated pastures. The adequacy of pasture infectivity was confirmed by examining tracer calves prior to allocation and treatment of the study animals. The cattle were of various breeds or crosses, weighing 79 – 491 kg, and aged approximately 6 – 15 months. In each study, 20 animals were infected by grazing, and then removed from pasture and housed in a manner to preclude further nematode infections for 8 – 16 days until treatment. Animals were blocked based on descending pre-treatment body weight and randomly allocated to one of two treatments: ERI vehicle (control) at 1 mL/ 50 kg body weight or <b>eprinomectin</b> 5 % (w/v) ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg body weight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg).

40|$|Abstract The {{pharmacokinetics}} and mammary excretion of moxidectin and <b>eprinomectin</b> {{were determined}} in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) following topical administration of 0. 5 mg kg 1. Following administration of moxidectin, plasma and milk concentrations of moxidectin increased to reach maximal concentrations (Cmax) of 5. 46 3. 50 and 23. 76 16. 63 ng ml 1 at Tmax of 1. 20 0. 33 and 1. 87 0. 77 days in plasma and milk, respectively. The mean residence time (MRT) were similar for plasma and milk (5. 27 0. 45 and 5. 87 0. 80 days, respectively). The AUC value was 5 -fold higher in milk (109. 68 65. 01 ng day ml 1) than in plasma (23. 66 12. 26 ng day ml 1). The ratio of AUC milk/plasma for moxidectin was 5. 04 2. 13. The moxidectin systemic availability (expressed as plasma AUC values) obtained in buffaloes {{was in the}} same range than those reported in cattle. The faster absorption and elimination processes ofmoxidectin were probably due to a lower storage in fat associated with the fact that animalswere in lactation. Nevertheless, due to its high excretion inmilk and its high detectedmaximumconcentration inmilk which is equivalent or higher to the Maximal Residue Level value (MRL) (40 ng ml 1), its use should be prohibited in lactating buffaloes. Concerning <b>eprinomectin,</b> the Cmax were of 2. 74 0. 89 and 3. 40 1. 68 ng ml 1 at Tmax of 1. 44 0. 20 and 1. 33 0. 0. 41 days in plasma and milk, respectively.

In each study, cats were assigned randomly to blocks of two animals each, based on decreasing pre-treatment body weight and were randomly allocated {{to one of two}} groups of six to 12 cats: untreated (control) or treated with topical fipronil (8. 3 %, w/v), (S) -methoprene (10 %, w/v), <b>eprinomectin</b> (0. 4 %, w/v) and praziquantel (8. 3 %, w/v) (BROADLINE®, Merial) at 0. 12 mL/kg body weight (providing a minimum of 10 mg fipronil+ 12 mg S-methoprene+ 0. 5 mg eprinomectin+ 10 mg praziquantel per kg body weight). The topical treatment was administered directly on the skin in the midline of the neck in a single spot once on Day 0. For parasite recovery and count, cats were euthanized humanely and necropsied seven or ten days after treatment. A single treatment with the novel topical combination product provided 91 % efficacy against Ancylostoma braziliense, ≥ 99 % efficacy against Ancylostoma tubaeforme, and > 97 % efficacy against Toxocara cati.

Merial) against larval and adult Aelurostrongylus abstrusus lungworms in cats was assessed in a controlled laboratory study. The study included 48 purpose-bred, short-haired cats which were each inoculated with 225 infective A. abstrusus larvae. The cats were formed into eight blocks based on pre-treatment bodyweight and were then, within each block, randomly allocated to one of six treatment groups: untreated control; treated once when A. abstrusus {{were expected to be}} third-stage larvae (4 days post inoculation [dpi]), fourth-stage larvae (7 dpi), immature adults (14 dpi) or adult nematodes (32 dpi), or treated twice, once when A. abstrusus were expected to be third-stage larval and once again when A. abstrusus were expected to be adult nematodes (4 dpi+ 32 dpi). Cats weighing ≥ 0. 8 – 2. 5 kg received one 0. 3 mL applicator and cats weighing > 2. 5 – 7. 5 kg received one 0. 9 mL applicator. For determination of the {{efficacy of}} treatments, lungworm larval counts were established on faecal samples collected from all cats 32, 39, 46, 53 and 60 dpi.

40|$|Background Although {{vector control}} strategies, such as insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) {{have been effective}} in Kenya the transmission of malaria continues to afflict western Kenya. This residual transmission is driven in part by Anopheles arabiensis, known for its opportunistic blood feeding behaviour and propensity to feed outdoors. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate the efficacy of the drug <b>eprinomectin</b> at reducing malaria vector density when applied to cattle (Bos indicus), the primary source of blood for An. arabiensis, under field conditions. Methods A pilot study was carried out in the Samia District of western Kenya from September to October of 2014. Treatment and control areas were randomly designated and comprised of 50 homes per study area. Before cattle treatments, baseline mosquito counts were performed after pyrethrum spray. Cows in the treatment area were administered topical applications of <b>eprinomectin</b> at 0. 5 mg/kg once a week for two consecutive weeks. Mosquito collections were performed once each week for two weeks following the <b>eprinomectin</b> treatments. Mosquitoes were first identified morphologically and with molecular confirmation, then screened for sporozoite presence and host blood using PCR-based methods. Results The indoor resting density of An. arabiensis was significantly reduced by 38 % in the treatment area compared to the control area at one-week post-treatment (Control mean females per hut = 1. 33 95 % CI [1. 08, 1. 64]; Treatment = 0. 79 [0. 56, 1. 07]). An increase in the indoor resting density of Anopheles gambiae s. s. and Anopheles funestus s. s. was observed in the treatment area in the absence of An. arabiensis. At two weeks post-treatment, the total number of mosquitoes for any species per hut was not significantly different between the treatment and control areas. No change was observed in An. arabiensis host preference as a result of treatment. Conclusions Systemic drugs may be an important tool by which to supplement existing vector control interventions by significantly impacting outdoor malaria transmission driven by An. arabiensis through the treatment of cattle.

40|$|AbstractAlthough foxes are {{the main}} {{reservoir}} of Echinococcus multilocularis, it is recognized that dogs and cats also may become infected. In cats the infection and egg production rates are usually low. Nevertheless, cats are a potential source of transmission of E. multilocularis. Due to the high human medical significance of E. multilocularis infection, it is important in endemic areas that owned cats are dewormed regularly. This paper presents the efficacy results of a new topical formulation, Broadline® (Merial) tested against E. multilocularis infection in cats. Two blinded laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate this novel topical combination of fipronil, (S) -methoprene, <b>eprinomectin,</b> and praziquantel against E. multilocularis. In each study, purpose-bred cats were assigned randomly to two treatment groups of 10 cats each: one untreated control group and one group treated at the minimum therapeutic dose of 0. 12 mL/kg bodyweight to deliver 10 mg fipronil, 12 mg (S) -methoprene, 0. 5 mg <b>eprinomectin</b> and 10 mg praziquantel/kg bodyweight.

The study comprised a multi-centre, positive control, blinded, field study, using a randomized block design based on order of presentation for allocation. In total 196 client-owned cats, confirmed as positive for naturally acquired infections of nematodes and/or cestodes by pre-treatment faecal examination, were studied in seven countries in Europe. Pre-treatment faecal examination revealed the presence of Toxocara, hookworm, Capillaria and/or spirurid nematode infections in 129, 73, 33 or 1 cat(s), respectively; infections with taeniid and Dipylidium cestodes were demonstrated in 39 and 17 cats, respectively. Cats were allocated randomly {{to one of two}} treatments in a ratio of 2, topical fipronil (8. 3 %, w/v), (S) -methoprene (10 %, w/v), <b>eprinomectin</b> (0. 4 %, w/v) and praziquantel (8. 3 %, w/v) (BROADLINE®, Merial; 130 cats); and 1, topical PROFENDER® Spot-On (Bayer; 66 cats) and treated once on Day 0. For evaluation of efficacy, two faecal samples were collected, one prior to treatment (Day − 4 ± 4 days) and one {{at the end of the}} study (Day 14 ± 5 days). These were examined for fecal forms of nematode and cestode parasites. For evaluation of safety, cats were examined by a veterinarian before treatment and at the end of the study, and cat owners recorded the health status of their cats daily until the end of the study. For cats treated with Broadline®, the efficacy was > 99. 9 %, 100 %, and 99. 6 % for Toxocara, hookworms, and Capillaria, respectively; and the efficacy was > 99. 9 %, > 99. 9 %, and 98. 5 %, respectively, for the cats treated with Profender® (p< 0. 001 for all nematodes and both treatments).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate if treatment of cows with <b>eprinomectin</b> around calving had any beneficial effects on the calving to first artificial insemination interval, calving to conception interval, and number of services per conception in totally- and semi-confined dairy herds. In totally-confined herds lactating- and dry-cows were housed throughout the summer and had no access to pasture. In semi-confined herds lactating- and dry-cows had limited outdoor exposure to a small pasture or paddock but were still fed a ration that met all their nutritional requirements. The study was carried out between February 2002 and February 2003 in 35 herds (2381 cows) located in Quebec, Ontario and Minnesota (USA) participating in a larger clinical trial. The herds kept electronic reproduction records. Cows were randomly allocated to receive <b>eprinomectin</b> or a placebo, with treatment being administered on or close to the day of calving. Monthly bulk tank milk samples from each farm were tested with an indirect ELISA using a crude Ostertagia ostertagi antigen and these data were averaged over the study year. The optical density ratio (ODR) values were then dichotomized into high and low using a cut-point of 0. 50. Treatment effects were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards survival models with herd frailty effects for calving to conception and calving to first service intervals. Aalen's linear hazards model was used to investigate time-varying effects in the Cox models. A random effects poisson regression model was used to model the number of services per conception. Other predictor variables tested in the models were lactation number, calving season, study site, peak milk production, ODR and the lactating- and dry-cow housing variables. Overall, there was no significant effect of treatment on the three indices of reproductive performance. The effect of season of calving depended on how much time had passed since calving. Presumably this effect reflected a seasonal effect at the time of breeding. Hazard of conception in younger cows was higher than in older cows. Early bred cows tended to have a higher number of inseminations per conception than those bred late.
