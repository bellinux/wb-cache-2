40|$|Abstract—Over {{the course}} of the past century, the global {{automotive}} industry’s stance towards safety has evolved from one of contempt to one nearing reverence. A suspension system that provides safe handling and cornering capabilities can, with the help of an efficient braking system, improve safety to a large extent. The aim of this research is to propose a new automotive brake rotor design and to compare it with automotive vented <b>disk</b> <b>rotor.</b> Static structural and transient thermal analysis have been carried out on the vented <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> and proposed rotor designs to evaluate and compare their performance. Finite element analysis was employed for both static structural and transient thermal analysis. Structural analysis was carried out to study the stress and deformation pattern of the rotors under extreme loads. Time varying temperature load was applied on the rotors and the temperature distribution was analysed considering cooling parameters (convection and radiation). This dissertation illustrates the use of Finite Element Methods to examine models, concluding with a comparative study of the proposed rotor design and the conventional vented <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> for structural stability and thermal efficiency.

40|$|This is a {{guide for}} the use of the {{pressure}} <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> model that has been placed in the incom-pressible Navier-Stokes code INS 3 D-UP. The pressure <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> model approximates a helicop-ter rotor or propeller in a time averaged manner and is intended to simulate the effect of a rotor in forward flight on the fuselage or the effect of a propeller on other aerodynamic components. The model uses a modified actuator disk that allows the pressure jump across the disk to vary with radius and azimuth. The cyclic and collective blade pitch angles needed to achieve a specified thrust coefficient and zero moment about the hub are predicted. The method has been validated with experimentally measured mean induced inflow velocities as well as surface pressures on a generic fuselage. Overset grids, sometimes referred to as Chimera grids, are used to simplify the grid generation process. The pressure disk model is applied to a cylindrical grid which is embed-ded in the grid or grids used for the rest of the configuration.

40|$|An {{integrated}} motor-bearing system integrates {{the functions}} of an active magnetic bearing and an electric motor into a single unit. Because this system requires the simultaneous generation of torque and radial control force, there will inevitably be undesired high order harmonic components in the rotating magnetic field, which will result in torque ripple and radial force distortion.

After the compensation of high order harmonics, the runout profile and rotor unbalance are identified by the extended influence coefficient method.

40|$|The {{design of}} more {{sustainable}} products can be best accomplished in a tradeoff-based design process that methodically handles conflicting objectives. Such conflicts are often seen between, environmental impact, cost, and product performance. To support such a process, this paper proposes {{the development of}} an environment where sustainability considerations are explicitly introduced early into the design process. This explicitness is provided by integrating the requirements information of sustainability standards and regulations directly into the design process. The emergence of the semantic web provides an interoperable environment in which the context and meaning of knowledge about the relationships among various domains can be shared. This work presents an ontological framework designed to represent both the objectives that pertain to sustainable design and the applicable sustainability standards and regulations. This integrated approach not only can ease the adoption of the standards and regulations during a design process but can also influence a design toward sustainability considerations.

Wake characteristics of small-scale mesh <b>disk</b> <b>rotor</b> simulators have been measured in a 21 m tilting flume at the University of Southampton. The results indicate that wake velocities are reduced in the near wake region (close behind the rotor disk) for increasing levels of disk thrust. Further downstream all normalised wake velocity values converge, enforcing that, as for wind turbines, far wake recovery {{is a function of the}} ambient flow turbulence. Varying the disk proximity to the water surface/bed introduces differential mass flow rates above and below the rotor disk that can cause the wake to persist much further downstream. Finally, the introduction of increased sea bed roughness whilst increasing the depth-averaged ambient turbulence actually decreases downstream wake velocities. Results presented demonstrate that there are a number of interdependent variables that affect the rate of wake recovery and will have a significant impact on the spacing of marine current turbines within an array. <br/...|$|E

The flow conditions for marine devices are distinctly different than for similar {{technologies such as}} the wind energy industry. The constrained nature of the operating fluid in the vertical plane is likely to introduce some interesting flow effects for marine current energy converters (MCECs). Experimental work was conducted at two indoor facilities. The first was the Chilworth hydraulics laboratory at the University of Southampton, UK. The working section of this flume is 21 m in length, 1. 35 m width and maximum depth 0. 4 m for steady operation.
