40|$|Does {{trade and}} {{investment}} liberalisation increase the growth in sales of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) ? Here, {{for the first time}} to our knowledge, we test this hypothesis using a unique data source on SSB-specific trade flows. We test whether lower tariffs effectively <b>increase</b> <b>imports</b> of SSBs, and whether a higher level of <b>imports</b> <b>increase</b> sales of SSBs. Cross-national fixed effects models were used to evaluate the association between SSBs sales and trade liberalisation. SSBs per capita sales data were taken from EuroMonitor, covering 44 low- and middle-income countries from 2001 to 2014, SSBs import data were from TradeMap, Foreign Direct Investment data were from EuroMonitor, and data on applied tariffs on SSB from the World Trade Organisation tariffs database, all 2015 editions. The results show that higher tariffs on SSBs significantly decreased per capita SSB imports. Each one percent increase in tariffs was associated with a 2. 9 % (95 % CI: 0. 9 %- 5 %) decrease in imports of SSBs. In turn, <b>increased</b> <b>imports</b> of SSBs were significantly associated with greater sales of SSBs per capita, with each 10 percent <b>increase</b> in <b>imports</b> (in US$) associated with a rise in sales of 0. 36  L per person (95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 68). Between 2001 and 2014, this amounted to 9. 1  L greater sales per capita, about 40 % of the overall rise seen in this period in LMICs. We observed that tariffs were inversely but not significantly associated with sales of SSBs. In conclusion, lower tariffs substantially <b>increased</b> <b>imports</b> of SSBs in LMICs, which translated into greater sales. These findings suggest that trade policies which lower tariff barriers to SSB imports can be expected to lead to <b>increased</b> <b>imports</b> and then <b>increased</b> sales of SSBs in LMICs, with adverse consequences for obesity and the diseases that result from it...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} and energy consequences of globalization {{have become an}} important topic of debate. My dissertation examines the interaction between {{environmental and}} energy issues and international trade. Specifically, I investigate environmental regulations and policy in an open economy. In the first chapter, I analyze how an environmental tax on pollution from consumption affects trade flows and welfare in an open economy. In particular, I argue {{that the effect of}} an environmental tax on the direction of trade flows depends on who is directly burdened by the regulation (consumers or producers) regardless of who is the polluter. In the case of pollution generated by consumers, a tax on consumers who are the polluters tends to increase exports and reduce imports of dirty goods. This result is the opposite of the well-known effect arising from taxes on pollution-intensive industries. Stringent environmental regulations on pollution-intensive industries diminishes exports and <b>increases</b> <b>imports</b> of dirty industries. In terms of welfare, I show the importance of targeting the policy instrument to the correct source of pollution. Assuming pollution is caused by the consumption of a good, a production tax has a weak effect on increasing welfare through reducing pollution. Furthermore, welfare can fall if the production tax ratio is too high, leading to reduced national income. The second chapter is motivated by recent trends in the U. S. economy: <b>increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China, decreasing energy consumption, and increasing output. There are two primary theoretical approaches related to the relationship between energy use in U. S. manufacturing and <b>increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China: Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) trade theory and the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH). These two frameworks generate opposite predictions about the relationship between these trends. H-O theory suggests that with <b>increased</b> Chinese <b>import</b> penetration, U. S. manufacturing should move toward more energy-intensive industries and as a result, energy use in U. S. industries should increase. Alternatively, PHH predicts that energy-intensive industries in U. S. manufacturing would relocate to other countries with more lax energy regulations. As a result, this would lead U. S. manufacturer to use less energy. To understand the determinants of energy use in U. S. manufacturing, I construct a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the U. S. economy using the 2005 input-output table. I find that <b>increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China causes all manufacturing industries to use more energy. Energy use increases proportional to the output of each industry. However, the magnitude of this effect is very small. In order to help understand the magnitude of the effect, I introduce a (counter-factual) tax on energy use in U. S. manufacturing. Combining these two scenarios, <b>increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China and an energy tax, produces an outcome consistent with the actual data: decreasing energy consumption and increasing output. Interestingly, total energy use in the U. S. manufacturing sector can decrease {{while at the same time}} U. S. welfare can increase due to its improved terms of trade. This result shows that a small energy tax can offset the increased energy use caused by Chinese import penetration, but will not reduce welfare. In addition, unlike the prediction generated by H-O theory, <b>increasing</b> Chinese <b>imports</b> causes imported intermediate inputs from China to become cheaper resulting in increased output in all sectors of U. S. manufacturing. In the final chapter, I numerically estimate these effects using U. S. manufacturing industry-level panel data from 1997 to 2005. I decompose the effect of <b>increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China on energy use in U. S. manufacturing into a factor substitution effect and an output scale effect. Because import penetration may be endogenous, I instrument for Chinese import penetration using Chinese share of world trade. My results indicate that <b>increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China raises consumption of fuel and electricity. As in the simulation model, the marginal effect of Chinese import penetration is small, about 0. 05 % to 0. 08 %, but statistically significant. Interestingly, the directions of the factor substitution effects on fuel and electricity are opposite. <b>Increasing</b> <b>imports</b> from China causes a decrease in the factor ratio of fuel over labor, but an increase in the ratio of electricity over labor...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} made of three {{independent}} chapters interested in the impact of globalization on workers in industrialized countries. The dissertation is especially focused on identifying the causal impact of international trade on workers' mobility, wages, and employment with both a short- and medium-term perspective. The first paper explores the relation between intra-industry trade (IIT) expansion and associated worker flows, taking the latter {{as an indicator of}} labor-market adjustment costs. Being the first study to combine theoretical simulations and a novel identification strategy, we find that both theoretical and empirical analyses are consistent with the "smooth adjustment hypothesis", according to which IIT expansion is less disruptive than inter-industry trade expansion. The study therefore lends support to the use of IIT indices as first-pass proxies for the adjustment effects of trade expansion. The second chapter contrasts the impact of <b>increased</b> <b>import</b> competition coming from China and the European Union (EU) on workers in the United Kingdom over a 15 -year period. The most salient findings show that <b>increased</b> <b>imports</b> from China had significantly negative effects on workers' earnings, wages and employment. In contrast, larger imports from the EU are associated with positive worker-level outcomes, which is largely {{explained by the fact that}} <b>increased</b> <b>imports</b> from the EU were mostly offset by increased same-industry exports to the EU. Besides, we find that <b>increased</b> <b>imports</b> from China exert additional pressure on workers through spillovers to employment and wages in downstream industries. Finally, the last chapter is focused on the impact of exposure to trade and real exchange rate shocks on wages for Swiss manufacturing workers. A particular attention is made to consistently estimate the causal effect in using a two-step gravity-type identification strategy. The study shows that the impact of trade and exchange rate movements is concentrated among high-skilled workers almost exclusively...|$|R
