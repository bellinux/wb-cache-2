25|$|Despite these improvements, Garcia's {{physical}} and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. By the beginning of 1995, his playing ability had suffered {{to the point where}} he would often turn down the volume of his guitar, a problem exacerbated by carpal tunnel syndrome and the ongoing loss of <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> extremities from diabetes. On the band's final tours, he frequently had to be reminded of what song he was performing.|$|E
25|$|As {{the show}} is about to leave one stand, Special Agent Gregory of the FBI {{intercepts}} Brad, asking whether the circus doctor looks like the photograph of a man he is hunting (the photo is of Buttons without makeup). Having never seen Buttons without makeup, Brad doesn't recognize {{the man in the}} photo. The detective boards the train to continue his investigation. Brad mentions this to Buttons, who tells him that Sebastian has <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> injured hand – a sign that his disability is not permanent. Brad makes the connection between Buttons and the fugitive doctor and comments that the police will be taking fingerprints at the next stand. The implication is that Buttons should make himself scarce until the detective leaves the show to search elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Former NFL coach Tony Dungy {{later told}} Profootballtalk.com {{he was certain}} that Williams {{operated}} a similar bounty system while he was defensive coordinator of the Oilers/Titans from 1997 to 2000. He also believes that Williams put a bounty on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning during Super Bowl XLIV, and targeted Manning on several occasions while with the Titans. The revelation of the bounty system also caused renewed speculation about a 2006 game between the Redskins and Colts, in which Manning was knocked down by a high-low hit from the Redskins' Phillip Daniels and Andre Carter and appeared to lose some <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> neck. While Dungy didn't speculate at the time about whether the Redskins targeted Manning on that play, he believes that hit ultimately caused the neck problems that sidelined Manning for the entire 2011 season and led to his departure for the Denver Broncos afterward.|$|E

500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "She's a Sensation", which was said by author Dave Thompson to have a 60's melody which [...] "melts through the hard rock." [...] The next song, [...] "7-11", deals with dating {{at a young age}} where the couple goes on dates to places like {{convenience}} stores and record swaps. The lyrics follow a boy who meets a girl by a Space Invaders machine, and eventually has to let her go after she dies in a car crash. True relates: [...] "You can lose your heart within the singer's torched '7-11'. Joey details in time-honoured girl group fashion the beauty of young love that takes place among the most mundane, humdrum of surroundings." [...] "You Didn't Mean Anything to Me", written by Dee Dee, reflects the desolation and vacillation which the bassist was <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> personal life as well as while he was with the band. This is evident through lines like [...] "Every dinner was crummy/Even the ones for free." [...] The pop-oriented song [...] "Come On Now" [...] was described by True as a [...] "sparkling rush of blood to the head from the [...] "comic book boy", and said that it ranged alongside songs from The Dave Clark Five and 1910 Fruitgum Company. The eleventh track on the album is titled [...] "This Business Is Killing Me", and was written by Joey to detail how everyone expects him to please others, but he simply cannot please everyone all the time. Pleasant Dreams concludes with [...] "Sitting in My Room", which contained lyrics quoted by David Fricke in the conclusion of his review on the album, saying: [...] "'It's us against them,' sneers Joey in [...] "Sitting in My Room.' 'They just wanna worry ... /They just wanna be so lame/Maybe they should try and sniff some glue.' Or put Pleasant Dreams on the box and crank it up to ten." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his cricket career, Pooley, {{as with so}} many of his {{contemporary}} cricketers, struggled {{financially and}} his gambling and drinking eventually led to the Lambeth workhouse. [...] In 1899 the writer Alfred Pullin traced and interviewed many old cricketers. [...] He described Pooley's hands as [...] "mere lumps of deformity" [...] and attributed their condition to rheumatism caused by drink. Pooley became angry at this, banging the table to show he had no <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fingers and that it was cricket rather than [...] "rheumatics" [...] that had put him in the workhouse. [...] He took Pullin outside to show he could still catch a ball.

He is angry with her and tries to lie {{his way out of the}} truth, but later confesses that this Christmas is likely to be his last.
