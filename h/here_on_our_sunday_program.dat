6000|$|... "Welcome, Monsieur Fletcher. When {{we found}} {{that you were not}} <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> arrival last night, we feared that some evil had befallen you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, uncle," [...] {{interposed}} Mabel, [...] "no land {{is to be}} seen, except <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own coast. To me {{it looks}} exactly like the ocean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leastwise he'm {{no right}} to go spying <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> quay, and never ax with your leave, or by your leave. I'll just goo mak' mun out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{men have}} not fallen into our hands," [...] Toussaint said, [...] "they have come <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> invitation, and, as I have told you, with our safeguard." ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. Oh, all right. Very well. Pick: you behave yourself. Let us put <b>on</b> <b>our</b> best <b>Sunday</b> manners {{for this}} {{creature}} that we picked {{out of the}} mud. [He flings himself sulkily into the Elizabethan chair].|$|R
6000|$|... 'You'll find an {{excellent}} brand of air {{down in the}} senior study,' said Dallas, pointedly. 'Don't stay and poison yourself <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> account,' he added. 'Think of your family.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Merciful heavens!' exclaimed Mr. Macrae, {{his face}} paling. 'What can this new outrage mean? <b>Here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> deck is the gold; if they explode their torpedoes the bullion sinks {{to join the}} exhaustless treasures of the main!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's {{have all}} our mail re-addressed from Timminsport to Henryville," [...] {{suggested}} Fred; [...] "then {{we can come}} down <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> skates any time we feel like it and get it." [...] And this was done.|$|R
60|$|Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows, The {{woods of}} white Colonos are not <b>here,</b> <b>On</b> <b>our</b> bleak hills the olive never blows, No simple priest conducts his lowing steer Up the steep marble way, nor {{through the town}} Do {{laughing}} maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what we pretend, {{but we know}} better. But I was {{thinking}} how pretty and pleasant things used to be turning {{up all the time}} <b>on</b> <b>our</b> travels in the old days. Why, when we were in New York <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> wedding journey the place didn't seem half so dirty as it does now, and none of these dismal things happened." ...|$|R

RAMSI is <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> invitation. ... mission is important to Solomon Islands as it provides security, development of our police service, and the strengthening of the capacity of government institutions." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{suggests}} that sleeping through a nuclear crisis ("If someone soon throws a nuclear poo <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> Europe") {{is the best}} way of avoiding it. Oversleeping is said to [...] "calm you down", among other benefits. Kojo also recorded the song in English, then under the title [...] "Bomb Out".|$|R
6000|$|... "All of that, sir, depend <b>on</b> it. <b>Here's</b> a rock close aboard on us, {{to which}} we're comin' fast--just off <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> weather-bow, that {{looks to me}} like the place where you landed a'ter that swim, and where we had stowed {{ourselves}} when Stephen Spike made us out, and gave chase." ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> {{experiences}} using {{a program}} animation tool, the Teaching Machine, for program and algorithm visualization for engineering and physics students at two universities: Memorial University, {{where it has}} been used since 1999 for teaching engineering students, and the University of Athens, where it was adopted in 2005 to teach physics students...|$|R
5000|$|John Harding {{reports that}} [...] "Right now, Millard is soaking in {{retirement}} in a swamp <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> farm ... swizzles cold deliciouses {{and listens to}} deep tracks on old Miles Davis Albums. Oh yeah, and by the way, He's still upset that he got passed over for the AFLAC duck bits. Its tough being green." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jaap, what is done, is done, {{and there}} is no use in regretting it, in words. Of one thing, however, you may be certain; no mercy will be shown you, should this fellow, Muss, be {{actually}} out <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> heels, and should you be so unfortunate as to fall into his hands." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) {{is difficult to}} predict, and ERCP may be helpful in diagnosing its complications and treating them. Few descriptions of cholangiographic findings {{during the course of}} the disease have yet appeared. We report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> experience in the management and follow-up by ERCP of six patients with deteriorating PSC. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
6000|$|... "White and handsome--well brought up!" [...] said Marks, {{his sharp}} eyes, nose and mouth, all alive with enterprise. [...] "Look here, now, Loker, a {{beautiful}} opening. We'll do a business <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own account;--we does the catchin'; the boy, of course, goes to Mr. Haley,--we takes the gal to Orleans to speculate on. An't it beautiful?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, yes, truly," [...] said Mary; [...] "well, then, it {{must stand}} <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> new stand. How glad I am {{that we have}} such a {{handsome}} new stand for it! it will look so much better." [...] And Mrs. Stephens laid down her work, and folded a piece of newspaper, on which the treasure was duly deposited.|$|R
40|$|We report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> lab {{studies of}} ice {{photochemistry}} of large organic molecules under cometary conditions. We focus on {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), their photoproducts, and their similarities to molecules seen in living systems today. We note that these kinds of compounds are seen in meteorites and we propose an explanation for both their formation and their observed deuterium enrichments...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} entropy and the correct {{application}} of the Second Law of thermodynamics are essential {{in order to understand}} the reason why quantum error correction (QEC) is thermodynamically possible and no violation of the Second Law occurs during its execution. We report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> preliminary work aiming at an information-theoretic analysis extended to QEC in the presence of imperfections...|$|R
5000|$|Another show {{followed}} in September 2015, titled “Acrylic on Darkness I - Outside Your House, at Night, While You’re Sleeping”. It consisted of nightscapes from the Reykjavik suburbs, cars parked in driveways outside houses, hardly {{visible in the}} pitch black dark. “We have darkness {{most of the time}} up <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> northern island. Still we have hardly ever painted it or done art about it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Young {{described}} the album as [...] "a collection of 13 songs from throughout my life, songs I {{have written about}} living <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> planet together." [...] The album's mix also includes nature and animal sounds, including turkeys, insects, crows, and thunder. Young {{said that he was}} inspired by animals because [...] "they don't have this uptight vibe. They don't have all the hatred and everything." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} been in the little streets--impassable for horses--that the people sat and talked, as Heine fabled, in their doorways, and touched knees with the people sitting and talking on the {{thresholds}} of the opposite side. But we saw no gossipers there <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>Sunday</b> in Genoa; and I think the domestic race of Heine's day no longer lives in Genoa, for every body we saw on the streets was gayly dressed in the idea of the last fashions, and was to be met chiefly in the public promenades. The fashions were French; but here still lingers the lovely phantom of the old national costume of Genoa, and snow-white veils fluttered from many a dark head, and caressed many an olive cheek. It is the kindest and charitablest of attirements, this white veil, and, while decking beauty to the most perilous effect, befriends and modifies age and ugliness.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of our}} ongoing {{research}} program to produce a high-efficiency, low-cost, photovoltaic cell based on the fullerene C 60, we report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> first attempts at the intercalative doping of C 60 thin films by the electrodiffusion of metals. Semiconductor behavior with decreased values of conductivity activation energy has been demonstrated for the doped samples. The results are explained by electrodiffusion of Au from an electrode...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of our}} ongoing {{research}} program to produce semiconductor devices based on the C 60 thin films, we report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> first attempts at the intercalative doping of C 60 thin films by diusion of metals. Two techniques were employed: (a) chemically-induced counter electro-diusion of Cu and I 2 into a C 60 matrix; (b) diusion of Au under the action of an external electric field...|$|R
40|$|This {{issue of}} Gerontology {{includes}} a response by van Bodegom et al. to Herndon's recent {{article on the}} implications of the grandmother hypothesis for studies of aging and cognition. Although this hypothesis will doubtlessly continue to stimulate discussion, we focus <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> contention that human and non-human primate life histories have evolved essential differences and that these should be addressed in studies comparing aging in humans and chimpanzees...|$|R
40|$|We give {{an update}} <b>on</b> <b>our</b> lattice {{determination}} of r 0 ΛMS for different N f. Our calculations em-ploy the strong coupling constant in the minimal MOM scheme for QCD in Landau gauge, and we report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> progress towards a quantitative {{understanding of the}} intrinsic lattice dis-cretization artifacts at large momenta. This is important for a high-precision analysis, in particular for the unquenched calculations for which the access to small lattice spacings is restricted by the available gauge configurations...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubled the}} Good-Hope {{in the year}} '46," [...] {{continued}} the other, [...] "and saw a vessel lying, as it might be, <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> weather-bow--which is just opposite to this fellow, since he is <b>on</b> <b>our</b> lee-quarter--but there I saw a ship standing for an hour across our fore-foot, and yet, though we set the azimuth, not a degree did he budge, starboard or larboard, during all that time, which, as it was heavy weather, was, to say the least, {{something out of the}} common order." ...|$|R
40|$|Silver and its {{compounds}} {{have long}} been known to possess antimicrobial properties. We report <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> observations in this field of research, namely on silver coordination compounds, and in particular polymers, {{which can be used}} in the medical field. An overview of the structural diversity of coordination compounds with a particular class of organic ligands is given, together with their properties, with a special focus on antimicrobial activity, solubility and light stability...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let old Parker {{alone for}} that! I'll warrant you, he is never {{out of the}} way. Were it Lord Morganic, now, in the Achilles, I should {{expect him to be}} away off <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> weather-quarter, just to show us how his ship can eat us out of the wind when he tries: or away down yonder, under our lee, that we might {{understand}} how she falls off, when he don't try." ...|$|R
60|$|There was Great-grandfather King's flat {{tombstone}} {{of rough}} Island sandstone, so overgrown with ivy {{that we could}} hardly read its lengthy inscription, recording his whole history in brief, and finishing with eight lines of original verse composed by his widow. I {{do not think that}} poetry was Great-grandmother King's strong point. When Felix read it, <b>on</b> <b>our</b> first <b>Sunday</b> in Carlisle, he remarked dubiously that it LOOKED like poetry but didn't SOUND like it.|$|R
