Derrike {{will not run}} the No. 73 Dodge Challenger in the Nationwide Series. Cope also is entered in the Showtime Southern 500 at Darlington. Cope has changed manufacturers from Dodge Charger to Chevrolet Impala. He was forced to withdraw from Darlington when the engine in his MAXcellence Chevrolet was tested on an engine dyno and determined to not have enough power to make the race. Cope hoped {{to be ready for}} the Sprint Showdown. When problems again plagued the team, Cope went to race for Max Q Motorsports in the 64. During the showdown race, Landon Cassill blew a tire and spun in <b>front</b> of <b>Cope's</b> Ford, causing Cope to T-bone the side of Cassill's car. Neither driver was injured.|$|R
5000|$|Bonis Hall is {{a former}} country house {{to the north of}} Prestbury, Cheshire, England. It was the seat of the Pigot family until 1746, when it was bought by Charles Legh of Adlington. In {{the early part of the}} 19th century it was remodelled and used by the Legh family as a dower house. In the early 20th century the {{exterior}} was pebbledashed, and castellations were added. It has since been converted for use as offices. [...] It is constructed in brick, with Kerridge stone-slate roofs. The house is in two storeys and has a seven-bay <b>front</b> with <b>coped</b> gables surmounted by ball and urn finials. On top of the building is a square tower with a pyramidal roof surmounted by a hexagonal bellcote with a copper cupola and weathervane. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.|$|R

The race featured a bizarre incident when the No. 70 Chevrolet Camaro of 1990 Daytona 500 champion Derrike Cope appeared to explode in the chicane. It was later {{discovered that a}} brake line on the car broke and fluid leaked onto the calipers, causing the fluid to boil and blow apart the brake, {{which led to the}} <b>front</b> end of <b>Cope's</b> car to be blown apart.

40|$|The {{importance}} of low-power design {{is not just}} critical to portable devices but also to line powered equipment like TV products. Power dissipation strongly influences {{the price of the}} chip, since the packaging and cooling costs increase dramatically with increasing power dissipation. In this work, we analyze and optimize algorithm and architecture of a picture rate up-conversion module. We perform algorithm/architecture co-design in which we meet high quality specification while keeping the power dissipation low. In the algorithm front, we focus on the motion estimation which is computationally the most intensive part of the picture-rate up-conversion application. We analyze the following parameters of the motion estimation algorithm: The number of motion estimation iterations per input image pair and the image scanning order of individual iterations. Further, we apply novel pre-processing technique {{to address the issue of}} reducing the already extremely low number of motion vector candidate evaluations. However, optimal selection of motion vector candidates is a necessity to achieve high picture quality. In the architectural <b>front,</b> to <b>cope</b> with the large memory bandwidth requirements of the application, we use multi-level caching to exploit locality of reference. Further, we apply data compression to the image data stored in memory, to reduce the memory capacity and bandwidth requirements. Both the above techniques significantly reduce the overall power dissipation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndividuals {{confronted with}} novel environments, for {{instance}} recently modified environments such as towns or recently occupied habitats such as colonization <b>fronts,</b> have to <b>cope</b> {{with a lack}} of information about the location of resources. We hypothesized that, under these conditions, individuals of a social species such as European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, would be more responsive to social cues indicating food presence than individuals belonging to populations already established in a well-known habitat. To test this hypothesis, we displayed starling decoys with various age, group size and interindividual distance characteristics in feeding postures to evaluate their attractiveness to starlings from towns and colonization fronts and noted whether attracted individuals joined particular decoy groups. Our results supported our hypothesis that sensitivity to social cues varied according to the population's history, and we suggest that these cues enhance the success of starlings in occupying new habitats.

50|$|The {{building}} has late seventeenth century or early eighteenth century origins, and was extensively modified {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century. It was built out of squared off rubble stone and has a roof of Roman tiles. Originally the building was a single room deep with two gable ends and a stair at the centre of the rear wall. It had <b>coped</b> <b>front</b> and end gables, with cross saddle-stones, and an ashlar chimney stack at each end. Since then, right and left wings have been added to the building at the rear and an ashlar extension with entrance added at the front. The building consists of three storeys and a cellar, the front extension is two storeys high and has a flat roof. There is a central tall chimney stack at the front, between the two gable ends. The interior of the building is reported to have an original staircase and fireplace.|$|R
5000|$|The Coup√© was {{designed}} by Centro Stile Lancia and built by Maggiora and technically {{quite different from the}} saloon, having a shorter wheelbase (by 120mm), wider rear track and a distinctive profile with frameless doors. The front, from bumper to the window screen, was identical to the other Kappas. It was Lancia's first coup√© since 1984, when the Beta and Gamma coup√©s were discontinued, and remains the last Lancia to feature this body style to this day. The small building capacities at the Maggiora factory for this essentially hand-made car, and the relatively high price, destined it to be a rare vehicle. As a money saver the rear lights came from Delta. Only 3263 coupes were manufactured from April 1997 to March 2000, making this model a true rarity. Car magazine described the car as looking [...] "top heavy, like a Bentley Continental that¬¥s been heated up and squeezed at both ends." [...] However, the car's engine range was praised for matching the vehicle's dynamics, the 2.4 litre five cylinder and the 3.0 Alfa-derived V6 coming closest to [...] "infusing the k Coupe with the classy character its styling tries to suggest." [...] "It¬¥s the spiky turbo four that asks the hardest questions of the chassis and the all-strut suspension doesn¬¥t flounder. It shines. A viscous coupling helps the <b>front</b> wheels <b>cope</b> with the onslaught of the engine¬¥s old school, big-bang turbo delivery, and it feels remarkably untroubled." [...] About the refinement and ride, John Barker (of Car Magazine) reported that the occupants [...] "are completely isolated from any vibration while the ride is smooth at moderate speeds, parrying bumps quietly and unobtrusively." [...] The interior was described as [...] "appealing" [...] and having [...] "curvy, attractive door casings, plump supportive Recaro seats and choice plastics.". The 1997 price was estimated at 24,000 pounds sterling.|$|R
25|$|The {{military}} {{leadership of the}} British Army during the World War I was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended.

However, during the 1960s historians such as John Terraine began to challenge this interpretation.

After having published a description of this animal, followed by an illustration in a textbook about reptiles and amphibians, Cope invited Marsh and Joseph Leidy to admire his new Elasmosaurus platyurus. Having listened to Cope's interpretation for a while, Marsh suggested that a simpler explanation of the strange build would be that Cope had reversed the vertebral column relative to the body as a whole. When Cope reacted indignantly to this suggestion, Leidy silently took the skull and placed it against the presumed last tail vertebra, to which it fitted perfectly: it was in fact the first neck vertebra, with still a piece of the rear skull attached to it. Mortified, Cope tried to destroy the entire edition of the textbook and, when this failed, immediately published an improved edition with a correct illustration but an identical date of publication. He excused his mistake by claiming that he had been misled by Leidy himself, who, describing a specimen of Cimoliasaurus, had also reversed the vertebral column. Marsh later claimed that the affair was the cause of his rivalry with Cope: [...] "he has since been my bitter enemy". Both Cope and Marsh in their rivalry named many plesiosaur genera and species, most of which are today considered invalid.|$|R

Here we address the problem of uncertain evaluation, in which the uncertainty can be modeled as an additive noise in objective space. We develop a novel algorithm, the rolling tide evolutionary algorithm (RTEA), which progressively improves the accuracy of its estimated Pareto set, while simultaneously driving the front toward the true Pareto <b>front.</b> It can <b>cope</b> with noise whose characteristics change as a function of location (both design and objective), or which alter during the course of an optimization. Four state-of-the-art noise-tolerant EMO algorithms, as well as four widely used standard EMO algorithms, are compared to RTEA on 70 instances of ten continuous space test problems from the CEC' 09 multiobjective optimization test suite. Different instances of these problems are generated by modifying them to exhibit different types and intensities of noise. RTEA seems to provide competitive performance across both the range of test problems used and noise types...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of a}} roof on any {{building}} is to separate the interior environment of the building from the exterior environment, thereby making it a crucial component of the building design. Metal roof edges are {{the first line of}} defense against wind-induced loads on the roof system; however, data on the nature of these loads acting on the roof edge system is scarce. Previous studies with field measurements of wind pressure acting on the roof edge reported that metal flashings experienced negative pressure. These findings suggest that current building codes in North America (i. e. NBCC and ASCE codes) do not accurately identify wind design loads acting on roof edge systems. The Roof Edge Systems and Technologies (REST) project is a consortium of academia, government and roof industries, which was created to develop testing protocols and design guidelines for roof edges. The work presented in this thesis contributes to the collection and analysis of wind loads acting on metal roof edges, which were installed on the Canada Post building in Vancouver, Canada. The thesis presents the findings and analysis of the measured wind-induced pressure acting on all surfaces of three different edge configurations, namely the Anchor Clip Configuration (ACC), Continuous Cleat Configuration (CCC) and Discontinuous Cleat Configuration (DCC). The analysis showed the presence of negative pressure acting on all three faces of the configurations, in which the type of configuration had minimum effect on the magnitude and nature of the wind-induced loads. Furthermore, the top face of the edge configurations was found to experience the highest suction, and the front face of the edge coping was subjected to a net outward suction force due to the combination of the suction experienced by the <b>coping</b> <b>front</b> face and the positive pressure acting on the cleat. Comparison of these results with current NBCC and ASCE building codes highlight a need to update these codes in order to adequately design metal roof edges against wind action...|$|R
