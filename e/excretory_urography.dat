40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Magnetic Resonance (MR) {{urography}} {{with its}} optimal contrast resolution {{and lack of}} ionizing radiation provides a comprehensive examination of the entire urinary tract noninvasively. MR urography is clinically useful {{in the evaluation of}} suspected urinary tract obstruction, haematuria, congenital anomalies, and surgically altered anatomy. It is particularly useful in cases of where there is contraindication of ionizing radiation and in paediatric and pregnant patients. The common MR urographic techniques are: Static-fluid MR <b>urography</b> and <b>excretory</b> MR <b>urography.</b> Static-fluid MR urography uses of heavily T 2 -weighted sequences to image the urinary tract as a static collection of fluid, can be repeated sequentially (Cine MR urography) to better demonstrate the ureters in their entirety and to confirm the presence of fixed stenoses. <b>Excretory</b> MR <b>urography</b> is performed during the excretory phase of enhancement after the intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast material; thus, the patient must have sufficient renal function to allow the excretion. Static-fluid and <b>excretory</b> MR <b>urography</b> can be combined with conventional MR imaging for comprehensive evaluation of the urinary tract. The limitations are limited availability, high cost, relatively long examination time, low spatial resolution compared to IVU (Intravenous Urogram) and CT Urography; sensitivity to motion (breathing and ureteral peristalsis) inherent contraindications like patients with pacemakers, claustrophobia, and relative insensitivity for calcification and ureteric calculi. In this article, an attempt has been made to demonstrate the potential of static-fluid MRU to demonstrate a spectrum of urologic pathology involving the kidneys, ureters, and bladder while discussing the limitations. METHODS Thirty patients with urinary tract abnormalities were evaluated with MR urography performed between May 2014 to April 2016 using routine MR sequences and additional heavily T 2 weighted sequence on a 1. 5 Tesla MRI machine. Images were post processed using MIP algorithm. Both, the reconstructed and source images were evaluated. RESULTS Static-fluid MR urography correctly depicted the presence of urinary tract dilatation and level of obstruction. It also succeeded in depicting the cause of obstruction. CONCLUSION MR urography allows comprehensive imaging of the urinary tract abnormalities non-invasively without using ionizing radiation. PURPOSE To study the efficacy of static MR urography in comparison with conventional urography. To study the levels and causes of obstruction of urinary tract by MR urography and compare them with other investigation procedures...|$|R
30|$|Similarly to post-surgical injuries, {{iatrogenic}} {{trauma to}} the ureter from endourological procedures is often (in almost two-thirds of cases) undetected intraoperatively. Unfortunately, delayed diagnosis {{is associated with a}} worse outcome due to superinfection and renal damage. Clinically, ureteral injury may be suggested by flank pain, urinary incontinence, vaginal or drain urinary leakage, haematuria, fever, worsening renal function, or imaging detection of hydronephrosis or urinoma [5, 33, 34]. MDCT urography and—in selected patients—MR urography represent the cross-sectional techniques of choice to investigate suspected ureteral lesions noninvasively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. Our aim was {{to compare}} {{unenhanced}} helical CT and <b>excretory</b> <b>urography</b> {{in the assessment of}} patients with renal colic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-three of 70 consecutive patients with acute signs of renal colic were prospectively examined with unenhanced helical CT, which was followed immediately by <b>excretory</b> <b>urography.</b> Two radiologists who were unaware of the findings independently interpreted these examinations to determine {{the presence or absence of}} ureteral obstruction. On all CT scans that had positive findings for ureteral stones or obstruction, were looked for secondary signs of obstruction (perinephric or periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, ureteral dilatation, and blurring of renal sinus fat). RESULTS. A stone was recovered in 45 of the 53 patients, nine before and 36 after imaging. The latter 36 patients had their stones identified on CT, whereas only 24 patients had their stones identified on <b>excretory</b> <b>urography.</b> Eight patients without stone disease had normal ureters on both CT and <b>excretory</b> <b>urography.</b> Of the 45 patients who had stone disease 26 had ureteral dilatation on both CT and <b>excretory</b> <b>urography,</b> and 36 patients who recovered a stone after CT had secondary signs of obstruction. Of the nine patients who recovered a stone before CT, three had secondary signs of obstruction. Two patients had periureteral fat stranding, ureteral wall edema, and renal sinus fat blurring. One patients had only ureteral wall edema. CONCLUSION. Compared with <b>excretory</b> <b>urography,</b> unenhanced helical CT is better for identifying ureteral stones in patients with acute ureterolithiasis. Secondary CT signs of obstruction, including renal sinus fat blurring, were frequently present even when the stone was eliminated before imaging. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

30|$|Low-voltage CT of {{the abdomen}} {{has been gaining}} the {{attention}} of investigators because {{it has the potential}} to improve contrast enhance for hypervascular liver lesions in the late arterial phase with less contrast material and a lower radiation dose (Nakayama et al. 2005; Altenbernd et al. 2011). It is also reported to be useful for improving enhancement of the pancreas and peripancreatic vasculature or improvement of tumor conspicuity during the pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases (Altenbernd et al. 2011; Marin et al. 2010). Moreover, low-voltage CT is used to improve the depiction of anatomically fine structure like peripheral or coronary arteries for the arterial phase and urinary system opacification for <b>excretory</b> phase CT <b>urography</b> (Utsunomiya et al. 2010; Shinagare et al. 2011). Most previous studies of low-voltage CT investigated contrast enhancement during a single phase (Nakayama et al. 2005; Altenbernd et al. 2011; Shinagare et al. 2011) and few studies have investigated contrast for multi-phasic CT. Besides, the use of high-concentration contrast material has been found to yield superior vascular enhancement compared with moderate-concentration contrast material and not to improve contrast enhancement of liver parenchyma on portal phase and late phase images (Awai et al. 2004; Holalkere et al. 2011; Fleischmann 2003). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have compared the effects of high-concentration contrast material and low-voltage CT or low-voltage VM image on contrast for multi-phasic CT of the upper abdomen.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} effect of {{diuretic}} administration on the image quality of <b>excretory</b> magnetic resonance <b>urography</b> (MRU) obtained following intravenous hydration, and to determine whether intravenous hydration alone is sufficient to produce diagnostic quality studies of nondilated upper tracts. Materials and Methods A total of 22 patients with nondilated upper tracts were evaluated with contrast-enhanced MRU. All patients received 250 mL of saline intravenously immediately prior to the examination. A total of 11 patients received 10 – 20 mg furosemide in addition to saline. Imaging was performed with a three-dimensional (3 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) breathhold spoiled gradient-echo sequences. Excretory MRU images were acquired five minutes after the administration of 0. 1 mmol/kg gadolinium and were independently reviewed by two radiologists, who were blinded to the MRU technique. Readers evaluated the calyces, renal pelvis, and ureters qualitatively for degree of opacification, distention, and artifacts on a four-point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using a permutation test. Results There was no significant disagreement between the two readers (P = 0. 14). Furosemide resulted in significant improvement in calyceal and renal pelvis distention (P < 0. 005), and significant artifact reduction in all upper tract segments (P < 0. 001) compared to {{the effect of}} saline alone. Conclusion Intravenous furosemide significantly improves the image quality of excretory MRU studies obtained following intravenous hydration.

40|$|Introduction & Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} urography (MRU) {{refers to}} MR imaging of the urinary col-lecting systems {{and it provides}} information roughly analogous to conventional intravenous urography. There are two basic MRU imaging strategies, (1) Static MRU uses T 2 W scans and rely {{on the presence of}} fluid in the pelvicaliceal systems and the ureters; (2) Excretory MRU is performed after administration of IV Gd using a 3 D gradient echo sequence. Static MRU is best used for dilated collecting systems and can be employed regardless of renal function. Excretory MRU is usually preferred over static techniques for the demonstration of non-distended ureters; however, it is contraindicated in severely impaired renal function. As MR urograms are often displayed as maximum intensity projections, a low signal intensity ureteral stone surrounded by high signal intensity urine may be obscured on maximum intensity projection images. A prob-lem in static MR urography is the superimposition of fluid-filled structures (i. e. bowel loops, gall bladder and bile ducts, CSF, or any intraabdominal fluid collection) on reconstructed images which may create false posi-tive findings or obscure true abnormalities. Non-distended ureters may escape detection on static MR uro-grams, resulting in the incorrect diagnosis of complete ureteral obstruction. Parapelvic cysts may simulate hy-dronephrosis while calyceal diverticulae may simulate simple renal cysts on static MRU. <b>Excretory</b> MR <b>urography</b> is performed in all such cases; however, Gd may create different problems when it becomes too concentrated within the collecting system. Sufficiently concentrated Gd shortens T 2 relaxation times to the point that signal loss from T 2 relaxation exceeds the T 1 shortening effects of the contrast agent. This may result in poor visualization of all or a portion of collecting system on T 1 W images. Concentrated Gd in the renal collecting system also causes signal loss on T 2 W images, particularly when long echo times are used. Blood products like Methemoglobin or hemosiderin resulting from hemorrhage within the collecting system also creates problems that limit the utility of heavily weighted static MR urograms. Flow artifacts re-sulting from moving urine (ureteral jet) may simulate a bladder abnormality. Repeating the sequence would be helpful because they often change in appearance on subsequent images. MRU has proved advantages in examining live renal donors, diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction, investigat-ing infants, children, and pregnant women with urinary symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Plain x-rays and {{contrast}} urography {{are important for}} diagnosing urinary tract diseases. The first plain film of the urinary tract was made in 1896, and the first tests using contrasts started in 1904. <b>Excretory</b> <b>urography</b> has been used since 1930. Plain film of the urinary tract Plain films of the urinary tract {{are used in the}} kidney area, the area of the ureter and urinary bladder. They also show structures (lumbar and sacral spine and pelvis), muscles (m. iliopsoas) as well as calculi. <b>Excretory</b> <b>urography</b> X-ray visualization of the urinary tract with contrast substances is intravenous urography. It is used for diagnosing diseases of the upper urinary system with symptoms such as: pain, colic, hydronephrosis, as well as acute cortical infections, urinary bladder tumors, etc. Retrograde urography Retrograde urography is a procedure recommended when either the pyelocalyx system or the ureter are not seen unilaterally or bilaterally. Cystography and urethrocystography Cystography is used to visualize the bladder. It is recommended in case of intravesical obstruction. Urethrocystography is a technique for investigation of the anterior and prostatic urethra as well as the neck of the urinary bladder.
