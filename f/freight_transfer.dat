25|$|Güvercinlik Yard {{in central}} Ankara {{is the largest}} railway {{facility}} in Turkey. This multi-use facility includes a marshaling yard, passenger yard, 3 repair shops, for passenger cars, freight cars and locomotives, <b>freight</b> <b>transfer</b> terminal and a grain silo siding. The Haydarpaşa Yard is the second largest yard in Turkey, consisting of a freight yard, passenger yard, 3 maintenance shops for locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars, and a loop for trains.|$|E
25|$|Prices dropped quickly {{both for}} {{passenger}} tickets and <b>freight</b> <b>transfer.</b> However, the Ottomans {{were able to}} lower the prices more {{because they did not}} have to pay dividends and did not require as high a profit. This caused the valley line to become favorite among exporters in the Hauran, to the point that many of them preferred to send their goods through the valley line to Haifa and ship them to Beirut, rather than send them directly to Beirut over the French railway.|$|E
25|$|From the 1920s, London was {{surrounded}} by a number of large freight Marshalling yards, where long distance freight was brought and re-organised into new trains for onward transmission to its destination. Three of these yards, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green were operated by the Southern Railway. The requirement for a fast <b>freight</b> <b>transfer</b> locomotive between these yards, and across London to other railway yards provided a challenge for Richard Maunsell. The electrified suburban lines were busy with commuter traffic that took priority over freight workings, and the London network abounded in junctions and signal stops. The design brief called for a powerful locomotive with good acceleration and adhesion. One that was able to climb the steep gradients over the flying junctions that were to be found all over the Southern Railway's London network. The ability to operate over tight curves and be able to move from a standstill on the aforementioned gradients were also key considerations that needed to be incorporated into the design. A tank locomotive design was also preferable since the journeys were relatively short, and the work would involve frequent changes in direction.|$|E
50|$|North of Mackinaw City, train {{passengers}} and <b>freight</b> <b>transferred</b> onto the railroad car ferries {{operated by the}} Mackinac Transportation Company, a joint venture operated by the Michigan Central and two other railroads. On these ferries, railroad service was extended to St. Ignace and onward points on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.|$|R
5000|$|The Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad [...] is a {{terminal}} railroad in the Chicago area, formerly giving various other companies access to (Chicago's) Grand Central Station. It also served to connect those railroads for <b>freight</b> <b>transfers,</b> {{and is now}} controlled by CSX Corporation, the successor to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.|$|R

500|$|The line {{began on}} the east side of {{downtown}} Cincinnati, at the corner of Eggleston Avenue and Court Street. The site of the brick freight depot, closed in 1969 and demolished in 1975, is now owned by Greyhound Lines, which uses it as an intercity bus terminal. A track built in 1887 crossed Court Street, connecting with the Little Miami Railroad's Eggleston Avenue Connection for <b>freight</b> <b>transfer.</b> The line began by climbing the Deer Creek Valley, the only feasible rail entrance to downtown Cincinnati that did not follow a river valley. When the railroad was built in the late 1870s, the valley was used by the city as a dump. An 1852 city ordinance provided for raising the ground level, beginning with the raising of Court Street by as much as [...] To follow the eventual surface level and avoid the steep hillsides, the railroad was built on trestles for much of its ascent, with a maximum grade of 3.5%. After leaving the depot, the line traversed an S-shaped trestle to the east side of the valley, before crossing Elsinore Place and Eden Park Drive at grade, with a second trestle between these streets. (The former was replaced in January 1889 with a straighter single-track trestle.) A bridge took the line over Florence Avenue, and it then passed through the neighborhood of Mount Auburn before passing under the summit through the cut-and-cover Oak Street Tunnel north of McMillan Street. The line started its gradual descent as it left the tunnel, generally following the existing ground level and crossing streets at grade.|$|E
2500|$|Portland Slate Company {{built a new}} mill on the Monson Main line in 1904, and six new flat {{cars were}} built by Laconia Car Company in 1905 to handle {{loadings}} from the new shipper.

2500|$|The track {{crew was}} laid off in 1933, and the train crew became {{responsible}} for right-of-way maintenance and <b>freight</b> <b>transfer</b> at Monson Junction.

25|$|The newly amalgamated Southern Railway {{needed a}} group of {{powerful}} shunting tank locomotives to work in its marshalling yards around London and on <b>freight</b> <b>transfers</b> between them. Robert Urie's G16 class 4-8-0 performed this task well, and further examples were on order in 1922, but Richard Maunsell considered the firebox to be too large and the superheater an unnecessary expense on such locomotives. He therefore cancelled the order in favour of a new design.|$|R
50|$|Built from 1912 to 1913, Lambton {{served as}} {{mechanical}} and freight facilities. It {{also had a}} roundhouse facility from 1913 to 1960.

50|$|The New Jersey Railroad (NJRR; later {{part of the}} Pennsylvania Railroad, PRR) and Paterson and Hudson River Railroad (later part of the Erie Railroad) both {{built their}} lines to this point in 1834 and November 28, 1833, respectively. It took four more years for the NJRR {{to cut through the}} New Jersey Palisades; prior to that, {{passengers}} and <b>freight</b> <b>transferred</b> to horse-drawn carriages over the hill. The junction was a simple one, with both lines merging towards the east, allowing both railroads to access {{the east side of the}} Palisades and the Hudson River.|$|R

50|$|After a few {{teething}} problems, {{the class}} quickly proved {{the advantages of}} diesel electric shunters in terms of effectiveness, cost-saving, and driver comfort. Although at £7,275 they cost £1,100 more to build than a Z class steam locomotive, each one saved about £1,700 per year in operating costs. They could be used continually {{day and night for}} six days each week at Norwood without any service requirement beyond refuelling. They were however found to be too slow for their secondary task of <b>freight</b> <b>transfers</b> around the congested passenger lines in the London area, although perfectly well suited to this traffic on rural lines.|$|R
5000|$|A {{team track}} {{is a small}} {{railroad}} siding or spur track intended {{for the use of}} area merchants, manufacturers, farmers and other small businesses to personally load and unload products and merchandise, usually in smaller quantities. The term [...] "team" [...] refers to the teams of horses or oxen delivering wagon-loads of <b>freight</b> <b>transferred</b> to or from railway cars. Team tracks may be owned by the railroad company or by customers served by the railroad, or by industrial parks or freight terminals that encompass many customers. In some jurisdictions, the operation and construction of team tracks is regulated by legal authorities.|$|R

25|$|The {{desire for}} {{profitability}} {{led to a}} major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s. Dr. Richard Beeching was given the task {{by the government of}} re-organising the railways ("the Beeching Axe"). This policy resulted in many branch lines and secondary routes being closed because they were deemed uneconomic. The closure of stations serving rural communities removed much feeder traffic from main line passenger services. The closure of many freight depots that had been used by larger industries such as coal and iron led to much <b>freight</b> <b>transferring</b> to road haulage. The closures were extremely unpopular with the general public at that time and remain so today.|$|R
