In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are.

40|$|Studies of {{vertical}} {{as well as}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>distributions</b> of fishes often {{require the use of}} gill nets hung vertically from the surface to the bottom. By using gill nets in this fashion it is possible to sample the entire water column as a continuous variable. The specific gear design used for handling gill nets for sampling a vertical water column varies and often a small design change can make the gear much easier to use. Several authors have described vertical gill-net rollers or floats that are to two basic types: (1) those that have a large floating work platform {{as an integral part of}} the net support (Miller and Perrin 1967), and (2) those that are separate and depend on a boat for a working platform, similar to designs described by Hartman (1962), Horak and Tanner (1964), and Lackey (1968).
