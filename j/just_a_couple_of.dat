5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season. When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks {{before the start of}} 2013 Allsvenskan, he picked up a knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months. On his Allsvenskan debut on 25 August 2013 in an away match against Malmö FF he {{suffered}} another injury, which meant that he would be out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of the change of government, former viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{prepared}} a counter-revolution from the city of Córdoba, but Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo routed his militia and captured all the leaders in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> skirmishes. The initial orders were to send them to Buenos Aires, but after their capture the Junta decided to execute them. This decision was taken in a resolution signed by all members of the Junta, excepting Manuel Alberti, because as a priest, he could not give consent to the death penalty. The measure found strong popular resistance in Córdoba, as Liniers and the governor Juan Gutierrez de la Concha were popular and the execution of a priest (Rodrigo de Orellana, another leader of the counter-revolution) was rejected as heretical. Ocampo and Chiclana decided to carry on with the original orders, and transferred the prisoners to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were some}} mixed {{feelings}} about this episode.

25|$|Prior to the cartel's creation, Union and Confederate forces {{exchanged}} prisoners sporadically, usually {{as an act}} {{of humanity}} between opposing field commanders. In some cases, a transfer of only sick and wounded captives took place. Exchanges for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> prisoners between sides could prove very time-consuming to achieve. A few military commanders unfamiliar with the practice were reluctant to engage in exchanges without explicit approval and instruction from their superiors.|$|E
25|$|In <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{decades the}} work of Fisher, Ford, Arthur Cain, Philip Sheppard and Cyril Clarke {{promoted}} natural selection as the primary explanation of variation in natural populations, instead of genetic drift. Evidence {{can be seen in}} Mayr's famous book Animal Species and Evolution, and Ford's Ecological Genetics. Similar shifts in emphasis can be seen in most of the other participants in the evolutionary synthesis, such as Stebbins and Dobzhansky, though the latter was slow to change.|$|E
25|$|The band sent several demos {{to record}} companies, but {{were told that}} in order to be {{published}} they had to cut their hair and sing in Swedish. Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by John Levén. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months later, Levén joined Yngwie Malmsteen's band Rising Force, and Malmsteen's former bassist, Marcel Jacob, joined Force.

25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year.

25|$|The Wrythe {{lies between}} Carshalton village {{to the south}} and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word rithe which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman {{occupation}} of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by {{the fact that there was}} once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.|$|E
25|$|The first {{building}} {{placed at}} Dinas Brân {{was not the}} castle which now stands in ruins {{on top of the}} mountain but an Iron Age hillfort built around 600 BC. An earthen rampart was constructed probably topped by a wooden palisade and this was further protected by a deep ditch on the shallower southern slope. The walls of the hillfort encircled a village of roundhouses. Dinas Brân is one of many hillforts in this part of Wales; Moel y Gaer is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles to the north-west near the Horseshoe Pass, and another is close by at Y Gardden in Ruabon to the east.
