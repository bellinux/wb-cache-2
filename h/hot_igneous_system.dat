40|$|Almost a century’s {{study on}} {{thermodynamics}} of <b>igneous</b> <b>systems</b> has laid a mature {{foundation for the}} equilibrium relations among different phases of minerals and silicate melts. However, this ‘static’ view {{does not account for}} various kinetic processes that drive changes in <b>igneous</b> <b>systems.</b> With the additional temporal angle, the kinetic approach focuses on mineral dissolution and growth that contribute to changes in <b>igneous</b> <b>systems,</b> and aims to quantitatively model them. Taking a kinetic approach, this dissertation presents experimental results on the dissolution kinetics of anorthite - the major mineral in the lunar highland crust, and quartz – the major mineral in Earth’s continental crust, and quantitatively models the convective dissolution or growth of anorthite and quartz in silicate melts. In the anorthite study, the non-convective dissolution of anorthite was shown to be controlled by the diffusion of Al 2 O 3. The Al 2 O 3 concentration profiles conform well to the constant-diffusivity solution to the diffusive dissolution. Though noticeable variation exists across published Al 2 O 3 diffusivity data, such difference was reasonably accounted for by considering compositional effect on diffusivity. Based on Al 2 O 3 diffusivity model and anorhite-melt equilibrium model, both diffusive and convective dissolution rates of anorthite in the basaltic melt were modeled. In the quartz study, the composition-dependent SiO 2 diffusivity complicates the diffusive dissolution of quartz. Boltzmann analysis was developed to characterize the compositional dependence of SiO 2 diffusivity. Combined with functional fitting approach, the two methods showed that lnDSiO 2 linearly depends on the cation mole fraction of Si+Al (XSi+Al). Especially, the effect of H 2 O on SiO 2 diffusivity is simply dilution of XSi+Al by including H as cation. The diffusive dissolution of quartz still follows the parabolic relation, but with DSiO 2 interpreted roughly as the geometric average of diffusivities at interface melts and far-field melts. Based on this, convective dissolution or growth of quartz was modeled to provide constraints on the evolution rate of some <b>igneous</b> <b>systems.</b> Put together, the kinetic studies complement the existing understanding of mineral dissolution and growth, with new insights to account for composition-dependent diffusion behavior. Via kinetic modeling, the work provides important temporal constraints on the evolution rate of natural <b>igneous</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sulfur, the 10 th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} universe and the 14 th {{most abundant}} element in the Earth’s crust, is the defining element of sulfide minerals and provides insights into the origins of these minerals through its stable isotopes. The insights come from variations in the isotopic composition of sulfide minerals and related compounds such as sulfate minerals or aqueous sulfur species, caused by preferential partitioning of isotopes among sulfur-bearing phases, known as fractionation. These variations arise from differences in temperature, or more importantly, oxidation and reduction reactions acting upon the sulfur. The oxidation and reduction reactions can occur at high temperature, such as in <b>igneous</b> <b>systems,</b> at intermediate temperatures, such as in hydrothermal systems, and at low temperature during sedimentary diagenesis.

40|$|International audienceThe {{crystal size}} {{distribution}} (CSD) {{corresponds to the}} number of crystals of a mineral per unit volume within a series of defined size intervals. Many crystal size distributions in <b>igneous</b> <b>systems</b> are straight lines when plotted on the ‘classical' diagram of ln(population density) versus size. Other common CSDs are concave-down on such graphs for the low size values. The effect of growth rate on CSDs seems to be small and nucleation apparently increases exponentially with time. Although magmatic systems are always multiphase, only a few CSD studies deal with several phases. On the basis of the few available published examples, it seems that the parallelism (defined as y-spacing constancy) of the normalized CSDs (i. e. where the crystal lengths are normalized to the greatest length for each phase) is a common feature in <b>igneous</b> <b>systems.</b> The aim of our modelling is to propose a mathematical framework to unify the CSD typology, to explain the common occurrence of straight lines on the ‘classical' CSD diagram and the y-spacing constancy of the normalized CSDs for multiphase rocks, and also to provide a convenient tool to easily test petrogenetic scenarios through efficient computer simulations. The bulk balance modelling is based on a square matrix having for coefficients the number of nuclei of one phase by the crystallized volume of another phase. This interaction matrix is the mainspring of our CSD modelling, which requires straightforward assumptions about the uniformity of crystal shape and growth: (1) at each time, every crystal of a phase has the same shape and (2) the one-dimensional growth rate of a crystal is independent of its size. Consequently, the values of the normalized CSD are linked together by means of an integral equation. For the most part, the behaviour of the CSDs theoretically obtained with a constant matrix may also be observed in computer simulations of more general cases. This extended approach makes feasible the application of the model to natural cases. Concave-down shapes for the lowest size are classically interpreted {{as a consequence of the}} ending of crystallization. By roughly taking into account crystal interactions during the growth process through the concept of mean clutter, we successfully simulate such concave-down CSDs...|$|R

However, there is increasing evidence in our study that these elements can be transported by hydrothermal fluids under the restrictive sets of conditions that commonly prevail in alkaline igneous settings. Our study has provided evidence of metamict processes, which resulted in alteration of the cores of zircon crystals and mobilization of Y and HREE from these crystals to form minerals such as fergusonite-(Y) and Samarskite-(Y). Similar alteration has been documented by Anderson et al. (2008) for zircon from the Georgeville granite, Nova Scotia. The LREE form considerably stronger complexes with fluoride than the HREE and are therefore more easily mobilized. The REE also form relatively strong complexes with chloride and as for fluoride, the strongest complexes are with the LREE, Sheard (2010).

With this approach, oxygen fugacities were calculated for samples from the Bishop tuff (USA), Toba tuff (Indonesia) and the Nain plutonic suite (Canada), which typically agree with independent estimates within one log unit or better. With the success of reproducing the fO 2 of well-constrained <b>igneous</b> <b>systems,</b> we have applied our Ce-in-zircon oxygen barometer to estimating the redox state of Earth's earliest magmas.

This volcanic suite is cored by a multiphase quartz monzonite stock. The WRP (15. 18 ± 0. 31 to 12. 66 ± 0. 54 Ma) consists of an early hypabyssal suite, monzodiorite and diorite intrusions, main phase quartz monzonite of the Teakettle Pass suite, and bimodal late stage dikes. Previous mapping linked the now faulted and detached (by 20 km) volcanic and plutonic suites. The current study establishes a more explicit link between the RM volcanic suite and WRP by using new 206 Pb/ 238 U zircon ages and a more complete geochemical data set. The major conclusions of this new work are that: 1) the WRP and the RM represent a single cogenetic <b>igneous</b> <b>system</b> and; 2) that multiple types of data (lithologic, geochronologic, and geochemical) must be used to identify cogenetic volcanic and plutonic suites. An important implication of this work is that other volcanic fields and plutons closely related in age and chemistry may represent single systems with shared magmatic histories...|$|R
40|$|This map is {{the second}} of a series showing the distribution, composition, and age of early and middle Cenozoic {{volcanic}} centers in the western conterminous United States. The maps are designed primarily as a data base of <b>igneous</b> <b>systems,</b> a major geologic environment known to promote and host mineral depos-its. The data shown provide the basic information necessary for derivative studies such as the development of geologic concepts to identify and assess igneous-related mineral deposits and(or) min-eralized systems. In addition, this map series shows the temporal and spatial relationships of early and middle Cenozoic igneous rocks and their geochemical associations, at a single common map scale, within the many different igneous centers in the western states. This map series {{can also be used}} as a base for studies of volcanology, volcanotectonics, and the general geology of volcanic and related rocks. Original sources were consulted wherever possible in construction of these maps, but in areas of meager data I interpreted the general composition and age of the igneous rocks. This procedure was necessary in order to resolve internal problems and to maintain a standard treatment for meaningful comparison of data throughout the map series. In this map series the early and middle Cenozoic time frame extends from about 58 Ma to 16 Ma; 16 Ma is the maximum age cutoff for a published map series designed as a guide for the evaluation of igneous-related geothermal resources (for the com-parable Colorado and Utah region, see Luedke and Smith, 1978). Within this early and middle Cenozoic time frame, the ages of the volcanic rocks are arbitrarily divided into three time increments...|$|R
40|$|The densities {{and thermal}} expansivities of F-bearing haplogranitic glasses and liquids have been {{investigated}} {{using a combination of}} scanning calorimetry and dilatometry. F 2 O- 1 reduces the density of haplogranitic liquids (at 750 °C) from 2. 295 + 0. 006 g/cm 3 to 2. 261 + 0. 005 g/cm 3 with the addition of 4. 55 wt% F (0. 33 % per wt% of F added). The expansivities of the liquids increase with the addition of F 2 O- 1 from 29. 9 +- 3. 0 x l 0 - 6 /°C to 53. 1 +- 1. 4 x l 0 - 6 /°C (at 750 °C). Densities have been converted into molar volumes based on the haplogranite and F 2 O- 1 components. The partial molar volume of F 2 O- 1 has been calculated at 750 °C to be 14. 2 +- 1. 3 cm 3 /mol in these melts. This value is close to the molar volume per O for several components of silicate melts. F and O have similar ionic and covalent radii, and thus the substitution of two F for one O yields approximately the volume change expected, assuming no secondaryc onsequencesfo r the averagec oordination number of cations. This is despite evidence from quenched melts that [6]Al exists in these compositions. F is significantly more effective (per wt% added) than B 2 O 3 in reducing the density of haplogranitic melt. The effect of F on density reported here should complement the viscosity- reducing effect of F 2 O- 1 on granitic melts in significantly acceleratingg ravity-driven processes of crystal-melt fractionation in F-rich <b>igneous</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} fluid (FI) and melt {{inclusions}} (MI) {{can be a}} powerful tool for understanding melt generation, crystallization, mixing histories of magmas and the conditions of magma evolution during their ascent to the surface. FI and MI data from the alkali syenite xenoliths of different subvolcanic <b>igneous</b> <b>systems</b> in the Neapolitan volcanic area (Vesuvius, Campi Flegrei, Ponza and Ventotene) in Italy provide valuable information on the nature of fluid and melt phases trapped during the late evolutionary stages of these alkaline magmatic systems. They also document liquid immiscibility at pre-eruptive magma conditions and furnish evidence that high salinity fluids (brines) exsolve directly from magma in the upper part of chambers at the magmatic/hydrothermal transition and play critical roles in ore metal transport. Magma chamber margins are of particular significance because FI and MI may record the various evolutionary processes during the crystallization of the magmatic system. The complex daughter crystal assemblages seen in the silicate melt + CO 2 + H 2 O and silicate melt, hypersaline or S-rich aqueous inclusions found in xenoliths of some samples record high solute contents in the fluid(s) during entrapment and provide direct evidence of the magmatic source of these metals. The latter inclusions could be of considerable interest for the interpretation of ore genesis, because FI and MI demonstrate a linkage of these systems with low sulfidation epithermal deposits and some porphyry systems. In addition, FI and MI data are used {{to address the problem of}} frequent ground movements (bradyseism) in the Campi Flegrei, interpreted as representing a modern analog behaving physically like a porphyry system...|$|R

An examination of the structural pattern of this area indicates that the fold trends form a radial pattern.

40|$|Metallic Fe-Ni {{is rare in}} {{terrestrial}} rocks, being largely {{restricted to}} serpentinized peridotites and volcanic rocks that assimilated carbonaceous material. In contrast, metallic Fe-Ni is nearly ubiquitous among extraterrestrial samples (i. e., meteorites, lunar rocks, and interplanetary dust particles). Anhedral grains are common. For example, in eucrites and lunar basalts, most of the metallic Fe-Ni occurs interstitially between silicate grains and thus tends to have irregular morphologies. In many porphyritic chondrules, metallic Fe-Ni and troilite form rounded blebs in the mesostasis because their precursors were immiscible droplets. In metamorphosed ordinary chondrites, metallic Fe-Ni and troilite form coarse anhedral grains. Some of the metallic Fe-Ni and troilite grains has also been mobilized and injected into fractures in adjacent silicate grains where local shock-reheating temperatures reached the Fe-FeS eutectic (988 C). In interplanetary dust particles metallic Fe-Ni most commonly occurs along with sulfide as spheroids and fragments. Euhedral metallic Fe-Ni grains are extremely rare. Several conditions must be met before such grains can form: (1) grain growth must occur at free surfaces, restricting euhedral metallic Fe-Ni grains to <b>systems</b> that are <b>igneous</b> or undergoing vapor-deposition; (2) the metal (+/-) sulfide assemblage must have an appropriate bulk composition so that taenite is the liquidus phase in <b>igneous</b> <b>systems</b> or the stable condensate phase in vapor-deposition systems; and (3) metallic Fe-Ni grains must remain underformed during subsequent compaction, thermal metamorphism, and shock. Because of these restrictions, the occurrence of euhedral metallic Fe-Ni grains in an object can potentially provide important petrogenetic information. Despite its rarity, euhedral metallic Fe-Ni occurs {{in a wide variety}} of extraterrestrial materials. Some of these materials formed in the solar nebula; others formed on parent body surfaces by meteoroid impacts...|$|R
