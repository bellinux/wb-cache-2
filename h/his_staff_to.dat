5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of The Adventures of Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E

Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E
5|$|The {{crew was}} {{likewise}} {{unprepared for the}} emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock {{for a few minutes}} before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but Titanics passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, Charles Joughin, and <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> do so. No lifeboat or fire drills had been conducted since Titanic left Southampton. A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> see {{a variety of}} films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> Powers Hill.|$|E
5|$|North of the Alps, Army Group G {{followed}} suit on 6 May. Kesselring now decided to surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser {{to supervise the}} SS troops {{to ensure that the}} surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at Saalfelden, near Salzburg, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, the commander of the 101st Airborne Division, who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at Zeltweg and Graz unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> move into a hotel at Berchtesgaden. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created a stir in the United States. Kesselring met with Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.|$|E
