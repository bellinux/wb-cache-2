Effects of forming pressure on carbonation of steel slag and carbonated depth were studied by pore structural changes before and after carbonation and carbonated region. The results showed that these were visible pore structural changes between non-carbonated and carbonated steel slag, and after carbonation, the porosity <b>of</b> steel slag <b>samples</b> were decreased, the number of fine pore was increased and large pore was opposite.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a primary study on the effects of water on permanent deformation potential of asphalt concrete mixtures by using Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA). The same gradation was applied for all mixes. The samples were preconditioned using four different procedures: soaked, saturated, saturated with freeze-thaw conditioning cycle, and preheated. Among the saturated samples and the saturated with freeze-thaw cycle samples, the samples were conditioned to 25 %, 50 % and 75 % degrees of saturation respectively. The freeze-thaw cycles were designed as 1, 4 and 7 cycles. The rut test was performed with APA under wet and dry conditions. All samples saturated with freeze-thaw cycle were tested in wet rut. The results indicate that water influences the rut <b>depths.</b> The <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> wet rut are greater than those of dry rut in most of preconditioning states. Saturation with freeze-thaw cycle, which is normally considered a harsher preconditioning, does not result in larger wet rut depths in this study.

The secondary alteration effects in the noble gases are distributed unevenly throughout the specimens, as seen in the nonsystematic differences observed for the heavy noble gases. Chemical analyses show significant enrichment of Ba and Sr in the outer parts of the weathered samples due to element contamination through aqueous solution. Iron, Ni, and Co are partly flushed from the system as the metal oxidation proceeds. Oxygen isotopes show increases in delta(sup 18) O and delta(sup 17) O with increasing terrestrial age.

40|$|Imaging of {{biological}} samples using fluorescence microscopy has advanced substantially with {{new technologies to}} overcome the resolution barrier of the diffraction of light allowing super-resolution of live samples. There are currently three main types of super-resolution techniques – stimulated emission depletion (STED), single-molecule localization microscopy (including techniques such as PALM, STORM, and GDSIM), and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). While STED and single-molecule localization techniques show the largest increases in resolution, they have been slower to offer increased speeds of image acquisition. Three-dimensional SIM (3 D-SIM) is a wide-field fluorescence microscopy technique that offers a number of advantages over both single-molecule localization and STED.

However, our knowledge of the effects of uncertainty in the assessment of different ecological indicators is limited. Here, we used data from a standardized campaign of aquatic plant surveys, in 28 lakes from 10 European countries, to assess variation in macrophyte metrics across a set of nested spatial scales: countries, lakes, sampling stations, replicate transects, and replicate samples at two depth-zones. Metrics investigated in each transect included taxa richness, maximum depth of colonisation and two indicators of trophic status: Ellenberg’s N and a metric based on phosphorus trophic status. Metrics were found to have a slightly stronger relationship to pressures when they were calculated on abundance data compared to presence/absence data.

The present paper aims to identify, using the Grassberger-Procaccia correlation dimension (CD) algorithm, {{the existence of}} a nonlinear deterministic and chaotic dynamic behaviour in the spatial pattern of arsenic, manganese and zinc concentration in a Russian coal waste disposal site. The analysis carried out yielded embedding dimension values ranging between 7 and 8 suggesting thus from a chaotic dynamic perspective that arsenic, manganese and zinc concentration in space is a medium dimensional problem for the regionalized scale considered in this study. This alternative nonlinear dynamics approach may complement conventional geostatistical studies and may be also used for the estimation of risk and the subsequent screening and selection of a feasible remediation scheme in wider mining and waste disposal sites.
