Two steep hills, Brynsbakken on the Loenga–Alnabru Line and Tistedalsbakken south of Halden are currently major hindrances. Proposals have been made to build new lines to bypass these hills. One alternative to the south <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new railway from around Berg to Skee on the Bohus Line in Sweden. The capacity through the Western Line will be so large, especially during rush hour north of Moss, that it is possible that all freight trains may be routed via the Eastern Line.

25|$|The People's Republic of China has {{initiated}} {{a research and}} development project in thorium molten-salt reactor technology.

An expected intermediate outcome of the TMSR research program <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> 2 MW pebble bed fluoride salt cooled research reactor in 2015, and a 2 MW molten salt fueled research reactor in 2017.

The project is spearheaded by Jiang Mianheng, with a start-up budget of $350 million, and has already recruited 140 PhD scientists, working full-time on thorium molten salt reactor research at the Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics. An expansion of staffing has increased to 700 as of 2015. As of 2016, their plan is for a 10MW pilot LFTR is expected to be made operational in 2025, with a 100MW version set to follow in 2035.|$|E
25|$|Normally, a wing {{with such}} a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor {{performance}} due {{to the degree of}} induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip vortices carry a lot of energy with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these vortices <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and roll rate of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the tip vortex problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip vortices. The propellers are arranged to rotate in the opposite direction to the tip vortices, with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E
