"Of the old Spanish {{translation}} of the Old Testament, published in Ferrara, we have availed ourselves hereof {{more than any other}} that we have seen thus far, not simply due to it always being accurate in such things, but rather because it gives us the natural and first meaning of Hebrew terms, and the differences between the tenses of the verbs as found in the same text; it is a work that is worthy of greater esteem (in the judgement of all those that understand it) than the many others found to this day: and by this <b>exceptional</b> <b>aid,</b> of which the other translations have not taken advantage, we hope that ours will not be considered inferior to any of them." ...|$|E

25|$|Lifesaving Award: may be {{presented}} to any classified or civilian employee when a person would more than likely have died or suffered permanent brain damage {{if not for the}} employee's actions. The act must clearly indicate the employee did {{at least one of the}} following: (a) rendered <b>exceptional</b> first <b>aid</b> or (b) made a successful rescue (e.g. from a burning building or vehicle, or from drowning).|$|R
5000|$|The Merry Band's <b>exceptional</b> musicianship <b>aid</b> in {{creating}} the style Williamson had desired in the past. He and the troupe would tour regularly in the mid-seventies. The addition of the Celtic style and acoustic ensemble would be a trademark of Williamson and The Merry Band on further works. [...] "Likky Lambert", guesting on the album, is actually former String Band member Licorice McKechnie. Her final recording appearances are on the tracks [...] "Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "The Bells".|$|R
50|$|Gettysburg {{is known}} to be generous with {{financial}} aid, with over 70% of students receiving some form of aid. The Princeton Review has called Gettysburg a Best Value College, an award given to schools with <b>exceptional</b> financial <b>aid</b> systems and high rates of employment after graduation. 94% of alumni one year after graduation were either in graduate school or employed. This distinction is given to only 150 colleges in the United States, only 8 of which are in Pennsylvania. The Princeton Review has also called Gettysburg a College That Pays You Back, ranking the college 11th in Best Schools for Internships, one of only four liberal arts colleges to make the top 25.|$|R
2500|$|While {{serving with}} his platoon in 1944 on Guam and the Philippines, {{he was awarded}} two Bronze Star Medals with a [...] "V" [...] device for <b>exceptional</b> valor in <b>aiding</b> wounded {{soldiers}} under fire. During the Battle of Okinawa, he saved the lives of 75 wounded infantrymen atop the area known by the 96th Division as the Maeda Escarpment or Hacksaw Ridge. Doss was wounded four times in Okinawa, and was evacuated on May 21, 1945, aboard the USS Mercy. He was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in Okinawa on October 12, 1945.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Forbidden by the Treaty {{establishing}} the European Economic Community (EEC Treaty), but permitted in <b>exceptional</b> cases, State <b>aids</b> are constantly under the “eye ” of the European executive {{as regards the}} granting mechanisms, as well as concerning its monitoring. In order to undertake a more efficient control of State aids, the European Commission has adopted a new Block Exemption Regulation which came into force in 20 days from its publication in the EU Official Journal 1, respectively on 29 th of August 2008. In this article I shall present {{certain aspects of the}} new normative act...|$|R
5000|$|Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle {{called the}} film Leigh's [...] "best and most {{accessible}} work to date" [...] and remarked that [...] "everyone's had these family skirmishes and confrontations in their lives, and it's remarkable {{to see them}} recorded so accurately and painfully on film. Leigh's marvelous achievement is not only in capturing emotional clarity on film, but also in illustrating {{the ways in which}} families start to heal and find a certain bravery in their efforts." [...] Similarly, Kenneth Turan from the Los Angeles Times ranked the film within [...] "the best of the 14 features Leigh" [...] had directed by then. He found that Secrets & Lies was [...] "a piercingly honest, completely accessible piece of work that will go directly to the hearts of audiences who have never heard of him. If film means anything to you, if emotional truth is a quality you care about, this is an event that ought not be missed ... Unforced, confident and completely involving, with <b>exceptional</b> acting <b>aided</b> by Dick Pope's unobtrusive camera work and John Gregory's telling editing, Secrets & Lies is filmmaking to savor." ...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in Shanghai, Jardine, Matheson & Co. {{were the}} first to {{register}} a building lot on the Bund in 1843 where their first premises at No. 27 were completed in 1851. In the second edition of his Shanghai handbook published in 1920, the Rev. C. B. Darwent estimated that by 1900, the firm's initial investment of £500 in the land was by then worth £1,000,000. Plans for a new Renaissance style building with five stories were drawn up by local architects Stewardson & Spence and work began in 1920. The building was completed in November 1922 and featured a specially designed silk room with <b>exceptional</b> lighting to <b>aid</b> the silk inspectors in their work. Another story was later added to the building and it is today home to the Shanghai Foreign Trade Bureau (...) [...]|$|R
40|$|If, as is contended in {{the social}} {{security}} literature, a policy for the poor is a poor policy, a final judgment of poverty programs crucially depends on the effects such programs may have on the behaviour of different actors. Assuming that these are to a significant extent determined by concerns of fairness rather than by economic interests, the argument is made {{to look at a}} poverty program as an interaction between different concepts of justice. The particular case we look at, a food emergency program organized and financed by the Belgian NGO Médicins sans Frontières-Artsen Zonder Grenzen in Kinshasa, suggests indeed that the importance of local standards of fairness in the sphere of food is seriously underestimated, even if the intervention is clearly designed as a purely humanitarian answer to an <b>exceptional</b> calamity.

40|$|Under recent reforms, the UK {{government}} has eroded state funding for civil legal aid. Funding cuts affect asylum and immigration law as produced, practiced, and mediated {{in the course}} of interactions between case workers and their clients in legal-aid-funded Law Centers in South London. The article explores the contradictory character of one-on-one relationships between case workers and clients. Despite pressure to quantify their work in "value for money" terms, the empathy that often motivates case workers drives them to provide <b>exceptional</b> levels of <b>aid</b> to their clients in facing an arbitrary bureaucracy. Such personalized commitment may persuade applicants to accept the decisions of that bureaucracy, thus reinforcing a hegemonic understanding {{of the power of the}} law. The article, however, challenges the assumption that, in attempting to shape immigrant/refugees as model-albeit second-class-citizens, case worker/client interactions necessarily subscribe to the categories and assumptions that underpin UK immigration and asylum law...|$|R
40|$|The “Spanish ” {{influenza}} pandemic {{killed at least}} 20 million people in 1918 – 1919, making it the worst infectious pandemic in history. Understanding {{the origins of the}} 1918 virus and the basis for its <b>exceptional</b> virulence may <b>aid</b> in the prediction of future {{influenza pandemic}}s. RNA from a victim of the 1918 pandemic was isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, lung tissue sample. Nine fragments of viral RNA were sequenced from the coding regions of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, matrix protein 1, andmatrix protein 2. The sequences are consistent with a novel H 1 N 1 influenza A virus that belongs to the subgroup of strains that infect humans and swine, not the avian subgroup. The influenza pandemic of 1918 was ex-ceptional in both breadth and depth. Out-breaks of the disease swept not only North America and Europe but spread as far as the Alaskan wilderness and the most remote islands of the Pacific. Large proportions o...|$|R
