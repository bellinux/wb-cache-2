25|$|The {{character}} {{returns in}} the game's sequel, Mass Effect 3, released on March 6, 2012. He is first {{seen as a}} hologram on Mars when Shepard is retrieving data to stop the concurrent Reaper invasion of Earth. The Illusive Man tells Shepard his plan to control the Reapers and attempts to foil Shepard when Shepard resists. Over {{the course of the}} game, the Illusive Man commands Cerberus to attack the planet Sur'Kesh, homeworld of the salarians, to instigate a war between two allied races and {{to take control of the}} allied interspecies forces' base, the Citadel. He makes another appearance on the asari home planet, Thessia, where he again tries to convince Shepard that controlling the Reapers is the best solution. Shepard refuses and suggests that the Illusive Man is indoctrinated. In response, the Illusive Man commands the assassin Kai Leng to steal vital information necessary to combat the Reapers. Shepard tracks the VI to Cerberus's headquarters and discovers videos of the Illusive Man having himself implanted with Reaper technology and warning Kai Leng of Shepard. In these videos, the Illusive Man shows the Commander a great deal of respect. The Illusive Man makes his penultimate appearance at the headquarters. The Illusive Man appears at the Citadel in the endgame. Depending on prior in-game choices, players then decide whether to shoot him, or to convince him that he is indoctrinated, which makes him shoot himself. If the player shoots him he remarks <b>how</b> <b>beautiful</b> Earth is while gazing out through the Citadel arms, wishing Shepard could see it the same way, before succumbing to his wounds.|$|E
25|$|Imonida, {{the love}} of Oroonoko’s life, is a {{beautiful}} African woman who is sold into slavery after Oroonoko attempts to rescue her. When Oroonoko meets Imonida, they instantly fall in love. His first encounter with her is described as, “a beauty, that to describe her truly she was female to the noble male, the beautiful black Venus to our young Mars, as charming in her person as he, and of delicate virtues” (Behn, 9). Oroonoko is smitten by her, instantly asks her for her hand in marriage, and without hesitation she agrees. Although the African tradition of having more than one wife is still prevalent during this time, Oroonoko assures Imonida that he will never take on another wife. It {{is evident in the}} novella that Oroonoko and Imonida’s love for one another is unconditional. Once the King, Oroonoko’s grandfather, hears different rumors of <b>how</b> <b>beautiful</b> Imoinda is, he becomes adamant on making her one of his women. Despite his grandson’s deep affection and love for Imonida, the King gives her a royal veil which officially marks Imoinda as one of the King’s women. This is an honor that is nearly impossible to refuse and Oroonoko is angered by his grandfather’s actions. Imonida becomes a vital character by becoming the heart and center of this tragic travel narrative alongside Oroonko. Her beauty, strength, and flawless characteristics attract Oroonoko, the King, and even the reader for that matter. Oroonoko and Imoinda were constantly being separated once Imoinda gets sold into slavery. Regardless of how long they were a part, their love remained strong and eventually they are reunited. This never ending love between Oroonoko and Imoinda is evident throughout the novella. Both characters are willing to announce their love, make brutal sacrifices, and remain passionate for one another which helps solidify the strength of their unconditional love.|$|E

Cameron Duddy was able to shot the behind-the-scenes {{in exchange for his}} jean jacket, which Mars used during the music video. The video features Peruvian-Australian actress Nathalie Kelley. Lander considers Bruno Mars a star. He adds [...] "The charisma that he has, you can’t teach.” Finishing with [...] "singer even manages to be suave in his mugshot, which is no small feat!" [...] He sees the video as a collaboration, the video director came up with the vision and Mars added his vision and so on. The video is a mixture of live action and stopped animation and through the animation Bruno shows his girlfriend <b>how</b> <b>beautiful</b> she is. He takes a cassette tape and starts creating images out of the tape and they start to get a life of their own.|$|E
500|$|By {{the fifth}} orbit, Schirra {{had begun to}} relax, commenting {{that it was the}} first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small bungee cord {{exercise}} device for [...] "a little bit of stretching", before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on [...] "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made some comments on <b>how</b> <b>beautiful</b> the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery [...] "Buenos Dias, y'all!" [...] Schirra later noted that he was [...] "furious" [...] at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.|$|E
500|$|Much of [...] "Boom Town" [...] {{was filmed}} on Cardiff Bay, with one scene in {{particular}} {{in front of the}} Millennium Centre, in February 2005. The Doctor is seen reading the Welsh newspaper Western Mail; Davies stated that he wanted to incorporate Welsh culture because the series is made in Wales and contains a lot of Welsh crew members. He also wanted to show off <b>how</b> <b>beautiful</b> the area could be. The night shoot of Rose and Mickey in front of the water tower at Roald Dahl Plass had to be extended to two nights because it was below the temperature at which the fountain automatically shuts off. The dinner scene between the Doctor and Margaret was filmed in January 2005 at the Cardiff restaurant Bistro 10 before the rest of the episode was filmed; Eccleston filmed the scene while Piper and Barrowman were filming scenes for [...] "The Empty Child". [...] This was due to scheduling conflicts with Badland. Some of the schedule was also rearranged because of the death of Piper's uncle, resulting in her and Eccleston being replaced by doubles during some scenes {{near the end of the}} episode. The egg Margaret turns into was a reused prop from the second episode, [...] "The End of the World".|$|E

500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga <b>how</b> <b>beautiful</b> she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
500|$|The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, [...] "It is easy, {{because of}} the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay {{insufficient}} attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres." [...] Maw said of Britten, [...] "He {{is one of the}} 20th century's great orchestral composers... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers." [...] Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale. The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as [...] "the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible". Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: [...] "less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between [...] "Dawn", [...] "Sunday Morning", [...] "Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Storm". The commentator Howard Posner observes {{that there is not a}} bar in the interludes, no matter <b>how</b> <b>beautiful,</b> that is free of foreboding. The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work [...] "exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [...] fits well into Britten's oeuvre." [...] David Matthews calls it [...] "a brilliant educational exercise." ...|$|E
