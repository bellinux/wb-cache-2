5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only <b>homogenise</b> through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. To {{determine}} whether freezing before homogenisation or the reverse procedure {{was the best}} way of achieving maximal recovery of chlamydiae from solid tissues, specimens from mice infected experimentally with Chlamydia trachomatis were used. For 10 of 12 mice, three-fold to over fifty-fold more chlamydiae were isolated from portions of spleens which were <b>homogenised</b> before freezing in liquid nitrogen than from those which were <b>homogenised</b> after being stored frozen. The value of <b>homogenising</b> small strips of infected genital tissue before freezing was less apparent. Nevertheless, if this was undertaken, the number of chlamydiae recovered from the tissues of four of 10 mice was three-fold to seven-fold more than if the tissues were <b>homogenised</b> after freezing...|$|R

2500|$|John Jowett argues the {{production}} very much reinforced the teleoloical assumptions {{upon which the}} Tudor myth is based; [...] "it generated an epic sense of history as a horrific process.

[...] Randall Martin similarly writes [...] "Barton created a compelling dynastic saga about the houses of Lancaster and York, as one falls and the other triumphs - or appears to do so. This emphasis on family history over any single personal story was reinforced by the plays' relationship to the wider cycle, which affiliated individual episodes to an epic structure and teleological interpretation of history." [...] Likewise, Nicholas Grene explains that [...] "as Tillyard saw the history plays, they were the grandly consistent embodiment of the orthodox political and social morality of the Elizabethan period, preaching order and hierarchy, condemning factious power-seeking and the anarchy of civil war to which it led, commending the divinely sanctioned centralised monarchy of the Tudors. Barton and Hall worked to <b>homogenise,</b> to accentuate and underline the orthodoxy postulated by Tillyard." ...|$|E

Finite element method adapted to the new non-linear model of tissue electroporation is used to compare experiments with simulations. Adapting the phenomenological electroporation model of Leguèbe et al. to the tissue scale, we calibrate the tissue model with experimental data. This makes two steps appear in the tissue electroporation process, as for cells. The new insight of the model lies in the well-established equivalent circuit approach to provide a <b>homogenised</b> version of cell scale models. Our approach is tightly linked to numerical homogenisation strategies adapted to bioelectrical tissue modeling...|$|R

The use of homogenisation in cheesemaking is limited due to the deleterious impact on cheese quality. The objective {{was to investigate the}} effects of a pre-processing routine (homogenisation of raw milk, incubation and pasteurisation) on the resultant cheese. Pilot- and laboratory-scale Cheddar cheeses were produced where raw bovine milk was <b>homogenised</b> at various pressures (0, 5 and 10  MPa in the pilot-scale and 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25  MPa in the laboratory-scale trial), incubated at 37  °C for 1  h and batch-pasteurised at 63  °C for 30  min. A control milk was not <b>homogenised.</b> Acid degree value increased with increasing homogenisation pressure. Moisture and salt contents were higher in cheeses made with milk <b>homogenised</b> at 5 and 10  MPa, as was pH. The cheese made from milk <b>homogenised</b> at 10  MPa contained the highest level of FFA initially and throughout ripening. Breakdown of αs 1 -casein was more extensive in cheese made from non-homogenised milks and breakdown of β-casein was more extensive in <b>homogenised</b> milk cheeses. The use of low-pressure homogenisation in a controlled pre-processing routine may be suitable for cheesemaking; however, further investigation into the effects of the pre-treatment and effects on cheese microstructure and sensory properties is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Adobe masonry {{is largely}} used as {{construction}} material worldwide and the mechanical modelling of adobe structures {{is a key}} issue. This work deals with 2 -D micromechanical analysis of two component adobe masonry (i. e. composite system composed of adobe bricks and mortar joints), focusing {{on the influence of}} different bond configurations and loading schemes. Homogenization is applied by defining a periodic unit cell for each of the investigated bond schemes and by deriving global failure curves, based on failure criteria of both mortar and bricks. Experimental tests showed bi-modularity (i. e. different Young modulus in compression and tension) for both mortar and bricks, so this feature of elastic behaviour was taken into account in micromodelling. The results are twofold: for each bond scheme, critical curves in the principal stress plane are derived for the <b>homogenised</b> unit cell, and the relationships between the <b>homogenised</b> elastic moduli and the loading angle is obtained. Micromechanical analysis provided a major difference between <b>homogenised</b> elastic behaviour in tension and in compression.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is a study of homogenisation problems in electromagnetics and elasticity with potential applications {{to the development of}} metamaterials. In Chapter 1, I study the leading order frequency approximations of the quasi-static Maxwell equations on the torus. A higher-order asymptotic regime is used to derive a higher-order <b>homogenised</b> equation for the solution of an elliptic second-order partial differential equation. The equivalent variational approach to this problem is studied which leads to an equivalent higher-order <b>homogenised</b> equation. Finally, the derivation of higher-order constitutive laws relating the fields to their inductions is presented. In Chapter 2, I study the governing equations of linearised elasticity where the periodic composite material of interest is made up of a "critically" scaled "stiff" rod framework with the voids in between filled in with a "soft" material which is in high-contrast with the stiff material. Using results from two-scale convergence theory, a well posed <b>homogenised</b> model is presented with features reminiscent of both high-contrast and thin structure <b>homogenised</b> models with the additional feature of a linking relation of Wentzell type. The spectrum of the limiting operator is investigated and the establishment of the convergence of spectra from the initial problem is derived. In the final chapter, I investigate brie y three additional homogenisation problems. In the first problem, I study a periodic dielectric composite and show that there exists a critical scaling between the material parameter of the soft inclusion and the period of the composite. In the second problem, I use of two-scale convergence theory to derive a <b>homogenised</b> model for Maxwell's equations on thin rod structures and in the final problem I study Maxwell's equations in R^ 3 under a chiral transformation of the coordinates and derive a <b>homogenised</b> model in this special geometry...|$|R
