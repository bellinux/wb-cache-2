5|$|T-26 mod. 1939 in the Kubinka Tank Museum, Moscow Oblast (Russia): this {{tank with}} pressed turret front {{armoured}} plate is in drivable condition (the GAZ-41 engine from the BRDM-2 {{was installed in}} 2005). The tank has combat damage taken during the Great Patriotic War (many marks from armour-piercing bullets and a welded <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right side of the}} turret from a 50mm shell).|$|E
5|$|Vent: A thin tube on {{the near}} end of the cannon {{connecting}} the explosive charge inside with an ignition source outside and often filled with a length of fuse; always located near the breech. Sometimes called the fuse hole or the touch <b>hole.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> top of the vent {{on the outside of}} the cannon is a flat circular space called the vent field where the charge is lit. If the cannon is bronze, it will often have a vent piece made of copper screwed into the length of the vent.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} break out of Normandy, the Allied armies {{developed}} a multi-stage operation. It started with a British and Canadian attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in Operation Goodwood on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its armoured reserves to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers carpet bombed a 6000-metre <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western end of the German lines around Saint-Lô in Operation Cobra, allowing the Americans to push forces through this hole in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army—which included large segments of the soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (Operation Bluecoat) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the orderly withdrawal eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.|$|E
50|$|Small {{versions}} of this instrument, called bird flageolets, were also made and were used for teaching birds to sing. These tiny flageolets have, like the French flageolet, four finger <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front and two thumb <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying {{took place}} on 20-21 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eden Course and 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Old Course; the top 80 and ties qualified. Jock Hutchison led <b>the</b> field <b>on</b> 146; <b>the</b> {{qualifying}} score was 161 and 85 players advanced.|$|R
50|$|All entries played 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first day}} {{with all those}} within 19 strokes of the leader making the cut and playing 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day, with the {{additional}} provision that the final day's field had to contain at least 32 professionals.|$|R
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back wall. On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting {{this turn}} of events, Rin travels {{back into the}} {{artificial}} world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Slavas draft had {{increased}} {{too much to}} allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and Vormsi (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the February Revolution had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a shoal southeast of the channel because {{there was no one to}} obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and Slava settled on the shallow bottom with a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> starboard side near the funnel. She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets and scrapped in 1935 by the Estonians.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the typical}} piri, {{there are eight}} finger <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bamboo body. Seven of <b>the</b> finger <b>holes</b> are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front and one is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back for the thumb.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying {{took place}} on 9-10 July, and entries played 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Old Course at Troon Golf Club and 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lochgreen Troon Municipal course. A maximum of 120 players qualified; the {{qualifying}} score was 154 and 119 players qualified. Eric Brown of Scotland led the qualifiers with 139, and Palmer was at 143. This was the last Open in which all players had to qualify; in 1963 a system of exemptions for the leading players was introduced. A maximum of 50 players could make the cut to play 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day.|$|R
2500|$|A third method uses a {{pictorial}} tablature {{similar to}} the ocarina's finger hole pattern, with blackened holes that represent holes to cover. The tablature represents <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the ocarina, and, where necessary, <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underside. This enables easy playing, particularly for beginners. The two most popular tabulature systems are: ...|$|R
5|$|The Enterprise was {{refurbished}} for its space shots, {{with its}} shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail {{added to the}} frame. Compared to the newly built Reliant, the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen; it took eight people to mount the model, and a forklift truck to move it. The Reliant, meanwhile, was lighter and had less complex internal wiring. The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage. Any reflection of blue on the ship's hull would appear as a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> film; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film. The same camera used to film Star Wars, the Dykstraflex, was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships.|$|E
5|$|The MOD {{commissioned}} {{a series of}} multi-beam sonar surveys to image the wreck and appraise its condition. The high-resolution sonograms showed Royal Oak to be lying almost upside down with her top works forced into the seabed. The tip of the bow had been blown off by U-47s first torpedo and a gaping <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> starboard flank {{was the result of}} the triple strike from her second successful salvo. Following several years of delays, Briggs Marine was contracted by the MoD to conduct the task of pumping off the remaining oil. Royal Oaks mid-construction conversion to fuel oil had placed her fuel tanks in unconventional positions, complicating operations. By 2006, all double bottom tanks had been cleared and the task of removing oil from the inner wing tanks with cold cutting equipment began the next year. By 2010, some 1600 tonnes of fuel oil had been removed, and the wreck was declared to be no longer actively releasing oil into Scapa Flow. Operations continue at a reduced pace to tackle the oil known to be remaining (state for 2012).|$|E

25|$|N. Kameswara Rao {{proved that}} pots {{excavated}} from Mohenjo daro {{dating back to}} 2800 BCE had been used as water clocks. They are tapered at the bottom, have a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side, and {{are similar to the}} utensil used to perform abhishekam (pour holy water) on shivalingam.|$|E
25|$|On June 14, 1979, {{the number}} 5 and 6 tires on an Air France Concorde blew out during takeoff. Shrapnel thrown from the tires and rims damaged number 2 engine, {{punctured}} three fuel tanks, severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires, {{in addition to}} tearing a large <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of the wing, over the wheel well area.|$|E
25|$|A {{tap hole}} {{near the edge}} of the top, and a spile <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side used for {{conditioning}} the unfiltered and unpasteurised beer. A keg has a single opening in the centre of the top to which a flow pipe is attached. Kegs are artificially pressurised after fermentation with carbon dioxide or a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas.|$|E

The prize money for first place was increased from £30 to £50 while that for second place was increased from £20 to £25.|$|R
50|$|There was no {{qualifying}} competition. All entries played 18 <b>holes</b> {{in pairs}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first two days}} with all those within 14 strokes of the leader making the cut and playing 36 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day.|$|R
25|$|Once a hwacha {{was set up}} for combat, the {{operators}} would use the gunpowder stored in a boot-like bag tied on each igniter {{to be used for}} each <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> machine. After that, {{the operators}} were able to load the hwacha with arrows or iron spikes and be ready to shoot. To do so, they stepped back, covered their ears, and pulled the rope for each igniter.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cellar}} is promarily {{constructed}} of field stone and mortar, with a wood shingled gable roof on top. Access into the cellar is an inclined double wooden cellar {{door at the}} surface, down a set of stairs, and through a second wooden door {{at the bottom of}} the stairs. The cellar has a round air vent on one side and a square screened <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other, providing air movement into the cellar.|$|E
25|$|The {{width of}} the wreath was 5mm at the widest point and tapered to the apex where two oak leaves meet tip-to-tip. The height of the badge from base to tip was 26mm. The {{swastika}} was superimposed upon the separately-made wreath and was soldered onto the wreath assembly. The reverse side had four pins for attachment to allow securing to a strip of Iron Cross Second Class ribbon. This ribbon was then looped through the second button <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tunic of the recipient.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{typically}} live {{in paper}} nests, which {{consist of a}} pedicle (a paper comb on the inside), an envelope, and a single entry <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside. Materials such as twigs, branches, and any other plant sources available to them are broken up, chewed, and shaped into a nest by the workers. These pieces are not uniform in shape, but are glued together very closely. Since social wasps generally prefer to build nests in the dark, envelopes are commonly found surrounding the nests to make them dark if the colony could not locate a dark crevice in which to build.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the night, Kilroy was {{tortured}} and sodomized. He was then led {{out to the}} field and Constanzo killed him by chopping {{the back of his}} neck and head with a machete. His brain was then boiled on a nganga, an African metal pot that Constanzo used to stew human and animal remains. Kilroy's limbs were chopped off above his knees to facilitate his burial. A wire was inserted in his spinal cord to pull the bones out once the body decomposed. The cult members then dug a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds and buried Kilroy's corpse.|$|E
25|$|Another {{division}} is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, {{such as the}} Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a <b>hole</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes {{should not be confused}} with fipple flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.|$|E
50|$|Qualifying {{took place}} on 5-6 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Medal Course (the {{championship}} course) and 18 <b>holes</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Burnside Course. The number of qualifiers was increased to the top 140 and ties, having previously been the top 100 and ties. Two-time Masters champion Horton Smith led <b>the</b> qualifiers <b>on</b> 138; <b>the</b> qualifying score was 157 and 141 players advanced, and all the American Ryder Cup players qualified comfortably.|$|R
