5000|$|Portuguese {{settlers}} founded Malanje in the 19th century. The {{construction of}} the railway from Luanda to Malanje, in the fertile highlands, started in 1885. The environs of Malanje included the principal cotton-producing area of Portuguese West Africa and drove its development since the beginning. The town developed in the mid-19th century as an important feira (open-air market) on Portuguese Angola's principal plateau, between Luanda — the territory's capital and largest city, 350 km to the west [...] - [...] and the Cubango River valley, inhabited by Northern Mbundu peoples, 200 km to the east. Situated at an elevation of 1,134 m, the town had a high-altitude tropical climate, ideal to several agricultural productions. The city developed as an important agricultural, manufacturing, trading and services centre. Its productions included cotton, textiles, coffee, fruit and corn, and among its facilities it had cinema, hospital, railway station and airport. The Cangandala National Park, was established by the Portuguese authorities on 25 June 1970, having previously been classified as an <b>Integral</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Reserve</b> on 25 May 1963.|$|E

40|$|Montecristo Island is an <b>integral</b> <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park (Central Italy), {{characterized}} by a peculiar assemblage of flora and fauna, with several endemic taxa, and also with {{a high number of}} alien species. During a soil survey, we found an alien Oscheius tipulae Lam &Webster, 1971 isolate, phylogenetically close to others from South America. In this article, we examined the possible pathways of introduction of this nematode. Because of the high number of alien plants in this protected area and the low desiccation survival ability of O. tipulae, we hypothesized that the presence of this alien nematode isolate {{may be related to the}} soil of introduced plants, although historical association with plant-associated invertebrates is also possible. Further studies with more populations and marker molecules are necessary to investigate the distribution of O. tipulae and the possible impact on this natural reserve...|$|E
40|$|The wildcat {{is one of}} {{the most}} elusive {{mammalian}} carnivores in Italy. It is a species protected by the EC (Habitat Directive) and the efforts for its conservation are strictly related to a sound knowledge of its population parameters and genetic status. The different biological, genetic, taxonomic, phylogeographic and legal issues related to this species should all be considered in order to get to correct conclusions about its conservation status and the actions that should be applied. In this context I carried out my PhD thesis which has been developed through the collaboration between the Science Department of Roma Tre University, the Foreste Casentinesi National Park and the conservation genetics laboratory of ISPRA in Ozzano dell’ Emilia. This work took into account three main objectives : 1. Evaluate a standardized integrated protocol for non-invasive monitoring applying a methodology that integrating the different non-invasive techniques allowed us to improve the collection of diversified data (genetic, ecological, ethological, photographic, etc. [...] ) exploiting the least possible sampling effort. In this work we developed a protocol in which the sampling campaign was stratified simultaneously into three different layers: the camera-trapping layer, the scat-surveying and the hair-traps sprayed with valerian tincture (Valeriana officinalis). Using this method we were able to associate the genetic datum to the photographic one, identifying wildcats individuals, detecting hybridization traces, assessing the invasiveness of domestic cats and studying the reactions to the attractor. Alongside it was possible also to take advantage of the versatility of the camera-trapping in order to observe some aspects of the wildcat behaviour and the relationships with some potential competitors. This protocol has been chosen by the Biodiversity Department of the State Forestry Corps operating in the Foreste Casentinesi National Park as a tool for investigating the European wildcat in the <b>integral</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Reserve</b> of Sasso Fratino. 2. Study more efficient genetic markers for assessing admixture and introgression between wildcat and domestic cat. In the second section, taking advantage of a fruitful collaboration with a ISPRA researcher, we performed a wide genetic investigation of novel loci to establish a set of diagnostic tools suitable for accurately detect levels of introgressive hybridization between European wildcats and domestic cats. 150 samples (including putative European wildcats, captive and putative hybrids and domestic cats) from 15 different European countries and previously analysed at 31 microsatellites loci were analysed with an Illumina Infinium iSelect 63 K Cat DNA Array from which SNPs were selected the 151 most informative. Results from Bayesian model-based computations of simulated and empiric genotypes showed that the entire set of 151 markers provided successful estimates of admixture, correctly assigning all parental, F 1 -F 2 hybrids and first and second generation backcrosses. A direct comparison between most informative SNPs and STRs proved the outperforming power of SNPs on admixture detection and inferring admixed ancestries. To increase the temporal depth of such analysis and check for a possible hidden introgression were also analysed a total of 1269 bp of mtDNA (a coding portion of ND 5 containing 7 putative diagnostic mutation and the Region of Control) and two markers on the Y chromosome (SMCY STR- 7 and a SNP on the SRY gene). These markers allowed us to draw a phylogenetic history of the samples from which emerged two possible different transmission events that led to a mitochondrial haplotypes sharing between the wild and domestic population opening the way for further studies to better understand the phenomenon. Results were organized in a manuscript that is currently under preparation: 3. Clarify the phylogeographic history of the species in Europe. The second work mentioned above has shown how different haplotypes characterized by typical domestic polymorphisms appeared with good frequency in the wild population. So in this last one part we provided the preliminary results of a phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis sequencing 669 bp of the subunit 5 of NADH dehydrogenase of 717 samples of European wildcats, domestic cats and putative hybrids collected from 14 different locations in Europe previously analysed using 31 microsatellite loci. In this work, we have deepened the phylogeography of wildcat in Europe and shed light on the causes that led to the cytonuclear discordance on several individuals. Further analyses are underway for the definition of effective sample size and migration rates between the groups identified In conclusion, this work aimed to propose a multidisciplinary approach to deal with the problems of conservation of the wildcat defining the most efficient and standardized tools possible that could mediate a reasonable operational effort with a high quantity and quality of data...|$|E

40|$|The major {{premise of}} this article is: {{accessibility}} in <b>natural</b> <b>reserves</b> could become {{a risk factor for}} protected natural elements, if the ways of access inside of <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> are not correlated with the preserve purposes. Moreover, the transport network density and quality are elements, which lead to landscape fragmentation. These parameters catalyze the visitors flux inside the <b>natural</b> <b>reserve,</b> and thus, they could be identified like reserve vulnerability vectors. In order to prove this hypothesis we analyzed two study cases: the <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> “The Lăpuşna epicea woodnatural reserve” (The Eastern Carpathians) and “The <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> Les Hauts de Chartreuse” (French Alps). Regarding the transport network, the two <b>natural</b> <b>reserves</b> are totally opposed: the Romanian reserve is located in a isolated area, and the French reserve is very accessible.
