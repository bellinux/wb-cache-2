5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali <b>in</b> <b>Najaf,</b> which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

25|$|In early August, 2004, Sistani {{experienced}} {{serious health}} complications {{related to a}} previously diagnosed heart condition. He traveled to London to receive medical treatment. It was, reportedly, {{the first time that}} Sistani had left Iraq in decades, and may have been due, in part, to growing concerns for his safety from sectarian violence. Though still recovering, Sistani returned later in the month to broker a military truce at the Imam Ali Mosque <b>in</b> <b>Najaf</b> where Muqtada al-Sadr and the Mahdi Army had been cornered by American and Iraqi forces. Sadr, who rose rapidly to prominence through a series of independent military actions beginning in 2004, has since actively challenged Sistani's more progressive influence over Shia in the region.|$|E
25|$|Born to Seyyed Javad Khamenei, an Alim and Mujtahid born <b>in</b> <b>Najaf,</b> and Khadijeh Mirdamadi (daughter of Hashem Mirdamadi) in Mashhad, Khamenei is {{the second}} of eight children. Two of his {{brothers}} are also clerics and his younger brother, Hadi Khamenei, is a newspaper editor and cleric. His elder sister Fatemeh Hosseini Khamenei died in 2015, at age 89. His descendancy is of ethnic Azerbaijani background, with one source claiming {{that his mother was}} an ethnic Persian-speaker from Yazd. Some of his ancestors are from Tafresh in today's Markazi Province and migrated from their original home in Tafresh to Khamaneh near the Tabriz. Khamenei's great ancestor was Sayyid Hossein Tafreshi, a descendent of the Aftasi Sayyids, whose lineage supposedly reached to Sultan ul-Ulama Ahmad, known as Sultan Sayyid, a grandchild of Shia fourth Imam, Ali ibn Husayn.|$|E
25|$|In August 2004, al-Sadr {{attempted}} a second rebellion, and his al-Mahdi army again incited violence, {{especially in the}} Sadr city slum area of Baghdad, and <b>in</b> <b>Najaf.</b> U.S. forces responded by pushing into the areas of Najaf controlled by al-Mahdi, sending the militia reeling. Supported by helicopter gunships, the U.S. military managed to kill several hundred al-Mahdi fighters, and further close in on the Iman Ali mosque, where al-Sadr had made his base. Brutal fighting raged between U.S. troops and al-Madhi militiamen in a cemetery outside the mosque. To avoid damaging the sacred mosque in a direct raid, a political solution was sought, and a deal was struck between al-Sistani and al-Sadr ended his rebellion. In September 2004, a program encouraged al-Madhi members in Sadr city to exchange their guns into authorities for a financial compensation, and the slum was almost fully pacified.|$|E

25|$|Not much {{is known}} about Aqa Ali Shah's first two wives, both of whom died in Bombay. His first {{marriage}} with Maryam Sultana had two sons.

He died in December 1884 of a chest complaint while still in his early thirties, and was buried <b>in</b> <b>Najaf.</b> The second son, Nur al-Din Shah, who was the full-brother of Shihab al-Din Shah, died around 1884-5 in a riding accident at Pune while still in his youth.

25|$|The {{group has}} claimed {{responsibility}} for over 6,000 attacks in Iraq including the October 10, 2006 attack on Camp Falcon, {{the assassination of the}} American military commander <b>in</b> <b>Najaf,</b> the May 6, 2006 downing of a British Lynx helicopter and the October 3, 2007 attack on the Polish ambassador. Their most known attack however, is the January 20, 2007 Karbala provincial headquarters raid where they infiltrated the U.S. Army's offices at Karbala, killed one soldier, then abducted and killed four more American soldiers. After the raid, the U.S. military launched a crackdown on the group and the raid's mastermind Azhar al-Dulaimi was killed in Baghdad, while much of the group's leadership including the brothers Qais and Laith al-Khazali and Lebanese Hezbollah member Ali Musa Daqduq who was Khazali's advisor was in charge of their relations with Hezbollah. After these arrests in 2007, Akram al-Kabi, who had been the military commander of the Mahdi Army until May 2007, led the organisation. In May 2007, the group kidnapped British IT expert Peter Moore and his four bodyguards. They demanded the release of all their fighters being imprisoned by the Iraqi authorities and US military in return for his release. His four bodyguards were killed, but Moore himself was released when the group's leader Qais al-Khazali was released in January 2010. Prior to Qazali's release, security forces had already released over 100 of the group's members including Laith al-Khazali. In 2008 many of the groups fighters and leaders fled to Iran after the Iraqi Army was allowed to re-take control of Sadr City and the Mahdi Army was disbanded. Here most fighters were re-trained in new tactics. It resulted in a major lull in the group's activity from May to July 2008.|$|E
