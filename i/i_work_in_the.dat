40|$|It is {{well-known}} that gravitationally induced vacuum polarization often violates the point-wise energy conditions and sometimes violates the averaged energy conditions. In this paper I begin a systematic {{attack on the}} question of where and by how much the various energy conditions are violated. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test-field limit, and focus on conformally coupled massless scalar fields in Schwarzschild spacetime, using the Hartle [...] Hawking vacuum. I invoke a mixture of analytical and numerical techniques, and critically compare the qualitative behaviour to be expected from the Page approximation with that adduced from the numerical calculations of Anderson, Hiscock, and Samuel. I show that the various point-wise energy conditions are violated in a series of onion-like layers located between the unstable photon orbit and the event horizon, the sequence of violations being DEC, WEC, and (NEC+SEC). Furthermore the ANEC is violated for *some* of the null geodesics trapped in this region. Having established the basic machinery in this paper, the Boulware vacuum will be treated in a companion paper, while other exensions should be straightforward.

40|$|I {{show that}} in the Boulware vacuum (1) all {{standard}} (point-wise and averaged) energy conditions are violated throughout the exterior region [...] -all the way from spatial infinity down to the event horizon, and (2) outside the event horizon the standard point-wise energy conditions are violated in a maximal manner: they are violated at all points and for all null/timelike vectors. (The region inside the event horizon is considerably messier, and of dubious physical relevance. Nevertheless the standard point-wise energy conditions also seem to be violated even inside the event horizon.) This is rather different from {{the case of the}} Hartle [...] Hawking vacuum, wherein violations of the energy conditions were confined to the region inside the unstable photon orbit. These calculations are for the quantum stress-energy tensor corresponding to a conformally-coupled massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum. <b>I</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test-field limit, restrict attention to the Schwarzschild geometry, and invoke a mixture of analytical and numerical techniques. This *suggests* that general self-consistent solutions of semiclassical quantum gravity might *not* satisfy the energy conditions, and may in fact for certain quantum fields and certain quantum states violate *all* the energy conditions.
