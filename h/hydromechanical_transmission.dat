The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} control aspects of complex <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The overall {{purpose is to}} {{increase}} the knowledge of important aspects to consider during the development of <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions</b> to ensure transmission functionality. These include ways of evaluating control strategies in early design stages as well as dynamic properties and control aspects of displacement controllers, which are key components in these systems. Fuel prices and environmental concerns are factors that drive research on propulsion in heavy construction machinery. <b>Hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions</b> are strong competitors to conventional torque-converter transmissions used in this application today. They offer high efficiency and wide speed/torque conversion ranges, and may easily be converted to hybrids that allow further fuel savings through energy recuperation. One challenge with <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions</b> is that they offer many different configurations, which in turn makes it important to enable evaluation of control aspects in early design stages. In this thesis, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, which blend hardware tests and standard software-based simulations, are considered to be a suitable method. A multiple-mode transmission applied to a mid-sized construction machine is modelled and evaluated in offline simulations as well as in hardware-in-the-loopsimulations. <b>Hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions</b> rely on efficient variable pumps/motors with fast, accurate displacement controllers. This thesis studies the dynamic behaviour of the displacement controller in swash-plate axial-piston pumps/motors. A novel control approach in which the displacement is measured with an external sensor is proposed. Performance and limitations of the approach are tested in simulations and in experiments. The experiments showed a significantly improved performance with a controller that is slightly more advanced than a standard proportional controller. The implementation of the controller allows simple tuning and good predictability of the displacement response...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes an {{automated}} methodology {{for the design}} of complex multiple-mode <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions.</b> High fuel prices and strict emission regulations are today drivers of the development of new fuel-efficient drive transmissions for construction machinery. <b>Hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions</b> have high energy efficiency and a wide torque/speed conversion range. They are today strong candidates to replace the fuel-thirsty torque converters conventionally used in heavy construction machines. The trend towards more complex transmission architectures increases the need for more sophisticated product development methods. Complex multiple-mode transmissions are difficult to design and prototype and can be realised in a great number of different architectures. This increases the need for reliable concept evaluation in early design stages. The design of the transmission is also strongly coupled to its energy consumption and for a fair comparison  between transmission concepts optimal designs are necessary. Design automation and optimisation with detailed simulation models can support the industrial engineer in the design task and increase the available knowledge early in the design process. The proposed methodology uses simulation-based optimisation to design the transmission for a specific vehicle application. Various aspects of the transmission’s characteristics may be targeted, although energy efficiency is in great focus in this work. To evaluate the energy efficiency, the transmission designs are simulated using backward-facing simulations with detailed power loss models. The methodology is applicable for designing the drive transmissions of construction machines and other mobile working vehicles such as agricultural machines, forest machines and mobile mining equipment...|$|R

5000|$|Introduced in 1988, the A2 {{received}} an improved [...] engine with an HMPT-500-3 <b>Hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> and improved armor (both passive {{and the ability}} to mount explosive reactive armor). The new armor protects the Bradley against 30 mm APDS rounds and RPGs (or similar anti-armor weapons). The new armor also eliminated the trim vane that made the Bradley amphibious and covered up the side firing ports. Spaced laminate armor was installed to the hull rear and spaced laminate track skirts protected the lower hull. A semicircular shield was attached to the turret rear to add more stowage space as well as act as spaced armor. Kevlar spall liners were added to critical areas. The troop carrying number was reduced to six, eliminating the periscope position behind the driver. After live firing testing, the seating and stowage arrangements were redrawn. These upgrades raised the cumulative gross weight of the vehicle to 30,519 kg (67,282 lb). The M2A2 was qualified to be transported by the C-17 Globemaster III. M2A2s were all eventually modified to M2A2 ODS or M2A3 standard.|$|E
40|$|A <b>hydromechanical</b> {{variable}} <b>transmission</b> (HMT) has {{advantages of}} continuous variation and high efficiency. So {{it is one}} of the ideal transmissions of heavy vehicles. The continuous speed varying process involves speed governing in range and range shift. Integrated control strategy of the HMT is proposed in this paper. The algorithm of the asymmetric saturated incremental proportional integral derivative (PID) speed control strategy in range and range shift conditions are derived. And this paper presents the range shift logic and range shift control strategies. A controller model is built in Matlab Simulink and cosimulated with the model of vehicle equipped with a two-range HMT. The HMT prototype hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS) platform of the integrated control strategy is built. The HILS results show that the range shift process is smooth and speed fluctuation does not happen. In the throttle stable stage, the engine speed is adjusted to the near optimal speed, and its change rules are in accordance with simulation results. The integrated control strategy is reasonable...|$|R
40|$|In {{domestic}} {{automotive industry}} {{the need for}} transition from transmission with manual control to automatic gearboxes (GB) emerged long ago. Regarding the leading foreign manufacturers (Allison, ZF, Eaton, etc.), an experience in design of automatic transmissions {{and the level of}} technological development is incomparably small. Thus, to have an informed choice of the gearbox structure types and control system is a relevant problem. Application efficiency of this or other gearbox depends both on its adaptability to the actual operating conditions and on the quality of transition refinement. This paper analyzes the special features of the gear change process in the most common types of automatic gearboxes. Constructive feasibilities of an "ideal" gear change (without power loss) and strategies for gear shifting are compared. The paper offers an overview of common problems when achieving these goals and the ways to solve them. An automatic transmission of the particular type used in the wheeled vehicles under off-road conditions determines the probability of maintaining their mobility. This is due to the phenomenon of wheel`s breakdown to slipping caused by sharp increase of torque on the wheel. Planetary <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmissions</b> (AT) provide continuous input torque to the wheels, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture and use. Besides, to provide a high number of density ratios in them is more complicated than in the automated and manual transmissions (AMT). This is important when moving long in the lower gears under difficult conditions. Compared with AT dual clutch transmissions due to design features require even more precise and fast control system of actuators and engine. Automation of constant-mesh or synchromesh transmissions provides a significant reduction in the duration of interruption in torque delivery. If {{it is not enough to}} increase mobility in the harsh conditions, a rational choice is to use a transmission type of TCCT (torque converter – clutch – (constant-mesh or synchromesh) transmission). Adding the torque converter to AMT increases the durability of clutch and synchronizers. It reduces the amount of gear changes and duration of interruption in torque delivery. Thus, the cost and repair complexity of such a transmission is much lower than those of AT. For almost 15 years there were no domestic scientific publications about economically perspective TCCT transmission. The fully automatic TCCT has been never investigated in domestic science...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the control {{strategy}} of shifting time involving multigroup clutches for a <b>hydromechanical</b> continuously variable <b>transmission</b> (HMCVT). The dynamic analyses of mathematical models are presented in this paper, and the simulation models are used to study the control strategy of HMCVT. Simulations are performed in Simulation X platform to investigate the shifting time of clutches under different operating conditions. On this basis, simulation analysis and test verification of two typical conditions, which play the decisive roles for the shifting quality, are carried out. The results show that {{there are differences in}} the shifting time of the two typical conditions. In the shifting process from the negative <b>transmission</b> of <b>hydromechanical</b> ranges to the positive <b>transmission</b> of <b>hydromechanical</b> ranges, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the clutches of shifting mechanism firstly and then disengaging a group of clutches of planetary gear mechanism and engaging another group of the clutches of planetary gear mechanism lastly. In the shifting process from the hydraulic range to the hydromechanical range, the control strategy based on the shifting time is switching the clutches of hydraulic shifting mechanism and planetary gear mechanism at first and then engaging the clutch of shifting mechanism...|$|R

40|$|In the {{agricultural}} and work machine sectors, <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> competes with traditional mechanical transmission. However, the double energy conversion {{taking place in}} hydrostatic transmission lowers {{the efficiency of the}} entire transmission. Thus, the dimensioning of <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> must not only meet the functional requirements of speed and power to be transmitted, but must also identify the particular combination of layout and the components that leads to the maximum efficiency. In this study, a general answer to this problem will be given. The design is transformed into a mathematical programming problem, whose goal is the optimization of both the configuration and internal components of the transmission. The structure of the transmissions is described by means of graph theory, and the resolution of the optimization problem is obtained by means of a "direct search" algorithm based on the swarm method...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of fuel consumption of urban vehicles {{is one of}} the challenges of the society today. Many promising technologies such as hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cells are the focus of a lot of research and investments, but high costs prevent their development on a large scale, especially in heavy duty vehicles. Simpler solutions, such as continuously variable transmissions, are then interesting alternatives: they preserve some of the advantages of hybrid solutions significantly reducing the overall cost of the system. Since these technologies allow the decoupling of the engine's velocity from that of the wheels, optimised management of the engine becomes feasible, leading to lower fuel consumption than that of traditional solutions. This work compares the <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> with a traditional power shift in an application where efficiency and comfort are required: a city bus. The performance of a vehicle with a dual stage <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> has been investigated by means of a model implemented in the AMESim environment. A second model of a vehicle with a power shift transmission has been taken as reference solution.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{conceptual}} design process of complex hydromechanical transmissions for mobile working machines. Efficient methods for design optimisation and controller development are presented {{to support the}} final concept selection. In the endeavour to develop new fuel-efficient driveline solutions for construction machines and off-road equipment new complex <b>hydromechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> concepts are being investigated. This pursuit is driven by stricter emission legislation, high fuel prices and a desire for a greener image both for customers and manufacturers. The trend towards more complex transmission architectures increases {{the need for more}} sophisticated product development methods. Complex multiple-mode transmissions are difficult to design and prototype and can be realised in a great number of architectures. By introducing a secondary energy storage in the machine the design space expands further for both hardware and software. There is accordingly a need for more reliable concept assessment in early design stages and the possibility to support concurrent engineering throughout the development process. Previous research on the design and development of hydromechanical transmissions has been limited to analysis of fixed concept designs or design optimization using very simple performance indicators. Existing methodologies for electrified on-road vehicles are not suitable for off-road working machines with hydromechanical transmissions and hydraulic energy storage. The proposed conceptual design process uses detailed quasi-static simulation models and targets to optimise the fuel efficiency of the specific machine specifications and operations. It is also shown how high-speed dynamic simulations can be used for controller development and hardware-in-the-loop simulations to support an efficient product design process. The methods are demonstrated for typical use cases targeting new transmission development for construction machines. Software control development is also treated using control optimisation and real-time simulation. Finally a novel hybrid hydromechanical motion system is presented for which an efficient design process is crucial to its end performance.
