50|$|Sandwich steaming, {{which was}} {{developed}} in a project among DEIAFA, University of Turin (Italy, www.deiafa.unito.it) and Ferrari Costruzioni Meccaniche (see image), represents a combination of depth and surface steaming, offers an efficient method to induce hot steam into the soil. The steam is simultaneously pushed into the soil from the surface and from the depth. For this purpose, the area, which must be equipped with a <b>deep</b> <b>steaming</b> injection system, {{is covered with a}} steaming hood. The steam enters the soil from the top and the bottom at the same time. Sheets are not suitable, since a high pressure up to 30 mm water column arises underneath the cover.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{steaming}} is {{a promising}} preventive method for weed control in high-value cash crops, such as vegetables and flowers. A 2 -year experiment (20052006) {{was carried out}} to test the effect of five different systems of steam injection (surface or deep steam injection bar and three mixed systems at different steam distribution ratios between the surface and the deep bar: 1 : 2; 1 : 1 and 2 : 1) on an artificial infestation of Brassica juncea and on the natural weed seedbank. Treatments were carried out using steam alone or in association with two different exothermic compounds (KOH and CaO), distributed at two different rates (1000 and 4000 kg ha- 1). The effects of treatments on the seedbank were analysed by the seedling emergence technique at three different soil depths (07, 714 and 1421 cm). Non-linear dose-response curves were used to correlate weed emergence with soil temperature sum. Surface steaming was the most effective treatment (up to 100 % weed control) at 07 cm depth. <b>Deep</b> <b>steaming</b> depleted the weed seedbank up to 95 % in the deepest soil layer. The most homogeneous weed control effect across the soil profile was obtained with mixed systems, with differences depending on their distribution ratio. The new steam injection systems increased the versatility of this innovative soil steaming machine and confirmed its efficiency in reducing the weed seedbank, making it a promising replacement of methyl bromide fumigation before growing high-value crops...|$|E

50|$|The {{alternative}} to surface generated steam is downhole steam generation that reduces heat loss and maintains high quality steam in the reservoir {{that allows for}} more heavy oil and oil sands production at a faster rate. Downhole steam generators were first proposed by the major oil companies in the early 1960s. Over the last 50 years multiple downhole steam technologies have been developed such as the DOE and SANDIA downhole combustion system known as Project <b>Deep</b> <b>Steam</b> that was field tested in Long Beach, CA in 1982, but was a failure.

40|$|Soil {{steaming}} {{has become}} an important practice in commercial greenhouse production {{as an alternative to}} chemicals to control soil-borne pathogens. In addition to their effect on pests, due to soil temperature increase, steaming methods may also have an impact on soil chemical properties, on plant nutrient regime and, consequently, on crop yield. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of two <b>steam</b> disinfection methods (<b>deep</b> or shallow <b>steam</b> injection) with or without the addition of an exothermic reacting compound (1000 kg CaO ha- 1) on two consecutive greenhouse radish crops. The steam disinfection methods {{had a significant impact on}} soil thermal dynamics, on soil chemical properties and on radish crop production (with similar but more marked effects in the first than in the second crop cycle). The best results, in terms of both yield and quality, were obtained with shallow <b>steam</b> injection, while <b>deep</b> <b>steam</b> injection without CaO addition, resulted in a similar or lower yield than that obtained in the control soil. The main changes observed in soil chemical parameters were a temporary increase of pH following the incorporation of CaO and an increase of exchangeable K in the case of shallow steam injection...|$|R

40|$|Steam {{disinfestation}} {{represents an}} increasingly attractive strategy to control soil-borne pathogens and weeds both in greenhouses and field crops. Beyond pest control, steam injection {{has the potential}} to alter soil nutrient dynamics and composition of bacterial communities. This study investigated the impact of a soil-steaming method (the Bioflash system) on main chemical (total organic C, TOC; total N, TN; cation exchange capacity, CEC; exchangeable Na, K, Mg and Ca; KCl-extractable ammonium and nitrate, DTPA-exchangeable Mn) and microbial (microbial biomass C, MBC; genetic structure of bacterial communities) properties in a greenhouse loamy soil. Treatments were carried out by using a selfpropelled soil-steaming machine operating at two <b>steaming</b> modes (<b>deep</b> or shallow) in combination or not with addition of an exothermically reacting compound (CaO at a 1000 kg ha 1 rate). Soils from a fivetreatment (NS, non-steamed soil, DS, <b>deep</b> <b>steam</b> injection; DS þ E, <b>deep</b> <b>steam</b> injection plus CaO; SS, shallow steam injection; SS þ E, shallow steam injection plus CaO) plot block were sampled before steaming and after 8, 19, 54 and 91 days. Compositional shifts in the structure of soil bacterial communities were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting of soilextracted 16 S rRNA gene fragments, using primers specific for Bacteria and Actinobacteria. Maximum soil temperature reached 70 C (DS) and 82 C (DS þ E) in the 10 e 20 cm layer; and 50 C (SS) and 53 C (SS þ E) in the 0 e 10 cm layer. TOC, TN, CEC, exchangeable Na, Mg and Ca were not statistically affected by soil steaming, CaO addition, depth of injection or their interactions. Conversely, SS promoted a large release of exchangeable K, notwithstanding CaO addition. Steam disinfestation significantly stimulated ammonium release, which further increased in CaO-treated steamed soils. Generally ammonium and nitrate pools varied oppositely, being the latter markedly reduced {{at the end of the}} observation period. Available Mn was significantly increased by soil steaming, but it was depressed when steaming was combined with CaO addition. Soil steaming markedly reduced the MBC, especially in DS-treated and SS-treated plots. The genetic structure of soil bacterial and actinobacterial communities was largely unresponsive to the steaming treatments. Even though the Bioflash system did not cause bacterial eradication or compositional shifts in bacterial community structure, soil steaming stimulated an increased release of soluble nutrients (Kþ, Mn 2 þ, NH 4 þ eN). Over a longer perspective, excessive soil resources exploitation and potential risks of Mn toxicity should be cautiously considered especially in repeatedly (and eventually acid) steamed soils...|$|R

New, high signal-to-noise ratio flux-calibrated spectra, spanning the wavelength interval 1. 10 − 2. 35 µm with an average resolving power R = 1800 were obtained using NIRSPEC on the Keck II telescope. Results are reported and compared for three late L dwarfs (L 5, L 7, and L 8) and two T dwarfs (T 1 and T 6).

50|$|Immediately after {{consents}} were granted, {{it became}} clear that the <b>deep</b> liquid <b>steam</b> wells did not provide sufficient fluid.

Meanwhile, the Electricity Corporation had been dissolved and the Wairakei power plant was now owned by Contact Energy Limited, who had applied for consent to reinject used fluid as part of their new low-temperature plant to be added to the main Wairaki stations, thus reducing their dumping into the Waikato river. MGL objected because this reinjection of low-temperature fluid (much cooler than that already being re-injected) would be detrimental to their Poihipi plant. But in December 1998 Judge Whiting held that Contact's existing (inherited) consents allowed for reinjection at any temperature and consequently, receivers were appointed for MGL and PLL, who decided to sell the Poihipi power plant and the leased land to Contact.|$|R

40|$|Background: Literature has {{recognized}} {{the critical role}} of knowledge and thus, intellectual capital (IC) to enhance strategy (Eisenhardt and Santos, 2002; Marr and Ross, 2005; Sveiby, 2001) and to prepare a dynamic competitive environment (Grant, 1996). The accounting studies on intellectual capital (IC) have been providing evidences {{of the role of}} IC based accounting techniques to improve management and reporting (Guthrie et al., 2012; Mouritsen et al., 2001). Nevertheless, scholars call to analyze how IC contributes to increase the organization’ s value, considering the relations between IC factors and business strategy (Roos, 2005). The agricultural sector results to be an increasing challenging environment (Boehlje et al., 2011), characterized by <b>deep</b> innovation processes <b>steaming</b> from the critical role of know-how and knowledge (Soulignac et al., 2012). Thus, knowledge management tools have been experimented (such as the Knowledge for Organic Farming and its Innovation System - KOFIS); however, when considering intellectual capital literature, intellectual capital accounting in agricultural sector results to be an under-researched field (Kozera, 2011), and more in general, only few studies at present analyze IC’s effect on performance of firms in farm business (see for e. g. Scafarto et al., 2016; Lee and Shaiban, 2014). Purpose: The paper aims at shading light on the role and relationship between human, structural and relational capital for strategic management in the chosen farm business. In particular, it aims at analyzing the interaction between human capital (the farm operators) and the introduction of innovative and sustainability-oriented agricultural technologies that follows management’ strategic orientation for firm’s competitiveness. Methodology: An explorative case study analysis (Yin, 2013) was conducted in the largest Italian agricultural firm to get an understanding of the intellectual capital’s variables and of their implication for strategic management. Data were gathered through interviews with top and middle management of the firm that help drawing the strategical map of the organization. Moreover, full time employees’ perception of the skills and knowledge required to achieve the fixed goals and their perception to possess these abilities were investigated through a closed answer questionnaire; therefore, their perceptions on the relevance of training to develop these critical skills were investigated. The skills were subsequently classified using the framework of Amabile in domain-relevant and creativity-relevant skills (1988); correlation’ analysis through Spearman’s rho (Sheskin, 2011) between the two sets of skills was calculated to create additive indexes, and linear regression models were set to investigate the effects of training on the acquisition of domain-relevant and creativity-relevant skills. Findings: The analysis confirmed the role of continuous training to build employees’ creativity’ skills to the innovation based strategy of the farm. Strengthen human capital through training to acquire new technical knowledge and make this knowledge exchangeable and transferable among employees, significantly impacts on the acquisition of innovative capacity, especially problem-solving which is applied exploiting new knowledge domains (Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005). The interviewed employees perceived a substantial alignment between their abilities and the capabilities considered relevant to support the introduction of innovative technology as a strategical priority of the company.
