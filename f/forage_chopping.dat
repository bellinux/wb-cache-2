40|$|Biomass {{logistics}} {{operations account}} for {{a major portion of}} the feedstock cost of running a biorefinery, and make up a significant portion of total system operational costs. Biomass is a bulky perishable commodity that is required in large quantities year round for optimal biorefinery operations. As a proof of concept for a decision making tool for biomass production and delivery, a heuristic was developed to determine biorefinery location, considering city size, agricultural density, and regional demographics. Switchgrass and sorghum (with winter canola) were selected to examine as viable biomass feedstocks based on positive economic results determined using a predictive model for cropland conversion potential. Biomass harvest systems were evaluated to examine interrelationships of biomass logistical networks and the least cost production system, with results demonstrating a need to shift to maximize supply-driven production harvest operations and limit storage requirements. For this supply-driven production harvest operations approach a harvest window from September until March was selected for producing big square bales of switchgrass for storage until use, <b>forage</b> <b>chopped</b> sorghum from September to December, and <b>forage</b> <b>chopped</b> switchgrass from December to March. A case study of the three major regions of North Carolina (Mountains, Piedmont, and Coastal Plain) was used to assess logistical optimization of the proposed supply-driven production harvest system. Potential biomass production fields were determined within a hundred mile radius of the proposed biorefinery location, with individual fields designated for crop and harvest system by lowest transportation cost. From these selected fields, crops and harvest system regional storage locations were determined using an alternate location-allocation heuristic with set storage capacity per site. Model results showed that the supply-driven production harvest system greatly reduced system complexity, maximized annual usage of high cost specialized equipment, and reduced logistical operations cost. The siting method and developed model shows promise and can be used for computational analysis of potential biorefinery site biomass production systems before costly on the ground logistical analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Corn stover (like {{various other}} kinds of stover) {{can be used as}} feed, whether grazed as <b>forage,</b> <b>chopped</b> as silage to be used later for fodder, or {{collected}} for direct (nonensilaged) fodder use. Maize forage is usually ensiled in cooler regions, but it can be harvested year-round in the tropics and fed as green forage to the animals. In the silage use case, it is usual for the entire plant (grain and stover together) to be chopped into pieces which are then crushed between rollers while harvesting. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. In dairy farming, corn silage is primarily used as fodder for dairy cows during the winter season. Corn stover can be beneficial to beef cattle producers because the “corn stover can provide a low cost feed source for mid-gestation beef cows.” In addition to the stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs remaining in the field, kernels of grain may also be left over from harvest. These left over kernels, along with the corn stover, serve as an additional feed source for grazing cattle. Over time, the stalks will decrease in value as feed, so farmers aim to graze the corn stover as soon as possible after harvest. The amount of grazing possible on a field of corn stover is “between one and two months of grazing per cow per acre (50 cows on 50 acre for one to two months).” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{high rates}} of rumen fermentation, {{physical}} breakdown and passage rates from the rumen of legume silages lead to higher intakes than for grass silages of comparable digestibility. Although total tract digestibilities for legume silages and maize silages are often lower than for grass silages, milk yields are usually higher. A further benefit of legumes and maize is the reduced rate of decline in digestibility. Legume silages often lead {{to a reduction in}} milk fat concentration and increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3. This latter effect is related to reduced rumen biohydrogenation as a consequence of increased rumen passage rates or the effects of polyphenol oxidase. There is quite a wide range of maturities (300 – 350 g kg- 1 DM) that leads to maximum dry matter intakes and milk production from maize silage; milk production is reduced with immature or over–mature maize crops. <b>Forage</b> <b>chop</b> length exerts a number of effects, both in the silo and in the rumen, but effects on rumen function, feed intake and milk production have been inconsistent. The high protein content and high N degradability of most legume silages is associated with a low efficiency of converting dietary N into milk N, with a concomitant increase in urine N. Reducing N intake by inclusion of maize silage in mixtures with legume silages leads to a marked reduction in urine N without loss of production potential. It is predicted, {{on the basis of their}} chemical composition and rumen kinetics, that legume silages and maize silages would reduce methane production relative to grass silage, though in vivo measurements are lacking. Extensive fermentation in the silo reduces the amount of fermentable substrate, and reduced methane production in comparison with grass silage where fermentation had been restricted by high levels of acid additive...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} harvesting systems and presents conclusions on selection of machines for harvesting silage for dairy cows. Achieving {{a high quality}} cut of forage requires a high machine capacity and harvesting {{must be carried out}} at the optimal time with respect to plant growth stage. Therefore calculation of timeliness costs, which are determined by the time and capacity of harvesting, formed {{an important part of the}} study. These calculations require timeliness factors that describe the losses for each day by which harvest is delayed after the date of maximum economic crop value. The timeliness factors were calculated for each cut from data on changes in yield and quality of cuts during the harvest period. Harvesting cost calculations were based on a precision <b>chop</b> <b>forage</b> trailer, a precision <b>chop</b> <b>forage</b> harvester with separate transport trailers and a round baler with integral wrapping. Cost calculations were carried out for three different sizes of machine chain (small (S), medium (M) and large (L)) for each harvest system. The operations included were mowingconditioning, harvesting in the field, transport to storage and loading and packing into a bunker silo. Harvesting costs included the cost of machines, labour and timeliness. In addition, ensiling costs such as bale plastic and the investment, interest and maintenance cost for the bunker silo or the storage area for round bales were included when comparing the harvesting systems. Calculations were made for a three-cut system in conventional (CONV) and organic (ORG) forage production in southern Sweden (Gss) and central Sweden (Ss). When timeliness costs were not considered there was a risk of too low a harvest capacity being chosen. The effect of including timeliness costs when calculating harvesting costs increased with the forage area harvested, since a larger forage area increased the duration of harvest. Table S 1 shows harvesting and ensiling costs with 1 km transport distance for 70 hectares of forage in conventional production and 90 hectares in organic production in central Sweden. At short transport distances (1 km), the precision <b>chop</b> <b>forage</b> trailer and the precision <b>chop</b> <b>forage</b> harvester with separate transport trailers had similar harvesting and ensiling costs, while those for round baling were somewhat higher. The precision <b>chop</b> <b>forage</b> harvester with 2 or 3 transport trailers resulted in the lowest costs at 2 - 7 km transport distance. At longer transport distances (> 7 km), the round baler was the cheapest of the harvesting systems studied here. As regards machine capacity, it is clear from Figure S 1 that to minimise harvesting costs the smallest machine chain should be used for forage areas less than 60 ha, whereas when the forage area exceeds 90 ha the largest machine chain should be chosen. In the 60 - 90 ha forage area range, there was little difference in costs between the S, M and L machine chains. For harvest with round bales only the size of the mower-conditioner varied between the machine chains and the largest machine chain had the lowest harvest costs for all forage areas. Machine cooperatives are a good way to lower harvesting costs since for smaller forage areas in particular, increased annual use of the machines decreases the machine costs and allows larger machines to be used to greater capacity. To avoid high timeliness costs it is important that cuts are performed at the optimal time...|$|R

Using the same protocol we then investigated preferences for single and multiple forage sources and interactions with the effect of location. Ten stabled horses, four females and six geldings, aged from 18 months to 21 years, maintained at Writtle College Stud took part in these trials. In Trial 1 four 60 litre containers holding 2. 7 kg of chopped English ryegrass were located in {{the centre of the}} front, back, left and right walls of the horses' 3. 5 m 2 Monarch-style loose-boxes. In Trial 2 three containers each containing 2. 7 kg of <b>forage</b> (<b>chopped</b> Italian ryegrass, chopped timothy, chopped alfalfa) and one container containing 2. 7 kg of an equal parts mixture of these three forages (i. e. 0. 9 kg of each forage) were presented in the same locations according to a Latin Square design to control for location order effects. In both trials the horses' behaviour was recorded for 30 minutes using wall mounted video cameras. Data was harvested from tapes according to an 11 behaviour mutually exclusive ethogram using the Observer v. 5 package and analysed using SPSS v. 12. Data were analysed using Freidman's analysis. In Trial 1 a significant difference in position was found with total foraging duration greatest in the front position (P< 0. 005, df 3, 2 = 14. 0). In Trial 2 a significant difference in duration of foraging was found with highest duration recorded for single ryegrass (P< 0. 001, df 3, 2 = 21. 4).

Propionic acid-based additives can be added to ensiled forages to inhibit yeast and mold growth, and improve the aerobic stability of silages. The objectives of this study were {{to determine the effects of}} a propionic acid-based silage additive (Solution Foin) on ensiling characteristics, aerobic stability and feeding value of short-term ensiled corn <b>forage.</b> <b>Chopped</b> whole corn was left untreated or treated with Solution Foin (contains 700 g kg- 1 propionic acid and 300 g kg- 1 NH 4 OH). The additive was added to forage prior ensiling at a rate of 5 L ton- 1 (wet basis). Treated and untreated forages were placed in six plastic silo bags (three each). Silo bags were opened one day after ensiling and daily samples were collected for 30 consecutive days. Effects on animal performance of feeding treated or untreated forage were determined in a completely randomized design, using 30 lactating cows (178 +/- 55 days in milk) fed total mixed ration (50 : 50 forage: concentrate) with the major forage portion consisting of untreated or treated forage. The feeding study started one day post-ensiling. Results showed that Solution Foin reduced (P < 0. 05) yeast and mold populations between d 5 and 14 post-ensiling. The highest differences (P < 0. 002) were observed on d 10, at which point yeast and mold populations for untreated silage were 7. 86 and 2. 51 log cfu g- 1, respectively. The corresponding values for treated silage were 4. 35 and 0. 00 log cfu g- 1, respectively. Aerobic stability of treated ensiled forage was also improved (P < 0. 01) from day 0 (by 159 h) to day 10 (by 33 h) post-ensiling. Solution Foin also increased (P < 0. 05) the overall lactic acid and WSC content, and lowered the temperature of the treated ensiled forage in the field. No treatment differences were detected in the forage pH and acetic acid concentration. Dairy cows fed treated forage had similar feed intake (average 23 kg d- 1) and milk yield (average 29 kg d- 1) to cows fed the untreated forage.

Botanical composition was determined {{on a monthly basis}} from April through August, in the field and on three component mixtures in the laboratory. The dry-weight-rank method was modified for use on five different species compositions artifically composited for each pasture mixture. The microscopic point technique was applied to the same samples with first the forage in whole form, then chopped for a second determination. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, linear regression, and correlation, Results show estimations of the microscopic point method on the whole forage were different from those on <b>chopped</b> <b>forage.</b> The ratios of weight to point change because of a change in thickness, amount, and cover of plant parts in the sampling, tray through the season. The greatest differences in all estimations of the components corresponded to the greatest change in the dry matter percentages. Weight per point by the microscopic point method before correction were more accurate in the overall application than were the laboratory dry-weight-rank estimations after correction. The laboratory dry-weight-rank technique is not sensitive to true differences and the overall accuracy is poor without proportional ranking. Without proportional ranking the dry-weight-rank method is only accurate when ratios of the species within the mixture approximate the ratios of the multipliers. Dry weight percentages can be predicted accurately by the microscopic point method within the range of composition levels studied.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the chemical composition, silage quality and ensilability of ten cocksfoot cultivars using biological and chemical silage additives. The plant material was harvested from {{the first and second}} cut, cultivated at the Research Station of Fodder Crops in Vatín, Czech Republic. Wilted <b>forage</b> was <b>chopped</b> and ensiled in mini-silos with 3 replicates per treatment. The treatments were: 1) without additives, used as a control; 2) with bacterial inoculants; and 3) with chemical preservatives. The results indicated that the year factor (2012 - 2013) influenced significantly the chemical composition of the silage in both cuts. The use of biological inoculants reduced the content of crude fibre and acid detergent fibre; but it did not influence the content of neutral detergent fibre, in comparison with the control silage in both cuts. Furthermore, the application of biological inoculants reduced the concentration of lactic acid (LA) and acetic acid (AA) in contrast to the control silage in the first cut. Moreover, in the second cut the same values tended to be the opposite. Interestingly, ‘Amera’ was the unique variety that presented a high concentration of butyric acid (0. 2 %) in comparison with other varieties in the first cut. In conclusion, the biological inoculants had a favourable effect on silage fermentation. Notably, only ‘Greenly’ and ‘Starly’ varieties from the first cut; and ‘Greenly’, ‘Sw-Luxor’, and ‘Otello’ varieties from the second cut were appropriate for ensiling because their pH-values; LA and AA concentrations were ideal according to the parameters of the fermentation process...|$|R

Typical meadow forage was ensiled in minisilos and stored under shelter (Shelter) or in the field (Field) in a complete block design with repeated measures in time (t). <b>Forage</b> was <b>chopped</b> and inoculated with lactic acid bacteria plus enzymes, and harvested with 420 g dry matter (DM) kg– 1 fresh matter, 111 g crude protein kg– 1 DM, 665 g ash-free neutral detergent fibre kg– 1 DM, and 64 g water soluble carbohydrates kg– 1 DM. Shelter minisilos had higher metabolizable energy concentration at 236 d (PTrat×t = 0. 03; Shelter = 10. 2; Field = 9. 6 MJ kg– 1 DM, P = 0. 01), and lower DM losses (Shelter = – 0. 2; Campo = 22 %, P = 0. 02) and values of pH and N-NH 3 /total N (Field: 5. 6 and 12 % and Shelter: 4. 4 and 6. 8 %, P ≤ 0. 01).

For this, Second growth Alfalfa harvested at the early bud stage of development after a sunny day at sundown (about 1900 h; PM alfalfa), whereas the second half was cut next day at sunup (about 0800 h; AM alfalfa). After cutting, alfalfa <b>Forage</b> was <b>chopped</b> by using a chopper to a length of 8 to 10 cm, and then ensiled without or with microbial additive as factorial experiment (2 × 2) with repeated measurement design. Silages were provided in laboratory silos (6 repeats in every treatment) lined with two layers of plastic, after air exclusion. Silos were opened at 3, 10 and 30 day for determination of pH and other chemical analysis. The numerically lower pH of PM vs. AM silages indicates that the former forage was more extensively fermented possibly because of its increased total non structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentration. Shifting alfalfa harvesting from sun up to sundown significantly decreased NDF% and ADF%, because of the dilution effect associated with increased concentrations of TNC in the former forage. The NPN content and N-NH 3 concentration of the silages treated in the afternoon was lower compared with AM group. CP content decreased, but NDF, ADF, NPN and N-NH 3 concentration increased during ensiling time. Silage pH decreased by using of microbial additive and ensiling time. Dry matter and nitrogen losses were lower in silages treated by microbial inoculants, and, increased with increasing fermentation time. It can be concluded that microbial additives and time of cutting {{can be used as}} proper way to improve fermentation situation and silage quality...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Ensiling is a {{conservation}} method for forage crops. It {{is based on}} the fact that anaerobe lactic acid bacteria (LAB) convert water-soluble carbohydrates into organic acids. Therefore, pH decreases and the forage is preserved. The aim of this study was to isolate special kinds of lactic acid bacteria from silage and to study the effect of bacteria, inulin and enzymes as silage additives on the fermentation and aerobic stability of the silage. Materials and Methods: The heterofermentative LAB were isolated from corn silages in Broujerd, Iran and biochemically characterized. Acid tolerance was studied by exposure to acidic PBS and growth in bile salt was measured by the spectrophotometric method. Results: The results of molecular analysis using 16 SrDNA sequences showed that the isolates belonged to Lactobacillus and Enterococcus genera. To enhance stability in acidic environment and against bile salts, microencapsulation with Alginate and Chitosan was used. The Lactobacillus plantarum strains were used as control.

Moreover, the surface of the pyloric region, which represents the gastric area responsible for bolus retention, was higher (P< 0. 05) for pigs fed the 30 WECS diet (20. 4 % of total S surface) than 15 WECS and C diets (21. 8 an 20. 4 %, respectively). The incidence of follicular gastritis was significantly lower (P< 0. 01) and the gastritis were less severe (P< 0. 05) for diets containing WECS than C diets. WECS diets influence the development of stomach and maintain the gastric mucosa integrity for a lower incidence of gastritis in heavy pigs...|$|R

Grain corn was harvested at 32 – 37 % of dry matter and ensiled in a 4 [*]L laboratory silo. Forage was treated as follows: bacterial types: B 0 (without bacteria-control), B 1 (L. plantarum), B 2 (P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii), and B 3 (combination of L. plantarum and P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii). Each 2 [*]kg of <b>chopped</b> <b>forage</b> was treated with 10 [*]mL of bacterial culture and allowed to ferment for 27 days. The first experiment determined the most suitable wavelength for detection of bacteria (490 [*]nm and 419 [*]nm for B 1 and B 2, resp.) and the preferable inoculation size (1 × 105 [*]cfu/g). The second experiment analysed the effect of B 1 and B 2 applied singly or as a mixture on the fermentation characteristics and quality of corn silage. L. plantarum alone increased crude protein (CP) and reduced pH rapidly. In a mixture with P. freudenreichii, the final pH was the lowest compared to other treatments. As a mixture, inclusion of bacteria resulted in silage with lower digestibility than control.

A high level of oestrogenic substances fed to cattle or sheep may result in several adverse biologi-cal effects, including increased teat length, gesta-tion time, and uterine weight, as well as prolapsed vagina. In contrast, beneficial effects of alfalfa silage have also been reported; an increased rate of growth and milk production can serve as good examples (Vagnoni and Broderick, 1997; Broderick et al., 1999). Although it {{has been known for}} a long time that alfalfa haylage containing 37 ppm of coumestrol or more caused clinical signs of oestro-genic stimulation in cattle (Lookhart, 1980), data on coumestrol content in alfalfa silage are surpris-ingly sporadic.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{chemical}} composition and rumen degradability of ensiled soybean forage harvested at three plant vegetative stages (i. e., R 4, R 5, R 6) and wilted for 20 or 28 h. The wilted <b>forages</b> were <b>chopped</b> from 1 to 2 cm and then manually pressed into 6 kg bags of fresh material (two bags for each combination of maturity stage and wilting duration) prior to storage under anaerobic condition for 90 d. The soybean silages were analysed for fermentative parameters and manually separated into leaves, stalks and pods. Whole forage and separated plant components were chemically analysed and the in vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) ruminal degradation (NDFD) was determined. Only whole plant silages were assessed for in vitro gas production (GP) and in vitro crude protein degradability (CPD). The dry matter (DM) content of the ensiled whole plants increased (P= 0. 005) from 454 to 485 and 518 g/kg from the R 4 to R 5 and R 6 vegetative stages and was higher for forages wilted at 28 h than those at 20 h (528 vs 444 g/kg, P< 0. 001). Advancing plant maturity increased (P< 0. 001) the crude protein (CP) and ether extract (EE) content from 164 to 199 and from 18 to 53 g/kg DM, respectively, but reduced ash (P= 0. 011) from 71 to 63 g/kg DM. The NDFD increased with plant maturity from 0. 319 to 0. 465 (P< 0. 001). The GP did not differ among maturity stages of forages or wilting lengths, while CPD increased from 0. 391 to 0. 548 (P< 0. 001) with advancing maturity and slightly decreased with the longer wilting duration (P< 0. 008). The DM content of the pods and stalks increased (P< 0. 01) with the vegetative stage and CP content increased in pods and decreased in leaves. Results indicate that harvesting soybean forage at an advanced maturity stage (e. g., from R 4 to R 6) greatly increases the protein, the fat and the degradable NDF contents. Moreover, the wilting soybean forage has to be targeted to achieve a DM content of ensiled forage of about 440 g/kg (between about 410 to 480 g/kg, according to the maturity stage), and a further wilting determines no fermentative improvements at ensiling or relevant modification of silage nutritional contents...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A modular, computer–controlled {{sampling}} system {{was developed to}} directly sample <b>chopped</b> <b>forage</b> material from a forage harvester spout. Pneumatic cylinders powered a deflector flap to redirect crop material from the spout. A hydraulic cylinder compressed deflected forage material into 35. 6 –cm long, 10. 2 –cm diameter PVC pipes, which served as miniature test silos. Timing of the pneumatic and hydraulic actuators was controlled by a programmable microcontroller. The control system included three operator inputs: travel speed, row length, and number of samples along the row for each silo; this provided flexibility to adapt to different harvesting situations. In two experiments, test–silo samples fermented for 48 days and then were separated into six size fractions. In the first experiment, a side–by–side comparison with a self–propelled plot harvester, statistically {{significant differences in the}} mass fractions of medium and small particles (indicated by low p–values in the range of 0. 1 to < 0. 001) were found between samples collected by both machines and their respective controls. No differences in the mass fractions of large particles were found. In the second experiment, the performance of the modular {{sampling system}} in sampling corn chopped at two theoretical lengths of cut (6. 35 and 19. 1 mm) and two whole–plant moisture levels (approximately 70 and 60 % w. b.) was evaluated.

While considerable information is available on seed grains, {{little is known about}} the aerodynamic behavior of corn (Zea mays L.) silage. In this re-search, the weighed mean terminal velocity of a sample representative of the entire bulk mass was determined using Wolf and Tatepo’s method. The terminal velocity of various particle types (leaf, stalk and corncob pieces) of <b>chopped</b> <b>forage</b> corn plants, which were kept in silo for six months, at different moisture contents (40 - 50, 50 - 60 and 60 - 70 % w. b.) was also studied. The terminal velocity was determined by measuring the air velocity re-quired to suspend a particle in a vertical air stream using a wind tunnel. A 3 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement with 30 replications in a completely randomized design was used to study the effect of moisture content and particle type on the terminal velocity. The mass mean terminal velocities of the corn silage at 40 - 50, 50 - 60 and 60 - 70 % moisture con-tents were 7. 1, 7. 3 and 7. 8 m/s, respectively.

The first cut (477 g of dry matter/kg) and second cut (393 g of dry matter/kg) of a second-year alfalfa stand were ensiled in 2 trials. In both trials alfalfa was harvested with standard field equipment. All inoculants were applied at 1. 0 × 10 6 cfu/g of crop. Uninoculated silages served as controls. After inoculants were added, the <b>chopped</b> <b>forages</b> were ensiled in 1. 0 - and 0. 5 -L anaerobic glass jars, respectively, at a density of 500 g/L. Each trial had 15 treatments (uninoculated control and 14 inoculants), with 4 silos per treatment. Silos were stored {{for a minimum}} of 30 d at room temperature (∼ 22 °C). In first-cut silage, all inoculants but one reduced pH relative to the uninoculated control, and all but 2 of the homofermentative strains shifted fermentation toward lactic acid. In second-cut silage, the epiphytic lactic acid bacterial population was 2. 7 × 10 7 cfu/g, and only commercial inoculants produced significant shifts in fermentation. Overall, microbial inoculants generally had a positive effect on alfalfa silage characteristics in terms of lower pH and shifting fermentation toward lactic acid with homofermentative lactic acid bacteria or toward acetic acid with heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus buchneri.

Although such crops are often held to be in competition with food crops and thus raise the question of current and future food security, at the same time mitigation measures are required to tackle climate change and sustain local farming communities and crop production. However, in some cases the actions envisaged for specific pedo-climatic conditions are not always economically sustainable by farmers. In this frame, energy crops with high environmental adaptability and yields, such as giant reed (Arundo donax L.), may represent an opportunity to improve farm incomes, making marginal areas not suitable for food production once again productive. In so doing, three of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations would be met, namely SDG 2 on food security and sustainable agriculture, SDG 7 on reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG 13 on action to combat climate change and its impacts. In this work, the response of giant reed in the marginal areas of an agricultural district of southern Italy (Destra Sele) and expected farm incomes under climate change (2021 - 2050) are evaluated. The normalized water productivity index of giant reed was determined (WP; 30. 1 gm(- 2)) by means of a SWAP agro-hydrological model, calibrated and validated on two years of a long-term field experiment. The model was used to estimate giant reed response (biomass yield) in marginal areas under climate change, and economic evaluation was performed to determine expected farm incomes (woodchips and <b>chopped</b> <b>forage).</b> The results show that woodchip production represents the most profitable option for farmers, yielding a gross margin 50 % lower than ordinary high-input maize cultivation across the study area...|$|R

40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} crop processing on pull-type forage harvesters requires engineering analysis and experimentation {{in areas such}} as roll design, particle aerodynamic, vibration, power measurement and crop physical characterization. The first step of this research project was to design, build and evaluate two processing rolls integrated in an experimental pull-type forage harvester. With a 12. 7 mm theoretical length of cut setting, the processing rolls were used to treat alfalfa at a 1 mm clearance between the rolls. Samples analyzed at an animal research centre showed that processing increased the effective ruminal degradability of corn by 3 % but did not improve the degradability of alfalfa. The presence of processing rolls in the forage harvester increased friction. The air inlet area had to be increased to improve particle flow and obtain maximum air outlet speed. The presence of crop processing rolls required an increase in blower speed of 10 to 20 % to maintain the throwing capacity. Critical speeds were analyzed by the Transfer Matrix Component Mode Syntheses (TMCMS) method and three classical approaches using analytical models to predict deflections in the shaft. Experiments showed that the TMCMS method was very reliable and predicted the critical speed with an error of about 4 % compared to 8 % or higher for classical methods. Modal analysis also proved to be a simple and practical way to measure critical speed. A laboratory setup was built to investigate various mechanical adjustments: roll clearances of 4 and 6 mm for corn, and 1 and 3 mm for grass; eight peripheral speed ratios between 1. 08 and 1. 93; two levels of throughput (9 and 18 t fresh crop/h). Optimal adjustment will ultimately depend on animal response to various levels of crop breakage. A hydrodynamic model of <b>chopped</b> <b>forage</b> processed between rolls was developed to determine crop properties using an experimental database and subsequently predict the power requirement {{as a function of the}} configuration.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{public interest in}} developing a sustainable biobased economy that favors support of family farms and rural communities and also promotes the development of biorenewable energy resources. This study focuses {{on a number of}} questions related to the development and exploration of new pathways that can potentially move us toward a more sustainable biobased economy. These include issues related to biomass fuels for drying grain, economies-of-scale, new biomass harvest systems, sugar-to-ethanol crop alternatives for the Upper Midwest U. S., biomass transportation, post-harvest biomass processing and double cropping production scenarios designed to maximize biomass feedstock production. For each question of interest, specific examples were identified and detailed models developed in MS Excel 3 ̆c® 3 ̆e. Techno-economic analysis and Monte Carlo simulation techniques were used to challenge each model and evaluate viability. The first section of this study considers post-harvest drying of shelled corn grain both at farm-scale and at larger community-scaled installations. Currently, drying of shelled corn requires large amounts of fossil fuel energy. To address future energy concerns, this study evaluates the potential use of combined heat and power systems that use the combustion of corn stover to produce steam for drying and to generate electricity for fans, augers, and control components. Techno-economic analysis suggests that there are significant economies of scale with community-based dryers, e. g. grain elevators, which show a much faster return on investment over farm-scaled systems. Because of the large capital requirements for solid fuel boilers and steam turbines/engines, both farm-scale and larger grain elevator-scaled systems benefit by sharing boiler and power infrastructure with other processes. The second and third sections evaluate sweet sorghum as a possible 2 ̆ 2 sugarcane-like 2 ̆ 2 crop that can be grown in the Upper Midwest. Various harvest systems are considered including a prototype mobile juice harvester, a hypothetical one-pass unit that separates grain heads from chopped stalks and traditional forage/silage harvesters. Also evaluated were post-harvest transportation, storage and processing costs and their influence on the possible use of sweet sorghum as a supplemental feedstock for existing dry-grind ethanol plants located in the Upper Midwest. Results show that the concept of a mobile juice harvester is not economically viable due to low sugar recovery. However, traditional forage/silage harvest systems provide an economically viable harvest solution as long as <b>chopped</b> <b>forage</b> can be quickly processed in a nearby, centralized facility. The transportation of low bulk density, fresh harvested or ensiled sweet sorghum was found to significantly contribute to overall costs. However, at the scales evaluated in this study, those costs did not adversely affect the viability of sweet sorghum as a supplemental feed for existing dry-grind ethanol plant. The addition of front-end stalk processing/pressing equipment into existing ethanol facilities was also found to be economically viable when combined with the plants 2 ̆ 7 use of residuals as a natural gas fuel replacement. Because of high loss of fermentable carbohydrates during ensilage, storage of sweet sorghum in bunkers was not found to be economically viable. The forth section looks at double cropping winter triticale with late-planted summer corn and compares these scenarios to traditional single cropped corn. Double cropping systems show particular promise for co-production of grain and biomass feedstocks and potentially can allow for greater utilization of grain crop residues. However, additional costs and risks associated with producing two crops instead of one could make biomass-double crops less attractive for producers despite productivity advantages. Detailed evaluation and comparisons show double cropped triticale-corn to be at a significant economic disadvantage relative to single crop corn. The cost benefits associated with using less equipment combined with availability of risk mitigating crop insurance and government subsidies will likely limit farmer interest and clearly indicate that traditional single-crop corn will provide greater financial returns to management. To evaluate the various sweet sorghum, single crop corn and double cropped triticale-corn production scenarios, a detailed but generic model was developed. The primary goal of this generic approach was to develop a modeling foundation that can be rapidly adapted, by an experienced user, to describe new and existing biomass and crop production scenarios that may be of interest to researchers. To facilitate ease-of-use, the techno-economic model was developed in MS Excel 3 ̆c® 3 ̆e. It also incorporates the Excel add-on, Crystal Ball 3 ̆c® 3 ̆e, which provides Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis capabilities. The foundation model allows input of management practices, crop production characteristics and utilizes standardized machinery performance and cost information, including farm-owned machinery and implements, and machinery and farm production operations provided by custom operators. Several of the studies reported in this dissertation take advantage of the flexibility of the foundation model. Many specific models of unique production scenarios (in excess of 100) were developed and tested. Twenty of these models are actually presented in this work. More important to the success and value of this modeling approach is the now readily available Monte Carlo simulation tools, which allows researchers to describe uncertainty around key model variable in a more realistic manner. It is opinion of the author that all future crop related techno-economic studies should incorporate Monte Carlo simulations as standard practice...|$|R
