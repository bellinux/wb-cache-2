5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the {{power stations}} were projected to consume {{a significant proportion of}} the bay's waters each day <b>for</b> <b>cooling.</b> After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed <b>for</b> <b>cooling</b> water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling.

5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium <b>for</b> <b>cooling,</b> before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case <b>for</b> <b>cooling</b> during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and <b>for</b> <b>cooling</b> the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E

5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University, the Idaho National Laboratory, and other colleges beginning in 2000. At the time, Oregon State's nuclear department had been developing passive water-circulation techniques <b>for</b> <b>cooling</b> in nuclear plants. The research grant ended in 2003, but {{a group of scientists}} at Oregon State University continued the work. They built a test lab at one-third the actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007, in exchange for a small equity in the company. NuScale was founded that same year. Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum. It began seeking certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} propels itself {{underwater}} {{by moving the}} rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9km/h (5.6mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater <b>for</b> <b>cooling.</b> The sea otter's body is highly buoyant because of its large lung capacity – about 2.5 times {{greater than that of}} similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} <b>for</b> <b>cooling</b> {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and evaporative cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. Evaporative cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} of heterogeneous consumer preferences to {{examine the effect of}} voluntary and mandatory country of origin labeling (COOL) on consumer purchasing decisions and welfare when consumers view COOL information as an attribute that differentiates products vertically and horizontally. Analytical results of both the vertically and horizontally differentiated product models show that the change from a no COOL to a mandatory COOL regime decreases (increases) the welfare of consumers with weak (strong) preference <b>for</b> <b>COOL.</b> A change from a no COOL to a voluntary COOL regime leads to an undisputed increase in consumer welfare which results from an increase in the welfare of consumers with strong preference <b>for</b> <b>COOL,</b> while the welfare of consumers with weak preference <b>for</b> <b>COOL</b> remains unchanged. A change from a voluntary to a mandatory COOL regime leads to a consumer welfare loss in the vertically differentiated product model and in the horizontally differentiated product model when product relocation is prohibitively costly. In both the above models, a switch from voluntary to mandatory COOL decreases the welfare of consumer with weak preference <b>for</b> <b>COOL,</b> while it keeps the welfare of consumers with strong preference <b>for</b> <b>COOL</b> unchanged. A change from a voluntary to a mandatory COOL regime in the horizontally differentiated product market when product relocation is possible leads to a decrease in the welfare of consumer with both weak and strong preference <b>for</b> <b>COOL</b> and to possible welfare gains for those consumers who place greater value in country of origin information under mandatory than under voluntary COOL. country of origin labeling, heterogeneous consumer preferences, vertical and horizontal product differentiation., Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R
