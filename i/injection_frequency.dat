High-power single longitudinal mode operation of the TEA laser is achieved over a wide but finite range of <b>injection</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the frequency of the single-mode pulse being that of the TEA laser cavity mode lying closest to the injected frequency.

Injection frequencies of 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 injections per engine cycle had been investigated using the RNG k-ε turbulent model.

40|$|TiOx {{films were}} {{prepared}} by liquid injection {{atomic layer deposition}} using titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP), Ti[OCH(CH 3) (2) ](4), dissolved in ethylcyclohexane (ECH). We analyzed the residual water content and the reaction with the TTIP for several solvents, choosing ECH for dissolving the TTIP because of the lowest residual water level and no ligand exchange reaction with the TTIP. TiOx films were deposited at 240 degrees C {{with a wide range}} of the TTIP solution injections per cycle. However, an ideal self-regulated growth was not achieved for the TiOx films due to a slow catalytic decomposition of the TTIP molecules followed by the exchange reaction with the underling layer. The contribution of the catalytic decompositions to the deposition rates was suppressed by increasing the <b>injection</b> <b>frequency</b> of the TTIP solution into the vaporizer. A rather independent deposition rate of the input of the TTIP solution was achieved by increasing the <b>injection</b> <b>frequency</b> to 4 Hz, while TiOx films deposited with a low <b>injection</b> <b>frequency</b> of 0. 25 Hz showed almost linear film growth rate to the input of the TTIP solution.

To establish whether baseline VA and <b>injection</b> <b>frequency</b> influence visual outcomes. Patients and methods: Retrospective review of 70 patients (76 eyes) treated with 0. 5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab for 3 consecutive months, and pro re nata thereafter (three + pro re nata protocol), over a 3 -year period. VA was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months. The number of injections administered at the end of years 1, 2, and 3 were also recorded. Eyes were stratified according to baseline VA, as well as the number of injections administered at the end of year 1. Linear regression analysis determined the relationship between VA and both baseline VA and <b>injection</b> <b>frequency.</b> P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: At 36 months, VA improved by a mean of 5. 3 ETDRS letters (P= 0. 002), with 29 % of eyes (n= 22) demonstrating a clinically significant improvement in VA (gain of ≥ 15 ETDRS letters). Improvements in VA from baseline to 36 months were inversely proportional to the baseline VA (R= 0. 414, P=< 0. 001). A positive correlation was observed between <b>injection</b> <b>frequency</b> and change in VA from baseline to 36 months (R= 0. 244, P= 0. 036). Conclusion: Mean improvement in VA is inversely proportional to baseline VA, and directly proportional to <b>injection</b> <b>frequency.</b> Keywords: long-term results, Lucentis, neovascular AM...|$|E

The "traversal'' or "B"uttiker-Landauer'' time (which grows linearly with the distance to the source) for the Hermitian, non-absorbing case is substituted by three different characteristic quantities. One of them describes the arrival of a maximum of the density calculated with respect to position, but the maximum with respect to time for a given position becomes independent of the distance to the source and is given by the particle's ``survival time'' in the medium.

In contrast monthly treatment [...] as also provided in the ANCHOR and MARINA studies [...] is generally allowed in Switzerland.

The hemoglobin levels, the weekly dose {{as well as the}} injection fre-quency of epoetin zeta were monitored at least every two weeks. Patients were followed in three time periods: 1) ex-tended follow-up (months 1 - 18); 2) intervention phase (months 19 - 21); and 3) post intervention observation phase (months 28 - 30). During extended follow-up the majority of patients (n = 21) received only one injection of epoetin zeta per week. During the intervention phase, <b>injection</b> <b>frequency</b> was increased to 3 injections per week in all patients accompanied by a reduction in weekly doses of approximately 20 %- 30 %.
