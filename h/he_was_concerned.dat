5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; {{he was told that}} the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.|$|E
5|$|In 1918 Davies {{sought the}} {{position}} of miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the SWMF. Against strong competition—his main opponent was William Mainwaring, later a long-serving Labour MP for Rhondda East—Davies was victorious by 100 votes. The main role of the agent was to represent miners in disputes with their employers; typically these would involve issues of pay, redundancy, working hours, and compensation for injuries. Davies's surviving day books reveal {{the extent to which}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> with cases where the mining companies denied liability for underground injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{initially}} {{opposed the}} march outright, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> it would negatively impact {{the drive for}} passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided {{it was important to}} work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that few articles of this time {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and he {{wrote a letter to the}} president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about the world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan {{as a way to}} avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg left Hawaii on June 7, 1887, booking {{steerage}} class {{passage on}} the steamer Australia. Some reports state {{that he left}} owing to health issues, although others suggest that Rosenberg departed the island because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about political unrest. He left {{three weeks before the}} king signed the June Constitution. Rosenberg returned to San Francisco, but was hospitalized within a month of his return, and died on July 10, 1887. He spoke of King Kalākaua on his deathbed, whispering the king's name with his dying breath. He was buried at the cemetery of Congregation Sherith Israel in the San Francisco Peninsula; brief death notices were published in Hawaii- and San Francisco-based newspapers.|$|E

In the process, he has further developed the sociological concept of “strategic groups” {{in the context of}} both local cadres and entrepreneurial groups in China. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> with social and policy innovations in China, and with critical junctures of authoritarian systems. Most recently <b>he</b> <b>is</b> working on new political representative claims from a comparative perspective.|$|R

5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911. The {{work had been}} {{completed}} in 1907, but {{the manager of the}} Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré, repeatedly deferred its presentation. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were {{an important part of the}} Opéra-Comique's audience. The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular.|$|E
5|$|There were {{issues with}} casting the film. Paramount Studios' deal with William Shatner had ended {{and so the}} first draft of the film did not feature Captain Kirk. He was later added as a new {{contract}} was signed. However, Leonard Nimoy dropped out of the film because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> over potential merchandising after his likeness as Spock was used in a Heineken advertisement without either his permission or an arrangement for royalties. He had refused to speak publicly about the issue, but Shatner explained it in an interview. The situation was eventually resolved and Nimoy signed on to appear in Planet of the Titans.|$|E

Although <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{a trained}} Bedoowan knight, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> about the Milago and helps {{the rest of}} the Travelers {{whenever}} <b>he</b> can. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> described as being very clumsy and not very good looking.|$|R
50|$|Clodumar {{was born}} in Boe. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{a member of the}} {{indigenous}} population of Nauru, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> with environmental issues. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a Member of Parliament for many years and served as Minister of Finance from 2003 until October 2004.|$|R
50|$|Tsukushi is {{the main}} character's younger brother. Although <b>he</b> may <b>be</b> a little arrogant at times, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> about his sister and will provide {{information}} about potential love interests. It is possible to visit him on free days.|$|R
5|$|To address his problems, Cho's {{parents also}} {{took him to}} church. According to a pastor at the Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho was a smart student who {{understood}} the Bible, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about Cho's difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to NBC News, he never heard him say a complete sentence. The pastor also recalled that he told Cho's mother that he speculated Cho was autistic and {{he asked her to}} take him to a hospital, but she declined.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{approved}} of the 1830 election victory of the more progressive Whigs, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about the implications of}} their Reform Bill which proposed the redistribution of parliamentary seats towards newer towns and cities and an extension of the franchise. In the event, the Reform Act 1832 was to bring more abolitionist MPs into Parliament as a result of intense and increasing public agitation against slavery. In addition, the 1832 slave revolt in Jamaica convinced government ministers that abolition was essential to avoid further rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Another of Dannatt's {{priorities}} was {{tackling the}} perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.|$|E

5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their {{holidays}} as wealthy people like him could. The number of railways in Great Britain steadily increased {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and Hesketh was impressed by the arrival in 1828 of the steam locomotive in Lancashire. As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{served as}} a member or {{chairman}} of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, {{he was a member}} of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947–52), he was also a member of the Commonwealth government's Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases. His report was titled War from a Biological Angle. Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.|$|E
2500|$|Chartock says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> about {{governmental}} {{restrictions on}} free speech. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> dismayed {{by what he}} calls the proliferation of corporate run radio stations, which he believes express extreme right-wing views without giving opposing viewpoints. [...] He has called Pete Seeger [...] "an American hero".|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> about a {{disconnect}} {{between what the}} public believes about evolution and what scientists believe about evolution. He states the value of studying evolution is in {{the true story of}} our origins and its value in restoring wonder in people.|$|R
5000|$|G. K. Chesterton calls suicide [...] "the {{ultimate}} {{and absolute}} evil, {{the refusal to}} {{take an interest in}} existence". He argues that a person who kills himself, as far as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>concerned,</b> destroys the entire world (apparently exactly repeating Maimonides' view).|$|R
