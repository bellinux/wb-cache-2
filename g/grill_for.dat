25|$|Security {{changes in}} Washington, D.C., after the September 11, 2001, {{terrorist}} attacks significantly affected Old Ebbitt <b>Grill</b> <b>for</b> a while. The restaurant {{was forced to}} close for two days when streets near the White House were closed. Over the next two weeks, the restaurant lost half its business (normally 2,000 customers a day, most of them politicians and businesspeople). After First Lady Laura Bush began patronizing the restaurant, business soon returned to normal. The Beltway sniper attacks of fall 2002 did not affect business, which continued to hold steady through February 2003, a time of high alert and anxiety. Due to security restrictions in 2004, Old Ebbitt Grill was nearly prevented from its traditional practice of selling coffee and hot chocolate to spectators watching the inaugural parade, in this case for the landmark election of Barack Obama as President of the United States. That year the Democratic Leadership Council rented the entire restaurant for a private party on Inauguration Day.|$|E

2500|$|Walter Anderson {{contributed a}} number of novel ideas to White Castle during its early years, {{including}} {{the creation of a}} special spatula and a special bread for the burgers. In 1949, an employee named Earl Howell calculated {{the amount of time that}} it took to break hamburgers apart in a presentable fashion, eventually leading him to create the perforated burger. By 1951, White Castle had incorporated five perforations into its burgers. Before Anderson, hamburgers were cooked on a <b>grill</b> <b>for</b> an indefinite period of time and minced meat balls were [...] "crushed" [...] into conventional slices of bread, like a sandwich. The meat was frozen and hamburgers came to be cooked from frozen, instead of using fresh meat. White Castle revolutionized the burger-making process by regularizing the finished products and using hygienic preparation techniques that were in clear view of the customers.|$|E
