50|$|National and {{international}} standards {{have been developed}} to standardize the safety and performance requirements for <b>jacks</b> <b>and</b> other <b>lifting</b> devices. Selection of the standard is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance {{in the design of the}} jack. In the United States, ASME has developed the Safety Standard for Portable Automotive Service Equipment, last revised in 2014, including requirements for hydraulic hand jacks, transmission jacks, emergency tire changing jacks, service <b>jacks,</b> fork <b>lift</b> <b>jacks,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>lifting</b> devices.|$|R

50|$|The gun car was {{positioned}} over the pit, the wheels were locked and the platform was locked into position with gun mount and car's weight {{shifted from the}} trucks (bogies) directly to the ground by <b>jacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>lifting</b> screws. The rails were removed from above the pit because the gun breech was too wide to pass between them. The gun could elevate up to 43°, which gave it a maximum range of 42,000 yards (23.8 miles/38.4 km), and could be traversed 2.5° left and right of center. Any greater change of direction required the gun to be moved forward or backward along its curved track and a new recoil pit dug. The gun used the standard naval gun mounting and recoil system, {{with the addition of}} a pneumatic system to assist the runout springs to return the gun to firing position after recoil at the higher maximum elevation of 43° compared to maximum 30° in naval use.|$|R
40|$|This senior project {{discusses}} the design, construction, {{and evaluation of}} a portable RPC (Reusable Plastic Container) dumper. This RPC dumper is one piece of a citrus processing system to package citrus. Bee Sweet currently utilizes man power in order to dump its RPCs whereas this design will decrease the amount of man power needed to dump RPCs during high workloads. The goal of this project was to design, construct, and test a custom fabricated RPC dumper that will decrease {{the number of people}} needed to dump RPCs and also the amount of damage on the oranges when being dumped from the RPC by hand. The finished RPC dumper functions well, it dumps 4 RPCs per minute and is portable in that it can be moved by both pallet <b>jack</b> <b>and</b> fork <b>lift.</b> The RPC dumper also functions well in that it reduces the velocity change that the fruit sees by 80 % and also decreases the impact duration by 38 %...|$|R
40|$|This study {{developed}} an observational method of measuring lifting behavior, {{which was used}} to evaluate educational assistants in the public school system as they lifted students with disabilities during a normal work day. A survey was sued to identify the type of <b>lifting</b> <b>instruction</b> educational assistants had received, and to determine factors related to incorrect lifting behavior. Fifteen of the twenty subjects (75 %) who participated in this study received <b>lifting</b> <b>instruction</b> from a physical therapist. It was found that very few (10 %) of the sampled educational assistants consistently lifted students as they had been taught at physical therapy in-services. More studies are needed to determine if a relationship exists between physical therapy in-service <b>and</b> <b>lifting</b> behavior in this setting. This observational method could be used to examine the lifting behavior of a larger subject group, and could be adapted to study other occupations...|$|R

Mr. Ashford brings his customary gymnastic vigor to the choreography: lots of revved-up jumping <b>jacks,</b> push-ups <b>and</b> leg <b>lifts,</b> usually led by a trio of athletic muscle boys." [...] Variety added that [...] "watered-down Waters has yielded a flavorless Broadway musical that revels in its down-and-dirtiness yet remains stubbornly synthetic. There's a lot of talent, sass and sweat onstage, particularly in the dance department, plus a sprinkling of wit in the show's good-natured vulgarity. But somehow, it never quite ignites." [...] The New York Sun opined that O'Donnell and Meehan [...] "had far more success with another retro-themed Waters adaptation, Hairspray.... Cry-Baby is content to stay in the shallow end and focus on a standard wrong-side-of-the-tracks tale.... But rather than supply a jolt of not-too-outsider-energy, songwriters have instead coasted on their magpie skills, tossing out an undistinguished stream of pastiche numbers. The lyrics occasionally have a welcome crispness.... The songs themselves, however, are as generic as the lyrics are pointed: It's the first time I can recall forgetting a show's melodies before they were even finished." ...|$|R
60|$|An {{hour or two}} passed, when Flash Jack {{directed}} {{attention to}} my long friend, who, since the medicine boy left, had not been noticed till now. With eyes closed, he was lying behind the stocks, <b>and</b> <b>Jack</b> was <b>lifting</b> his arm <b>and</b> letting it fall as if life were extinct. On running up with the rest, I at once connected the phenomenon with the mysterious vial. Searching his pocket, I found it, and holding it up, {{it proved to be}} laudanum. Flash Jack, snatching it from my hand in a rapture, quickly informed all present what it was; and with much glee, proposed a nap for the company. Some of them not comprehending him exactly, the apparently defunct Long Ghost--who lay so still that I a little suspected the genuineness of his sleep--was rolled about as an illustration of the virtues of the vial's contents. The idea tickled everybody mightily; and throwing themselves down, the magic draught was passed from hand to hand. Thinking that, as a matter of course, they must at once become insensible, each man, upon taking his sip, fell back, and closed his eyes.|$|R

60|$|Then {{he picked}} up Jack between a big finger and thumb and threw him away; <b>and</b> as <b>Jack</b> went through the air {{he felt as if}} he were flying from system to system through the {{universe}} of stars. But, as the giant had thrown him away carelessly, he did not strike a stone, but struck soft mire by the side of a distant river. There he lay insensible for several hours; but when he awoke again his horrible conqueror was still in sight. He was striding away across the void and wooded plain towards where it ended in the sea; and by this time he was only much higher than any of the hills. He grew less and less indeed; but only as a really high mountain grows at last less and less when we leave it in a railway train. Half an hour afterwards he was a bright blue colour, as are the distant hills; but his outline was still human and still gigantic. Then the big blue figure seemed to come to the brink of the big blue sea, and even as it did so it altered its attitude. <b>Jack,</b> stunned <b>and</b> bleeding, <b>lifted</b> himself laboriously upon one elbow to stare. The giant once more caught hold of his ankle, wavered twice as in a wind, and then went over into the great sea which washes the whole world, and which, alone of all things God has made, was big enough to drown him.|$|R
