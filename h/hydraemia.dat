40|$|Acute {{maternal}} hypervitaminosis A {{established on}} Day 9 of gestation in Sprague-Dawley-derived rats caused a dose-related {{increase in the}} resorption of implants. The median embryolethal dose was 189, 000 i. u. /kg. In addition to suppression of the allantois leading to placental agenesis, damaged embryos showed retarded somatic development and <b>hydraemia,</b> all apparent 24 h after treatment. At about Day 11 the <b>hydraemia</b> involved the visceral wall of the yolk sac causing death of the embryo soon after. The fluid in the vitelline vessels continued to collect until Day 13 when it absorbed following necrosis of {{the wall of the}} yolk sac. Two mechanisms are suggested for the embryonal hydraemia: either the excess fluid resulted from a permeability disorder induced by the vitamin A; or it was retained metabolic water or water specifically absorbed to inflate the allantois and, being unused for this purpose, it pooled in the blood vessels of the embryo. The yolk sac <b>hydraemia</b> is more likely to have followed injury to the proximal endoderm...|$|E
40|$|THOUGH one {{normally}} {{regards the}} estimation of hemoglobin {{as one of the}} simplest procedures, itdoes seem rather anomalous that having obtained the result, it should then be difficult to decide whether certain pregnant women are actually anemic or not. This is largely due to other changes which take place in the blood during pregnancy. As early as I 88 I Willcocks first noted the occurrence of <b>hydraemia.</b> Since then more detailed investigations have been carried out(Dieckmann and Wegner, I 934; Thomson, Hir-sheimer, Gibson and Evans, I 938; Roscoe and Donaldson, I 946; Tysoe and Lowenstein I 950; Lund and Sisson, 1958), which have shown that while all elements of the blood increase in pregnancy, the increment in plasma volume is proportionately greater. For example Dieckmann and Wegner (I 934) estimated that the plasma volume increased by 25 %, and the red cell and haemoglobin mass by only 20 and 15 % respectively, findings which explain the apparent drop in the haemoglobin level noted by many other observers(Davidson, Fullerton and Campbell, 1935; Boy...|$|E
40|$|By the {{perfusion}} method {{through the}} kidney of the toad following results were obtained. 1) When the Extr. of Rad. Phytol. {{is added to}} the perfusing fluid, it increases distinctly the flow of urine. 2) Conversely, the addition of potassium salt, which will be contained abundantly in Rad. Phytol., brings, firstly, the remarkable decrease of the urine flow, and then it may increase slightly. 3) Ash of the Rad. Phytol. dissolved in Ringer's solution decreases the urine flow remarkably at first, and then it may increase. 4) When the Extr. of Rad. Phytol. is applied in drops to the exposed kidney of frog, causes dilatation of glomerular capillaries; the circulation in them becomes more rapid, i. e. the quantity of blood which flows through them increases, and a number of glomeruli, hitherto invisible, becomes visible. The application of this extract in drops on the web of frog dilates its blood-capillaries and increases the blood-flows through them. 5) But the solution of potassium salt used, or the ash of the Rad. Phytol. causes contraction of glomerular capillaries and capillaries of web of frog. The blood-flows in the capillaries become remarkably slow, i. e. the quantity of blood which flows through them decreases. The glomeruli, hitherto activ, becomes stationary and visible number of glomeruli diminishes. 6) The measurement of the freezing-point revealed that the osmotic pressure of the Extr. of Rad. Phytol. used was not very different from the normal Ringer's solution. 7) By the flame-reaction it was ascertained that potassium and sodium salts were contained in the Rad. Phytol. 8) Diuretic action of Rad. Phytol. is due to some organic substance, which causes dilatation of capillaries of glomerulus and web of frog. Potassium salt which is contained in Rad. Phytol. makes some additional action through <b>hydraemia...</b>|$|E
40|$|The author made various {{experiments}} {{on the action}} of glucose as a diuretic and obtained the following results, 1) The number of glomeruli with blood circulation of a frog increases 2. 5 times after the intravenous injection of 0. 2 cc of 25 % glucose solution. 2) In frog the injection of 0. 2 cc of 3. 75 % NaCl solution (isotonic with 25 % glucose solution) increases the number of glomeruli with blood circulation about twice as before injection. 3) The urine secretion of a rabbit increases about 3 times or nlore in 1 - 2 minutes after the injection of 3 cc of 20 % glucose solution. 4) The urine secretion of the dog increases after the injection of 10 - 15 cc of 20 % glucose solution. The osmotie pressure of the blood rises after the injection for a while. Conceming the osmotic pressure of blood same thing will be observed also on rabbits. 5) Blood vessels of the lower limbs of the toad widen a little with perfusion of 0. 6 % Ringer, s solution containing 0. 38 % glucose. 6) The rate of flow of blood through the kidney of rabbit does not increase by the injection of glucose. 7) The diuretic action of gluco 8 e {{is accompanied by a}} marked increase of the intake of oxygen by kidney. When KGN solution is injected previously the hrine secretion and also the oxygen consumption in the kidney do not increase by the injection of glucose solution. From these data could be sammalise that the diuretic action of hypertonic glucose solution depends on not only increased blood irrigation of kidney or <b>hydraemia</b> following increased osmotic pressure of blood but also a enhancement of secreting activity of kidney-cells take a great part...|$|E
40|$|A large {{quantity}} of blood was shed from dogs and immediately {{replaced by the}} injection of an equal volume of Acacia-Ringer solution (Ringer solution mixed with 7 % of gum acacia) into the vein {{in order to prevent}} any fall of blood pressure, (due to loss of blood,) and to maintain the normal state of circulation. The content and tension of oxygen in the blood under the abovementioned conditions and the recovery of these from their now lowered level to the normal, were studied. Concomitant changes in the blood, viz., in the number of erythrocytes, and in the volume-ratio of blood corpuscles to the plasma and the haemoglobincontent of blood, were observed during the successive days. 1) By the letting of blood, the oxygen content in the arterial blood was lowered until it was 8. 95 vol% or below; in these cases the animals succumbed always; but in cases in which the oxygen content remained over 10. 55 vol%, the animals survived. 2) The critical amount of oxygen in the blood, the severe loss of blood and the lowered oxygentension of the respiratory air, all coincide in producing death. The determining factor in producing death, in these cases, was the deficiency of oxygen in the blood. 3) The decrease of the oxygen content in the blood below the critical value is shown by the decrease of the respiration frequency, especially in the most case by the respiration of Cheyne-Stokes type. 4) It seems as if failure of the respiratory centre to respond foretells the death of animals in the case of anoxaemia, for if the frequency of the respiration in anoxaemia exceeds the normal rate (i. e. the rate of respiration before the bleeding a. s. f.,) the prognosis is generally favourable; but if the centre can not respond to the lack of oxygen with increased respiration frequency, the animal, without exception, expires. 5) The amount of the lost blood until about 44 % of the total blood volume (which was calculated as 9. 72 % of the body weight, according to Meek and Gasser) could be safely replaced by Acacia-Ringer solution; but a loss of blood exceeding 45 % could not be safely replaced in this way. 6) Socalled “head of oxygen” i. e. the difference between the oxygencontents of arterial and venous blood decreased to 2. 0 % (normal value is 5. 66 to 3. 66 %, average 4. 26 %,) when about 44 % of blood was replaced by Acacia-Ringer. If this value fell lower than 1. 62 %, by the replacement of a greater amount of blood by Acacia-Ringer, the animal died. 7) Complete recovery of the blood to its normal volume and number of bloo-dcorpuscles, required 33 to 40 days, if the shed blood was replaced by an equal amount of hypertonic Acacia-Ringer. If isotonic Acacia-Ringer was used, the recovery was effected in 24 to 27 days. Recovery of the amount of haemologlobin delayed about 3 days from this term. 8) The recovery of the blood to normal conditions of oxygencontent, numbers of erythrocytes and the amount of haemoglobin proceeded steadily, when replacement of the shed blood was made by isotonic Acacia-Ringer. If hypertonic Acaeia-Ringer was used for replacement, <b>hydraemia</b> followed withinin a few days during the early stages of recovery...|$|E
