During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker.

500|$|This {{morning at}} 11 o'clock I have {{attacked}} the enemy.... All my troops have worked wonders, {{but at a}} cost of innumerable losses. Our men got into confusion. I assembled them three times. In the end I was in danger of getting captured and had to retreat. My coat is perforated by bullets, two horses of mine have been shot dead. My misfortune <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still living... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; I am no more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. I do not have any more resources, and—frankly confessed—I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever! ...|$|E

[...] Manea also wrote: [...] "What struck about [...] was the contradiction between the extraordinary mobility of spirit and the Affixed Idea. [...] How did he pacify his disappointments and regenerate his militantism after having seen with his eyes, and his mind, and his heart the nightmarish masquerade of the totalitarian state?" [...] He added: [...] "The socialist tension between the 'conserved' ideal and the putrid reality maintained in those who gave up neither contempt nor complicity a sort of narcissistic and megalomaniac blindness." ...|$|E

New Jersey political circles had speculated about McGreevey's sexual orientation and questions about his relationship with Cipel had been alluded to in the media. McGreevey's announcement made him the first openly gay state governor in United States history.

2500|$|His {{achievements}} {{in the navy}} were well-known, but himself much less.

2500|$|Brian Whitaker, the Middle East {{editor for}} The Guardian {{newspaper}} at the time, {{wrote in a}} public email debate with Carmon in 2003, that his problem with MEMRI was that it [...] "poses as a research institute when it's basically a propaganda operation".

[...] and that MEMRI's website does not mention Carmon's employment for Israeli intelligence, or Meyrav Wurmser's political stance, which he described as an [...] "extreme brand of Zionism".

2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to make some kind of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I can make you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality of the situation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
