However, out of the 32 reservoir liners cemented on the Ekofisk M platform only 16 were defined as 100 % successful. In this thesis <b>foam</b> <b>cement</b> and liner string components are introduced before evaluating the outcome of the different jobs. A success criterion for the outcome is established, incorporating liner centralization, zonal isolation and liner movement. The criterion regards the outcome a success if liner manipulation is maintained throughout the job and no remedial job is needed, a semi-success if manipulation is maintained for most of the job and no remedial job is needed, and a failure if none of the previously mentioned. Data from all {{the reservoir}} liner cementing operations are gathered and the outcome of each is evaluated based on the above criterion. 16 of the liners were cemented successfully, 6 were semi-successfully, and the last 10 were failures. Failing to reestablish rotation after setting the liner hanger is the most common reason for failure, 7 out of 10 failures can be related to this. Wellbore inclination and liner length are both parameters which seems to contribute to the outcome of <b>foam</b> <b>cementing</b> the reservoir liner. 13 of the 32 wells have an inclination above 80 º at the liner shoe. Out of these 13 wells only 4 are regarded as successful, the rest are either semi-successful, 4, or failures, 5. Even though failures are observed for all inclinations, this happens more frequently at higher inclination. The success rate also seems to be influenced be the length of the liner. For shorter liners, i. e. with a length below 2000 ft, nearly 78 % of the cement jobs were successful, whereas the same percentage for liners with a length between 5000 ft and 6000 ft is 25 %.

When the CMFs {{came in contact with}} a pore solution of cement, their surfaces underwent alkali-caused oxidation, leading to the formation of metal (Na, Ca, Al) -complexed carboxylate groups. The extent of this oxidation was enhanced by the temperature increase, corresponding to the incorporation of more oxidation derivatives at higher temperatures. Although micro-probe examinations did not show any defects in the fibers, the en-hanced oxidation engendered shrinkage of the interlayer spacing between the C-basal planes in CMFs, and a decline in their thermal stability. On the other hand, the complexed carboxylate groups present on the surfaces of oxidized fibers played a pivotal role in improving the adherence of fibers to the cement matrix. Such fiber/cement interfacial bonds contributed significantly to the excellent bridging effect of fibers, resistance to the cracks development and propagation, and to improvement of the post-crack material ductility. Consequently, the compressive toughness of the 85 ˚-, 200 ˚-, and 300 ˚C-autoclaved <b>foamed</b> <b>cements</b> reinforced with 10 wt % CMF was 2. 4 -, 2. 9 -, an...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{function}} of well cement {{is to provide}} casing support and zonal isolation {{for the life of}} a well (Thiercelin et al., 1998; Singamshetty, 2004; Iverson et al., 2008). Failure to achieve one or both of these conditions can lead to a migration of fluids up the wellbore and result in both economic and ecological disasters, as exemplified by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on April 20, 2010. To avoid these kinds of failures, the cement must have sufficient strength to secure the casing in the hole and withstand the stresses of drilling, perforating, enhanced oil recovery, and hydraulic fracturing and also be able to keep the annulus sealed against the formation. This thesis analyzes and presents in detail some of the mechanical and physical properties of atmospherically generated <b>foamed</b> <b>cements</b> typically used in deep offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico.

To better represent the behavior of cements in the wellbore, we subjected cements to pressure cycling and the measurements were analyzed over the range of these pressures.

40|$|Establishing a {{hydraulic}} seal that prevents flow {{is the primary}} objective of any cement job, as it is essential throughout {{the life of a}} well. Evaluation of the cement in the annulus must be done to verify its quality. Tools based on acoustics are market leaders, although having limitations that may cause erroneous conclusions. It is of interest to find tools based on other principles that either replaces or supplements acoustic logs. The thesis covers briefly barrier establishment, acoustic and fiber optic principles. A preliminary investigation into x-ray viability for cement evaluation has been done. Photon interactions, generation, detection and their subsequent challenges were also discussed. Heavy emphasis was placed on Compton scattering, as this is the basis for allowing both the transmitter and detector to be placed on the same side. To determine the viability of x-rays downhole several scenarios were created. We considered a single photon traveling through casing and a selection of materials before it is reflected at an angle. Initial results based scenarios with concentric and eccentric cemented 958 casing showed that investigation of the cement-formation interface is too demanding of x-rays as it failed to provide sufficient penetration of the casing on its return. The attenuation due to Compton scattering is significant, dependent on energy level and angle of the beam it can reach 80 % attenuation. The angle of reflection or transmission will provide additional attenuation due to added length of travel path for the beam. Material density must be taken into consideration, as it influences the attenuation rate of the x-rays beam. The beam experienced high degree of attenuation when passing through casing, the attenuation contrast between casing and cement was discernable. Materials such as <b>foamed</b> <b>cement,</b> seawater and gas were also investigated. All of the latter materials allowed for increased transmission compared to casing and cement. The contrast between <b>foamed</b> <b>cement</b> and seawater was low and of concern for applicability of x-rays for <b>foamed</b> <b>cement</b> evaluations. Gas channels in cement are easily detected if the size of channel is sufficient.

40|$|Recovering from roof {{cavities}} on the {{longwall face}} is an endemic aspect of longwall mining {{and this is}} especially the case today as longwall faces are wider and higher than they have ever been, yet powered support ratings are effectively technology constrained. There {{is little doubt that}} the ever-increasing dimensions of longwall faces are consequently increasing the likelihood of major roof falls occurring, especially in those more challenging geotechnical environments containing poor immediate roof conditions at depths of cover greater than 250 m. As a result, the efficiency and safety of longwall roof cavity recoveries is being given increased attention and is more relevant than ever {{to the success of the}} coal industry. This has led to the now almost universal use of cavity fills during the recovery of major roof falls on the longwall face, albeit that there is industry discussion regarding what constitutes ideal properties for cavity fill material. The paper discusses the geotechnical reasons why it is believed that major roof falls on longwall faces are becoming more likely with time and defines a conceptual geotechnical model for the cavity recovery process and the inherent ground control problems involved.
