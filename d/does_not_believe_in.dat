5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L.

He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul {{was one of three}} U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E

Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E

Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E

Dot and Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) are involved in a car collision, but both blame the other as Kim has no licence but Kim accuses Dot of being too old to drive. Dot then locks her car key away. After Patrick and Dot go to the cinema together, he convinces her to see an optician because she was squinting throughout. Dot is seen hiding away in her house on Halloween and Patrick comes to talk to her.

Certain violations, such as eating blood, being absent from worship services too long without any solid reason, or marrying or having a romantic relationship with a non-member may result in mandatory excommunication.|$|E

25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> the {{existence}} of intrinsic or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but he thinks that any political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with {{the role played by}} perception in empirical science.|$|E

As a devout follower of Yevon's teachings, Wakka believes that anyone who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> Yevon, like the Al Bhed, are evil heathens, and is staunchly against the use of machina.
