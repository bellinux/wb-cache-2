As prime minister, a {{law was passed}} in November 1968 that {{introduced}} a special benefit for full unemployment (trattamento integrativo di disoccupazione) for workers in the industrial sector, in cases of total or partial closing down of enterprises or large-scale dismissals, equalling two-thirds of previous monthly earnings for 180 days. The law also extended <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> benefits to cases of sectoral crises or industrial restructuring with a new compensation formula equaling 80% of previous earnings for 3 months (9 months in exceptional circumstances), allowed for family allowances {{to be paid to}} those in receipt of unemployment benefits.|$|E
50|$|During his periods as Prime Minister, {{a number}} of {{progressive}} reforms were carried out. A law of 11 December 1969 extended {{access to higher education}} to all students holding a higher secondary school diploma (formerly limited to students who came from classical (and in some cases, scientific) curricula. A law of 30 April 1969 introduced broad provisions covering pensions under the general scheme. The multiplying coefficient was increased to 1.85%, applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 5 years of work (maximum pension, after 40 years of contribution: 74% of previous earnings). A social pension was also introduced for people over the age of 65 with low incomes and not eligible for any type of pension. In addition, cost of living indexation for all pensions (with the exception of social pensions) was introduced. A law of 2 February 1970 extended <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> benefits to artisan undertakings in the construction industry. Under a law of 2 March 1974, the legal minimum for pensions was raised to 27.75% of the average industrial wage for 1973. A law of 16 July 1974 extended family allowances to INPS pensioners, in lieu of child supplements. A law of August 1974 extended hospital assistance to all those not previously covered by any scheme.|$|E

40|$|Our project uses DYNASIM 3, the Urban Institute’s dynamic microsimulation {{model of}} the U. S. population, to {{simulate}} several alternative systems of Social Security auxiliary benefits. We specifically consider earnings sharing, {{a system in which}} a husband’s and a wife’s earnings records are combined and averaged over the duration of their marriage when computing Social Security benefits. We also consider whether other changes to Social Security’s benefit computations — like caregiver credits, minimum benefits, and more modest changes to spouse/survivor benefits — could improve program adequacy and horizontal equity with less complexity and fewer transition difficulties relative to earnings sharing. Each proposal we examine substitutes existing spouse (and, sometimes, all or parts of survivor) benefits with mechanisms that explicitly acknowledge marital partnerships, are more neutral with respect to marriage, and/or better target economically vulnerable people. All proposals are roughly cost-equivalent in 2050. We find that all three packages — <b>earnings</b> sharing, <b>replacement</b> of most of the spouse benefit with a minimum, and full spouse replacement with caregiver credits — reduced poverty modestly and made lifetime benefits more similar for couples paying the same amount in taxes relative to current law scheduled. The earnings-sharing proposal, however, only achieved the poverty reduction with significant adjustments to the treatment of surviving spouses through a self-financed survivor benefit. The packages reveal important tradeoffs among beneficiary groups, with particular tensions between workers and non-workers, and married, never married, divorced, and widowed persons.

The distributions of <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> rates of men who were not RPP members are far more dispersed than those of men who were RPP members.

The argument also highlights the need to consider {{gender differences in the}} receipt of income. We explore the implications of a scenario in which non-means-tested <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> benefits are abolished and means-tested benefits and tax credits fill some of the gap.

40|$|The {{practice}} {{of international trade}} has evolved from the purchase of final goods of foreign origin to production sharing, now {{commonly referred to as}} offshore outsourcing. Due to the nature of direct replacement of domestic tasks with foreign ones, the discussions about offshore outsourcing tend to be built around the resulting job losses. However, there are not many empirical studies on this subject due to data limitations. In this dissertation, I investigate the labor market implications of offshore outsourcing. In the first two essays, I use structural models to analyze the size of employment changes - job creation as well as job destruction. The third essay takes {{a closer look at the}} readjustment process of individual workers in the new era of globalization. In the first essay, I assume firm heterogeneity in productivity to allow firms to respond to the feasibility of offshore outsourcing. Two developed (northern) countries compete. The theoretical analysis shows that the most productive firms outsource while the least productive firms exit (the Cleansing Effect) and that the aggregate employment effect is negative. The numerical analysis, however, shows that the negativity of the aggregate effect is caused by the cleansing effect, and that the employment responses of outsourcers are ambiguous. In the second essay, firms are homogeneous and face competition from firms in developing (southern) countries. The analysis compares the competitiveness of northern firms in the world market with and without offshore outsourcing. The results show that employment in the north is generally larger with outsourcing due to improved price competitiveness of their firms which generates larger sales despite its job destruction. Finally, the third essay looks into the US Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program which provides retraining services to workers who are displaced due to import competition. I investigate how successful completion of occupational skills training – measured as a match between occupations of training and reemployment - improves the customers’ post-participation performance. The empirical analysis shows that receipt of training services alone does not guarantee superior post-participation performance; however, successful training – a match – significantly improves the trainees’ <b>earnings</b> and wage <b>replacement</b> rates...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how {{changes in}} the two key {{parameters}} of unemployment insurance - the benefit replacement rate (RR) and the potential duration of benefits (PBD) - affect the duration of unemployment. In 1989, the Austrian government made unemployment insurance more generous by changing, simultaneously, the maximum duration of regular unemployment benefits and the <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> ratio. We find that increasing the replacement ratio has much weaker disincentive effects than increasing the maximum duration of benefits. We use these results to split up the total costs to unemployment insurance funds into costs due to {{changes in the}} unemployment insurance system and costs due to behavioral responses of unemployed workers. Results indicate that costs due to behavioral responses are substantial. ...|$|E

40|$|Between 1984 and 2000, {{the share}} of non-elderly adults {{receiving}} benefits from the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs rose by seventy percent. We trace this remarkable growth to reduced screening stringency and, due to the interaction between growing wage inequality and a progressive benefits formula, a rising <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> rate. We explore {{the implications of these}} changes for the level of labor force participation among the less skilled and their employment responses to adverse employment shocks. Following program liberalization in 1984, DI application and recipiency rates became two to three times as responsive to plausibly exogenous labor demand shocks. Contemporaneously, male and female high school dropouts became increasingly likely to exit the labor force rather than enter unemployment {{in the event of an}} adverse shock. The liberalization of the disability program appears to explain both facts. Accounting for the role of disability in inducing labor f o r c e exit among the low-skilled unemployed, we calculate that the U. S. unemployment rate would b...|$|E
40|$|For {{several decades}} the United Kingdom pension {{debate has been}} {{dominated}} by the most basic questions of programme design. What is the ideal balance between public and private provision? To what extent should public pens ion benefits be tied to contributions paid or simply targeted on the least well off? Is private provision best organised through employers or through contracts of individuals with insurance companies? Part of the reason why answers have not been found is indecision about how to balance competing objectives. A solidaristic insurance type scheme, intended to ensure that idiosyncratic risks do not burden any individual or generation too heavily, sometimes complements but sometimes conflicts with the redistributive goal of ensuring that no pensioner has too low a standard of living, or with the aim of <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement.</b> The current UK system strikes a compromise through the multi-pillar 1 setup of choice-based provision described in Section 2. Section 3 describes how the United Kingdom programme handles ‘solidarity’ in its provision of pension benefits by the state. We argue that the UK has move...|$|E
40|$|Support for the two-tier {{approach}} to income maintenance {{for the aged}} is becoming increasingly widespread. Two-tier formulas combine an income-conditioned bottom tier with an earnings-related top tier {{in order to achieve}} both antipoverty and <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> objectives. This paper first refutes the frequent claim that the two-tier approach is more target-efficient in reaching the poor than is the earnings-related top tier with progressive replacement rates. After showing that both approaches can be equally target-efficient, we compare the effectiveness of the two systems in terms of other goals. We also examine how the tradeoffs among goals in moving from one system to the other depend on the correlation between preretirement earnings and current income of the aged. It is seen that. the higher is the correlation, the less at-tractive is the two-tier approach. The paper concludes by demonstrating that a formula with a low tax on current income and a progressive earn-ings-related benefit schedule can virtually dominate a wide range of two-tier formulas. As a bonus, revenues saved from this more efficient method IJ...|$|E
40|$|On January 1, 2017, {{the parental}} leave benefit will be celebrating its tenth anniversary. Although its {{implementation}} was fervidly debated, {{it has become}} a widely accepted family policy measure. Its impact on parental labor supply, the division oflabor between parents, fertility, and indicators that reflect the well-being of parents and children have been examined from a variety of perspectives. A global evaluation of relevant economic studies shows that on average, when young familiesreceive the parental leave benefit as an <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> benefit, their economic stability in the first year after childbirth increases. As a result of the parental leave benefit, the employment rate of mothers decreased in the first year after childbirth, while it increased in the second year. The share of fathers who take parental leave has clearly increased, while the effects on the division of labor within the family are inconclusive. Some evidence suggests that the parental leave benefit can even have an effect on fertility. Little is known about its impact on child development. Overall, although the parental leave benefit family policy measure has been successful in many areas, its targeted effects could be augmented by additional family policy reforms...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} ways to alleviate feelings of role overload experienced by working mothers in Canada through {{changes to the}} current paid parental leave policy. Although women have made great strides in labour market participation and career development since the 1970 ’s, they are still maintaining the majority of childcare and household care activities, leading to difficulties balancing their roles of parent and employee. Using mothers’ blog entries from parenting websites and a comparative case study analysis, this study argues that paid parental leave policies must encourage the equal contribution of fathers in childcare and household maintenance activities {{in order to reduce}} mothers’ feelings of stress. Currently, the Parental Benefits program provides a period of parental leave, which may be shared by both parents; however, only 10 % of Canadian fathers take a paid leave of absence upon the birth or adoption of a child. Policy recommendation includes: providing a six month period of non-transferable paternity leave in addition to six months of non-transferable leave for mothers and six months of shared leave; increased financial support through a higher <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> and higher weekly benefit minimum...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Social Security {{benefits as}} a retirement resource (wealth and income) for U. S. near-retirees. We {{look at how}} the average values of several measures of benefits such as Social Security wealth and <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> rates have changed from earlier cohorts to today's near-retirement cohort, examine differences among demographic and socioeconomic groups within cohorts, and discuss reasons for these changes and differences. We use improved data (actual earnings history data) to produce more accurate measures of benefits. The paper also uses some new benefit measures. Three key findings are: (1) average real Social Security wealth increases markedly as we move to later cohorts primarily because of increases in average real lifetime earnings; (2) replacement rates fall as we move from the cohorts of persons reaching 61 in 1993 - 97 to later cohorts primarily because of the phase-in of increases in the age of eligibility for full benefits and the increasing labor market activity of women; and (3) median Social Security wealth is much higher for women than for men because women live longer.

40|$|After being {{displaced}} from their jobs, workers experience reduced earnings {{for many years}} and are at greater risks of other problems as well. The ills suffered by displaced workers motivated several recent expansions of government programs, including the unemployment insurance system, and have spurred calls for wage insurance that would provide longer-run <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement.</b> However, while the average size and the individual characteristics associated with the losses are relatively clear, the theory of displacement-induced earnings loss is scattered. Much of the policy discussion appears to interpret displacement-induced losses through the lens of specific human capital theory, in which skills are specific to jobs, locations, industries, or occupations, and that model has considerable empirical support. Assistance for displaced workers may improve well-being in that model since it insures workers against the risk that their consumption of goods and services might fall for idiosyncratic reasons and, as a consequence, allows workers to make more productive but higher-risk career choices. But there are other credible theories of costly job displacement that have different causal mechanisms, different interpretations and different policy implications. This paper reviews theories of costly job displacement and discusses their consistency with the available empirical evidence. We find that while specific human capital is important, we cannot rule out important roles for other theories...|$|E
40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the shift in the private sector from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, primarily 401 (k) s. Often forgotten, however, is that, at any given moment in time, only about half of private sector workers are covered by any sort of employer-sponsored plan. This lack of coverage has two implications. First, a substantial proportion of households – roughly one-third – ends up with no pension coverage at all during their entire worklife and must rely exclusively on Social Security during retirement. And, even under current law, Social Security will provide less in the future relative to pre-retirement earnings than it has in the past. Second, with median job tenure of about four years in 2008, many employees move in and out of coverage so that they end up with inadequate 401 (k) balances. This brief proceeds as follows. The first section describes the extent to which private sector workers are covered by any retirement plan. The second section explores the implications of the lack of universal coverage. The third section discusses policy initiatives to improve coverage. The key finding is that, absent a government initiative, pension coverage is unlikely to increase, which – coupled with declining <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> under Social Security – means that many future retirees will end up with inadequate incomes. ...|$|E
40|$|Financial advisors {{commonly}} use <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> {{rates to}} assist workers in their retirement planning. Policymakers and analysts {{use them to}} gauge the adequacy of Social Security benefits and other retirement income in allowing retirees to maintain preretirement living standards. In recent years, the Social Security trustees regularly published replacement rates that have been widely interpreted as {{the extent to which}} Social Security benefits replace earnings of workers at various points in the lifetime earnings distribution. However, the trustees ’ replacement rates are calculated differently than those generally used for retirement planning purposes possibly leading to confusion among policymakers and others regarding how much of workers ’ earnings are replaced by Social Security and how much those workers need to save on their own for retirement. Financial planners calculate replacement rates by comparing an individual’s retirement income to that same individual’s pre-retirement earnings, generally earnings in the years immediately preceding retirement. The Social Security Administration, by contrast, effectively calculates replacement rates by comparing retiree incomes to the incomes of contemporaneous workers. This latter measure is often used in other countries, but differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from the more common replacement rate calculations used for financial planning purposes. We find that replacement rates calculated on a financial planning basis are generally higher than those published by the Social Security trustees and that Social Security benefits generally replace somewhat more of individual workers ’ earnings than the trustees ’ rates suggest. ...|$|E
40|$|Market-heavy pension systems, {{in which}} low or {{moderate}} state benefits are topped up by private welfare arrangements, {{have long been}} expected not only to create dualisms, but also to fuel patterns of politics that perpetuate and even increase such dualisms over time. The starting point {{of this research is}} the observation that while some market-heavy pension systems indeed remain dualised in the post-industrial context, others have become more universal, either through changes to the structure of the state pension or through regulation to extend the coverage of private pensions. My research objective is to explain the universalising changes that have occurred. I show that the very institutional features that are usually expected to lead to further dualisation, namely a reliance on market-based arrangements, the prevalence of targeting and limited <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement,</b> contribute to bringing about universalising reforms. In particular, I show how under certain conditions these institutional features help structure the policy preferences of key political actors such that those actors usually associated with the extension of state provision embrace market means, while those associated with private provision push for the expansion of the state pension. I use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) of nine market-heavy pension systems over the three decades since 1980 to map the combinations of causal conditions under which universalising reforms have occurred. In addition, I present case outlines linking the institutional conditions to the reform outcomes via the policy preferences of key political actors. In doing so I provide a causal logic that reinforces the results of the fsQCA and offers a substantial explanation for the introduction of universalising reform in some market-heavy systems, {{as well as for the}} absence of such reform in others...|$|E

40|$|Litigation over product {{liability}} has escalated because of shifting liability standards, {{and the role}} of workers' compensation has increased both because of the changing injury mix and the provision of more generous benefit levels. The rise in these costs does not necessarily signal that the systems are in need of retrenchment, since the earlier institutional roles may not have been adequate. However, they do signal a need for reassessment. In the case of {{product liability}}, the major shortcoming is that the courts' treatment of design defects is overly ambitious. Regulatory agencies are better suited than the courts in making judgments about design defects, and establishing the role of insurance for all product defects is not feasible. Similarly, in the case of workers' compensation, it is not feasible to have an administrative compensation scheme for all diseases with some possibly remote link to the workplace. The cost of covering all such diseases is simply too great. Moreover, raising benefit levels to provide better <b>earnings</b> <b>replacement</b> is desirable, but additional research is needed to find ways of limiting the problem of moral hazard which appears to be substantial. Economic analysis has an extensive role to play in analyzing liability reform. Litigation behavior accords with an economic model of the bargaining process in which both the plaintiff and defendant behave rationally given the economic stakes involved. Moreover, analysis of the appropriate role of the product liability and workers' compensation remedies hinges on issues that can be examined with the aid of empirical studies. Empirical evidence on workers' compensation suggests that income replacement rates are near the optimal amount, abstracting from the role of moral hazard. Further application of empirical tests to ascertain the optimal level of insurance for specific classes of injuries will further illuminate the key concerns in the tort liability reform debate. Perhaps the main insight economists have brought to the tort liability reform debate is that incentives matter. Workers' compensation costs substantially affect workplace safety, and product liability expenses influence the safety of product designs and the rate of new product introductions. What is missing from this analysis is a determination of the optimal level of safety. Eliminating all risks is not desirable, and we currently have no precise estimates of the direction or extent of the departure from the optimal amount of safety...|$|E
