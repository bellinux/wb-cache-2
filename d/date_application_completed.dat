40|$|A {{study was}} carried out over two years (2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006) on a private farm in the Alentejo region (Évora), in the South of Portugal where rainfed wheat is sown {{at the start of}} the winter {{rainfall}} season. The wheat crop was established using no-till as this technology provides the necessary machine bearing capacity of the soil to assure the post-emergence application of herbicides at different weed development stages. Mesosulfuron-methyl (3 %) and iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium (0. 6 %) and mefenpyr-diethyl (9 %) were used at three doses and two dates with three different application volumes. The results of this study indicate that using lower doses than recommended (0. 4 kg ha− 1) this herbicide controls the annual grass weeds (Avena sterilis L. and Lolium rigidum G.) better than some broad-leaved weeds. For all doses and volume combinations, the application at the first weed development stage (beginning of tillering for grass weeds and 3 – 4 pairs of leaves for broad-leaved weeds) provided higher grain yields. The lower efficiency of control of more developed grass and broad-leaved weeds and a longer period of competition between crop and weeds for the second <b>application</b> <b>date</b> (<b>complete</b> tillering for grass weeds and 5 – 6 pairs of leaves for broad-leaved weeds) were responsible for the significantly lower crop yields for this <b>application</b> <b>date.</b> Within each <b>application</b> <b>date</b> no significant differences were obtained between all dose/volume combinations, indicating that the reduction of dose is possible. At the later <b>application</b> <b>date,</b> the lower herbicide dose seems to require a lower application volume to provide maximum grain yield...|$|R

The introduction is dedicated to theoretical findings and basic terminology related with on-line dating.

In connection with these attributes, {{the second part of the}} thesis concentrates on theories dealing with transformations in present relationships. Separate chapter is devoted to millennials - known as generation Y.

In this study we investigate this phenomenon, in both training and <b>dating</b> <b>applications,</b> from a design perspective using the frameworks of gamification and Fogg´s behavior model.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Tinder {{is a very}} popular smartphone-based geolocated <b>dating</b> <b>application.</b> The goal {{of the present study}} was {{creating}} a short Problematic Tinder Use Scale (PTUS). Methods Griffiths’ (2005) six-component model was implemented for covering all components of problematic Tinder use. Confirmatory factor analyses were carried out on a Tinder user sample (N[*]=[*] 430). Results Both the 12 - and the 6 -item versions were tested. The 6 -item unidimensional structure has appropriate reliability and factor structure. No salient demography-related differences were found. Users irrespectively to their relationship status have similar scores on PTUS. Discussion Tinder users deserve the attention of scientific examination considering their large proportion among smartphone users. It is especially true considering the emerging trend of geolocated online <b>dating</b> <b>applications.</b> Conclusions Before PTUS, no prior scale has been created to measure problematic Tinder use.

40|$|The study {{attempted}} {{to determine whether}} there was a significant relationship between <b>date</b> of <b>application</b> for admission to the University and academic achievement of freshmen at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. ACT data were utilized to determine whether early applicants possessed characteristics predictive of academic performance. The research explored whether or not <b>date</b> of <b>application</b> differentially related to grade point average and credit hours completed. It also {{attempted to}} ascertain whether earlier appliers for admission to college were higher achievers in high school, more decisive about future goals, and more involved in non-academic activities than later appliers. These variables were then examined in relationship to academic performance. All freshmen entering the University for the 1979 - 1980 academic year with complete ACT data on file were examined with reference to <b>date</b> of <b>application</b> for admission. The sample was comprised of 1, 157 first-time, full-time, 18 year old students. Students were classified as earlier or later applicants based on their <b>date</b> of <b>application</b> to the University. Pearson Product Moment Correlations and Multiple Regression Analyses were applied to determine the relationship between <b>date</b> of <b>application,</b> first year grade point average and credit hours completed, and ACT profile variables. Significant relationships (p. <. 001) were found between <b>date</b> of <b>application,</b> first year grade point average, high school rank, certainty of first vocational choice and predicted first year grade point average. It was concluded that <b>date</b> of <b>application</b> had some value as a predictor of academic performance. Earlier applicants had achieved higher high school rank, expressed greater degree of certainty regarding educational and vocational plans, and predicted higher first year grade point average. It was also found that high school rank, ACT composite scores, and predicted first year grade point average were highly correlated with academic performance.

40|$|Gay <b>dating</b> <b>applications</b> {{serve the}} drive for meeting sex {{partners}} and are now used by over 2 million gay men around the world. The nature of these apps involves users engaging in conversation that allows for significant information disclosure and increased trust, allegedly leading to unprotected sex when they meet offline. This paper therefore aims to explore the behavior of users of gay <b>dating</b> <b>applications</b> in Thailand and their pattern of information disclosure in order to investigate the relationship between app usage, information disclosure, and the resulting sexual behavior. 286 gay-dating application users in Thailand were surveyed with a self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire between February and March 2015. The findings showed significant positive association between the degree of usage {{and the amount of}} information being disclosed. Moreover, the frequency of usage such as the number of days (r =. 249), the number of locations (r =. 320), and the amount of time (r =. 360) that the participants use the apps along with the disclosure of personal information like Facebook account (r =. 337), mobile number (r =. 306) and address (r =. 240), are associated with the higher rate of unprotected sex. Trustworthiness deriving from information disclosure could {{play a vital role in}} the psychology of many gay men.
