25|$|The gallery {{arrangement}} is {{almost identical to}} that of the House of Representatives. Unlike the House of Representatives, only the leader of the government or opposition in the Senate approaches the lectern; other frontbench senators and all backbench senators have a <b>desk</b> <b>microphone.</b> As {{can be seen from the}} illustrations, unlike the House of Representatives, there is no distinction between the front and back benches in the Senate chamber; Senate ministers and their opposition counterparts have the same two-seat benches as all other senators. The press gallery is located above the Senate chamber. The presiding officer of the Australian Senate is the President of the Senate, who occupies a position in the Senate chamber similar {{to that of the}} Speaker of the House of Representatives. Behind the seat of the President of the Senate are two large seats which are modern versions of thrones. The larger is used by the Governor-General or the monarch (when visiting) when they open Parliament at the start of a new parliamentary session. The vice-regal consort or the royal consort (when visiting) sits in the smaller throne.|$|E

50|$|The Queensland Legislative Assembly sits in Parliament House in the Brisbane central {{business}} district. The {{building was}} completed in 1891. The lower house chamber is decorated dark green in the traditional Westminster style. The chamber once featured central tables which divided two rows of elevated benches on each side. The room is now configured in a U-shape away from the Speaker's chair with three rows of benches that have their own <b>desks</b> and <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Common {{uses for}} this size of battery include some small flashlights, remote control door chimes, glucose meters, small <b>desk</b> clocks, {{wireless}} <b>microphones,</b> laser pointers, some vintage calculators, and film cameras.

5000|$|Sometime in 2015 Bob {{could be}} heard in the {{background}} along with Elic Thomas taping windows and turning on power tools. Erica and Peanut Butter were in the background trying to go thru the Hollywood news. Bob then proceeded to saw what {{could be heard}} as a <b>desk</b> or <b>microphone</b> stand or something of that nature. Erica and Peanut Butter were in shock and tried to go on. Bob told Erica and Peanut Butter mid conversation to get off the air and leave with them. He was tired of things not working and walked out while on the air. You can hear doors slamming and voices, then dead silence. There has not been any confirmation if this was fake or real. The Showgram returned a few days later, most likely with [...] "equipment" [...] being fixed.|$|R
5000|$|During February 1971, Nixon had {{a secret}} audio {{recording}} system installed in the Wilson Desk. The president's offices in the White House, Camp David, and the Old Executive Office Building all had hidden microphones installed by the United States Secret Service, {{and some of the}} recordings created by this system make up the Watergate tapes. There were seven microphones in total installed in the Oval office, one {{on either side of the}} fireplace and five located within the Wilson <b>Desk.</b> These <b>microphones,</b> as well as recording devices in the Cabinet Room were all wired to central mixers and recorders in [...] "an old locker room in the White House basement." [...] Not long after April 9, 1973 a switch was installed in the desk to allow Nixon to turn the microphones on and off at will. Previously they turned on automatically whenever someone began talking.|$|R
50|$|DMX512-A uses {{a single}} pair of conductors, so can be {{connected}} using the cheaper 3-pin XLR connectors. Some manufacturers made units with three-pin XLR connectors, {{because of their}} lower cost. However, as 3-pin XLRs are commonly used for connecting microphones and sound mixing consoles, there is then a risk of wrongly connecting DMX512 equipment to microphones and other sound equipment. The +48 volt phantom power emitted by mixing consoles could damage DMX512 equipment if connected to it. The DMX512 signals emitted by lighting <b>desks</b> can damage <b>microphones</b> and other sound equipment if connected to it. Hence best practice is to use only 5-pin XLRs for DMX512 signals, to avoid risk of confusion with connectors used for sound signals.|$|R
5000|$|A bronze {{statue of}} late Seattle Mariners {{broadcaster}} Dave Niehaus was unveiled Friday September 16, 2011 at Safeco Field. The statue captures the Hall of Fame broadcaster who broadcast 5,284 Mariners games over 34 seasons (1977-2010) at a <b>desk,</b> behind a <b>microphone,</b> wearing headphones with his Mariners scorebook {{in front of}} him. His scorebook is opened to the box score for Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series, when Edgar Martínez hit [...] "The Double". There is an empty seat next to the statue, so fans can sit next to Dave and pose for photos. Dave's longtime broadcast partner Rick Rizzs presided over a private ceremony to unveil the statue.|$|R
40|$|Full text of {{this book}} is not {{available}} in the UHRAThe room is set up like a conference hall somewhere in the Arab world, or perhaps like the legislative assembly of a small modern state. There are <b>desks</b> with push-button <b>microphones</b> and headsets. Behind, there is a screen, as if someone planned to give a Powerpoint presentation. But {{the names on the}} desks are the familiar characters from "Hamlet". The setting of Sulayman Al Bassam's powerful, disturbing version of the "Hamlet" story is a modern Middle-Eastern state whose old king has just died, to be replaced by his brother, a ruthless, westernised dictator who has married the old king's wife to legitimise his rule, and calls his regime a "new democracy"...|$|R
5000|$|The statue depicts Niehaus at a <b>desk,</b> {{behind a}} <b>microphone,</b> wearing {{headphones}} with his Mariners scorebook {{in front of}} him. Niehaus is wearing a favorite necktie with tiny baseballs on it and a sport coat. He's holding a pencil {{in his right hand}} and wearing the 2001 All-Star Game ring on his left. The scorebook in front of him is open to Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees. The pages are engraved with Niehaus's actual notes and scoring of the game. The scorebook is so detailed, you even see the word [...] "Unbelievable" [...] scribbled—and misspelled—at the top in Niehaus's handwriting. One person in attendance said Niehaus often misspelled the word because he was writing so fast. [...] "That's unreal", said former Mariner Jay Buhner as he looked at the artistry. That game was won when Edgar Martínez hit a double down the left field line and Ken Griffey, Jr. slid into home.|$|R
30|$|Technology {{enhanced}} learning (TEL) has {{the potential}} to enhance the student experience by facilitating self-paced learning, lowering inhibition thresholds for asking questions, and allowing access to learning on an as-and-when basis (Kamath, 2015), all of which are factors that may contribute to informal and incidental learning outside of the formal learning space (Peart et al., 2014). There is a body of research examining the role of the teacher in facilitating TEL, and a reservation or anxiety from staff has been described with respect to the technology acceptance model (Blackwell et al., 2014; Gong et al., 2004; Louw, 2015; Teo et al., 2008). Such problems may present a barrier to the promotion of TEL to support student learning. However, an aspect that has been less researched is the contribution of students to the impact of TEL, and in particular their perspectives on TEL tools (TELT). There is a wealth of information on student perceptions of a selection of ‘learning objects’ (LO) and ‘web based learning tools’ (WBLT) (Cochrane, 2005; R. Kay, 2011; R. H. Kay & Knaack, 2009; Nurmi & Jaakkola, 2006; Vargo et al., 2003). Such studies can provide a useful insight for LO and WBLT developers, but the implication from a teaching perspective is somewhat limited unless the teacher is likely to use that very specific tool in their teaching. For example Cochrane (2005) evaluated two audio engineering LOs (interactive mixing <b>desk</b> and <b>microphone</b> chooser) and Nurmi and Jaakkola (2006) evaluated three LOs to teach fractions, the Finnish language and electrical DC circuits. Such tools are typically designed {{to be used in the}} classroom, and as a result do not promote extra-curricular and informal/incidental learning.|$|R
