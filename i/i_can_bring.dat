500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, so I don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, and so forth. I just listen {{and try to figure}} out if I have anything <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> to a song." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1979, de Lucía, John McLaughlin, and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and {{together}} made {{a tour of}} Europe and released a video recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits. Pohren said that de Lucía's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin, Di Meola, Coryell, and Chick Corea {{must have been an}} [...] "exciting and stimulating" [...] experience for him, given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him [...] "so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused, a man running the risk of losing his musical identity." [...] This concerned de Lucía, who said in a late 1990s interview, [...] "I have never lost the roots in my music, because I would lose myself. What I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching, digging in other places, trying to find new things <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> into flamenco." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael Jordan's Restaurant was {{the brainchild}} of Joe and Gene Silverberg, owners of the Bigsby & Kruthers {{clothing}} store. They obtained the rights to use Jordan's name in 1990 and spent $6 million developing the restaurant. Jordan himself never had ownership stakes in the restaurant, though he provided input in terms of the decor and the menu. He said he wanted it to be the [...] "kind of place where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> my family and friends to eat".|$|E
2500|$|On 18 January 2011, Russian Premier League side Terek Grozny {{announced}} that Gullit {{has agreed to}} sign a year-and-a-half contract and become the head coach for the Chechen side. Upon signing, Gullit told Sovetsky Sport, [...] "I'd {{like to believe that}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> joy into the lives of the Chechen people through football...Of course, I won't deny that I'm getting lots of money from Terek." [...] Gullit was sacked by the club on 14 June 2011, having only won three games as manager. The club also said Gullit had a [...] "party lifestyle".|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, British comedian John Oliver {{described}} Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn a [...] "buffoon" [...] {{and showed}} the leaked video of Vajiralongkorn and his topless wife celebrating the birthday of the prince's poodle, Air Chief Marshal Foo Foo, in a satirical piece about monarchy in general on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. The Thai military government described Oliver as [...] "undermining the royal institution", to which Oliver responded by saying [...] "It seems my Thailand vacation {{is going to have}} to be postponed very much indefinitely. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> down your monarchy, you have—at best—a wobbly monarchy." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Muslim commentators, after Ibrahim {{survived the}} great fire, notoriety in society grew bigger after this event. Nimrod, {{who was the}} King of Babylon felt that his throne was in danger, {{and that he was}} losing power because upon {{witnessing}} Ibrahim coming out of the fire unharmed, a large part of society started believing in Allah and Ibrahim being a prophet of Allah. Up until this point, Nimrod was pretending that he himself was a God. Nimrod wanted to debate with him and show his people that he, the king is indeed the god and that Ibrahim was a liar. Nimrod asked Ibrahim, [...] "What can your God do that I cannot?" [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "My Lord is He who gives life and death." [...] Nimrod then shouted, [...] "I give life and death! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>bring</b> a person from the street and have him executed, and I can grant my pardon to a person who was sentenced to death and save his life." [...] Ibrahim replied, [...] "Well, my lord Allah makes the sun rise from the East. Can you make it rise from the West?" [...] Nimrod was confounded. He was beaten at his own game, on his own territory and in front of his own people. Prophet Ibrahim left him there speechless and went back to his important mission, calling people to worship the one and only God, Allah.|$|E

6000|$|He {{looked at}} her quickly, half-hopefully, and then said, all regretfully: “Too late. I’d like to, perhaps, but I can’t.
