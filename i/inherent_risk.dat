25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the <b>inherent</b> <b>risk</b> associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner that appears to mimic natural infection. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.|$|E

Depending on the type of operation, OSHA rules may be generally applicable to Habitat construction sites, similar to for-profit builders. In some cases, Habitat affiliates have local partnerships with OSHA on safety programs.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{citation}} for {{the shot}} being outlawed {{was that the}} possibility of being out LBW ("a player is out LBW if...the ball pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket") is removed, as the off side become the leg side and vice versa. The shots were considered by the MCC, governors of the game, who {{came to the conclusion that}} the shot was legal, believing that the LBW law (which continues [...] "The off side of the striker's wicket shall be determined by the striker's stance at the moment the ball comes into play for that delivery") adequately covers the scenario. They cited the variations bowlers can make, such as bowling a googly or a slower ball, and also the <b>inherent</b> <b>risk</b> in the shot to the batsman, in the justification of their decision.|$|E

2500|$|The {{preferred}} form of LSD for drifting is {{the clutch}} type, in [...] "two-way" [...] form, for its consistent and aggressive lockup behavior under all conditions (acceleration and deceleration). Some drift cars use a spool [...] "differential", which actually has no differential action at all - the wheels are locked to each other. Budget-minded drifters may use a welded differential, where the side gears are welded {{to give the}} same effect as a spool. This {{makes it easier to}} break rear traction because it reduces maximum traction in all situations except traveling in a straight line. Welded differentials have an <b>inherent</b> <b>risk</b> involved: due to the tremendous amount of internal stress the welds may fail and the differential completely lock up leaving the rear wheels immobilized. Helical torque-sensing differentials such as the Torsen or Quaife (available on cars in certain stock trims such as S15, FD3S, MX-5, JZA80, UZZ3x) are also adequate. It is common for drifters to change the final gear ratio {{depending on the type of}} track layout.|$|E
2500|$|Scalia {{argued that}} {{a better way to}} {{determine}} whether a prior conviction qualified as a [...] "crime of violence" [...] under the residual provision would be to see whether it posed at least as much risk of injury as the enumerated crime that posed the least such risk. [...] That crime could not be arson or the explosives crime, and so Scalia was left with burglary or extortion. [...] In Taylor the Court ruled that [...] "burglary" [...] in the ACCA's definition of [...] "violent felony" [...] had a generic meaningunlawful or unprivileged entry into or remaining in a building or structure with the intent to commit a crime. [...] Scalia posited a generic definition of extortion: [...] obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use or threatened use of force. [...] As between the two, burglary posed less of an <b>inherent</b> <b>risk</b> of harm because it did not, by definition, in its generic sense, involve the use of force.

2500|$|The {{coupling}} of chromatography with MS is a {{well developed}} chemical analysis strategy dating back from the 1950s. Gas chromatography (GC) - MS was originally introduced in 1952, when A.T. James and A.J.P Martin were trying to develop tandem separation - mass analysis techniques. In GC, the analytes are eluted from the separation column as a gas and the connection with electron ionization (EI) or chemical ionization (CI) ion sources in the MS system was a technically simpler challenge. Because of this, the development of GC-MS systems was faster than LC-MS and such systems were first commercialized in the 1970s. The development of LC-MS systems took longer than GC-MS and was {{directly related to the}} development of proper interfaces. V.L. Tal'roze and collaborators started the development of LC-MS in the early 1970s, when they first used capillaries to connect LC columns and MS ion sources. A similar strategy was investigated by McLafferty and collaborators in 1973. This was the first and most obvious way of coupling LC with MS, and was known as the capillary inlet interface. This pioneer interface for LC-MS had the same analysis capabilities of GC-MS and was limited to rather volatile analytes and non-polar compounds with low molecular mass (below 400 Da). In the capillary inlet interface, the evaporation of the mobile phase inside the capillary {{was one of the main}} issues. Within the first years of development of LC-MS, on-line and off-line [...] alternatives were proposed as coupling alternatives. In general, off-line coupling involved fraction collection, evaporation of solvent, and transfer of analytes to the MS using probes. Off-line analyte treatment process was [...] time consuming and there was an <b>inherent</b> <b>risk</b> of sample contamination. Rapidly, it was realized that the analysis of complex mixtures would require the development of a fully automated on-line coupling solution in LC-MS.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The Malaysian {{government}} has worked together with non-governmental entities {{to develop and}} operate internal management systems as well as deliver public services to citizens. Much {{attention has been given}} to the computerization of government ministries and agencies to improve the government’s capacity to carry out its tasks and cope with the future challenges in order to achieve performance goals. The aims of this research are to determine the ICT services that are currently being outsourced and to describe the <b>inherent</b> <b>risks,</b> issues and challenges in ICT outsourcing in the Malaysian public sector. The findings from this research showed that network services is the most common ICT services activity that is being outsourced and that outsourcers who do not comply with contract has the most influence on ICT outsourcing <b>inherent</b> <b>risks.</b> The main issue raised in ICT outsourcing is the inappropriateness of ICT projects being outsourced. Through the findings, public sector organizations would be able to identify the most common ICT services outsourced, analyse the <b>inherent</b> <b>risks,</b> and address the issues that are being raised. In so doing, the potential impact of failure can be anticipated and dealt with accordingly...|$|R

2500|$|The duty of {{care was}} codified in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1, as the [...] "care and skill that is reasonable" [...] to expect, {{regarding}} any special skills of the trustee. In practice this means that a trustee must be judged by what should be reasonably expected from another person in such a position of responsibility, being mindful not to judge decisions {{with the benefit of}} hindsight, and mindful of the <b>inherent</b> <b>risk</b> involved in any property management venture. As long ago as 1678, in Morley v Morley Lord Nottingham LC held that a trustee would not be liable if £40 of the trust fund's gold was robbed, so long as he otherwise performed his duties. Probably one of the main parts of the {{duty of care}}, in managing trust property, will relate to a trustee's investment choices. In Learoyd v Whiteley, Lindley LJ elaborated the general prudent person rule, that in investments one must 'take such care as an ordinary prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide'. This meant a trustee who invested £5000 in mortgages of a brick field and four houses with a shop, and lost the lot when the businesses went insolvent, was liable for the losses on the brick field, whose value must have known to be bound to depreciate as bricks were taken out. Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd suggests investments must be actively monitored, particularly by professional trustees. This duty was broken when the Barclays corporate trustee department, where trust assets held 99 per cent of a company's shares, failed to get any information or board representation before a disastrous property speculation. In making investments, TA 2000 section 4 requires that [...] "standard investment criteria" [...] must be observed, essentially along the lines of modern portfolio theory about diversification of investments to reduce risk. Section 5 suggests advice be sought on such matters if needed, but otherwise may invest anything that an ordinary property owner would. Additional restrictions, however, may be imposed depending on the how courts view the purpose of the trust, and the scope of a trustee's discretion.|$|E
