The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed.

40|$|Harmonization of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> {{standards}} {{is a goal}} shared by many countries around the world, {{with the aim of}} making companies’ financial information comparable. The view is that comparability between companies’ <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> will result in greater transparency and more efficient capital markets and will improve the quality of the <b>financial</b> <b>reports.</b> A major step in this harmonization work is that more than 120 countries now follow International <b>Financial</b> <b>Reporting</b> Standards (IFRS). The fact that many countries today follow the same set of accounting standards means that harmonization has taken place at a de jure level, but it is unclear whether harmonized standards have also led to harmonization in practice (de facto harmonization). The aim of comparable financial information will be achieved only when the standards are applied consistently. The study investigates the factors that influence how individuals apply <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> standards in practice and whether conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> vary between individuals. The investigation consists of a study of annual reports from the years 1930 to 2012, as well as interviews with a number of individuals responsible for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> within the Volvo Group. The interviews were then analyzed using the phenomenographic research method with a view to identifying the different qualitative conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> The areas of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> that were the focus of the study are revenue and provisions. In addition to factors identified in prior literature, a finding of the study is that a significant factor in the application of the {{standards is}} individuals’ conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> For example, this includes views on who is the primary user of financial information, the fundamental principles that form the basis for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting,</b> how standards have been designed and how individual transactions are to be reflected in the <b>financial</b> <b>reporting.</b> Five qualitatively different ways of looking at <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> are identified, indicating that conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> have not developed in harmony with the standards. Older approaches to <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> exist in parallel with new influences from global standards. Diversity in conceptions of <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> leads to a risk that there will be differences in the application of standards (inconsistent application), which in turn complicates comparability.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relation}} between <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and investment efficiency on a sample of 38, 062 firm-year observations between 1980 and 2003. <b>Financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality has been posited to improve investment efficiency, but to date {{there has been little}} empirical evidence to support this claim. Consistent with this claim, I find that proxies for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality are negatively associated with both firm underinvestment and overinvestment. The relation between <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and underinvestment (overinvestment) is mainly driven by the innate (innate and discretionary) component of <b>reporting</b> quality. Further, <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality is more strongly associated with overinvestment for firms with large cash balances and dispersed ownership, which suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality mitigates information asymmetries arising from agency conflicts. However, I find mixed evidence for the hypothesis that <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality is more strongly associated with underinvestment for firms facing financing constraints.
