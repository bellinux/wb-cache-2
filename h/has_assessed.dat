Upon completion, the Veterans Memorial Parkway would no longer be an expressway, but a freeway, for the majority of its length.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> {{this species}} as Near Threatened {{worldwide}} and Vulnerable {{in the northwestern}} Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The American Fisheries Society has also assessed North American dusky shark populations as Vulnerable. Its very low reproductive rate renders the dusky shark extremely susceptible to overfishing.|$|E

5|$|The United States Geological Survey <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> the extinct Kohala as a {{low-risk}} area. The volcano is in zone 9 (bottom risk), {{while the}} border of the volcano with Mauna Kea is zone 8 (second lowest), as Mauna Kea has not produced lava flows for 4,500 years.|$|E
5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, {{and for its}} meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E
5|$|Bottom-dwelling {{and perhaps}} {{relatively}} active in nature, the Izak catshark feeds mainly on a {{diverse array of}} bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. A significant portion of its diet may be scavenged from offal discarded by fisheries. This species is oviparous, with females producing encapsulated eggs {{two at a time}} year-round. The Izak catshark is regularly caught incidentally by a South African bottom trawl commercial fishery, but is discarded rather than utilized. Despite the fishing pressure, its population has been increasing and thus the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> it as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, {{the giant}} {{freshwater}} stingray inhabits sandy or muddy areas and preys on small fishes and invertebrates. Females give live birth to litters {{of one to}} four pups, which are sustained to term by maternally produced histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species faces heavy fishing pressure for meat, recreation, and aquarium display, as well as extensive habitat degradation and fragmentation. These forces have resulted in substantial population declines in at least central Thailand and Cambodia. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> the giant freshwater stingray as Endangered.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and play with it. However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E
5|$|Favoring soft-bottomed habitats, the {{peppered}} maskray is a bottom-dwelling predator consuming mainly crustaceans (particularly caridean shrimp) and polychaete worms. It is viviparous, with litter {{sizes of}} one to three. The females supply their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk") during gestation. Although the peppered maskray is a frequent bycatch of bottom trawl fisheries, it is still common and significant portions of its population appear to lie within unfished waters. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> it as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the leopard}} shark is caught by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} the aquarium trade. This species is mostly fished in the waters off California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{the shallow}} coastal {{waters of the}} central and western Indo-Pacific, the winghead shark feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It gives birth to live young, with the {{developing}} embryos receiving nourishment through a placental connection. Females produce annual litters of 6 to 25 pups; depending on region, birthing may occur from February to June after a gestation period of 8â€“11 months. This harmless species is widely fished for meat, fins, liver oil, and fishmeal. The International Union for Conservation of Nature <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> it as Endangered in 2016, as it {{is thought to have}} declined in some parts of its range due to overfishing.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the finless sleeper ray can {{generate}} a defensive electric shock from paired electric organs in its disc. It gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk. A litter size of four has been recorded from one individual. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> the finless sleeper ray as Vulnerable. This slow-reproducing species is caught by intensive bottom trawl and possibly other fisheries throughout its range, which likely cause high mortality {{regardless of whether it}} is discarded or utilised.|$|E
5|$|Pacific {{angelsharks}} are {{not dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They are valued for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. A targeted gillnet fishery for this species began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. This species is now mainly fished in Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> this species as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoryzomys simplex, {{also known}} as the Brazilian false rice rat or false oryzomys, is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae from south-central South America. It is found in lowland palm savanna and thorn scrub habitats. It is a {{medium-sized}} species, weighing about , with grayâ€“brown fur, long and narrow hindfeet, and a tail that is about as long as the head and body. The IUCN <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> its conservation status as being of least concern, although almost nothing is known of its diet or reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Shy and {{difficult}} to approach, the nervous shark is harmless to humans. It is occasionally marketed for food. This species is susceptible to being caught incidentally in coastal gillnets, such as the barramundi (Lates calcarifer) gillnet fishery operating off northern Australia. It may also be caught on line gear and in prawn trawls. The Australian nervous shark population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by fishing activities, and there the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> it as Least Concern. No data on the impact of fishing are available elsewhere in its range, and thus the IUCN has listed it overall under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Solitary in nature, the {{mangrove}} whipray preys {{mainly on}} small, bottom-dwelling bony fishes and invertebrates. It is, like other stingrays, aplacental viviparous, with the females nourishing their unborn young via histotroph ("uterine milk"). The mangrove whipray is caught for its meat, skin, and cartilage {{across much of}} its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> it as Vulnerable globally and as Endangered in Southeast Asia, where its population has declined substantially due to intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries as well as widespread habitat degradation. In particular, juvenile rays have been disproportionately targeted by fishers and affected by the large-scale destruction of mangrove forests.|$|E
5|$|Spending most of {{its time}} close to the sea floor, the sicklefin weasel shark is a {{specialist}} predator of cephalopods. Its reproductive mode is viviparous, in which the unborn young form a placental connection to their mother. Females probably give birth twice a year, with each litter consisting of two to four pups. The sicklefin weasel shark is widely caught by artisanal fisheries and used for meat, fins, and fishmeal; its low natural abundance and reproductive rate mean that it cannot sustain much fishing pressure. Given that fishing activity is intense throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) <b>has</b> <b>assessed</b> this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
